Currently, through benefit extensions authorized by Congress, eligible displaced workers can receive UI benefits for up to 99 weeks in certain states.

Labor estimated that about an additional 3-1/2 million individuals exhausted benefits in 2010 and 2011.", "Many of the displaced workers who exhausted UI by January 2010 appear to have faced difficult economic circumstances. Their unemployment rate was high\u009746 percent in January 2010. Most, however, appeared to have worked at some point in 2009 or to have been supported by another household member who was working, and some had income from assets, such as interest or dividends. Nevertheless, the poverty rate of displaced workers who exhausted UI was higher than the rate among working-age adults\u009718 percent compared to 13 percent, and more than 40 percent had relatively low incomes, below 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold. Few (less than 3 percent) of the households of those who exhausted UI received TANF benefits in 2009. Most would not have qualified for TANF because they did not have children age 18 or younger, a general TANF eligibility criteria. More of these households received benefits from Social Security programs (18 percent) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (15 percent for the program formerly known as the Food Stamp Program).", "While there are no federal requirements to refer those exhausting UI benefits to other support programs, most (45) of the state UI agencies GAO surveyed reported providing such individuals with information or connecting them to support programs. UI agencies made these connections in a variety of ways, such as through websites, mail, staff referrals, and interagency coordination.

In January 2012, the unemployment rate was 8.3 percent, with  more than 40 percent of the 12.8 million unemployed out of work for 6  months or longer. Workers who involuntarily lose a job\u2014referred to as  \u201cdisplaced workers\u201d in this report\u2014may turn to financial assistance  offered through the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program. UI is a $156  billion federal-state program that temporarily and partially replaces the  lost earnings of those who become unemployed through no fault of their  own. Typically, states provide UI benefits for up to 26 weeks. Since mid- 2008, Congress and the states have temporarily extended the period of  time that displaced workers can receive UI benefits to up to 99 weeks,  though the maximum number of weeks of available benefits varies among  the states.", "However, despite the UI benefit extensions, the slow economic recovery  may result in some displaced workers exhausting UI benefits without  finding a new job. This raises questions about how the Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, one of the nation\u2019s  primary income support programs for low-income families, is aiding UI  exhaustees. TANF is a $16.5 billion federal block grant program that  provides cash assistance and other services to low-income families with  children.", "You asked us to provide information about displaced workers\u2019 receipt and  exhaustion of UI. In response to your request, we answered the following  questions: (1) Among workers who lost jobs during the recession, how  many received and exhausted UI benefits? (2) What are the economic  circumstances of those who exhausted UI, and how many received  assistance from TANF and other support programs? (3) To what extent  do state UI agencies refer exhaustees to support programs?", "To address these questions we used several different research methods.  To identify the number of displaced workers who received and exhausted  UI, referred to as \u201cexhaustees\u201d in this report, we analyzed data from the  2010 Displaced Worker Supplement to the January 2010 Current  Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Census Bureau, which  surveyed individuals who lost jobs from 2007 to 2009. We also  compared some results from the 2010 Displaced Worker Supplement to  data from the 2008 supplement, which surveyed individuals who lost jobs  prior to the recession, from 2005 to 2007. Using data from the Displaced  Worker Supplements allowed us to examine the experiences of a cohort  of workers who lost jobs in the recession years and compare them to  workers who lost jobs before the recession, but our results are as of  January 2010 when the 2010 Displaced Worker Supplement was  conducted. To examine UI exhaustees\u2019 economic circumstances and  determine how many exhaustees received supports from TANF and other  federal income support programs, we analyzed data from the 2010  Displaced Worker Supplement, merged with data from the Annual Social  and Economic Supplement of the 2010 CPS. Merging these two data  sets allowed us to identify UI exhaustees as of January 2010 (using data  from the Displaced Worker Supplement) and examine their household  incomes in 2009 (using data from the Annual Social and Economic  Supplement). We also interviewed officials from 16 state TANF agencies,  selected to reflect a range of changes in unemployment rates in recent  years, and we analyzed data on the UI and TANF programs from the  Department of Labor (Labor) and the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). To determine the extent to which UI agencies refer  exhaustees to other programs, we conducted a web-based survey with UI  agencies in 50 states and the District of Columbia, obtaining responses   For all research questions, we spoke with officials at Labor  from all 51.who oversee the UI program and officials at HHS who oversee TANF. We  also reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations, studies, and policy  documents. We conducted this performance audit from March 2011 to  February 2012, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives (see appendix I  for further information on our scope and methodology)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unemployment Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["The UI program, established under Title III of the Social Security Act in  1935, was intended to, among other things, help those who become  unemployed through no fault of their own, and help stabilize the economy  during recessions. The program is generally financed by federal and state  payroll taxes levied on employers. Within the guidelines of federal law,  states administer the program and can specify who is eligible to receive  UI benefits and how much they receive. Nationwide, UI benefit payments  replaced 46 percent of a worker\u2019s previous wages in 2010 on average.  Applicants must have earned at least a certain amount in wages and/or  have worked a certain number of weeks over a period of time to be  eligible for benefits. In addition, they must be available for and able to  work. For their part, UI agencies must identify recipients who are likely to  exhaust their benefits and refer them to re-employment services, such as  those available through state run-employment centers, known as \u201cone- stops.\u201d At these one-stops, states and localities are required to provide  services for many federally funded employment and training programs,  and they have the option of including additional programs, such as TANF.", "Typically, eligible unemployed workers can receive UI benefits for up to  26 weeks in most states, though individuals may be eligible for fewer  weeks. During periods of high unemployment, states may provide up to  13 or 20 additional weeks of benefits through the Extended Benefits  program, funded jointly by states and the federal government. In 2009,  Congress temporarily authorized full federal financing of the Extended  Benefits program and later extended the authorization several times,  most recently in 2011. In 2008, Congress made additional weeks of  benefits available through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation  program, which are federally funded. The Emergency Unemployment  Compensation program has four tiers of benefits, the first two of which  are available in all states and enable eligible UI recipients to obtain  benefits for up to an additional 34 weeks. The second two tiers are only  available in states with high unemployment and provide up to 19 weeks of  additional benefits. In states that provide at most 26 weeks of regular UI  benefits, that offer the maximum 20 weeks of Extended Benefits  payments, and that are on all four tiers of Emergency Unemployment  Compensation, some eligible unemployed workers may receive up to 99  weeks of UI benefits (see fig. 1). As of January 8, 2012, eligible  unemployed workers could potentially receive the maximum 99 weeks of  benefits in 17 states, according to Labor\u2019s data, though some individuals  may be eligible for fewer weeks in these states. The Emergency  Unemployment Compensation program and full federal financing of the  Extended Benefits program are scheduled to expire in March 2012.", "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of  1996 created the TANF block grant, a $16.5 billion fixed federal funding  stream allocated to states to provide a wide range of services to low- income families who have children. States must maintain a specified  level of spending, referred to as maintenance of effort, to get their federal  TANF funds. The most recent data available show that in fiscal year  2010, states spent approximately $35.8 billion in federal and state TANF  funds, with 70 percent used for programs and services other than ongoing  cash assistance.", "As established in federal law, the goals of the TANF program are to  provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in  their own homes or in the homes of relatives, end needy families\u2019  dependence on government benefits, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies,  and encourage two-parent families. In line with these goals, TANF funds  may be used in a variety of ways, including monthly cash assistance to  low-income families, child care, employment and training, subsidized  employment, transportation, and single or short-term payments for one- time urgent needs, such as for rent or utilities. States have flexibility to set  eligibility requirements for TANF benefits and services and to determine  the type of assistance they provide. However, federal law requires states  to involve at least a specified percentage of TANF cash assistance  recipients in work activities, such as participating in job training or  subsidized employment. States face financial penalties if they do not meet these specified rates. Additionally, certain individuals who do not  cooperate in establishing or enforcing child support orders face reduced  levels of TANF assistance, and possible denial of all TANF benefits.", "In the period of the recession, states were able to draw upon two  additional TANF-related funding sources. The Personal Responsibility  and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 had created a TANF  Contingency Fund of up to $2 billion that states could access in times of  economic distress. Only a portion of this fund had been drawn down by  the states at the start of the recession, but the fund was depleted by the  end of 2009. Congress has appropriated up to $612 million for the  Contingency Fund for fiscal year 2012. In 2009, Congress also created a  $5 billion TANF Emergency Contingency Fund in the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), which was made available  to states that had certain increases either in their cash assistance  caseloads or in their expenditures for nonrecurrent short-term benefits or  subsidized employment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "2 Million of Those Who Lost Jobs in the Recession Years Exhausted UI Benefits by Early 2010", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Half of Workers Who Lost Jobs in the Recession Years Received UI, an Increase from Prior Years", "paragraphs": ["The number of displaced workers increased substantially during the  recession years, and proportionately more of them received UI than in the  3 years prior to the recession.

In contrast, 36  percent of the 8.3 million people who lost jobs from 2005 to 2007 received  UI (see fig. 2). The UI safety net expanded during a recession that  affected so many workers, as it is designed to do.", "One reason for the higher rate of UI receipt during the recession is that  fewer displaced workers became re-employed quickly. Displaced workers  have diverse labor market experiences following a job loss, with some  finding new work soon afterwards, while others take longer to become re- employed. For workers displaced during the recession years, however,  comparatively fewer of them found new jobs quickly.

Among workers who lost jobs from  2007 to 2009, those in the bottom 30 percent in earnings were half as  likely to receive UI benefits as displaced workers in the top 70 percent.  However, both groups received UI at a higher rate during the recession  than in the period before the recession (see fig. 3). We and others  previously identified several possible reasons for the historically lower  rate of UI receipt among lower-wage workers. For example, they are less  likely to have met the minimum earnings required for UI eligibility,  particularly if their work was intermittent or part-time. Family crises can  also cause some in marginal financial situations to quit a job (for example,  to care for a sick child), potentially making them ineligible for UI.", "In the Recovery Act, Congress provided for incentive payments for states  that have certain UI laws in place, and low-wage workers may benefit  from such laws. As of September 2011, 39 states have been approved for  Recovery Act incentive payments totaling $4.4 billion (see table 1).

These data suggest that some exhaustees may have been  helped by other sources of income, such as a household member who  was earning income in 2009, or income from assets, such as interest or  dividends. About two-thirds of exhaustees had a household member with  some wage or salary earnings in 2009. About 40 percent of exhaustees\u2019  households had some income from assets, namely interest, dividends,  retirement, or rental income. In total, about 90 percent of UI exhaustees  had some private income sources within their household during calendar  year 2009 (table 2).", "Nevertheless, while the annual income levels of UI exhaustees varied in  2009, their poverty rate was higher than that of other working-age adults  (ages 18 to 64).

Other than Supplemental  Security Income, the CPS data do not distinguish among the types of  Social Security benefits a household received, but 7 percent of  exhaustees were age 62 or older in January 2010 and therefore  potentially eligible for Social Security retirement benefits (see fig. 9).Some exhaustees may have received the other types of Social Security  benefits, or they may have been residing with a household member who  received Social Security benefits.", "The estimated percentage of exhaustee households receiving TANF may  be slightly higher among those households more closely aligned with the  TANF target population.

One official  noted that some may not have sought TANF because they may still have  some resources or assets that they can rely on. Such assets may also  make a person ineligible for TANF since nearly all states consider the  value of a family\u2019s assets when determining their eligibility for ongoing  TANF cash assistance. Other state officials said that some workers who  recently lost jobs may be reluctant to seek TANF due to its work activity  or child support requirements, particularly given the fact that the TANF  benefit is low.activities that limit the amount of time that can be spent on education and  training may not match the needs of displaced workers, who may require   Some officials also noted that the restrictions on work  more education or retraining to find a new job.

Officials we  interviewed in 7 of the 16 states said that their states have decreased  funding for the TANF program since the recession began. With regard to  federal funds, as a block grant, the TANF allocations that states receive  are not adjusted for caseload size, and the amounts have not been  adjusted for inflation since 1996. Collectively, states in economic distress  can access up to $612 million in the TANF Contingency Fund in fiscal  year 2012, but they must spend more than a specified amount of state  funds to do so. Other TANF funding sources that states had access to  during the recession have expired. For example, nearly all 51 states  accessed TANF Emergency Contingency Funds provided in the Recovery  Act, but these funds expired at the end of fiscal year 2010. In addition,  TANF supplemental funds, which had been awarded to 17 states with  historically low welfare spending per person and high population growth,  expired in June 2011. In our interviews, officials said that budgetary  constraints have led to decreased spending on work supports, such as  employment and training services and childcare, hiring freezes, and, also  greater enforcement of time limits. States must restrict most families to a  lifetime limit of 60 months of federally funded TANF cash assistance, but  they may use state funds to continue benefits for families reaching the  limit.

For some of our  analyses, we also compared the 2010 data to data from the 2008  Displaced Worker Supplement, conducted with households in which  someone lost a job from 2005 to 2007, so that we could compare workers  displaced during the recession to those displaced prior to the recession.  Results of our review are as of January 2010 and January 2008, when  the Displaced Worker Supplements were conducted.", "We chose to use the Displaced Worker Supplement over other possible  data sources, such as the Survey of Income and Program Participation,  because the Displaced Worker Supplement contains questions to identify  whether an individual who lost a job received and exhausted UI. For  purposes of our review, we defined a UI exhaustee as a displaced worker  with \u201cyes\u201d responses to the following two questions in the Displaced  Workers Survey:  \u201cDid you receive unemployment insurance after that job (the job from  which the worker was displaced) ended?\u201d and  \u201cDid you exhaust your eligibility for unemployment benefits?\u201d", "We analyzed data from the Displaced Worker Supplement to estimate the  percentage of displaced workers who received UI and the percentage  who exhausted UI. We also used the data to examine the characteristics  and labor force statuses of UI exhaustees specifically, in particular their  ages, employment status at the time they were surveyed, and for those  employed, their earnings at their new job compared to their previous job.  Given the structure of the Displaced Worker Supplement, the survey  captures the experiences of workers who lose jobs earlier in the 3-year  period of the survey more fully than those who lost jobs later in the period,  since more time would have elapsed between when they lost their job and  when the survey was conducted. More specifically, the estimate of the  number of displaced workers who exhausted UI does not include workers  who may have exhausted UI at some point after January 2010.", "In comparing UI receipt among higher-wage and lower-wage workers in  the 2005-2007 and 2007-2009 time periods (using the 2008 and 2010  Displaced Worker Supplements, respectively), we conducted the analysis  in two different ways and obtained virtually identical results. In the first  approach, for each of the time periods, we compared displaced workers  in the bottom 30 percent in average weekly wages with displaced workers  in the top 70 percent, for the respondents with wage data available.  Conducting the analysis in this way, displaced workers in the bottom 30  percent had average wages of $380 per week or less in the 2005-2007  time frame and average wages of $418 per week or less in the 2007-2009  time frame. In our second approach, we used the same average weekly  wage as the cut-off point for defining the lower-wage worker group in the  two time frames, adjusting for inflation. Specifically, lower-wage workers  were still defined as those with average wages of $380 per week or less  in 2005-2007. However, for 2007-2009, we used the $380 value to define  the lower-wage group, but adjusted it for inflation. As such, displaced  workers in the 2007-2009 time period were in the lower-wage group if  they had average weekly wages of $400 or less. These two methods  yielded results that were nearly identical. We presented the results of the  first approach in figure 3."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Displaced Worker Supplement Merged with the Annual Social and Economic Supplement", "paragraphs": ["To examine the incomes of UI exhaustees and their receipt of benefits  from government programs, we merged data from the Displaced Worker  Supplement with data from the CPS\u2019 Annual Social and Economic  Supplement (ASEC). Census conducts the ASEC annually to provide the  usual monthly labor force data, as well as additional national data on work  experience, income, and use of government benefits, among other topics.  Due to the rotation structure of the CPS, approximately half of the  households who were administered the Displaced Worker Supplement in  January 2010 were also interviewed for the ASEC in March 2010.Merging data from the two surveys allowed us to identify UI exhaustees  (from the Displaced Worker Supplement) and examine their incomes  (from the ASEC). Specifically, we used the merged data to examine UI  exhaustees\u2019 private income sources, their family incomes relative to the  federal poverty threshold, the presence of a child under the age of 18 in  the household, and the benefits received from government programs.  Data we report from the 2010 ASEC on the income status and receipt of  benefits of UI exhaustees is for calendar year 2009. As such, our results  may not necessarily reflect individuals\u2019 circumstances directly after  exhausting their UI benefits, as we included all individuals who lost jobs  from 2007 to 2009 and who then received and exhausted UI during that  period and through January 2010, when the Displaced Worker  Supplement was conducted.", "Because the merged sample contains approximately half the number of  observations as the full Displaced Worker Supplement sample, we  inflated the population weights so that the weighted population counts  from the merged sample would reflect the full displaced worker  population. In addition, following the guidance of staff at the Bureau of  Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, we constructed raking factors to  rebalance the merged sample by the race and ethnicity of the  householder, the presence of children in the household, and the gender  of the displaced worker.", "We used data in the ASEC to examine the incomes of UI exhaustees\u2019  households from both private and government sources. For each person  in the sample 15 years old and over, the ASEC asks questions on the  amount of money income received in the preceding calendar year from  each of the following sources: earnings; unemployment compensation;  workers\u2019 compensation; Social Security; Supplemental Security Income;  public assistance; veterans\u2019 payments; survivors benefits; disability  benefits; pension or retirement income; interest; dividends; rents,  royalties, and estates and trusts; educational assistance; alimony; child  support; regular financial assistance from outside of the household; and  other periodic income. The income statistics in the ASEC refer to receipt  of income during the preceding calendar year, in contrast to the  demographic characteristics, such as age, labor force status, and family  or household composition, which are as of the survey date. The income of  the family/household does not include amounts received by people who  were members during all or part of the income year if these people no  longer resided in the family/household at the time of interview. However,  the ASEC collects income data for people who are current residents but  did not reside in the household during the income year.", "Data on consumer income collected in the ASEC by the Census Bureau  cover money income received (exclusive of certain money receipts such  as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, Social  Security, union dues, Medicare deductions, etc. Therefore, money income  does not reflect the fact that some households receive part of their  income in the form of noncash benefits, such as food stamps, health  benefits, rent-free housing, and goods produced and consumed on the  farm. In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash  benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which often take  the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial  payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational  expenses, etc. Moreover, readers should be aware that for many different  reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to  underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived  income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents  report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other  sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is  nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income.", "We determined exhaustees\u2019 income-to-poverty ratios using Census  computations. The Census classifies the income-to-poverty ratio of each  family and unrelated individual using a poverty index adopted by the  Federal Interagency Committee. The index provides a range of income  cutoffs or \u201cpoverty thresholds\u201d adjusted to take into account family size,  number of children, and age of the family householder or unrelated  individual. If a family\u2019s total money income is less than the applicable  threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered in  poverty. The official poverty thresholds are updated annually for inflation  using the Consumer Price Index. The official poverty definition uses  money income before taxes and excludes capital gains and noncash  benefits (such as SNAP benefits and housing assistance). The thresholds  do not vary geographically.", "We calculated standard errors for our estimates using the Census  generalized variance functions, as published in the CPS January 2010  Displaced Worker, Employee Tenure, and Occupational Mobility  Technical Documentation. However, we adjusted these standard error  calculations to take account of the larger sampling interval of the merged  sample, following guidance from staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics  and the Census Bureau.", "We assessed the reliability of the CPS generally and of data elements  that were critical to our analyses and determined that, despite the  limitations outlined below, they were sufficiently reliable for our analyses.  Specifically, we:  reviewed documentation on the general design and methods of the  CPS Displaced Worker Supplement and the CPS ASEC, and on the  specific elements of the CPS data that were used in our analysis;  interviewed Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics officials  knowledgeable about the CPS data and consulted with these officials  periodically throughout the course of our study; and  completed our own electronic data testing to assess the accuracy and  completeness of the data used in our analyses. To the extent  possible, we compared our estimates against published reports using  the CPS.", "As a result of these efforts, we identified the following limitations with the  data:", "The Census Bureau determined that respondents report income  earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of  income. Therefore, estimates of receipt of government assistance  may be underestimated.", "Due to the small sample sizes in our merged sample, confidence  intervals around some of our estimates are wide.

The survey included questions about  providing information to UI exhaustees about other support programs,  coordinating or working with one-stops and/or workforce agencies, data  on UI exhaustees, and changes states are making that may affect UI  coverage.", "Because this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors, such as variations in how respondents interpret  questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses. We took  steps to minimize nonsampling errors, including pretesting draft  instruments and using a Web-based administration system. Specifically,  during survey development, we pretested draft instruments with UI  administrators from three states (Alabama, Arizona, and Pennsylvania)  and a representative from the National Association of State Workforce  Agencies in July 2011. We selected the pretest states to provide variation  in selected state UI program characteristics and geographic location. In  the pretests, we were generally interested in the clarity, precision, and  objectivity of the questions, as well as the flow and layout of the survey.  For example, we wanted to ensure definitions used in the surveys were  clear and known to the respondents, categories provided in closed-ended  questions were complete and exclusive, and the ordering of survey  sections and the questions within each section was appropriate. We  revised the final survey based on pretest results. Another step we took to  minimize nonsampling errors was using a web-based survey. Allowing  respondents to enter their responses directly into an electronic instrument  created a record for each respondent in a data file and eliminated the  need for and the errors associated with a manual data entry process. To  further minimize errors, programs used to analyze the survey data and  make estimations were independently verified to ensure the accuracy of  this work.", "While we did not fully validate specific information that states reported  through our survey, we took several steps to ensure that the information  was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For example, we  reviewed the responses and identified those that required further  clarification and, subsequently, conducted follow-up research to ensure  the information they provided was reasonable and reliable. In our review  of the data, we also identified and logically fixed skip pattern errors for  questions that respondents should have skipped but did not.
