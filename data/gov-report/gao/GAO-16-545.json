It has identified priorities for modernization, such as web applications, to help reach IRS's future state vision. However, while IRS has developed a structured process for allocating funding to its operations activities consistent with best practices, it has not fully documented this process. IRS officials stated this is because the process is relatively new and not yet stabilized.

For these investments, IRS should develop metrics  similar to FATCA and RRP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to IRS for comment. In its written  comments, reproduced in appendix III, IRS agreed with two  recommendations, did not agree nor disagree with one, and disagreed  with one. Specifically,  IRS agreed with our recommendations to better document its  prioritization process for operations support activities and extend that  process to its business systems modernization activities.", "With respect to our recommendation to report on actual costs and  scope delivery at least quarterly for CADE 2 and ACA, IRS did not  agree nor disagree, but noted that IRS is continuing to try to improve  its processes in reporting investment performance.", "Regarding our recommendation to modify existing processes for  FATCA and RRP for measuring work performed by IRS staff to  incorporate best practices, including accounting for actual work  performed and using the level of effort measure sparingly, IRS  disagreed and stated that modifying the use of the level of effort  measure would equate to a certified earned value management  system, which would add immense burden on IRS\u2019s programs on  various fronts and would outweigh the value it provides. However, we  did not specify the use of an earned value management system in our  report and believe other methods could be used to more reliably  measure work performed. As noted in our report, 22 to 100 percent of  the work for selected projects was performed by IRS staff. As a result,  we believe that it is a reasonable expectation for IRS to reliably  determine the actual work completed, as opposed to assuming that  work is always completed as planned. Accordingly, we maintain our  recommendation is still warranted.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Commissioner of IRS, and other interested parties.

Further, we interviewed officials in IRS\u2019s Office of Strategy and Planning,  as well as stakeholders of the Portfolio Investment Planning process from  IRS business units. We then analyzed IRS\u2019s processes against best  practices in our IT Investment Management Framework and the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Capital Programming Guide to determine the  extent to which the processes met best practices and requirements.  Lastly, we met with officials at the Department of the Treasury who are  responsible for IT capital planning, including the Treasury Chief  Information Officer, to determine the department\u2019s role in IRS\u2019s process  for prioritizing IT funding.", "For our second objective, we analyzed the performance of four key  development investments\u2014Customer Account Data Engine 2 (CADE 2),  Return Review Program (RRP), Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act  (FATCA), and the Affordable Care Act Administration (ACA). Further, we  analyzed two key operational investments \u2014Telecommunications  Systems and Support (TSS) and Mainframes and Servers Services and  Support (MSSS). We chose these investments because they represented  IRS\u2019s most significant expenditures on development and operations for  fiscal year 2015 ($496.5 million and $777.8 million, respectively).", "A tailored approach was necessary for analyzing the development  investments given the varying types and extent to which performance  information was available for these investments. To determine the  progress in implementing FATCA and RRP, we compiled and  analyzed quarterly output from IRS\u2019s Investment Performance Tool for  the period of fiscal year 2015 through the first quarter of 2016. IRS  does not consider this tool to be a formal Earned Value Management  System. As a result, we did not evaluate the extent to which the tool  was compliant with the American National Standards Institute\u2019s  guidelines for an Earned Value Management System. For CADE 2,  we analyzed IRS\u2019s quarterly reporting of planned and actual costs, as  well as requirements reports and schedule reporting. For ACA, we  analyzed IRS\u2019s financial reporting via the ACA business case  submissions, as well as performance reporting to management and  schedule reporting. In addition, we held multiple meetings with IRS  officials, including officials in the CADE 2, FATCA, ACA, and RRP  program offices.", "To determine the progress in implementing TSS and MSSS, we  reviewed operational performance information reported for the  selected investments from October 2014 to September 2015; this  information included, where reported, the performance target and  actual results for each metric. In addition, we reviewed documentation  describing the performance metrics and interviewed IRS officials  regarding the process for reporting such metrics.", "To determine the reliability of data used for our review, we obtained and  reviewed IRS\u2019s guidance for its Investment Performance Tool, which  identifies, among other things, how data are to be entered within this tool,  sources of such data, and explanations of the methods used to calculate  performance metrics generated from the tool. Further, we held meetings  with officials responsible for overseeing the use of IRS\u2019s Investment  Performance Tool. In addition, we relied on extensive work we previously  completed on IRS\u2019s financial management system for relevant data used  for this review. In determining the reliability of the data supporting this  review, we determined that data regarding the delivery of planned scope  for the FATCA and RRP investments could be more reliable by  incorporating best practices. While these data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes, we made recommendations to improve their reliability.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to June 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
