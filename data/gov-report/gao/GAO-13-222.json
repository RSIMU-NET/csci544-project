The most widely used source, according to survey responses from 32 agencies, is the institutional knowledge or subject matter expertise in physical security that agencies' security staff have developed through their professional experience. The second most used source are standards issued by the Interagency Security Committee (ISC). The standards, which are developed based on leading security practices across the government, set forth a decision-making process to help ensure that agencies have effective physical security programs in place. However, according to survey responses, the extent of agencies' use of ISC standards varied--with some agencies using them in a limited way. Agency officials from the case-study agencies said that certain conditions at their agencies--such as the types of facilities in the agencies' portfolios and their existing physical security requirements--contribute to limited use of the standards. ISC officials said that the standards are designed to be used by all agencies regardless of the types of facilities or their existing security programs; the standards can be customized to the needs of individual facilities and do not require the use of specific countermeasures. ISC has an opportunity to clarify how the standards are intended to be used when it trains agencies on them; during quarterly meetings with member agencies, where ISC can share best practices on the use of the standards; or when ISC engages in other outreach on the standards. Clarifying how agencies can use the standards may result in their greater use. Greater use of the standards may maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of agencies' physical security programs.", "Agencies use a range of management practices to oversee physical security activities. For example, 22 surveyed agencies reported that they have a manager at the agency-wide level responsible for monitoring and overseeing physical security at individual facilities. In addition, 22 surveyed agencies reported that they have some documented performance measures for physical security. Such performance measures can help agencies evaluate the effectiveness of their physical security programs and identify changes needed to better meet program objectives. Agencies' use of management practices such as having a physical security manager responsible for allocating resources and using performance measures to justify investment decisions could also contribute to more efficient allocation of physical security resources across an agency's portfolio of facilities. However, some agencies make limited use of such practices to allocate resources. For example, only 13 reported that they have a manager for allocating resources based on risk assessments. In contrast, a majority of agencies reported having managers for other aspects of physical security, including those related to oversight. Greater use of management practices for allocating resources is particularly relevant given that the surveyed agencies identified allocating resources as the greatest challenge. As the government's central forum for exchanging information and disseminating guidance on physical security, ISC is well positioned to develop and disseminate guidance about management practices that can help agencies allocate resources across a portfolio of facilities. However, ISC's key physical security standards do not currently address management practices for allocating resources across an agency's entire portfolio of facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DHS should direct ISC to conduct outreach to executive branch agencies to clarify how its standards are to be used, and develop and disseminate guidance on management practices for resource allocation as a supplement to ISC's existing physical security standards.

Over 9,000 of these buildings and  structures are protected by the Federal Protective Service (FPS). The  remainder of the buildings and structures are protected by some three  dozen other federal executive branch agencies.", "The federal government\u2019s approach to physical security is largely  decentralized, with individual agencies generally having the discretion to  establish physical security programs that govern how they will protect  their people, property, structures, and facilities. Agencies tailor these  programs to their missions, the types of facilities they occupy, and other  circumstances such as the level of public access needed and whether the  facilities house classified or nuclear materials. The Interagency Security  Committee (ISC)\u2014an interagency organization led by the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is a central forum for standards and guidance  that is available for agencies to consult when designing and updating their  physical security programs. ISC is comprised of 51 federal agencies and  departments, 21 of which are categorized as primary members that vote  to approve the standards, and 30 of which are associate members that do  not vote.

However, given that many executive branch agencies are  also responsible for the physical security of federal facilities, you asked us  to examine the physical security programs at these agencies. The  objectives of our review were to examine the (1) sources that inform how  federal agencies conduct their physical security programs and (2)  management practices that agencies use to oversee physical security  activities and allocate physical security resources.", "Our review focused on executive branch agencies that have non-military  facilities in the United States and its territories that are not protected by  FPS. To address our objectives, we conducted a web-based survey of 36  cabinet level and independent agencies; we received responses from all  36 agencies, which are listed in appendix II. Four agencies reported that  all of their facilities were protected by FPS, and we therefore did not  include them in our review. The remaining 32 agencies are included in  our review, and in this report we identify these agencies as the agencies  we surveyed. Of these 32 agencies, 16 are primary ISC members, 9 are  associate ISC members, and 7 are not members of ISC. This report  presents survey results in aggregate and does not discuss individual  agency responses in a way that would identify them. Summary results for  each survey question, except those requiring narrative responses, are  available in a supplement to this report, GAO-13-223SP. We also  conducted interviews with and reviewed documentation from officials at  five case-study agencies for more in-depth analysis: the Department of  Energy (DOE), the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),  and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). We selected these  agencies because they vary in the level of public access allowed at their  facilities and the amount of building square footage they have. To obtain  further information, we conducted site visits at DOE, VA, and USPS  facilities in New Jersey, West Virginia, and Illinois, where we interviewed  officials in charge of physical security at the facility and obtained  documentation for review. We selected these locations and facilities to  achieve diversity in geographic area, urban and rural environments, and  facility risk levels. This report discusses the results of these case studies  and site visits on an individual agency basis, in which case the agency  referred to is identified by name, as well as in the aggregate. Since the  five case-study agencies and the facilities we visited were selected as  part of a non-probability sample, the findings from our case studies and  facility visits cannot be generalized to all federal agencies.

We have previously reported that because of the considerable differences  in types of federal facilities and the variety of risks associated with each of  them, there is no single, ideal approach to physical security. For  example, in some instances, an agency\u2019s component offices\u2014which are  subordinate entities such as bureaus, administrations, or other operating  divisions\u2014have their own physical security programs for the facilities they  use. In other instances, an agency\u2019s regions or districts play a role in  physical security.", "ISC was created by Executive Order 12977 in 1995, after the bombing of  the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, to address  physical security across federal facilities occupied by federal employees  for nonmilitary activities. ISC\u2019s mandate is to enhance the quality and  effectiveness of security in and protection of federal facilities. To  accomplish this, Executive Order 12977 directs the ISC to, among other  things, develop and evaluate security standards for federal facilities,  develop a strategy for ensuring compliance with such standards, and  oversee the implementation of appropriate security measures in federal  facilities. Executive Order 12977 also directs each executive agency and  department to cooperate and comply with ISC policies and  recommendations issued pursuant to the order. The order, as amended,  gives the Secretary of Homeland Security the responsibility to monitor  federal agency compliance with ISC policies and recommendations.", "Prior to the creation of ISC, there was no federal body responsible for  developing government-wide physical security standards. Consequently,  ISC became the government\u2019s central forum for exchanging information  and disseminating standards and guidance on physical security at federal  facilities. ISC\u2019s standards are intended to help agencies integrate security  into the operations, planning, design, and construction of federal facilities  and are intended to be customized to address facility-specific conditions.  ISC has developed the following security standards and guidance, among  others:9, 10", "Physical Security Criteria for Federal Facilities establishes a process  for determining the baseline set of physical security measures to be  applied at a federal facility and provides a framework for the  customization of security measures to address unique risks at a  facility.", "Design-Basis Threat establishes a profile of the type, composition,  and capabilities of adversaries.

Sources can include an agency\u2019s institutional knowledge  or subject matter expertise in physical security, federal statutes and  regulations, physical security standards issued by ISC, and state or local  regulations, among others, as shown in figure 1. Characteristics such as  agencies\u2019 missions and the type, use, and location of their facilities can  affect which of these sources agencies use. For example, a facility may  adhere to local building codes that affect aspects of physical security  such as perimeter fencing, or a facility that is used to house radioactive  waste may be subject to federal requirements on the storage of nuclear  materials. Institutional knowledge in physical security and ISC\u2019s physical  security standards were the two sources that our survey results and case- study interviews showed to be the most influential in guiding agencies\u2019  physical security programs.", "All 32 of the agencies we surveyed reported that institutional knowledge  or subject matter expertise informs their physical security programs. This  was the most widely used source cited in our survey, as shown in figure  1. For example, officials from three of the agencies we surveyed said that  the knowledge, experience, and expertise that their security specialists  have in physical security\u2014which they consider institutional knowledge\u2014  is reflected in their physical security programs and policies. One of these  officials said his agency contracts with a security company that has  extensive knowledge and experience in providing security and law  enforcement to high profile institutions across the federal government,  and that this knowledge is used in managing the agency\u2019s security  program. Another agency official said that the knowledge gained from  employees\u2019 previous education, training, or work experiences, or  historical knowledge of the agency has assisted in the development of  several security policies and procedures within the agency.", "Agencies also rely heavily on institutional knowledge or subject matter  expertise to inform specific aspects of their security programs, more so  than any other source we asked about in our survey. As shown in figure  2, 26 agencies reported that institutional knowledge informs how they  conduct risk assessments and determine appropriate countermeasures.  For example, officials from two of our case-study agencies\u2014DOE and  USPS\u2014said that they use institutional knowledge to inform how they  conduct these activities. DOE headquarters officials told us that when  developing and updating agency-wide physical security policies, which  address topics such as risk assessments, they obtain input from DOE  staff in their component offices, who have knowledge of the particular  needs and constraints of their facilities based on their experience  implementing security programs. In addition, USPS officials said that their  security staff\u2019s knowledge of the agency\u2019s long-standing security program  and their professional education in physical security helps them make  decisions about security measures needed at their facilities, such as on  the location of perimeter fencing and the appropriate brightness for  security lights.", "Twenty-nine of 32 agencies surveyed reported that ISC standards inform  their physical security programs, making it the second most-used source  behind institutional knowledge, as shown in figure 1. Officials we  interviewed from our case-study agencies said that they use ISC  standards as one of many sources that inform what they include in their  physical security programs. ISC has developed a number of government- wide physical security standards that address topics intended to help  guide agencies\u2019 physical security programs, including determining a  facility\u2019s risk level and identifying threats posed by potential adversaries,  among other things. Agencies\u2019 use of ISC standards can help ensure that  physical security programs are effective government-wide. The standards  are developed based on the collective knowledge and physical security  expertise of ISC member agencies and, therefore, reflect leading  practices in physical security. Every ISC member agency that we  surveyed, as well as four agencies that are not ISC members, reported  that they use ISC standards at least to some degree. The three agencies  we surveyed that reported that they do not use ISC standards at all are  not ISC members. According to our survey, ISC standards are most  often used for conducting design-basis threat analysis of agency facilities,  identifying aspects of facilities that need security measures, and  determining appropriate countermeasures, as shown in figure 2.", "Although the majority of agencies we surveyed use ISC standards, the  extent of their reliance varies\u2014with some agencies using the standards  extensively to inform their physical security programs and some using  them in a more limited way. For example, 11 agencies reported that all of  the physical security aspects shown in figure 2 are largely informed by  ISC standards, whereas six agencies reported that none of these aspects  are largely informed by ISC standards. Instead, these six agencies  generally reported that these aspects are somewhat, minimally, or not  informed by ISC standards. Among the six agencies that said none of  these aspects are largely informed by ISC standards, three are primary  ISC members, two are associate members, and one is not an ISC  member.", "We found that agencies\u2019 reasons for making limited use of ISC standards  reflect a lack of understanding by some agencies regarding how the  standards are intended to be used. For example, officials from the case- study agencies that we interviewed said that certain conditions at their  agencies contribute to their limited use of the standards. Specifically,  these agencies cited the suitability of the ISC standards to the agencies\u2019  facilities and their own physical security requirements as contributing to  their limited use of the standards.", "Suitability of standards. Officials we interviewed at our case-study  agencies told us that they are selective in their use of ISC standards  because the standards are not suitable for the types of facilities in  their portfolio. For example, USPS officials said that, consistent with  ISC standards, they establish a baseline level of protection at their  facilities that address facility-specific functions and threats, but they  do not follow some practices included in the ISC standards\u2014 particularly those related to access control\u2014because the practices  are not suitable for the high degree of public access needed at post  offices. Likewise, VA officials told us that they do not use ISC  standards for all of their facilities because some practices included in  the standards do not cover security topics that are specific to their  facilities, such as hospitals and health clinics. In response to these  comments, ISC officials told us that ISC\u2019s standards are designed to  be suitable for all facilities and to accommodate a broad range of  security needs, conditions, and types of facilities. For example, ISC\u2019s  Physical Security Criteria for Federal Facilities\u2014one of ISC\u2019s key  standards\u2014establishes a decision-making process to help agencies  consistently determine the baseline level of protection needed for  each facility. The Criteria provide agencies the flexibility to build upon  or customize the baseline level of protection to address facility- specific conditions. According to the Criteria, consistency in the  process used to determine a baseline level of protection for each  facility is important because it helps ensure that the risks that all  facilities face\u2014regardless of the type facility\u2014are mitigated to an  acceptable level. Furthermore, according to ISC officials, the Criteria  do not prescribe specific countermeasures and, as a result, can be  used by all agencies regardless of the type of facilities in their  portfolio.", "Use of other physical security standards. Officials we interviewed at  our case-study agencies also told us that they do not make greater  use of ISC standards because they have their own standards for  physical security. For example, officials at DOE told us that the Atomic  Energy Act was the foundation for their security program long before  the ISC was created and ISC standards developed. Additionally, DOE  officials told us that the act and DOE\u2019s security policy derived from it  establishes physical security requirements for their facilities with  classified or nuclear material and that these requirements are usually  more stringent than ISC requirements. Similarly, VA officials told us  that they have developed their own physical security standards that  are specific to the needs of their hospital and clinic facilities, and that  these standards go above and beyond ISC standards. ISC officials  told us that, because ISC standards are intended to ensure a  minimum or baseline level of protection, it is appropriate for agencies  to have their own requirements and standards that exceed those of  ISC. According to ISC officials, an agency should apply the decision- making process established by the ISC standards to determine if their  facilities\u2019 physical security requirements meet the baseline, and then  add additional requirements based on their agency\u2019s needs.", "As previously discussed, ISC was established to enhance the quality and  effectiveness of security in and protection of non-military, federal facilities.  Although most agencies we surveyed use ISC standards to some degree,  some agencies\u2019 use of the standards is limited because they believe that  the ISC standards are not suitable for their circumstances. Clarifying how  agencies can use the standards regardless of the types of facilities in  their portfolio and in concert with their existing physical security programs  may result in the greater use of the standards. Use of ISC standards may  be beneficial because they provide agencies with tools and approaches  for consistently and cost-effectively establishing a baseline level of  protection at all facilities commensurate with identified risks at those  facilities. By using the standards to determine the level of protection  needed to address the unique risks faced at each facility, agencies may  be able to avoid expending resources on countermeasures that are not  needed.", "ISC currently does not formally monitor agencies\u2019 compliance with ISC  standards. ISC officials said that with only five full time employees and a  budget that is not a dedicated line item within DHS\u2019s budget, it lacks the  staff and resources to conduct monitoring. Currently, in place of a formal  monitoring program, ISC officials hold quarterly meetings and participate  in ISC working groups along with their member agencies. ISC officials  said that the information sharing that occurs through these channels  helps them achieve a basic understanding of whether and how member  agencies use the standards. This approach, however, does not provide a  thorough or systematic assessment of ISC member agencies\u2019 use of the  standards, and provides no information on non-member agencies\u2019  physical security practices. Further, because ISC conducts limited  outreach to non-member agencies, property-holding agencies that are not  ISC members may not be fully aware of the benefits that the use of the  ISC standards might have for them. ISC stated in its 2012 to 2017 action  plan that it plans to establish protocols and processes for monitoring and  testing compliance with its standards by fiscal year 2014. According to  ISC\u2019s executive director, monitoring agencies\u2019 compliance with the  standards could include agency self-assessments or ISC officials\u2019  assessing agencies\u2019 compliance. Monitoring and testing as well as other  methods of measuring the performance of the standards can help gauge  the adequacy of facility protection, improve security, and ensure  accountability for achieving the goals of the standards.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE and USPS stated that they  use ISC standards as a baseline for at least some of their facilities. DOE  officials said that ISC standards must be considered the baseline for  security for facilities that do not have classified or nuclear material but  have federal personnel.  USPS officials said that ISC\u2019s Criteria standard  provides flexibility to customize baseline levels of protection to address  facility-specific conditions and that it is within this framework that USPS  employs appropriate countermeasures at its facilities when it is not able to  adopt ISC\u2019s recommended standards.  As discussed, ISC is planning to  monitor and test agencies\u2019 compliance with ISC standards.  This  monitoring and testing will help shed more light on whether these and  other agencies\u2019 approaches align with ISC\u2019s standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Use a Range of Management Practices to Oversee Physical Security Activities, but Make Limited Use of These Practices to Help Allocate Resources", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Use Several Management Practices to Oversee Physical Security and Ensure Program Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Based on responses to our survey and our interviews with agency  officials, we found that agencies use a range of management practices  that can contribute to effective oversight of physical security programs,  including: having a manager responsible for physical security, having agency-wide physical-security policies, using risk management practices that compare physical security measuring the performance of physical security programs.", "We and others have reported that these practices can help agencies  address risks, achieve effective results in their programs, determine  program effectiveness, and identify whether changes are needed to better  meet the program objectives.", "A physical security manager can be beneficial for an agency because the  manager can establish a cohesive strategy for the agency to mitigate or  reduce risk across the agency\u2019s facilities, coordinate and oversee  physical security efforts across departments, and minimize potential  redundancies that could be occurring across departments if accountability  for physical security is dispersed among several managers, according to  guidance issued by ASIS International.", "Many of the agencies we surveyed reported that they have a manager at  the agency-wide level responsible for their risk assessment approaches  and monitoring and oversight (25 and 22 agencies, respectively), as  shown in figure 3. However, we determined that physical security  managers at our case-study agencies have varying levels of  responsibility. For example, DOE\u2019s director of security has agency-wide  responsibility and works with component offices throughout the agency to  ensure that the component offices\u2019 security programs align with DOE  policies, which helps achieve a consistent approach to security across the  agency. Alternatively, FCC\u2019s chief security officer is responsible for  physical security at only a select group of the 14 facilities held by FCC.  Two of FCC\u2019s component offices are responsible for physical security at  the remaining facilities. Each of these component offices approach  physical security in a way that meets its particular needs. The FCC official  we interviewed acknowledged, however, that if physical security were  centrally managed\u2014through a physical security manager with agency- wide responsibilities, for example\u2014the agency could benefit from a  consistent approach to physical security for facility types that are similar.  Although it is important to tailor physical security to facilities so that the  unique risks at those facilities are addressed, a consistent approach to  certain aspects of physical security is beneficial because it helps ensure  that all facilities are covered by a baseline level of physical security  commensurate with identified risks at those facilities. For example, we  previously reported that the Department of the Interior (Interior)  established a central law enforcement and security office in 2002 that  enabled it to develop a uniform risk assessment and ranking methodology  to quantify risk, identify needed security enhancements, and measure  risk-reduction benefits at some of its properties. In addition to fostering  consistency, a central approach to physical security can also help  coordinate physical security across component offices and provide a  single point of contact for the agency for physical security. For example,  Interior\u2019s central office responsible for security provided the agency with a  single point of contact that the Secretary and senior managers could  depend upon for security information and advice.", "We have previously reported that agencies\u2019 physical security programs  can benefit from documented agency-wide guidelines. According to  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  policies and procedures that enforce management\u2019s directives at an  agency-wide level are an important part of an agency\u2019s ability to achieve  effective results in its programs, in physical security as well as other types  of programs. Furthermore, according to the Standards for Internal  Control, assessing compliance to policies and procedures can also assist  agencies in monitoring and measuring the performance of programs,  including physical security programs.", "A majority of the agencies (24) we surveyed reported that they have  documented agency-wide guidelines for monitoring and overseeing  security programs at individual facilities, as shown in figure 4. Our more  in-depth analysis of the case-study agencies found that they have  documented agency-wide policies for a range of physical security  activities. For example, DOE has documented policies for facility-level  security plans, performance assurance, facility clearance activities, and  other security-related activities that apply to individual facilities, and  according to OPM officials their agency has a documented general  security policy and access control policy. Having documented policies can  help agencies ensure that their security programs achieve results. For  example, USPS\u2019s security policy states that its security policies and  adherence to these policies can help the agency ensure that the most  appropriate level of security and protection available are provided to its  facilities. DOE\u2019s security policy states that adherence to the policies can  help prevent adverse impacts on the safety of DOE and contractor  employees and the public.", "Most agencies (26 of 32) we surveyed reported that offices at the agency- wide or component level, or both, monitor facilities\u2019 compliance with  policies and procedures. In addition, six agencies reported that their  region or district offices or facilities are responsible for performing this  activity, rather than agency-wide or component offices. Agency-wide  offices at our case-study agencies monitor facilities\u2019 compliance with  agency-wide policies. For example, USPS staff working in field offices  annually assess whether postal facilities are complying with agency-wide  policies, and the headquarters security office reviews the results of the  assessments. At DOE, component offices assess facilities\u2019 compliance  with security policies and the agency-wide security office reviews high risk  facilities to determine if DOE policies have been adequately implemented.", "We have previously identified risk management as a key practice in  facility protection. A risk management approach that compares physical  security across facilities can provide agencies assurance that the most  critical risks at facilities across their agencies are being prioritized and  mitigated, and that systemic risks are identified and addressed.", "Agencies we surveyed reported that they conduct risk management  practices\u2014such as comparing risk assessments across facilities and  monitoring the implementation of countermeasures across facilities\u2014and  that such practices are most often the responsibility of agency-wide  offices, component level offices, or both. Specifically, of the 32 agencies  we surveyed, 24 agencies reported that agency-wide or component  offices, or both, had primary responsibility for comparing risk  assessments across facilities and 26 agencies reported that either or both  of these offices had primary responsibility for monitoring countermeasure  implementation across facilities. A few agencies reported that regional or  district offices or facilities had primary responsibility for these activities  instead of agency-wide or component offices. However, not all agencies  we surveyed perform these activities: six agencies reported that they do  not compare risk assessments across facilities, and two agencies  reported that they do not monitor the implementation of countermeasures  across facilities. Officials from OPM and DOE, two of our case-study  agencies, said that they do not compare risk assessments across  facilities.  Specifically, OPM officials told us that they do not compare the  results of the risk assessments across facilities because they have a  small facility portfolio and have not seen the need to do such a  comparison. Rather, the agency uses risk assessments to determine  what countermeasures need to be implemented to address risks at  individual facilities. Similarly, DOE officials told us that each of their  component offices conducts risk assessments in different ways and that  the Office of Health, Safety, and Security, which has agency-wide  responsibility for physical security policy and oversight, does not compare  risks across components or facilities. In contrast, officials from another  case-study agency, USPS, said that they do perform such comparisons.   USPS officials who have agency-wide responsibilities for physical security  said that they review the results of risk assessment performed across  facilities to identify trends or anomalies that may indicate a systemic  problem, and use this information to determine which countermeasures  need to be implemented on a national basis. Monitoring the  implementation of countermeasures across facilities can provide agencies  with an agency-wide understanding of their vulnerabilities and whether  identified risks have been mitigated.", "Another key practice in facility protection we have identified is the use of  performance measures. In the area of physical security, performance  measures could include the number of security incidents or the  effectiveness of countermeasures, among other things. We have  previously reported that benefits of performance measures for physical  security include helping agencies reach their strategic objectives for  physical security, evaluating the effectiveness of their physical security  programs, and identifying changes needed to better meet the program\u2019s  objectives.", "Twenty-two of 32 agencies we surveyed reported that at least some of  their performance measures are documented in agency-wide or  component-level planning, budget, or performance reports. The  remaining 10 agencies reported that they did not have or did not know if  they have performance measures documented in such reports. One of  our case-study agencies, OPM, uses agency-wide performance  measures to measure the performance of its security program.  In  contrast, officials from another case-study agency, DOE, said that such  measures are difficult to implement at their agency. OPM, for example,  has specific goals for its physical security program that are reflected in  the evaluation used for its director of security. These performance goals,  which are linked to the agency\u2019s strategic plan and operational goals,  include measures such as completing a certain number of facility risk  assessments, revising physical security policies, and fully implementing  physical security technologies by specific dates. In contrast, DOE officials  told us that although measuring performance on an agency-wide basis is  a beneficial practice, they do not have agency-wide performance  measures because each DOE facility varies, making it difficult to compare  performance trends across facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Make Limited Use of Management Practices for Allocating Resources", "paragraphs": ["Among the physical security activities we asked about, agencies we  surveyed identified allocating physical security resources across an  agency\u2019s portfolio as the greatest challenge. A majority of agencies (17  or more) we surveyed identified the following resource allocation activities  as extremely or very challenging: balancing the need for improved  security with other operational needs and competing interests, obtaining  funding for security technologies and personnel, and balancing the  funding process with changing security needs. Additional activities related  to resource allocation were also among those that surveyed agencies  found most challenging, as shown in figure 5. Surveyed agencies  generally reported other aspects of physical security that we asked about  to be less challenging than those related to resource allocation.", "Officials we interviewed at various levels in our case-study agencies\u2014 including at agency-wide offices and facilities\u2014also cited challenges  related to the timeliness of funding decisions or prioritizing resource  allocation decisions. For example, DOE officials in the agency-wide office  responsible for physical security said that once they decide which  countermeasures they need to implement to address threats or  vulnerabilities, it takes time to obtain funding because the budget cycle  spans multiple years. Similarly, officials at a USPS facility we visited said  that USPS\u2019s funding process\u2014which involves headquarters prioritizing  security funds and reassessing the priorities during the year to take into  consideration newly identified security deficiencies\u2014makes it a challenge  for the facility to obtain funding as quickly as it would like. A USPS  headquarters official said that this might occur because there are other  facilities that have higher priority security needs, and that facilities would  be able to implement an interim solution while awaiting funding for a long- term solution. Officials must also prioritize funding for physical security  along with other agency needs, as described by an official from a VA  hospital we visited, who said that the medical center director has to  balance funding for physical security needs, such as training for security  personnel, with other hospital needs, such as medical equipment and  overtime pay.", "Agency officials we interviewed at our case-study agencies said that the  following circumstances contribute to the challenges they experience in  allocating physical security resources:", "Evolving threats. DOE officials at the agency-wide level and a  component office discussed the budgetary implications of the need to  address constantly changing threats and increased risks, which  results in the need for new or increased countermeasures at their  facilities. For example, the agency-wide officials said that after the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was a large focus on  security and that as a result, DOE incorporated many new  countermeasures at its facilities. The officials stated that the threats  have changed over time, and different countermeasures are required  to address the new threats.", "Limited familiarity with aspects of physical security. A USPS  headquarters official said that his agency recently took steps to help  individuals who make funding decisions in physical security make  more informed funding decisions.  This official said that USPS  improved the existing level of coordination between the individuals  responsible for making funding decisions and those with expertise in  physical security.  According to USPS, this enabled the agency to  more effectively prioritize and decide which physical security projects  should get funded.  Likewise, a police officer at a VA facility we visited  described the challenge of identifying appropriate and cost-effective  technologies to purchase because his training and expertise are in  law enforcement, not in technological aspects of physical security.", "Limited budgets available for physical security. Agencies throughout  the federal government have experienced or are experiencing budget  constraints that have limited the funding available for their programs,  including physical security programs. Agency officials we interviewed  told us that they have limited funds to implement some physical  security measures that address identified risks. A USPS official we  interviewed said that while baseline physical security measures are in  place at each USPS facility, financial constraints, caused by declining  revenues at the agency, have affected the agency\u2019s ability to deploy  security enhancements at its facilities. For instance, because of  limited funding, implementing security enhancements, such as an  upgraded closed-circuit television (CCTV) system, may be delayed at  a facility until the needed funding becomes available. In addition, an  official at FCC stated that funding was not available to implement  several recommendations identified in its fiscal year 2012 physical  security risk assessments. This official said that while there has not  been an immediate impact of not funding these recommendations, the  lack of funding results in continued risks not being addressed.  However, in instances when a risk assessment identified an  immediate or imminent threat, this official said that funding was made  available to mitigate or reduce the threat.", "As discussed, agencies are already using management practices to  support oversight of their physical security programs, but according to our  survey, agencies make limited use of some of these management  practices for the purposes of allocating resources. For example, as shown  in figure 3, of the 30 agencies responding to the survey question on  whether they have a manager responsible for physical security aspects  we asked about, only 13 reported that they have a manager for allocating  resources based on risk assessments. In contrast, a majority of  agencies reported having managers for other aspects of physical security,  including those related to oversight. In addition, as discussed, 6 agencies  do not compare risk assessments across facilities and 10 agencies do not  have or do not know if they have documented agency- or component- wide performance measures. In addition to supporting oversight, we  identified a number of examples of how agencies\u2019 use of management  practices can contribute to more efficient allocation of physical security  resources across an agency\u2019s portfolio of facilities. Below are examples of  how management practices\u2014such as having a physical security  manager, comparing risk assessments across facilities, and using  performance measures\u2014can aid in more efficient resource allocation.  The use of management practices for the purposes of resource allocation  is particularly relevant given the challenges cited in this area.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General recently reported that the agency  could realize efficiencies by consolidating security guard contracts  from multiple offices throughout the agency to a single unified office. A  physical security manager who is responsible for allocating resources  across an agency or across components within an agency can help  bring about greater efficiencies in procurement of equipment or  personnel at the agency.", "We have previously reported that comparing physical security across  facilities, such as comparing the results of risk assessments across  facilities and monitoring the implementation of countermeasures  across facilities, is another risk management practice that can help  agency officials prioritize resource allocation decisions. In this  context, USPS headquarters officials said that they are in the process  of improving their capability to compare the results of risk  assessments across facilities. They plan to use these comparisons to  help them prioritize which facilities in their portfolio have the greatest  physical security needs and then direct funding to meet the priority  needs.", "We have also previously reported that using physical security-related  performance measures can help agencies justify investment decisions  to maximize available resources. Such performance measures have  helped security officials in one government agency in Australia  allocate resources more effectively across facilities. One performance  measure this agency used allowed security officials to monitor the  impact of additional security expenditures on a facility\u2019s risk rating  while controlling for existing security enhancements that mitigate the  risk, such as the number of guard patrols and the adequacy of access  control systems. Security officials then used the results to justify  spending decisions and prioritize security investments. Although this  example is from an agency outside of the United States, the use of  such performance measures could be a useful practice to more  effectively allocate resources at agencies within the United States as  well.", "As the government\u2019s central forum for exchanging information and  disseminating guidance on physical security at federal facilities, ISC is  well positioned to develop and disseminate guidance on management  practices that can help agencies make funding decisions across a  portfolio of facilities. ISC\u2019s key physical security standards can help  agencies make resource allocation decisions at individual facilities, but  the standards do not currently address management practices for  allocating resources across an agency\u2019s entire portfolio of facilities. ISC\u2019s  key standards\u2014Facility Security Level Determinations, Physical Security  Criteria, and Design-Basis Threat\u2014are intended to be used to determine  the types of countermeasures needed at a given facility to provide a  baseline level of protection. In this regard, the standards can help  agencies make spending decisions at individual facilities, but do not  provide direction to guide funding decisions across a portfolio of facilities.  ISC officials we interviewed said that compiling information on  management practices that support the allocation of resources across a  portfolio of facilities would be useful for agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies\u2019 physical security programs are mainly informed by their own  institutional knowledge and subject matter expertise and, to a lesser  degree, ISC standards. A few agencies rely extensively on ISC standards  to inform key aspects of their security programs, but others use the  standards in a more limited way. Agencies whose officials we interviewed  and those we surveyed told us that they do not use ISC standards to a  greater degree because the standards are not suitable to their facilities or  because their agencies base their security programs on their own  physical security standards that they believe obviate the need to use ISC  standards. These reasons indicate some agencies lack an understanding  of how the standards are intended to be used. As ISC officials stated, the  standards are meant to accommodate almost any type of facility and are  to be used in concert with other physical security requirements to which  agencies may be subject. ISC has an opportunity to clarify to agencies  how the standards are intended to be used when it disseminates new or  updated standards, provides training to agencies on the standards, or  engages in other outreach regarding the standards. Furthermore, ISC can  use its quarterly meetings with its member agencies as a forum to share  best practices on how the standards are to be used. Such outreach to  clarify how the standards can be used may result in the greater use of the  standards by ISC member agencies. Likewise, outreach by ISC to  executive branch agencies that are not ISC members to clarify how the  ISC standards are to be used may also lead to wider adoption of ISC  standards. Potential benefits of more widespread use of ISC standards  include helping to achieve the purpose of Executive Order 12977 to  enhance the quality and effectiveness of security of federal facilities.  Moreover, consistent use may help ensure that federal agencies are  following a decision-making process that helps ensure that all facilities  are covered by a cost-effective baseline level of protection commensurate  with identified risks at those facilities. In addition to these benefits,  clarifying to executive branch agencies how ISC standards are to be used  will also help the agencies understand what the standards require, which  is an important first step for ISC as it prepares to monitor and test  agencies\u2019 compliance with its standards.", "Government agencies are faced with increasing security requirements  and limited budgets. Effective program management, including the use of  management practices such as risk management strategies and a  centralized management structure, can help make the most effective use  of limited resources. While agencies are already using management  practices to support oversight of their physical security programs,  agencies make limited use of some of these management practices for  the purposes of allocating resources. For example, most agencies do not  have a central manager or agency-wide guidelines for allocating  resources across facilities based on risk assessments, and some  agencies do not compare risk assessments across facilities. Agencies  also reported that the greatest challenge they face\u2014among the physical  security activities we asked about\u2014is allocating physical security  resources. ISC\u2019s key standards do not currently provide guidance on  management practices that agencies can use to allocate resources  across their entire portfolio of facilities. Agencies\u2019 use of management  practices could help agencies make resource allocation decisions  strategically for their entire portfolios of facilities and maximize effective  resource allocation agency-wide.

In addition, although not included in the FRPP, we surveyed  the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) because of its large number of federal  real property holdings. See appendix II for a list of agencies we surveyed.  We obtained responses from all 36 surveyed agencies. To determine  whether the surveyed agencies were within the scope of our review, we  asked questions in the survey to determine if all of their facilities were  protected by FPS. Four agencies reported that all of their facilities were  protected by FPS, and we therefore did not include them in our review.  The remaining 32 agencies are included in our review, and in this report  we identify these agencies as the agencies we surveyed.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey can introduce  non-sampling errors, such as difficulties interpreting a particular question,  which can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took  steps to minimize non-sampling errors by pre-testing the questionnaire in  person with six different agencies. The agencies were GAO, USPS, the  Department of Energy (DOE), ISC, GSA, and the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC). We conducted pretests to help  ensure that the questions were clear and unbiased, that the data and  information were readily obtainable, and that the questionnaire did not  place an undue burden on respondents.

Based on  our review of agency square footage as presented in the Federal Real  Property Council\u2019s FY2010 Federal Real Property Report, we classified  DOE, VA, and USPS as large property holders, and FCC and OPM as  small property holders. To ensure that we had diversity in levels of public  access at agencies\u2019 facilities, we reviewed previous GAO reports and  agency websites.
