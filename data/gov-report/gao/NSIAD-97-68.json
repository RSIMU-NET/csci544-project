DOD\u2019s comment fails to recognize, however, that we are suggesting that, given the already reported test results, Congress may wish a more detailed report outlining the adequacy of and the system\u2019s performance during follow-on operational testing to help in its oversight and provide it assurance that the system\u2019s problems have been substantially resolved. Given that (1) Congress felt such reporting to be beneficial enough to require it before a system can proceed beyond LRIP and (2) the fact that DOT&E, in the required report provided for Joint STARS, could not certify effectiveness for war and found the system unsuitable as tested, we continue to believe that Congress may wish to require a similar report based on the follow-on operational test and evaluation planned.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix I, along with our evaluation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether Joint STARS test performance indicates a maturity justifying full-rate production, we interviewed officials and reviewed documents in Washington, D.C., from the DOD Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation and the Joint STARS Integrated Product Team.

To determine whether it is possible that a more useful operational test and evaluation report can be provided Congress, we reviewed the statute governing operational testing and evaluation, examined DOT&E\u2019s Beyond LRIP report, and considered other relevant program information. We considered and incorporated where appropriate DOD\u2019s response to our September 20, 1996, letter of inquiry and its response to a draft of this report.

We have not suggested or recommended that Joint STARS production be interrupted. We have, however, suggested actions that we believe (1) will help reduce the program\u2019s risk; (2) could result in the acquisition of a more effective, less costly system; and (3) could help decisionmakers ensure that the Joint STARS program continues to make progress. 2. The report has been modified in light of DOD\u2019s comments. 3. DOD\u2019s indication that other factors were considered in deciding to proceed to full-rate production is a signal that DOD and the Air Force are willing to accept a high level of risk even when the Director, Operation, Test, and Evaluation (DOT&E) has concluded that the system was unsuitable as tested and operational effectiveness for war remains to be demonstrated. We believe, given the system\u2019s test performance as reported by both the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command (AFOTEC) and DOT&E and the program\u2019s procurement cost growth of $1 billion between the low-rate and full-rate production decision points, that an informed full-rate production decision required the following information: (1) an approved test and evaluation master plan for follow-on operational testing and specific plans for the tests called for in that master plan, (2) the results of the already ongoing study of ways to reduce the program\u2019s cost, and (3) an analysis of alternatives to the current platform. DOD did not have these items in hand when it made its decision. We must also note that DOD implies that our recommendations would require a break in production. This is inaccurate. As we stated in the body of our report, the program could have continued under low-rate initial production (LRIP) until operational effectiveness and suitability for combat were demonstrated and plans to address identified deficiencies and reduce program costs were completed. 4. In its report on the Joint STARS multi-service operational test and evaluation, AFOTEC stated that \u201cJoint STARS software is immature and significantly impedes the system\u2019s reliability and effectiveness.\u201d We do not believe that, given the software intensive nature of the system, this statement supports a conclusion that the system could be judged operationally effective. 5. We must note that follow-on operational test and evaluation of the system was planned before the full-rate production decision. The full-rate production decision called for acceleration of that testing and for that testing to address deficiencies identified in the earlier tests. Joint STARS could have continued under LRIP pending a demonstration of operational effectiveness and suitability. 6. This speaks to the number of aircraft missions planned and the number for which an aircraft was provided. It does not address the quality or quantity of the support provided during those missions. Furthermore, DOD\u2019s comment refers to the same\u2014operation that is reported on in both the Air Force and DOT&E reports and in this report. 7. U.S.-based contractor support was utilized during the first Operation Joint Endeavor deployment. It is also our understanding that during the second Operation Joint Endeavor deployment the Air Force may have utilized a \u201creach-back\u201d maintenance concept in which U.S. stationed contractor staff were providing field support through satellite communications. Moreover, DOD and Air Force officials told us that at least at the beginning of the second Operation Joint Endeavor deployment, contractor staff were flying on the deployed aircraft. This clearly raises the question of what the overall level of contractor support was for both the first and second deployments. \u201cAs already discussed, extensive efforts by the system contractor were required to achieve the demonstrated availability for the E-8C aircraft. Even with those efforts the system was not able to meet the user criteria for several measures directly related to the maintenance concept in place during \u2014a concept that involved considerably more contractor support than previously envisioned.\u201d", "11. As we noted in the body of our report, Joint STARS failed to meet test criteria during an operation less demanding than combat, even with such significant contractor involvement beyond that planned for in combat. In discussing operational tempo in its Beyond LRIP report, DOT&E stated that if the system is operated at rates similar to the Airborne Warning and Control System, \u201cit is questionable whether the [Joint STARS aircraft] can be sustained over time.\u201d DOD commented that an unbiased assessment of the measure of Joint STARS\u2019 ability to maintain the required tempo could not be made and would be tested during the follow-on operational test and evaluation. We believe that an informed full-rate production decision requires knowledge of a system\u2019s ability to satisfy the operational tempo expected of it. DOD made its Joint STARS full-rate production decision without this knowledge. 12. We understand that Joint STARS, like most systems, has limitations that need to be planned around. At issue here is a question of how great those limitations are and whether they are acceptable. DOD states that \u201cthe user is satisfied that the system meets requirements.\u201d However, we must note that the Air Force\u2019s own Operational Test and Evaluation Center reported that the \u201ctwo critical suitability [measures of performance, sortie generation rate and mission reliability rate], were affected by [Operation Joint Endeavor] contingency requirements and system stability problems.\u201d \u201cThe high failure rate of aging aircraft components affected  as critical failures were statistically determined to affect over 30 percent of the sorties flown. Analysis revealed the elevated critical failure rate was steady and showed no potential for improvement. Technical data and software immaturity affected the maintainability of the aircraft, and contractor involvement further compromised clear insight into the Air Force technicians\u2019 ability to repair the system.\u201d", "AFOTEC also reported on Joint STARS performance relative to 15 supporting suitability criteria. It stated \u201cEight did not meet users\u2019 criteria. One was not tested. Only one . . . met the users\u2019 criteria. The remaining five are reported using narrative results.\u201d 13. DOD discusses only the weight growth of funded activities, leaving open the question of whether there are future, but currently unfunded, improvements planned that will add weight growth. Air Force officials told us that the Airborne Warning and Control System had experienced weight growth over the life of its program. That growth was attributed to the system\u2019s being given added tasks over time. We believe it reasonable to expect that the Joint STARS program experience might track that of the Airborne Warning and Control Systems program, that is, be given added tasks and face weight growth as a result. Also, regarding Joint STARS room for growth, DOD previously advised us that Joint STARS currently has about 455,000 cubic inches of space available. We must note that this equates to a volume of under 7 feet cubed and that in commenting on the system\u2019s space limitation, DOT&E stated \u201cThere is little room available for additional people or operator workstations.\u201d 14. As we stated in the body of our report, how easily these software changes are incorporated remains to be seen. 15. We requested and DOD provided additional information on this point. DOD\u2019s subsequent response indicates that this DOD comment was in error. In its subsequent response, DOD stated that the follow-on test and evaluation was accelerated \u201cto reflect  desire for earlier  to evaluate fixes to  deficiencies.\u201d We believe this statement reflects a recognition of increased program risk. 16. The acquisition decision memorandum approving Joint STARS production clearly indicates that the Skantze study mentioned was not completed at that time. We believe that the full-rate production decision should have been made with the Skantze study in hand. Furthermore, we do not understand why DOD felt the need to direct the Air Force to fund and implement a plan that is to save it money, but felt no need to direct the Air Force to examine alternative platforms that at least one other DOD panel had stated would not only save $3 billion but also provide greater effectiveness. 17. We believe that not only should DOT&E approval of the Joint STARS Test and Evaluation Master Plan be required, but also of all supporting test plans. We have changed the language of this matter for congressional consideration accordingly. 18. We are suggesting that Congress may wish to request a more detailed report, one at the Beyond LRIP report level of detail, a level of detail not provided in DOT&E\u2019s annual report. Given that DOT&E could only state effectiveness for operations other than war\u2014could not state a belief as to whether the system would be effective in two of the three critical operational roles it is expected to perform in war\u2014and found the system unsuitable as tested, we believe that such report would help Congress maintain program oversight. DOD\u2019s comment of \u201cother reports as appropriate\u201d leaves the matter in DOD\u2019s hand to decide if Congress would benefit from such a report.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
