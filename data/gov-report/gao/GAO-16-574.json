These challenges include limited participant access because of a classified exercise environment, limited inclusion of other federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners, and inadequate incorporation of joint physical-cyber scenarios. In addition to these challenges, DOD has not identified and conducted a \u201ctier 1\u201d exercise\u2014an exercise involving national-level organizations and combatant commanders and staff in highly complex environments. A DOD cyber strategy planning document states, and DOD officials agreed, that such an exercise is needed to help prepare forces in the event of a disaster with physical and cyber effects.

In June 2015, we testified on the progress DOD  had made in implementing our prior recommendations to support civil  authorities including strengthening the department\u2019s strategy, plans, and  guidance; interagency coordination; and capabilities. We found that DOD  had taken action to address some of our prior recommendations, but had  not fully addressed others. For example, DOD had improved interagency  coordination for support of civil authorities by defining interagency roles  and responsibilities and had identified capabilities it could provide for  DSCA. However, DOD had not issued implementation guidance on the  use of dual-status commanders, as we had recommended. According to  DOD, as of May 2016, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland  Defense and Global Security had drafted a DOD instruction that provides  policy and guidance on dual-status commanders and the instruction was  in the approval process. In April 2016, we reported on the extent to which  DOD had developed guidance that clearly defines the department\u2019s  DSCA roles and responsibilities in response to domestic cyber incidents.  We reported that DOD guidance does not clarify the roles and  responsibilities of key DOD entities\u2014such as DOD components, the  supported command, and the dual-status commander\u2014that may be  called upon to support a cyber incident. We recommended that DOD  issue or update guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities for  relevant entities and officials to support civil authorities as needed in a  cyber incident.

Specifically, we reviewed Joint  Publication 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities; DOD Directive  3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA); DOD Instruction  3025.22, The Use of the National Guard for Defense Support of Civil  Authorities; and DOD Directive 7730.65, Department of Defense  Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). We compared the DOD  guidance documents listed above and the information we received in our  interviews to the requirement for identifying National Guard emergency  response capabilities listed in the United States Code. Additionally, we  discussed National Guard unit cyber capabilities and capability  identification mechanisms with officials from DOD involved in DSCA,  including from the National Guard Bureau, the Army National Guard, and  the Air National Guard. After pre-testing our interview questions with  officials from the Maryland National Guard and meeting with the Colorado  National Guard, we interviewed officials from a non-generalizable sample  of state National Guard cyber units from Georgia, Nevada, and  Washington regarding their cyber civil-support roles and responsibilities,  cyber capabilities, and capability identification mechanisms. We  judgmentally selected these states based on factors such as the type and  number of cybersecurity teams in the state, and the participation of teams  in cyber civil-support exercises. Our findings regarding the capabilities  identified during our interviews with these National Guard units are not  generalizable to all state National Guard cyber units and do not reflect an  exhaustive list of National Guard cyber capabilities.

We also reviewed these documents to  determine the types of exercises in which DOD should be conducting or  participating. We then identified a non-generalizable sample of relevant  exercises from fiscal years 2013 through 2015 by reviewing DOD  exercise planning documentation and by interviewing knowledgeable  officials from DOD and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We  chose this timeframe because it allowed us to identify a range of  exercises for review and to identify any trends over time. We selected  exercises where DOD trained for its role in supporting civil authorities  during a domestic cyber incident. To examine DOD planning for  conducting future exercises related to civil support for cyber incidents, we  compared DOD planning documentation to DOD guidance for exercises,  such as the DOD Cyber Strategy and Joint Publication 3-28.

However, the exercises DOD conducted did not  include other key federal agencies (e.g., State and Treasury  departments), or other critical infrastructure owners (e.g., bank owners).  According to an official from ODASD for Cyber Policy, DOD recognizes  that such organizations potentially would be involved in a cyber incident.  Similarly, according to the DOD Cyber Strategy, the private sector owns  and operates over 90 percent of all of the networks and infrastructure of  cyberspace and is thus the first line of defense. In Vista Host II, DOD  officials reportedly learned that the critical infrastructure owner would  contact its security vendors first because of their familiarity with the  critical infrastructure\u2019s industrial-control systems; however, none of the  DOD exercises we reviewed included such vendors.", "Inadequate incorporation of joint physical-cyber scenarios: The 7  DOD-conducted exercises we reviewed did not fully explore a scenario in  which multiple DOD components and commanders would be responding  to a cyber incident that causes an emergency or disaster with physical  effects or occurs during such an emergency. The Joint Action Plan for  State-Federal Unity of Effort on Cybersecurity, which was approved by  DOD, recognizes the possibility of a cyber incident with physical effects  as well as a physical incident with cyber implications. DOD recognizes  that a cyber incident could cause physical effects, including cascading  failures of multiple, interdependent, critical, life-sustaining infrastructure  sectors. Similarly, Washington National Guard officials told us that bad  actors may take advantage of a disaster or emergency to conduct cyber  attacks on information and communications systems in that geographic  area. In its planning, DOD has recognized that this is an area that needs  to be addressed. Specifically, a planning document that the ODASD for  Cyber Policy, the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Northern Command, and  U.S. Cyber Command developed to implement the DOD Cyber Strategy  states that the department should conduct an exercise that will  incorporate cybersecurity as part of broader exercise scenarios. DOD  officials acknowledged that DOD exercises to date, such as the Cyber  Guard exercises, have not been ideal for a nationwide exercise that  addresses multiple complexities of cyber incidents and physical  consequences.", "In addition to these challenges, we also observed that DOD has not  addressed its goals by conducting a tier 1 exercise involving various  partners in highly complex environments. Specifically, while DOD  conducted 7 exercises that evaluated in some part civil support for a  cyber incident, these exercises varied from tabletop exercises to other  exercises that do not meet Joint Staff\u2019s\u2019 tier 1 exercise criteria. DOD\u2019s  Cyber Strategy exercise planning document states that DOD needs to  conduct a tier 1 exercise to achieve the DOD Cyber Strategy goal of  exercising its DSCA capabilities in support of DHS and other agencies,  including state and local authorities, to help defend the federal  government and the private sector, if directed, in an emergency. Similarly,  U.S. Northern Command and ODASD for Cyber Policy officials told us  that the department needs to conduct a tier 1 exercise to explore a  disaster with physical and cyber effects. DOD\u2019s Cyber Strategy planning  document states and officials agree that the department needs to conduct  such an exercise to prepare its forces to support civil authorities during or  after a cyber incident. However, DOD has not conducted a tier 1 exercise  that would prepare DOD forces and enable the department to achieve  one of the goals in the DOD Cyber Strategy because the department has  not identified an exercise to do so. According to U.S. Northern Command  officials, the command wanted to incorporate a cyber civil-support  scenario in its 2016 Ardent Sentry exercise, which is a tier 1 exercise.  However, the command cancelled its plans after U.S. Cyber Command\u2014 a DOD component that would potentially provide critical capabilities in  supporting civil authorities\u2014stated that the command had to focus its  exercise resources on the Cyber Guard exercise to certify DOD\u2019s cyber  protection teams. Until DOD identifies and conducts a tier 1 exercise,  DOD will miss an opportunity to fully test response plans, evaluate  response capabilities, assess the clarity of established roles and  responsibilities, and improve proficiency in supporting DHS, other federal  agencies, and state and local authorities, if directed, in an emergency. In  addition, identifying and conducting a tier 1 exercise would provide DOD  an opportunity to address the challenges the department has experienced  in previous exercises. For example, the tier 1 exercise could be  conducted in part on an open network, include additional federal agencies  and other critical infrastructure owners that would be involved in a  response, and incorporate scenarios where both cyber threats and  physical effects were involved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has a key role to prepare to defend the homeland and support civil  authorities in all domains\u2014including cyberspace\u2014and plays a crucial role  in supporting a national effort to confront cyber threats to critical  infrastructure. The National Guard has cyber capabilities that could be  used\u2014if requested and approved\u2014to support civil authorities in a cyber  incident. During an emergency, it is necessary for decision makers to  have visibility into the full capabilities that National Guard units possess to  support civil authorities. Unless DOD develops or specifies a database to  provide full and quick identification of all National Guard units\u2019 cyber  capabilities, DOD may not have timely visibility and access for needed  capabilities when requested by civil authorities during a cyber incident.  Similarly, DOD has conducted and participated in exercises to prepare  the department to support civil authorities in a cyber incident. Unless  DOD conducts a tier 1 exercise that involves various partners in highly  complex environments, DOD risks having unprepared forces to call upon  to support civil authorities during or after a disaster with physical and  cyber effects, and will miss a key opportunity to address the challenges  we have identified with its previous exercises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that decision makers have immediate visibility into all  capabilities of the National Guard that could support civil authorities in a  cyber incident, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense maintain a  database that can fully and quickly identify the cyber capabilities that the  National Guard in the 50 states, three territories, and the District of  Columbia have and could be used\u2014if requested and approved\u2014to  support civil authorities in a cyber incident.", "To better prepare DOD to support civil authorities in a cyber incident, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, the Chief of the National Guard  Bureau, the Commander of U.S. Northern Command, and the  Commander of U.S. Cyber Command to conduct a tier 1 exercise that will  improve DOD\u2019s planning efforts to support civil authorities in a cyber  incident. Such an exercise should also address challenges from prior  exercises, such as limited participant access to exercise environment,  inclusion of other federal agencies and private-sector cybersecurity  vendors, and incorporation of emergency or disaster scenarios concurrent  to cyber incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and DHS for their review and  comment. In its written comments, DOD partially concurred with our two  recommendations. DOD\u2019s comments are summarized below and are  reprinted in entirety in appendix II. DOD also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. DHS  provided technical comments which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense maintain a database that can fully and quickly identify the cyber  capabilities that the National Guard in the 50 states, three territories, and  the District of Columbia have and could be used\u2014if requested and  approved\u2014to support civil authorities in a cyber incident. In its response,  DOD stated that it already tracks capability and readiness across the  entire force. Specifically, DOD stated that National Guard units assigned  to and performing Title 10, U.S. Code, missions report readiness through  the Defense Readiness Reporting System, and that units assigned to  perform Title 32, U.S. Code, missions report to their state\u2019s adjutant  general. However, as we reported\u2014and DOD\u2019s comments reflect\u2014the  Defense Readiness Reporting System does not identify National Guard  capabilities that could provide cyber support in a cyber incident. While this  system could track some National Guard capabilities, such as cyber  protection teams assigned to U.S. Cyber Command, this system alone  will not provide DOD leaders complete information about capabilities they  could employ to assist civil authorities. For example, while National Guard  computer network defense teams could serve as first responders for  states for cyber emergencies and may provide surge capacity to national  capabilities, the readiness system will not include these teams.", "In its comments, DOD also made reference to an annual report that state  adjutants general are to provide to the Chief of the National Guard  Bureau regarding the readiness of their respective state National Guards.  During our engagement, we reviewed the National Guard Bureau\u2019s  submission to the July-September 2015 Quarterly Readiness Report to  the Congress, which the bureau uses to meet its requirement to provide  DOD leaders a status on the readiness of the National Guard to conduct  DSCA activities. We found that the report identifies the readiness of state  National Guard units to conduct certain DSCA missions\u2014such as  hurricane response. However, the National Guard has not incorporated  other DSCA missions\u2014including cyber civil support\u2014in the Quarterly  Readiness Report to the Congress. Consequently, as prepared now, this  report does not help DOD leaders identify assets that could be used in a  cyber crisis scenario. However, if the National Guard Bureau modifies the  report to include the readiness level of National Guard units to provide  civil support in a cyber incident, DOD leaders will potentially have more  visibility into cyber capabilities that exist within the National Guard across  each state. Because the Defense Readiness Reporting System and the  National Guard report do not currently enable DOD leaders to identify  National Guard cyber capabilities that could facilitate a quick response in  a cyber incident, we continue to believe that DOD should maintain a  database\u2014as required by law\u2014that can fully and quickly identify the  cyber capabilities that the National Guard possesses.", "In response to DOD\u2019s comments, we clarified the recommendation that  was initially in the report. Specifically, we modified the recommendation  from stating that the database should include cyber capabilities that \u201call  National Guard units possess\u201d to cyber capabilities that \u201cthe National  Guard in the 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia have  and could be used.\u201d This modification is consistent with the requirement  identified in Section 1406 of the John Warner National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, which states that the database  should include emergency response capabilities that each state\u2019s  National Guard may be able to provide in response to a natural or  manmade domestic disaster. We discussed this modification with DOD  officials and they agreed that the modified recommendation provided  them the necessary flexibility to address the report\u2019s finding and  recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber  Policy, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, the Commander of U.S.  Northern Command, and the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command to  conduct a tier 1 exercise that will improve DOD\u2019s planning efforts to  support civil authorities in a cyber incident. DOD concurred in the need to  exercise a whole range of challenges associated with responding to a  cyber incident but stated that it believes that the Cyber Guard exercise  meets the intent of the recommendation. DOD stated that Cyber Guard is  designed to address a whole-of-government, whole-of-nation response to  a significant cyber attack and included participants from across DOD, the  National Guard, DHS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the  intelligence community, and the private sector. Based on our review of  after-action reports and discussions with DOD officials, we believe that  the Cyber Guard exercise provides DOD components with an opportunity  to evaluate aspects of the department\u2019s DSCA mission\u2014such as Cyber  Guard 15\u2019s test of DOD participation in a response to a cyber attack of  significant consequence against U.S. critical infrastructure. However,  these after-action reports and DOD officials at various levels also  identified a number of issues that keep Cyber Guard in its current form  from being a tier 1 exercise that would enable the department to achieve  its DOD Cyber Strategy goal of exercising its DSCA capabilities in  support of DHS and other agencies, including state and local authorities.  Specifically, officials from the ODASD for Cyber Policy, U.S. Northern  Command, U.S. Cyber Command, and National Guard units told us that  Cyber Guard, in its current form, does not meet the intentions of a tier 1  exercise. For example, according to DOD officials, one of the primary  purposes of Cyber Guard is to use the exercise as a forum to certify cyber  protection teams as being operationally ready. Consequently, according  to DOD officials, this does not provide DOD flexibility to address training  requirements that are not part of the certification requirements. DOD has  also conducted the exercise in a classified forum, which consistently limits  public and private sector participation. DOD stated that it strives for  greater inclusion of public and private entities in its exercises to increase  realism and enhance its understanding of domestic response  requirements; however, the exercises are typically classified because  they can reveal capabilities, readiness, or plans for military forces that  must be protected.", "DOD\u2019s approach does not recognize that while some DOD components  may support civil authorities using classified means, other DOD  components\u2014including the National Guard\u2014may be coordinating,  training, advising, or assisting civil authorities on unclassified networks.  Other cyber civil support exercises, such as the Army National Guard\u2019s  Cyber Shield exercise and the North American Electric Reliability  Corporation\u2019s GridEx exercise, demonstrate that training in unclassified  forums is both possible and beneficial. If DOD modifies Cyber Guard to  address the challenges we have highlighted\u2014such as limited participant  access to exercise environment, inclusion of other federal agencies and  private-sector cybersecurity vendors, and incorporation of emergency or  disaster scenarios concurrent to cyber incidents\u2014it could improve DOD\u2019s  planning efforts to support civil authorities in a cyber incident. Otherwise,  we still believe that DOD should conduct a tier 1 exercise such as a  modified Ardent Sentry that includes a DOD response to civil authorities  for a cyber incident.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland  Security.

Specifically, we reviewed Joint Publication 3- 28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities; DOD Directive 3025.18,  Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA); DOD Instruction 3025.22,  The Use of the National Guard for Defense Support of Civil Authorities;  and DOD Directive 7730.65 Department of Defense Readiness Reporting  System (DRRS). To identify National Guard cyber capabilities, we  reviewed DOD\u2019s and the National Guard\u2019s cyber mission analysis  reports. Additionally, we discussed National Guard unit cyber capabilities  and capability identification mechanisms with officials from DOD involved  in DSCA from the National Guard Bureau, the Army National Guard, the  Air National Guard, and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense (ODASD) for Cyber Policy. We also spoke with Timothy  Lowenberg, a recognized expert on the National Guard\u2019s role in cyber  incidents who is a retired U.S. Air Force Major General; he also has  served as an advisor to the Council of Governors and the National  Governors Association. We compared the DOD guidance documents  listed above and the information we received in our interviews to the  requirement for identifying National Guard emergency response  capabilities listed in the United States Code. Based on these discussions  and relevant DOD documentation, we categorized National Guard units  with cyber capabilities. After pre-testing our interview questions with  officials from the Maryland National Guard and meeting with the Colorado  National Guard, we conducted structured interviews with a non- generalizable sample of officials from state National Guard cyber units  from Georgia, Nevada, and Washington to discuss their cyber civil- support roles and responsibilities, cyber capabilities, and capability  tracking mechanisms. We judgmentally selected these states based on  the type and number of cybersecurity teams in the state, participation of  teams in cyber civil-support exercises, and the relative level of information  sector employment in the state based on 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics  sector-level data. We found the Bureau of Labor Statistics information- sector activity data sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this selection.  Our findings regarding the capabilities identified during our three sets of  interviews with these National Guard units are not generalizable to all  state National Guard cyber units and do not reflect an exhaustive list of  National Guard cyber capabilities. While some of the National Guard  capabilities could be used to support their respective state missions, our  focus was on National Guard capabilities that could be used in DOD\u2019s  DSCA mission.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has conducted and participated in  exercises to support civil authorities in cyber incidents and any challenges  it faced in doing so, we reviewed the DOD Cyber Strategy, Strategy for  Homeland Defense and Defense Support of Civil Authorities, and Joint  Publication 3-28 for DSCA. We also reviewed these documents to  determine the types of exercises in which DOD should be conducting or  participating. We identified a non-generalizable sample of relevant  exercises by reviewing exercise planning documentation and through  interviews with knowledgeable officials. Specifically, we reviewed an  exercise planning document that DOD developed in response to the DOD  Cyber Strategy and interviewed DOD and DHS officials to identify  exercises that DOD components conducted or participated in from fiscal  years 2013 through 2015. We chose this timeframe because it allowed us  to identify a range of exercises for review and to identify any trends over  time. We selected exercises\u2014to include tabletop or simulated network  defense exercises\u2014that addressed computer network defense and  involved support to civil authorities. We excluded exercises that focused  solely on defense of DOD networks. We confirmed these exercises met  our selection criteria through reviewing exercise after-action reports. To  examine DOD planning for conducting future exercises related to civil  support for cyber incidents, we reviewed the DOD Cyber Strategy  exercise planning document. We also reviewed DOD guidance for such  exercises, such as the DOD Cyber Strategy; Joint Publication 3-28; DOD  Directive 3025.18, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  3500.01H Joint Training Policy for the Armed Forces of the United  States. We compared DOD plans for exercises for supporting civil  authorities in cyber incidents to these documents. We observed the Cyber  Guard 2016 Legal/Policy Tabletop Exercise held in February 2016 in  Laurel, Maryland.
