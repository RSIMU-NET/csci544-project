We matched the remaining 243,289 EINs against EINs on the tax year 1991 CREF, which we had obtained from IRS and which contained about 4.3 million records (i.e., EIN/SSN combinations).", "This match showed that, of the 243,289 Schedule Cs with EINs, 217,279 of these EINs were on CREF and 26,010 were not. From the 217,279 EINs that matched, we selected a random sample of 250 accounts to determine whether the information on CREF, the Individual Master File, and the Business Master File was accurate. For each account, we reviewed the Individual and Business Master File entity record and tax return data. We determined that the information on the files was accurate when the EIN and SSN on CREF were the same as those on the Individual and Business Master File entity records.", "Table I.1 shows the point estimates and the statistical confidence intervals at the 95-percent level of our case analysis by types of erroneous EINs listed on the Schedule Cs found on CREF.", "From the 26,010 Schedule C EINs not on CREF, we randomly selected 250 to determine whether there were valid reasons for their omission from CREF. We made this determination by searching IRS master file and tax return records for EINs in our random sample and analyzing the records when a match occurred. Table I.2 shows the point estimates and the statistical confidence intervals at the 95-percent level of our analysis of cases not on CREF.", "Table I.3 shows the overall results of our analysis of EINs on tax year 1991 Schedule Cs filed at the Fresno Service Center."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "San Francisco Field Office", "paragraphs": ["Arthur L.Davis, Evaluator-in-Charge Sam Scrutchins, Technical Advisor Hans Bredfeldt, Statistician The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
