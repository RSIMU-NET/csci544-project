Since 1969, IRS has not specified that these hospitals have to provide charity care to meet these requirements, so long as they engage in activities that benefit the community. Many of these activities are intended to benefit the approximately 47 million uninsured individuals in the United States who need financial and other help to obtain medical care. Previous studies indicated that nonprofit hospitals may not be defining community benefit in a consistent and transparent manner that would enable policymakers to hold them accountable for providing benefits commensurate with their tax-exempt status. GAO was asked to examine (1) IRS's community benefit standard and the states' requirements, (2) guidelines nonprofit hospitals use to define the components of community benefit, and (3) guidelines nonprofit hospitals use to measure and report the components of community benefit. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed federal and state laws; the standards and guidance from federal agencies and industry groups; and 2006 data from California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Texas. GAO also interviewed federal and state officials, and industry group representatives. IRS stated that the report in general was accurate, but noted several concerns regarding the description of the community benefit standard. CMS did not have any comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS's community benefit standard allows nonprofit hospitals broad latitude to determine the services and activities that constitute community benefit. Furthermore, state community benefit requirements that hospitals must meet in order to qualify for state tax-exempt or nonprofit status vary substantially in scope and detail. For example, 15 states have community benefit requirements in statutes or regulations, and 10 of these states have detailed requirements. GAO found that among the standards and guidance used by nonprofit hospitals, consensus exists to define charity care, the unreimbursed cost of means-tested government health care programs (programs for which eligibility is based on financial need, such as Medicaid), and many other activities that benefit the community as community benefit. However, consensus does not exist to define bad debt (the amount that the patient is expected to, but does not, pay) and the unreimbursed cost of Medicare (the difference between a hospital's costs and its payment from Medicare) as community benefit. Variations in the activities nonprofit hospitals define as community benefit lead to substantial differences in the amount of community benefits they report. Even if nonprofit hospitals define the same activities as community benefit, they may measure the costs of these activities differently, which can lead to inconsistencies in reported community benefits. For example, standards and guidance vary on the level at which hospitals may report their community benefit (e.g., at an individual hospital level or a health care system level) and the method hospitals may use to estimate costs of community benefit activities. State data demonstrate that differences in how nonprofit hospitals measure charity care costs and the unreimbursed costs of government health care programs can affect the amount of community benefit they report. With the added attention to community benefit has come a growing realization of the extent of variability among stakeholders in what should count and how to measure it. At present, determination and measurement of activities as community benefit for federal purposes are still largely a matter of individual hospital discretion. Given the large number of uninsured individuals, and the critical role of hospitals in caring for them, it is important that federal and state policymakers and industry groups continue their discussion addressing the variability in defining and measuring community benefit activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, there were about 2,900 nonprofit hospitals in the United States.

This has become known as the  community benefit standard and has remained substantially unchanged  since 1969. In addition to charity care, services and activities that can  qualify as community benefits include the provision of health education  and screening to specific vulnerable populations within the community  and activities that benefit the greater public good, such as education for  health professionals and medical research.", "Many of these community benefit activities\u2014especially charity care\u2014are  intended to benefit individuals who need financial and other help to obtain  medical care. In 2006, there were approximately 47 million uninsured  individuals in the United States. These individuals are more likely than  insured individuals to rely on hospital emergency rooms for medical care.  Some of these individuals with serious illness or injuries are admitted as  inpatients to the hospital, incurring substantial treatment costs. Because  uninsured individuals may lack the ability to pay for their medical care,  hospitals absorb some of the costs associated with providing  uncompensated care\u2014either through a charity care program or as  expenses written off as bad debt. Given the benefits available to tax- exempt hospitals, policymakers have been interested in determining the  extent to which hospitals share the burden of caring for uninsured  individuals.", "In 2005, we reported on the amount of uncompensated care that nonprofit,  for-profit, and government hospitals provided. We found that nonprofit  hospitals devoted only slightly more of their patient operating expenses to  uncompensated care, on average, than their for-profit counterparts. We  also found that the burden of uncompensated care was not evenly  distributed among nonprofit hospitals\u2014a small number of nonprofit  hospitals provided substantially more uncompensated care than other  hospitals receiving the same tax preference. In 2006, the Congressional  Budget Office (CBO) also reported wide variation in the provision of  uncompensated care among nonprofit hospitals.

In 2006, CHA and VHA jointly released a set of  detailed community benefit guidelines\u2014A Guide for Planning and  Reporting Community Benefit. HFMA represents health care financial  management executives and leaders in all areas of health care, including  hospitals. In 2006, the organization issued financial reporting guidance on  community benefit activities, including details on charity care and bad  debt. In addition to examining standards and guidance from these  organizations, we interviewed their officials and representatives. We also  interviewed representatives from the Association of American Medical  Colleges, which represents medical schools, teaching hospitals, and their  faculty, residents, and students, as well as academic and professional  societies; the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents for- profit community hospitals and health systems; the National Association  of Children\u2019s Hospitals; state hospital associations and state health  officials from California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Texas; and seven  nonprofit health care systems.", "To examine the effects of including or excluding various community  benefit activities on reported community benefit, we analyzed 2006 state  data from California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Texas.

The state data were also the most recent available  at the time of our analysis. We limited our analysis to nonprofit,  nongovernmental, acute care, general hospitals that reported gross patient  revenues and total operating expenses. We calculated and compared a  variety of hospital expenses, including charity care costs, bad debt,  unreimbursed costs of government health care programs, and the costs of  other activities that benefit the community, as percentages of total  operating expenses. To assess the reliability of the state data from  California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Texas, we reviewed relevant  documentation for each of the data sets and interviewed knowledgeable  state officials about the accuracy of the data.

This exemption is based on  the principle that the government\u2019s loss of tax revenue is offset by its relief  from financial burdens that it would otherwise have to meet with  appropriations from public funds, and by the benefits resulting from the  promotion of general welfare. Nonprofit hospitals have never been  expressly categorized as tax-exempt organizations under section 501(c)(3)  of the Internal Revenue Code. However, these hospitals are able to qualify  for federal tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue  Code since IRS and courts have recognized the promotion of health for the  benefit of the community\u2014where medical assistance is afforded to the  poor or where medical research is promoted\u2014as a charitable purpose.  Specifically, nonprofit hospitals must be organized and operated  exclusively for the promotion of health, ensuring that no part of their net  earnings inure to the benefit of any private individual, and may not  participate in political campaigns on behalf of any candidate or conduct  substantial lobbying activities.", "IRS has also issued revenue rulings specifying how nonprofit hospitals can  meet the requirements of federal tax exemption. In a 1956 revenue ruling,  IRS required tax-exempt hospitals to provide charity care to the extent of  their financial abilities, which was known as the financial ability  standard. However, through another revenue ruling in 1969, IRS  established the community benefit standard, which modified the charity  care-based financial ability standard as to how hospitals could qualify for  tax-exempt status. The community benefit standard specified that  nonprofit hospitals were not required to provide charity care to qualify for  federal tax exemption, but they must provide a benefit to the community.  Therefore, nonprofit hospitals could qualify for tax-exempt status so long  as they benefited the community in a way that relieved a governmental  burden and promoted general welfare, even if not every member of the  community received a direct benefit.", "In the 1969 revenue ruling that established the community benefit  standard, IRS recognized five factors that would support a nonprofit  hospital\u2019s tax-exempt status. These five factors were (1) the operation of  an emergency room open to all members of the community without regard  to ability to pay; (2) a governance board composed of community  members; (3) the use of surplus revenue for facilities improvement, patient  care, and medical training, education, and research; (4) the provision of  inpatient hospital care for all persons in the community able to pay,  including those covered by Medicare and Medicaid; and (5) an open  medical staff with privileges available to all qualifying physicians. IRS  further stated that tax-exempt status would be determined based on the  facts and circumstances of each case, and that neither the absence of  particular factors set forth in the 1969 revenue ruling nor the presence of  other factors would be necessarily conclusive.", "Nonprofit hospitals that qualify for tax-exempt status are exempt from  federal income taxation, have access to bond financing that generates tax- free interest earnings for the bondholder\u2014allowing these hospitals to  borrow funds at a lower cost than nonexempt entities\u2014and are eligible to  receive contributions that are tax deductible for the donors.

For example, California requires its nonprofit hospitals to  adopt and annually update a community benefit plan, and annually submit  a description of community benefit activities provided and their economic  values, among other things.

Of the 15 states with community benefit requirements, 6 states explicitly  include the unreimbursed cost of Medicare as community benefit, none  of the states explicitly exclude this cost, and   9 states do not specify.", "Whether nonprofit hospitals define the unreimbursed cost of Medicare as  community benefit has an important effect on the resulting amount of  community benefit reported. Specifically, most of the nonprofit hospitals  in the four states we examined\u2014over 90 percent in Texas and over   80 percent in California, Indiana, and Massachusetts\u2014reported having  unreimbursed costs of Medicare, and the amounts were typically  substantial compared to charity care costs and the unreimbursed cost of  Medicaid (see fig. 4). For example, in all four states the unreimbursed cost  of Medicare as a percentage of total operating expenses was at least   86 percent more than charity care costs as a percentage of the same  expenses. Similarly, the unreimbursed cost of Medicare as a percentage of  total operating expenses was at least 54 percent more than the  unreimbursed cost of Medicaid as a percentage of the same expenses.  Moreover, the amount of hospitals\u2019 unreimbursed cost of Medicare varied  widely across hospitals. For example, among nonprofit hospitals in  Indiana, which had the most variation, the middle 50 percent of hospitals  reported unreimbursed costs of Medicare ranging from 4.9 to 13.4 percent  of total operating expenses in 2006. Among the middle 50 percent of  nonprofit hospitals in Massachusetts, which had the least variation, the  span was still notable with unreimbursed costs of Medicare ranging from  2.4 to 8.0 percent of total operating expenses in 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consensus Exists to Define Most Other Activities That Benefit the Community as Community Benefit", "paragraphs": ["Consensus exists among the standards and guidance nonprofit hospitals  use to define six of the seven groups of other activities as community  benefit: cash and in-kind contributions, community benefit operations,  community health improvement services, health professions education,  medical research, and subsidized health services. State community  benefit requirements on these activities vary. For example, 13 of the 15  states with community benefit requirements cite additional activities\u2014 other than charity care, bad debt, or government health care programs\u2014as  community benefit. For these states, the most commonly cited type of  activity appears to be subsidized health services, although the exact term  used varies among the states.", "In contrast, consensus does not exist to define the seventh group of  activities\u2014community-building activities\u2014as community benefit. AHA,  CHA and VHA, and HFMA define community-building activities as  community benefit because these activities provide opportunities to  address the underlying causes of health problems, such as poverty,  homelessness, and environmental problems. IRS, however, has not taken a  position on whether to define community-building activities, which  include activities such as physical improvements and housing programs,  economic development, and environmental improvements, as community  benefit. The agency recognizes that there appears to be widespread  support for including these activities, and while the agency believes that  certain of these activities might constitute community benefit, more data  and study are required. CMS also does not comment on what other  activities should be defined as community benefit.", "While data are not available to evaluate the effect of defining community- building activities as community benefit, data on groups of other activities  that benefit the community indicate that they represent a relatively small  proportion of total operating expenses for hospitals. Only two of the four  states we examined\u2014Indiana and Texas\u2014collect data on other activities  that benefit the community, though even these states do not collect any  data on two of the seven categories of other activities that benefit the  community. For the five groups of other activities with data, fewer  hospitals in Indiana and Texas generally reported having unreimbursed  costs for these activities when compared with other types of community  benefits, such as charity care, and the unreimbursed costs of most  activities account for less than 1 percent each of total operating expenses,  on average (see fig. 5). For example, more hospitals in these two states  reported having unreimbursed costs for community health improvement  services than for the other four groups\u2014over two-thirds of Indiana  nonprofit hospitals and almost three-quarters of Texas nonprofit hospitals  reported having these costs. Among Texas and Indiana nonprofit hospitals,  the unreimbursed costs of these services averaged only 0.6 percent in  2006. In contrast, few hospitals reported having unreimbursed costs for  medical research\u2014less than 15 percent of nonprofit hospitals in both  states reported these costs. Among Indiana nonprofit hospitals reporting  these costs, the unreimbursed costs of medical research averaged only   0.1 percent of total operating expenses in 2006. In Texas, however, these  costs averaged 0.8 percent, and the top quarter of hospitals had  unreimbursed costs at least twice the average\u2014at 1.7 percent in 2006.", "In addition to representing a small proportion of total operating expenses,  the costs of other activities that benefit the community are generally  smaller than the costs of other types of activities that benefit the  community, such as charity care, bad debt, and the unreimbursed costs of  Medicaid and Medicare (see fig. 6).

For example, standards  and guidance used by nonprofit hospitals specify a variety of levels at  which hospitals can report their community benefit. Specifically, IRS  requires hospitals to report community benefit on Form 990 by employer  identification number (EIN) because tax exemption is determined by  EIN. An EIN may cover a single hospital, several hospitals, or other  aggregates. In contrast, CMS requires hospitals to submit cost reports,  which include Worksheet S-10 with data on uncompensated care, at an  individual hospital level. Industry stakeholders, such as AHA and CHA,  have stated that hospitals should have the choice to report community  benefits on a health care system level or as individual hospitals. CHA has  stated that hospitals should have this option because, for example, they  may also have established foundations or free health clinics as separate  taxable entities through which they provide community benefit; hospitals  should therefore have the option to include this community benefit in their  reports. HFMA does not specify the level at which hospitals should report  community benefit. The percentage of expenses devoted to community  benefit could differ for hospitals that belong to a system depending on  whether they reported at a system or individual level, because reporting at  a system level aggregates the percentages of each hospital. One official  from a state hospital association noted that because individual hospital  percentages would be aggregated when community benefits are reported  at a system level, there is a potential for a health care system as a whole,  and not necessarily each individual hospital, to meet a community benefit  standard.", "Data are not available that would allow us to evaluate the impact of  differences in the level at which nonprofit hospitals report community  benefit. IRS\u2019s forthcoming Form 990, Schedule H, which will collect  community benefit data, will be of limited use for comparing individual  hospitals\u2019 reported community benefits because, as noted, hospitals may  report community benefit as a single hospital or a larger aggregate, such as  a health care system. CMS\u2019s Worksheet S-10 collects data on an individual  hospital level, but we have found the data to be unreliable. MedPAC has  stated that Worksheet S-10 should be improved, calling specifically for  differentiating charity care and bad debt. Although Worksheet S-10  could yield reliable data in the future, it does not currently collect data on  all the activities IRS includes as community benefit, such as medical  research or subsidized health services.", "Standards and guidance used by nonprofit hospitals also differ in how they  instruct hospitals to estimate costs of community benefit activities.  Specifically, CHA and VHA and HFMA advocate calculating costs, if  possible, using a cost-accounting system. However, one state hospital  association we spoke with stated that smaller hospitals may not be able to  use this method. In contrast, CMS instructs hospitals to estimate costs on  Worksheet S-10 using a cost-to-charge ratio (CCR). CHA and VHA also  suggest using a CCR when a cost-accounting system cannot be used. There  are, however, many methods of calculating a CCR; CMS and CHA and VHA  specify how hospitals should calculate the CCR used to determine charity  care costs, but their formulas differ. AHA does not specify how to estimate  costs, but supports the CHA and VHA guidance. IRS instructs hospitals to  use a cost-accounting system, a CCR, or another cost-accounting method,  whichever is most accurate in estimating costs. Data are not available that  would allow us to evaluate the impact of the different practices hospitals  use to estimate costs on the amount of reported community benefit.", "In addition to the different practices on reporting levels and  methodologies for estimating costs, which affect every aspect of reported  community benefit, standards and guidance used by nonprofit hospitals  also specify a variety of practices to measure the costs of charity care,  government health care programs, and other activities that benefit the  community, which can lead to inconsistent reporting of these activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Measurement Practices for Charity Care", "paragraphs": ["Consensus does not exist on whether to add to charity care costs a  nonprofit hospital\u2019s contributions to uncompensated care pools or  programs, or whether to offset charity care costs by payments to  hospitals from uncompensated care pools or programs.

At the national level, in particular, there is  substantial divergence of opinion on whether hospitals should be  permitted to include bad debt and the unreimbursed cost of Medicare as  community benefit. States vary considerably in the extent to which they  have community benefit requirements, the nature of the requirements, and  instructions on how to measure the components of community benefit. At  present, determination and measurement of activities as community  benefit for federal purposes are still largely matters of individual hospital  discretion.", "Given the large number of uninsured individuals, and the critical role of  hospitals in caring for them, it is important that federal and state  policymakers and industry groups continue their discussion addressing  the variability in defining and measuring community benefit activities. An  encouraging prospect for the future is the potential availability of two  national data sources derived from mandatory reporting to IRS and CMS.

IRS stated that, going forward with Schedule H reporting requirements,  there will be very little or no discretion regarding these measurement  points. IRS further stated that the area where Schedule H provides  individual organizations discretion is in whether the organization  estimates the cost of community benefit activities using a CCR, a cost- accounting system, or a blend, so long as it is the most accurate  information the organization has available.

To review states\u2019  community benefit requirements, we defined \u201ccommunity benefit  requirement\u201d as a legal standard that expressly obligates a hospital to  provide health care services or benefits to the community served by the  hospital as a condition of maintaining tax-exempt status or qualifying as a  nonprofit hospital. It is generally something that hospitals are required to  do beyond their role of providing care for the sick and injured in exchange  for remuneration or compensation. We considered the requirement to be  one applicable to hospitals only if it either expressly referred to hospitals  or expressly referred to care or services of the nature and type that one  would reasonably expect to be provided by or performed primarily at  acute care hospitals. We also limited our research concerning community  benefit requirements to acute care, general hospitals. We looked only for  codified state statutes and regulations that impose this type of  requirement. If a statute or regulation described an activity that would fall  into one of the commonly recognized \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d categories  identified by IRS, we considered it to present a community benefit activity.", "We searched only for state statutes or regulations that require hospitals to  perform relevant activities in order to maintain tax exemption or nonprofit  status.

Charity care is generally defined as care provided to  patients who the hospital deems unable to pay all or a portion of their  bills. Bad debt is generally defined as the uncollectible payment that the  patient is expected to, but does not, pay. The unreimbursed costs of  government health care programs are generally defined as the shortfall  created when a facility receives payments that are less than the costs of  caring for public program beneficiaries. Other activities that benefit the  community include health professions education and medical research.  Not all of the four states we examined had data on all of these expenses;  therefore, we calculated each expense as a percentage of total operating  expenses whenever possible.

We considered states to provide a  \u201cdetailed\u201d definition if they provided some combination of the following: a  definition of community benefit, requirements for a community benefits  plan that sets forth how the hospital will provide community benefits,  reporting requirements, and penalties for noncompliance. These states  typically set forth a detailed definition of community benefit, specifying  numerous categories of activities that qualify, and are consistent with the  level of detail of community benefit definitions used by the Catholic  Health Association of the United States and other similar entities (see   app. II). Illinois, for example, includes the unreimbursed cost of providing  charity care, language assistant services, government-sponsored indigent  health care, donations, volunteer services, education, government- sponsored program services, research, subsidized health services, and  collecting bad debts. Illinois specifically excludes the cost of paying taxes  or other governmental assessments. Maryland defines community benefit  as \u201can activity that is intended to address community needs and priorities  primarily through disease prevention and improvement of health status,  including\u2026ealth services provided to vulnerable or underserved  populations such as Medicaid, Medicare, or Maryland Children\u2019s Health  Program enrollees...inancial or in kind support of public health  programs...onations of funds, property, or other resources that  contribute to a community priority...ealth care cost containment  activities; and...ealth education, screening, and prevention services.\u201d", "These 10 states also tend to have very detailed instructions on how  community benefits should be provided and reported. They may include a  description of the required elements of and the process by which a  hospital should compose its community benefits plan and the required  elements to be provided in a hospital\u2019s annual report to the relevant  authority. A typical example is California, which requires each of its  nonprofit hospitals to have a mission statement that requires that  hospital\u2019s policies to integrate and reflect the public interest in meeting its  responsibilities as a nonprofit organization; complete a community needs  assessment in consultation with community groups and government  officials; update its community needs assessment every 3 years; adopt and  annually update a community benefits plan for providing community  benefits either alone or in conjunction with other entities; and annually  submit its community benefits plan, including a description of the  activities undertaken and the economic value of community benefits  provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other States with Community Benefit Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The remaining five states with community benefit requirements have  provisions that are less detailed.

Some states apply their  community benefits provisions to all hospitals, such as in the context of  hospital licensure, rather than to tax exemption or nonprofit status (see  app. V). Examples of states that fall into this category are Massachusetts,  New Mexico, and Rhode Island, and they require all hospitals, both for- profit and nonprofit, to provide some form of community benefits. A  second group requires that hospitals periodically report to the relevant  authority the community benefits that they provide but do not require that  hospitals actually provide any community benefits (see app. VI). A third  group discusses community benefit in sources other than codified statutes  or regulations, such as attorney general guidelines or property tax  exemption standards (see app. VII). One state, Utah, discusses community  benefit in a set of standards of practice for property tax exemptions and  through its case law. Although Massachusetts has a statute requiring  community benefits for licensure purposes, the bulk of its community  benefit discussion is found in a set of attorney general guidelines.

In addition, states  may include explicit penalties for failure to comply with community  benefit provisions tied to hospital licensure requirements. For example, in  Rhode Island, a state that applies its community benefits provisions to all  hospitals through licensure requirements, failure to comply with statewide  standards for community benefits may result in criminal penalties: the  Superior Court may, after notice and opportunity for a prompt and fair  hearing, impose a prison term of up to 5 years for a person who knowingly  violates or fails to comply with the requirements or willingly or knowingly  gives false or incorrect information in connection with its licensure  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quantity", "paragraphs": ["Most states do not specify a minimum quantity of community benefits that  must be provided in order to satisfy requirements.

In other states, the required minimum quantity is not a  specified dollar amount or percentage. For example, Mississippi requires  that, to be exempt from property tax, hospitals must maintain at least one  ward for charity patients.
