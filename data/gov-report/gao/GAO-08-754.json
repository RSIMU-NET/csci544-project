First, nearly 40,000 military peacekeepers have been trained and some training equipment has been provided. However, State is unlikely to meet the goal of training 75,000 military peacekeepers by 2010 and has encountered problems in accounting for the delivery of training equipment to countries. Second, State supports an equipment depot in Africa and has supplied equipment for missions in Haiti, Lebanon, Somalia, and Sudan, but has been delayed in providing some equipment in support of these missions. Third, State and DOD have trained 2,700 military peacekeeping instructors, conducted several multinational peacekeeping exercises, and refurbished some training centers. However, State has targeted a smaller share of resources to build peacekeeping skills and infrastructure than for training and equipping peacekeepers in Africa in comparison to other regions, in part due to needs and capabilities of the region and a focus on training African peacekeepers for current missions. Of the $98 million State has spent in Africa, 12 percent was spent on building skills and infrastructure needed for long-term peacekeeping capabilities, compared to 20 percent to 51 percent in other regions. While 56 percent of trained military peacekeepers--primarily from Africa--have deployed to peacekeeping missions, State faces challenges in assessing the proficiency of trained peacekeepers against standard skills taught in training and accounting for the activities of trained instructors. Although GPOI training standards follow U.S. military doctrine and United Nations requirements, State does not have a program-wide standard to assess the proficiency of military peacekeepers in skills taught. Further, State is unable to fully account for the training activities of the trained instructors. Collectively, these program limitations result in State's inability to assess the overall outcomes of its program in providing high-quality, effective training. State, in consultation with DOD, has selected 52 partner countries that generally meet program criteria, but in some cases State did not screen trainees for human rights abuses. For 24 countries, State's human rights reporting identified documented human rights violations by security forces in 2007, and GAO found that peacekeepers were not always screened or were not properly screened for human rights abuses. For example, we found that 81 individuals from one country received military training but were not screened for human rights violations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Peace support operations throughout the world have grown from 4 United  Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations in 1988 to 17 in 2008; more than  half of these missions began in the last 10 years.

Training is focused on providing  peacekeeping skills to military units to assist preparation for deployment  to a specific peacekeeping mission and is intended to supplement training  already provided by the partner country. According to GPOI strategy and  agency officials, GPOI implementers use relevant U.S. military doctrine to  develop training instruction for military tasks. As displayed in table 2,  training for these military units includes categories such as tactical skills  for peacekeeping, medical care issues, and interaction with civilian groups  and organizations, which contain a variety of peacekeeping tasks. For  example, DOD and State provide instruction on tactical peacekeeping  tasks such as how to escort a convoy, conduct checkpoint operations, or  guard fixed sites. In addition, training of military peacekeepers in Africa  may include instruction on firearms safety and marksmanship when  training in such skills is identified as a need of that unit or country\u2019s  military peacekeepers.

According to training documents, after  receiving instruction in tactical peacekeeping tasks, trainees perform the  task as a unit, and the instructors are to observe their performance and  determine how the unit is performing against a standard checklist of items.  For example, during an exercise for securing a distribution site,  instructors will observe the training to judge if the unit follows proper  procedures to control a crowd, set up checkpoints and observation points  for the distribution area, and report incident information. Trainers in  Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal stated that the intent of the training is to  expose students to the tasks they need for peacekeeping, although they  are not expected to achieve a specific level of proficiency in the skills  taught. Military troops from Ghana and Senegal account for 44 percent of  the deployed GPOI-trained troops.

For example, three G8 nations have provided instructors to the COESPU,  according to State and COESPU officials. In another example, countries  have provided equipment to support the troops deployed to peacekeeping  missions. Contributions of G8 nations are largely for activities in Africa or  in support of peacekeeping missions in this region, according to State  documents. According to State, in 2007, the G8 and other nations  identified 760 peacekeeping-related programs, events, and activities that  member states were conducting in Africa alone.", "The G8 and other nations also have directly contributed to the U.S. GPOI  program. According to State, 19 countries have contributed to the U.S.  program, primarily by providing training instructors to support GPOI- funded training. For example, 4 countries provided instructors to the  Central American peacekeeper training school in Guatemala and 14  countries provided instructors to the multilateral peacekeeper training  exercises held in Mongolia in 2006 and 2007. State paid travel costs for all  the training instructors for the Central American training. For the  Mongolia exercises, seven countries paid their own way, and State and  DOD paid for the remaining countries.", "Two countries also have provided funding and personnel support directly  to State for GPOI. Specifically, the Netherlands has committed to provide  State with $7 million per year for 3 years, to be used for peacekeeping  training and equipment activities in Africa. According to State officials,  about $5.3 million was received at the end of 2007, and they expect to  receive the remaining $1.7 million for 2007 in the near term.

State asserts that GPOI is on track to meet its objectives with over  35,000 peacekeepers deployed to 18 peacekeeping operations.  We  disagree that 35,000 peacekeepers have deployed to 18 missions with  the training or support of GPOI.  State\u2019s assertion conflicts with GPOI  evaluation team data that identified 22,000 peacekeepers trained by  GPOI that deployed to 12 UN or AU missions, as well as other missions  not supported by the UN or AU, as of April 2008.  State\u2019s statistics  include peacekeepers GPOI trained that have not deployed, supported  but not trained by GPOI, or troops deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan  (non-UN missions).  Appendix IV provides additional information on  the peacekeeper deployments of GPOI partners.  2.  State asserts that GPOI objectives will be achieved under the current  conditions and within projected resource levels.  We disagree with this  assessment because according to State\u2019s own training projections it is  not likely to train 75,000 military peacekeepers by 2010, faces delays in  providing support of nonlethal equipment to deployed peacekeepers,  and is unlikely to complete planned skills and infrastructure activities  in Africa by 2010.  In addition, State has not provided additional  support for requested staff positions at COESPU that would facilitate  the evaluation of progress made at COESPU.  3.  State now projects that GPOI will train 75,000 peacekeepers by the  third quarter of 2010 based on new training rates and asserts that we  do not provide a realistic projection.  We were unable to validate this  information.  As of April 2008, the number of military peacekeepers  trained is lower than the target number needed to meet the goal of  75,000 by the end of 2010. As recently as May 2008, officials from the  GPOI office in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and its GPOI  evaluation team indicated that slow expenditure rates related to  training rates would delay their efforts to reach the goal by 2010.  Accordingly, we are unable to validate State\u2019s new projections  provided in its comments to this report.  4.  State asserts that it has contributed $10.5 million to COESPU and plans  to provide an additional $4.5 million.  We disagree that this is a  contribution already provided to COESPU. State has obligated $15  million for COESPU, which includes the $10.5 million and $4.5 million,  but has only provided $9 million of that amount to COESPU, according  to State funding data identifying expenditures as of April 2008.  5.  State has stated that the United States established a virtual donors\u2019  coordination mechanism to enable deploying nations to facilitate  donor assistance in transportation and logistics support.  We agree that  a communication system has been established, however, we note that  the mechanism for facilitating this support is an e-mail system.  We  also note that the system was established in the fall of 2007 and that, as  of April 2008, only one request had been communicated by State to  donors through this system, according to the State officials responsible  for this system.  6.  State presents information on a number of activities that it asserts  were conducted under GPOI to improve the capabilities of regional  organizations to plan, train for, and execute peacekeeping missions.   We disagree that GPOI has conducted all of these activities and believe  that the activities listed in State\u2019s comment include a combination of  planned and completed activities.  In appendix VI we have presented  the GPOI activities that have been completed to build skills and  infrastructure for peacekeeping in support of the GPOI objective to  assist partners in achieving self-sufficiency and maintaining GPOI  proficiencies.  The information we have presented was obtained from  expenditure information and data provided by the GPOI assessment  team and GPOI program office. To confirm activities that were  completed as of April 2008, we crosschecked reported information by  the GPOI program with GPOI program implementers responsible for  implementing these activities, including the Africa Bureau and its  ACOTA program, and U.S. African, Pacific, and Southern Commands.  7.  State asserts that methods already exist for evaluating the quality of  training and measuring the proficiency of trainees in critical skills.  We  disagree that these methods address our recommendation.  State has  not developed military task lists and associated training that can be  applied at all GPOI training sites, although the GPOI strategy in 2006  identified the need for the development of military task lists and  related military training standards to contribute to standardization,  interoperability, and sustainability, and to ensure the proper use of  resources.  The strategy also indicated that developing such standards  would help efforts to evaluate the overall effectiveness of GPOI  training programs, events, and activities. We assert that there is value  in evaluating the performance of trainees, in the areas where there are  consistencies in the training, against a standard level of proficiency in  the skills taught during their training, in order to identify the quality of  training provided across the program and to identify the proficiency of  trained troops program-wide. We modified the recommendation to  clarify the need for GPOI-wide standards to provide program managers  with the ability to measure proficiency of GPOI-trained troops  program-wide and in accordance with the commitments made in the  GPOI strategy.  8.  State asserts that its process for vetting composite units to prevent  potential recipients from receiving training where there is credible  evidence of committed gross violations of human rights is effective  and that our findings on the vetting of composite units trained under  GPOI are unfairly applied against an updated agency policy on vetting  composite units. We disagree. The seven composite units we identify  in this report were vetted and received training after the policy change  in April 2007.  We identified these units in our review of vetting records  provided by State\u2019s ACOTA office and training rosters of individuals  trained provided by State\u2019s GPOI evaluation team. According to the  data provided by State, three composite units from Niger received  training in August 2007 and November-December 2007, one composite  unit from Nigeria received training in September-October 2007, and  three composite units from Uganda received training in July 2007.   Records for these units indicate that vetting was completed between  June 2007 and November 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["Key contributors to this report include Audrey Solis, Assistant Director;  Monica Brym; Justin Monroe; and Diahanna Post.
