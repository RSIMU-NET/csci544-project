Program data show that caseworkers\u2019 and recipients\u2019 errors occurring during the process of determining eligibility and benefit levels resulted in over $1.8 billion in overpayments in fiscal year 1993. This amount represents a 121-percent increase in overpayments since 1988. In addition, although there are no data available to develop a precise estimate, the number of cases being prosecuted each year suggest that a significant number of the food stamps issued each year are sold or traded for nonfood items\u2014referred to as trafficking\u2014thereby diverting benefits from their intended use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Food Stamp Program Administration", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp Program is administered by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Consumer Service (FCS) in partnership with state and local governments. The Congress established the current Food Stamp Program in 1964 to improve the nutrition of low-income individuals by increasing their food purchasing power. The program is federally designed and generally requires applicants to apply in person at a local food stamp or welfare office and meet numerous program requirements pertaining to their household composition, financial assets, employment requirements, and income to be eligible for monthly benefits. Benefits are generally provided in the form of food stamp coupons, which are issued to recipients in person or by mail. Recipients then use their coupons to purchase food items at stores that have been authorized by FCS to redeem food stamps. Retailers deposit redeemed food stamps at financial institutions and are credited for their sales. Financial institutions then forward the redeemed stamps for credit through the banking system to the Federal Reserve\u2014which destroys the coupons.", "The Food Stamp Program is the cornerstone of USDA\u2019s food assistance programs, providing more benefits than all other federal food assistance programs combined. Although the household is the base unit to which food stamp benefits are issued, most of the people who benefit from the program are children or elderly persons. In addition, more than 20 percent of recipient households have some earnings from work, making the program a critical source of nutritional support for the nation\u2019s working poor."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Role", "paragraphs": ["The federal government funds all food stamp benefits and shares with the states in the administrative costs of distributing benefits to eligible recipients. The federal government pays all costs for printing the stamps, distributing the stamps to the states, and destroying the stamps after they are used. The government also pays all costs associated with approving and monitoring food stores authorized to redeem food stamps. In addition, the government pays roughly 50 percent of the costs incurred by the states in administering the program. These costs include certifying recipients for eligibility, distributing benefits to recipients, and conducting quality control activities.", "FCS prepares Food Stamp Program regulations and provides technical assistance to the states. In addition, as part of its oversight responsibilities, FCS has established a Quality Control (QC) System to monitor states\u2019 determinations of individuals\u2019 eligibility for benefits and the level of those benefits. Under the QC System, states are required to review a sample of their food stamp cases to test the accuracy of eligibility and benefit level determinations made by their caseworkers. The states\u2019 error rate findings, a combination of overpayments and underpayments, are provided to FCS. FCS then reviews a subsample of each state\u2019s sample to ensure the quality of their efforts. After disagreements with the states\u2019 reported error rates are resolved, FCS determines the official error rate for each state. If a state\u2019s combined error rate (both overpayments and underpayments) exceeds a national tolerance level, calculated by FCS, then the state can be required to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the erroneous payments. On the other hand, if a state\u2019s combined error rate is less than 6 percent, the state may be eligible for enhanced federal funding.", "FCS is also responsible for authorizing stores to redeem food stamps and for monitoring stores to ensure that they comply with Food Stamp Program regulations. Store owners suspected of engaging in food stamp trafficking or abusing other program regulations are referred to FCS\u2019 Compliance Branch for investigation. In addition to FCS\u2019 oversight activities, USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigates retailers involved in illegally using food stamp coupons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Role", "paragraphs": ["States have primary responsibility for the day-to-day administration and operation of the Food Stamp Program. Generally, a state welfare agency operates the program either directly or by delegating these responsibilities to a local government agency.

However, recipients must report changes in income, in the composition of their household, or other pertinent information as changes occur during the certification period. On the basis of reported changes, caseworkers make adjustments to the benefit amounts provided to the recipients.", "The states also share in responsibilities regarding the integrity of the Food Stamp Program. Specifically, states are responsible for investigating and prosecuting individuals suspected of falsifying information in order to obtain food stamps and misusing their benefits\u2014such as selling their benefits for cash or trading them for other nonfood items.

In 1990, we reported that reducing certain major types of overpayment errors, such as those associated with recipients\u2019 income, was very difficult for the states because state caseworkers did not have access to the information necessary to prevent these errors.", "In our most recent report and testimony on food stamp fraud before the House Agriculture Committee, we pointed out that the rate of overpayment errors had increased significantly in recent years and that by fiscal year 1993 overpayments exceeded $1.8 billion. We also noted that 42 percent of the overpayments resulted from errors made by state and local caseworkers in determining recipients\u2019 eligibility and benefit levels. We also reported that 58 percent of the overpayments were the result of recipients\u2019 errors in reporting information to caseworkers at the time of application for benefits, or in updating information on changes in a recipients\u2019 household during the certification period. Of the fiscal year 1993 recipient-caused overpayment errors, about 60 percent were judged by state QC officials to have been inadvertent errors while about 40 percent were judged to have been deliberate, or suspected fraudulent, misrepresentations by the recipient in reporting household information.", "Furthermore, we reported that, according to FCS\u2019 QC System data, about two-thirds of the overpayments occurring in 1993\u2014regardless of whether the overpayment was caseworker- or recipient-caused\u2014were linked to errors related to recipient income.

We then interviewed FCS and state officials to determine how the program was being implemented on a day-to-day basis. In accomplishing this step, we met with FCS officials at headquarters and at three of its seven regional offices. We also met with FCS field office officials in each of the three regional offices.", "In addition to the FCS officials, we met with state and local agency officials responsible for operating the Food Stamp Program in seven states\u2014all located within the three FCS regions we visited. Four of the states selected\u2014Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and South Carolina\u2014were selected for review because they have been extremely successful in reducing error rates in recent years, and we wanted to learn how these states had lowered their error rates. South Carolina reduced its overpayment error rate from 11.66 percent in fiscal year 1986 to 7.87 percent in fiscal year 1993. Massachusetts reduced its overpayment error rate from 10.88 percent in fiscal year 1990 to 4.45 percent in fiscal year 1993. Louisiana\u2019s overpayment rate was 9.48 percent in fiscal year 1989, but by fiscal year 1993 the state had lowered the rate to 6.88 percent.

We also reviewed USDA OIG reports on why overpayment errors occur and what is being done to reduce these errors. We discussed overpayment issues with appropriate officials and obtained their opinions on why food stamp overpayments occur and what can be done to reduce overpayment errors. We also reviewed various state performance reporting data, including food stamp quality control reviews, management evaluations, and assessed how successful the states have been in reducing their overpayments. Additionally, we discussed food stamp overpayments and error-reduction activities with representatives from the American Public Welfare Association because of their interest in the Food Stamp Program.", "In Florida, New York, and Texas, we visited two local offices responsible for operating the program in each state. In Florida, we visited two state district offices\u2014Miami and Orlando\u2014having high food stamp caseloads and overpayment error rates.

This effort involved visits to not only the three regional offices responsible for the states included in our review but also eight FCS field offices within these regions.

States have taken a number of actions to reduce caseworkers\u2019 errors.

These reasons include the following:", "There has been a substantial increase in program recipients in recent years. Between July 1989 and March 1994, the number of individuals participating in the Food Stamp Program rose by 51 percent. The caseload growth has occurred at a time when states have been unable to hire additional staff to handle the increased workload. Stretched resources have caused the workload of caseworkers to increase drastically.", "A high turnover of caseworkers causes state and local offices to have less experienced staff. High caseloads, stress, and low salaries have led to attrition.", "Complex Food Stamp Program regulations contribute to confusion in determining eligibility, which leads to errors.", "There are differing eligibility and benefit requirements for the various welfare programs caseworkers are tasked with administering. For example, caseworkers often authorize recipients for multiple programs, including food stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid. Inadequately trained caseworkers and poor supervision lead to errors.", "FCS officials believe that some states place a lower priority on the Food Stamp Program than on other programs they administer and commit less effort to reducing food stamp overpayments. This is because the federal government pays the entire amount of food stamp benefits, whereas in some other programs\u2014such as AFDC\u2014costs are shared. FCS and state officials also told us that competing demands of other social programs often affect a state\u2019s ability to focus adequate people and resources on Food Stamp Program administration.", "Of all these factors, state officials that we visited cited (1) the complexity of the Food Stamp Program regulations and (2) the differences between the Food Stamp Program regulations and the AFDC regulations as the primary causes of caseworkers\u2019 errors. The officials believe that the program in itself is one of the more complex federal welfare programs and that caseworkers are prone to make mistakes when determining applicants\u2019 eligibility and benefit levels.", "The officials explained that in many states, the same caseworkers handle both AFDC and food stamp cases. They said that the probability of errors increases when caseworkers are responsible for processing applicants for both food stamp benefits and other benefit programs\u2014particularly AFDC because of the differences in the eligibility rules and benefit levels between programs. For example, caseworkers must take into account liquid assets, household income, and household size when determining eligibility and benefits for both the Food Stamp Program and AFDC. However, the treatment of this basic information differs for both programs. With regard to liquid assets, AFDC allows a family to possess assets of $1,000, whereas the Food Stamp Program sets the maximum asset limit at $2,000 per household ($3,000 for households with an elderly member). The treatment of vehicles also is different. AFDC calculates the equity value of a vehicle and excludes the first $1,500 from assets; however, the Food Stamp Program calculates the fair market value and excludes the first $4,550. While both programs allow vehicles to be exempted from the eligibility and benefit determination process, the criterion for exempting vehicles is not the same for both programs.", "Also, the definition of a food stamp beneficiary unit and an AFDC beneficiary unit differ. The basic food stamp beneficiary unit is the household. A food stamp household can either be an individual living alone or several individuals living together who customarily purchase food and prepare meals together. Individuals who are members of the same household must apply together, and the income, expenses, and assets of all members are counted in determining the household\u2019s eligibility and benefit allotment. Conversely, the AFDC beneficiary unit is defined as being made up of at least one dependent child, the child\u2019s parents and siblings (by blood or adoption), and possibly other caretaker relatives living with the child and/or family. For example, a mother, her two children, and a nonfamily-related companion live and prepare meals together. For the Food Stamp Program, all four people are included in the household, and the household\u2019s total expenses and income, including the companion\u2019s, are counted. The AFDC assistance unit would be the mother and her two children. The companion\u2019s income would not be included in determining AFDC benefits.", "In the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624), the Congress authorized a Welfare Simplification and Coordination Advisory Committee to review the federal government\u2019s four major assistance programs\u2014food stamps, AFDC, Medicaid, and housing. In its report, one of the committee\u2019s objectives was to examine the difficulties experienced by program administrators in providing timely benefits efficiently to all who are qualified to receive them. In its June 1993 report to the Congress, the committee recommended establishing uniform rules and definitions to be used by all needs-based programs in making their eligibility determinations, including: common definitions of countable income, allowable deductions, resources, and household composition. The report identifies 57 differences between the Food Stamp and AFDC Programs that were compiled by program administrators with the help of the American Public Welfare Association. According to the committee report, some of the differences are rooted in statute and only congressional action can eliminate them.

The form outlines the civil and criminal penalties for hiding or providing false information.", "State and local government officials that we talked with said that recipients do not report changes in their households for a variety of reasons. For example, some recipients have difficulty in understanding the Food Stamp Program requirements. Furthermore, recipients receiving both food stamp and AFDC benefits often confuse the different reporting requirements for each program. Second, some recipients wait until their recertification interviews to report changes to caseworkers. Third, the recipients do not have time to report changes to the office or are unable to get through to a caseworker when they try to report changes by telephone.

The system contains earned and unearned income information, such as unemployment compensation and Internal Revenue Service information, maintained by federal and state agencies. FCS requires state agencies to periodically compare their food stamp case income information with information contained on IEVS. The data-matching process helps verify reported income, and it helps identify income that the applicant failed to report.", "State officials told us that while the system enables them to match recipient\u2019s names with wage reports, its use is reduced because the information is not timely. Under the system, employers report earnings information to the states on a quarterly basis. Thus, employment information from the IEVS is usually 3 to 6 months old at the time the applicant applies for food stamps; accordingly, caseworkers are not always able to prevent errors at the time of certification. However, caseworkers are able to use the IEVS to detect discrepancies in income later in the certification period and avoid further overpayments.", "Some states are working to provide caseworkers with better information to help them verify recipient information. For example, in 1993, Massachusetts began requiring all employers to report to the state all new employees within 14 days of their hiring. Unreported employment was the state\u2019s biggest single error leading to overpayments. With this requirement, food stamp officials are now matching their recipient data base with the state\u2019s Department of Revenue employment information. Because the computer matches are done after certification, the matching does not prevent recipients who do not report employment from receiving benefits. However, it does detect the unreported employment quicker thereby lowering the length of time recipients get overpayments and the state\u2019s error rate. As a result of the state\u2019s effort, recipients\u2019 errors caused by misreported wages and salaries dropped from 8.6 percent in fiscal year 1992 to 2.7 percent in fiscal year 1993.", "Some states have better access to recipients\u2019 bank records for verifying recipient information. For example, New York and Massachusetts both require banks to provide the state with recipients\u2019 bank records at no cost. New York caseworkers contact several local banks to verify recipient asset information. Massachusetts has been able to conduct computer matches of recipient-reported data with bank records to verify asset information provided by recipients. We noted in Massachusetts that there were no reported asset overpayments in the first 9 months of fiscal year 1994. Officials in South Carolina told us that they do not have the authority to obtain recipients\u2019 bank records at no cost.

With each revision, different combinations of incentives and sanctions to reduce errors, as well as different approaches to determine sanctionable error rates, have been adopted. Sanctions have included a state returning a portion of the benefits issued or reducing a state\u2019s reimbursements for administering the program. Incentives have included the opportunity for states to earn additional, and differing, percentages of administrative funds for low error rates\u2014depending on the level of error rate achieved. In addition to changing incentives and sanctions, the method for determining error rates has changed. For example, previously only overpayment errors were used to calculate error rates, later, the Congress directed that both overpayment and underpayment errors be used to determine state error rates.", "The Congress has varied the way in which sanctionable error rates are determined. In the early 1980s, the Congress established specific numerical target error rates that states were to achieve to avoid sanctions. Later, the Congress allowed the sanctionable error rate to be determined by averaging the error rate experiences of the states. In 1988, the Congress used the lowest annual national error rate ever achieved plus 1 percent as the baseline for determining sanctions. States exceeding this tolerance level were required to repay a percentage of benefits issued equal to the percentage amount that they exceeded the tolerance level. Later, in 1993, the Congress changed the sanctionable error rate from the lowest national annual error rate ever achieved to an error rate based on the national average for the current year. A state sanction is calculated based on the degree the state exceeds the sanction. There is no 1 percentage point tolerance; however, the determination of the sanction is based on a sliding-scale calculation. This sliding-scale method of calculating the sanction has the effect of reducing the amount of sanctions for states near the national tolerance level while increasing the sanction for states exceeding the tolerance by a greater margin.", "FCS data indicate that congressional efforts to reduce errors have produced limited results.

While these initiatives are steps in the right direction to improving payment accuracy, it is difficult to determine if they will be sufficient to motivate states to do a better job in determining recipients\u2019 eligibility and benefit payments and the bottom-line impact they will have on reducing overpayments.

Table 3.1 shows the number of stores that the Compliance Branch investigated during the past 5 years.", "As table 3.1 shows, there has been a decline in the number of stores investigated during this 5-year period. Compliance Branch officials told us that staff limitations have prevented them from investigating all retailers suspected of program violations. However, table 3.1 shows that the number of stores found to be trafficking increased from 358 in fiscal year 1990 to 902 in fiscal year 1994.", "In instances where large amounts of food stamps are suspected of being trafficked, the Compliance Branch refers these cases to the USDA OIG for criminal investigation. The OIG also receives referrals from citizens and local law enforcement officials. OIG officials in two regions told us that they investigate about 10 percent of the cases referred to them by the Compliance Branch and other sources. OIG information shows that its food stamp investigation caseload has fluctuated between 1990 and 1994, but the amount of OIG time spent investigating these cases has steadily increased from 35 to 45 percent of their investigative workload over the same time period.", "FCS and OIG officials told us that civil and criminal investigations are very resource-intensive and that, due to a shortage of investigators, many suspect stores are not investigated for program violations such as trafficking. Furthermore, field office personnel tell us that they refer only the most significant cases for investigation to the Compliance Branch. According to field office officials, no records are kept of the number of potential cases not referred for investigation.

The statement called for several legislative changes to help identify unscrupulous retailers during the authorization process and keep them from defrauding the program. While these proposed legislative changes should help improve retailer integrity in the program, they do not address the problem of insufficient staff to authorize and monitor stores and pursue investigations of retailers suspected of violating program regulations.", "Some of the major legislative changes requested include: requiring retailers to provide sales and income tax filing documents when applying for authorization along with permission for FCS to verify such information with other agencies; requiring a 6-month waiting period before reapplication by a store that does not meet initial eligibility criteria; allowing FCS to set time limits for retailer authorization, including shorter authorization periods for questionable retailers; suspending stores charged with trafficking while their cases are pending administrative or judicial review thereby preventing them from continuing to abuse the program during the appeals process; suspending stores charged with trafficking on the basis of electronic benefit transfer transaction data; expanding forfeiture authority to allow the seizure of property used by traffickers in felony food stamp transactions of $5,000 or more, including property gained with the proceeds of illegal transactions; permitting permanent disqualification of retailers who intentionally falsify their applications; increasing the penalties for recipient trafficking; and disqualifying stores from participating in the Food Stamp Program that have been disqualified from participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.", "In addition to seeking legislative changes, FCS plans to expand retailer monitoring capabilities for states using EBT technologies to deliver food stamp benefits. FCS is currently testing the use of automated EBT exception reports to identify suspicious transaction patterns by retailers and recipients. By the end of 1995, FCS expects to have in place an automated system for analyzing EBT transaction data and producing exception reports of suspected violators for all states with EBT operations. FCS is also providing states that use EBT a checklist for evaluating retailer\u2019s eligibility while installing EBT terminals in the store. Also, FCS is requesting authority to share retailer-provided social security and employer identification numbers with state investigative and law enforcement agencies in order to detect illegal retailer activity.", "The Personal Responsibility Act (H.R. 4) includes provisions giving FCS a number of the authorities it has requested. While these authorities should help FCS\u2019 enforcement capabilities, on-site visits to retailers applying for authorization to redeem food stamp benefits is crucial to preventing unscrupulous retailers from being authorized to accept food stamps. The proposed act also provides for on-site visits of food stores by FCS or state or local officials before stores are authorized to redeem food stamps. However, neither the act, nor FCS, address the issue of monitoring retailers once stores are authorized to participate in the program nor does either address the need for additional resources to investigate retailers suspected of violating program regulations.", "FCS has indicated that it has plans to increase the monitoring of retailers, but it has not specifically said how these plans will be carried out nor what resources will be needed to implement them. To the extent that FCS may be required to make preauthorization store visits, and/or decide to increase its efforts to monitor and investigate retailers, it will need to reassess its resource needs and allocations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements in the Monitoring of Retailers Should Help Reduce Recipient Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["Detecting and preventing recipient trafficking is normally the responsibility of the states under Food Stamp Program regulations. State and federal officials told us that with 27 million recipients in 11 million households currently receiving food stamp benefits, the costs of preventing individual recipients from trafficking exceeds the cost of the benefits being trafficked. The officials believe that recipient food stamp trafficking is widespread, but they have no data to verify this belief. Because of the difficulties in detecting recipient trafficking\u2014and the cost involved to do so\u2014state officials told us that they generally do not pursue recipient trafficking. Some state program officials prefer to focus their limited resources on preventing, detecting, and prosecuting violating stores, which they believe will have a greater impact on reducing total recipient trafficking than by attempting to pursue violators individually.", "While reducing the number of violating stores will not completely eliminate recipient trafficking, making it more difficult to find sources for trafficking food coupons will discourage the illegal use of food stamps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of whether food stamp benefits are issued in the form of coupons, electronically through electric benefit transfer technologies, or in the form of cash, some unknown number of the approximately 27 million recipients are going to use their benefits for other than the intended purpose of buying food. Controlling the misuse of benefits can be a costly undertaking requiring a significant amount of resources at the federal and state levels.", "An effective approach for controlling trafficking is to root out retailers that redeem food stamps for other than legitimate food items. The 209,000 stores authorized to redeem food stamps represent the only gateways through which food stamp coupons can enter the banking system and be redeemed by the federal government. Without these gateways, recipient traffickers as well as other third-party traffickers have no means to \u201credeem\u201d their coupons for nonfood purposes. Thus, reducing the number of retailers that traffic food stamps would close the gateways by which illegally used benefits make their way back to the banking system for redemption. Furthermore, monitoring and controlling the 209,000 retailers is easier than trying to monitor and control the behavior of approximately 27 million recipients.", "FCS is pursuing several initiatives to improve its authorizing and monitoring of retailers, including requesting additional legislative authorities, and thereby reduce food stamp trafficking. The Personal Responsibility Act includes provisions giving FCS a number of the authorities requested. While the proposed changes would be beneficial, they do not address the resources needed to perform on-site visits at the time of retailer authorization or for monitoring visits after authorization.

Moreover, the agency believes that its antifraud proposals will help ensure that only legitimate stores are authorized to redeem food stamps.", "We agree that USDA\u2019s initiatives should help deter retailer trafficking of food stamps. However, we believe that it is important to consider that the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s legislative proposals in reducing trafficking is unproven at this time and will not be known until some time in the future. Also, we do not believe that the use of electronic benefit transfer systems will necessarily eliminate the need to conduct store visits. Instead, it will serve as a valuable supplementary tool in the effort to reduce trafficking. Furthermore, the implementation of electronic benefit systems is in its infancy, and nationwide implementation will not be completed for several years. In this context, we continue to believe that on-site visits to retailers should be included in any overall strategy to increase retailer integrity and that the Food and Consumer Service should take the necessary steps to ensure that such visits are made."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
