As the earth rotates  beneath it, each polar-orbiting satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. In contrast, geostationary satellites maintain a fixed position  relative to the earth from a high orbit of about 22,300 miles in space.", "Both types of satellites provide a valuable perspective of the environment  and allow observations in areas that may be otherwise unreachable.  Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne observing systems,  satellites have become an indispensable part of monitoring and  forecasting weather and climate. For example, polar-orbiting satellites  provide the data that go into numerical weather prediction models, which  are a primary tool for forecasting weather days in advance\u2014including  forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes, and geostationary  satellites provide the graphical images used to identify current weather  patterns. These weather products and models are used to predict the  potential impact of severe weather so that communities and emergency  managers can help mitigate its effects.

In addition, the government is also relying on data from a European  satellite, called the Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellite  program.", "With the expectation that combining the Polar-orbiting Operational  Environmental Satellite program and the Defense Meteorological Satellite  Program would reduce duplication and result in sizable cost savings, a  May 1994 Presidential Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to  converge the two satellite programs into a single satellite program\u2014the  National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System  (NPOESS)\u2014capable of satisfying both civilian and military requirements.  However, in the years after the program was initiated, NPOESS  encountered significant technical challenges in sensor development,  program cost growth, and schedule delays. Specifically, within 8 years of  the contract\u2019s award, program costs grew by over $8 billion, and launch  schedules were delayed by over 5 years. In addition, as a result of a 2006  restructuring of the program, the agencies reduced the program\u2019s  functionality by decreasing the number of originally planned satellites,  orbits, and instruments.", "Even after this restructuring, however, the program continued to  encounter technical issues, management challenges, schedule delays,  and further cost increases. Therefore, in August 2009, the Executive  Office of the President formed a task force, led by the Office of Science  and Technology Policy, to investigate the management and acquisition  options that would improve the program. As a result of this review, the  Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy announced in  February 2010 that NOAA and DOD would no longer jointly acquire  NPOESS; instead, each agency would plan and acquire its own satellite  system. Specifically, NOAA and NASA would be responsible for the  afternoon orbit, and DOD would be responsible for the early morning  orbit. The partnership with the European satellite agencies for the  midmorning orbit would continue as planned.", "When this decision was announced, NOAA immediately began planning  for a new satellite program in the afternoon orbit\u2014called JPSS\u2014and  DOD began planning for a new satellite program in the morning orbit\u2014 called the Defense Weather Satellite System. NOAA transferred  management responsibilities to its new satellite program, defined its  requirements, and transferred contracts to the new program. Specifically,  NOAA established a program office to guide the development and launch  of the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP)that was developed under NPOESS and managed by the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014as well as the two  planned JPSS satellites, known as JPSS-1 and JPSS-2. NOAA also  worked with NASA to establish its program office to oversee the  acquisition, system engineering, and integration of the satellite program.  By 2011, the two agencies had established separate\u2014but co-located\u2014 JPSS program offices, each with different roles and responsibilities.", "In addition, DOD established its Defense Weather Satellite System  program office, started defining its requirements, and modified contracts  to reflect the new program. These efforts, however, have been halted.

However, since it relies on NASA\u2019s acquisition experience and  technical expertise to help ensure the success of its programs, NOAA  implemented an integrated program management structure with NASA for  GOES-R. Within the program office, two project offices manage key  components of the GOES-R system. NOAA has entered into an  agreement with NASA to manage the Flight Project Office, including  awarding and managing the spacecraft contract and delivering flight- ready instruments to the spacecraft. The Ground Project Office, managed  by NOAA, oversees the Core Ground System contract and satellite data  product development and distribution.", "NOAA has made a number of changes to the program since 2006,  including the removal of certain satellite data products and a critical  instrument (the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite), and a reduction in  the number of satellites from four to two. NOAA originally decided to  reduce the scope and technical complexity of the GOES-R program  because of the expectation that total costs, which were estimated to be  $6.2 billion, could reach $11.4 billion. Recently, NOAA restored two  satellites to the program\u2019s baseline, making GOES-R a four-satellite  program once again. In February 2011, as part of its fiscal year 2012  budget request, NOAA requested funding to begin development for two  additional satellites in the GOES-R series. The program estimates that  the development for all four satellites in the GOES-R series is to cost  $10.9 billion through 2036. The current anticipated launch date for the  first GOES-R satellite is planned to be in October 2015, with the last  satellite in the series planned for launch in calendar year 2024.", "In September 2010, we reported that as a result of delays to planned  launch dates for the first two satellites in the GOES-R series, NOAA might  not be able to meet its policy of having a backup satellite in orbit at all  times, which could lead to a gap in satellite coverage if an existing  satellite failed prematurely. document plans for the operation of geostationary satellites that included  the implementation procedures, resources, staff roles, and time tables  needed to transition to a single satellite, an international satellite, or other  solution.", "We recommended that NOAA develop and  NOAA has since developed a continuity plan that generally includes the  key elements we recommended.

NOAA is receiving data from the five sensors  on the NPP satellite, and has begun calibration and validation. NOAA\u2019s  satellite data users began to use validated products from one sensor in  May 2012, and NOAA expects that they will increase the amount and  types of data they use in the following months. In addition, NOAA  established initial requirements for the JPSS program in September 2011.  Key components include acquiring and launching JPSS-1 and JPSS-2,  developing and integrating five sensors on the two satellites, finding  alternate host satellites for selected instruments that would not be  accommodated on the JPSS satellites, and providing ground system  support.", "NOAA also developed a cost estimate for the JPSS program, which it  reconciled with an independent cost estimate. Specifically, from January  to December 2011, the agency went through a cost estimating exercise  for the JPSS program. At the end of this exercise, NOAA validated that  the cost of the full set of JPSS functions from fiscal year 2012 through  fiscal year 2028 would be $11.3 billion. After adding the agency\u2019s sunk  costs of $3.3 billion, the program\u2019s life cycle cost estimate totaled $14.6  billion. This amount is $2.7 billion higher than the $11.9 billion estimate  for JPSS when NPOESS was disbanded in 2010.", "Although NOAA has established initial requirements for the program,  these requirements could\u2014and likely will\u2014change in the near future, in  order to limit program costs. In working with the Office of Management  and Budget to develop the president\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget request,  NOAA officials stated that they agreed to fund JPSS at roughly $900  million per year through 2017, to merge funding for two climate sensors  into the JPSS budget, and to cap the JPSS life cycle cost at $12.9 billion  through 2028. Because this cap is $1.7 billion below the expected $14.6  billion life cycle cost of the full program, our report being released today  discusses NOAA\u2019s plans to remove selected elements from the satellite  program. These included NOAA potentially discontinuing the  development of certain sensors, plans for a network of ground-based  receptor stations, planned improvements in the time it takes to obtain  satellite data from JPSS-2, and plans to install a data processing system at two Navy locations. Recently, NOAA briefed us on updated  plans to address this cost cap by changing the way the agency  approached operations and sustainment, and restructuring the free-flyers  project.", "The removal of these elements from the JPSS program will affect both  civilian and military satellite data users. The loss of certain sensors could  cause a break in the over 30-year history of satellite data and would  hinder the efforts of climatologists and meteorologists focusing on  understanding changes in the earth\u2019s ozone coverage and radiation  budget. The loss of ground-based receptor stations means that NOAA may not be able to improve the timeliness of JPSS-2 satellite data from  80 minutes to the current 30 minute requirement, and as a result, weather  forecasters will not be able to update their weather models using the most  recent satellite observations.

If DMSP-19 lasts 6 years, there is a  chance that DMSP-20 will not be launched until 2020. Thus, in a best- case scenario, satellites from the follow-on program will not need to  be launched until roughly 2026. However, civilian and military satellite  experts have expressed concern that the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program satellites are quite old and may not work as  intended. If they do not perform well, DOD could be facing a satellite  data gap in the early morning orbit as early as 2014.", "Midmorning orbit\u2014The European satellite organization plans to  continue to launch MetOp satellites that will provide observations in  the midmorning orbit through October 2021. The organization is also  working to define and gain support for the follow-on program, called  the Eumetsat Polar System-2nd Generation program. However, in  2011, NOAA alerted European officials that, because of the  constrained budgetary environment, they will no longer be able to  provide sensors for the follow-on program. Due to the uncertainty  surrounding the program, there is a chance that the first European  follow-on satellite will not be ready in time to replace the final MetOp  satellite at the end of its expected life. In that case, this orbit, too,  would be in jeopardy.", "Afternoon orbit\u2014There is likely to be a gap in satellite observations  in the afternoon orbit that could last well over one year. According to  our analysis, this gap could span from 17 months to 3 years or more.  In one scenario, NPP would last its full expected 5-year life (to  October 2016), and JPSS-1 would launch as soon as possible (in  March 2017) and undergo on-orbit checkout for a year (until March  2018). In that case, the data gap would extend 17 months. In another  scenario, NPP would last only 3 years as noted by NASA managers  concerned with the workmanship of selected NPP sensors. Assuming  that the JPSS-1 launch occurred, as currently scheduled, in March  2017 and the satellite data was certified for official use by March  2018, this gap would extend for 41 months. Of course, any problems  with JPSS-1 development could delay the launch date and extend the  gap period. Given the history of technical issues and delays in the  development of the NPP sensors and the current technical issues on  the sensors, it is likely that the launch of JPSS-1 will be delayed.  While the scenarios in our analysis demonstrated gaps lasting  between 17 and 53 months, NOAA program officials believe that the  most likely scenario involves a gap lasting 18 to 24 months.", "Figure 1 depicts the polar satellite constellation and the uncertain future  coverage in selected orbits.", "According to NOAA, a data gap would lead to less accurate and timely  weather prediction models used to support weather forecasting, and  advanced warning of extreme events\u2014such as hurricanes, storm surges,  and floods\u2014would be diminished. To illustrate this, the National Weather  Service performed several case studies to demonstrate how its weather  forecasts would have been affected if there were no polar satellite data in  the afternoon orbit. For example, when the polar satellite data were not  used to predict the \u201cSnowmaggedon\u201d winter storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic  coast in February 2010, weather forecasts predicted a less intense storm,  slightly further east, and producing half of the precipitation at 3, 4, and 5  days before the event. Specifically, weather prediction models under- forecasted the amount of snow by at least 10 inches. The agency noted  that this level of degradation in weather forecasts could place lives,  property, and critical infrastructure in danger.", "The NOAA Administrator and other senior executives acknowledge the  risk of a data gap in each of the orbits of the polar satellite constellation  and are working with European and DOD counterparts to coordinate their  respective requirements and plans; however, they have not established  plans for mitigating risks to the polar satellite constellation. NOAA plans to  use older polar satellites to provide some of the necessary data for the  other orbits. However, it is also possible that other governmental,  commercial, or international satellites could supplement the data in each  of the three orbits. For example, foreign nations continue to launch polar- orbiting weather satellites to acquire data such as sea surface  temperatures, sea surface winds, and water vapor.

However, many key  design milestones were completed later than the dates established for  them in December 2007 (when the flight and ground project plans were  established, prior to entering the program\u2019s development phase), and  were also later than the dates established following award of the  contracts for the instruments, spacecraft, and ground system  components. For example, the program\u2019s preliminary design review was  completed 19 months later than planned, and its critical design review is  expected to be completed 13 months later than planned.", "The program has also revised planned milestone dates for certain  components by at least 3 months\u2014and up to 2 years\u2014since its originally  estimated dates.

For example, in early 2011 the  program discovered that the ground project development schedule  included software deliveries from flight project instruments that were not  properly integrated\u2014they had not yet been defined or could not be met.  To address these problems and avoid potential slippages to GOES-R\u2019s  launch date, project officials decided to switch to an approach where  software capabilities could be delivered incrementally. While the revised  plan was to reduce schedule risk with greater schedule flexibility, the plan  was also expected to cost an additional $85 million and introduce other  risks associated with the incremental development such as additional  contractor staff and software development and verification activities that  require government oversight and continuous monitoring.", "So far, NOAA has been able to address certain delays and technical  challenges with an available contingency reserve, in which a portion of  the program\u2019s budget is allocated to mitigate risks and manage problems  as they surface during development, and has not changed its 2007 cost  estimates for the development of the first two program satellites.  However, contractors\u2019 cost estimates for major project components have  increased by $757 million, or 32 percent, between January 2010 and  January 2012. Given the recent increases in contract costs, the program  plans to determine how to cover these increased costs by reducing  resources applied to other areas of program development and support,  delaying scheduled work, or absorbing additional life cycle costs.  Furthermore, as a result of changes in budget reserve allocations and  reserve commitments, the program\u2019s reserves have declined in recent  years from $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion. Between January 2009 and January  2012, the program reported that its reserves fell from 42 percent of  remaining development costs to 29 percent.", "NOAA\u2019s ability to effectively limit milestone delays and component cost  increases depends in part on having an integrated and reliable  programwide schedule\u2014called an integrated master schedule\u2014that  defines, among other things, necessary detailed tasks, when work  activities and milestone events will occur, how resources will be applied,  how long activities will take, and how activities are related to one another.  GOES-R has a programwide integrated master schedule that is created  manually once a month directly from at least nine subordinate contractor  schedules.", "We analyzed four of these subordinate contractor schedules and  discovered instances where certain best practices had been implemented  in the schedules, as well as weaknesses in each schedule when  compared to nine scheduling best practices. When viewed in  conjunction with manual program-level updates, we concluded that the  program-level schedule may not be fully reliable. A full set of analysis  results is listed in table 1.", "Selected schedule weaknesses existed across each of the four schedules  analyzed. For example, each of the contractor schedules either did not  include information on allocation of resources or allocated too much work  to many of its resources. In addition, none of the contractors had  completed usable schedule risk analyses that included risk simulations.  Particularly important is the absence of a valid critical path throughout  all the schedules. Establishing a valid program-level critical path depends  on the resolution of issues with the respective critical paths for the  spacecraft and Core Ground System components. Without a valid critical  path, management cannot determine which delayed tasks will have  detrimental effects on the project finish date.", "The program office has taken specific positive actions that address two of  the scheduling weaknesses we identified. First, the program implemented  a tool that tracks deliverables between the flight and ground projects. This  initiative is intended to address a program-recognized need for better  integration among the program components. Second, the program  conducted a schedule risk analysis designed to identify the probability of  completing a program on its target date. This initiative, while not  addressing risk analyses for component schedules, is intended to  address a program-recognized need to conduct a schedule risk analysis.  In addition, GOES-R officials also stated that they are in the process of  creating an automated process for updating their integrated master  schedule sometime in 2012 and our analysis did find improvements  between July 2011 and December 2011 to weaknesses in each of the  four contractors\u2019 schedules.", "While the program has taken positive steps to improve its scheduling,  weaknesses that have the potential to cause delays nonetheless still exist  as the instruments, spacecraft, and ground project components complete  their design and testing phases. For example, according to program  officials, the Geostationary Lightning Mapper shipment date remains at  risk of a potential slip due to redesign efforts. The current projected  delivery for this instrument is August 2013, leaving only 1 month before it  is on the critical path for GOES-R\u2019s launch readiness date. As another  example, the schedule reserve for the first satellite in the GOES-R series  is being counted on to complete activities for the second satellite in the  series. As a result, delays to certain program schedule targets for the first  satellite could impact milestone commitments for the second satellite.", "The schedule risk analysis conducted by the program indicated that there  is a 48 percent confidence level that the program will meet its current  launch readiness date of October 2015. Program officials plan to consult  with the NOAA Program Management Council to determine the  advisability of moving the launch readiness date to a 70 percent  confidence level for February 2016. Even these confidence levels may  not be reliable, since the establishment of accurate confidence estimates  depends on reliable data that, in turn, results from the implementation of a  full set of scheduling best practices not yet in place in the program.", "Delays in GOES-R\u2019s launch date could impact the continuity of GOES  satellite coverage and could produce milestone delays for subsequent  satellites in the series. Program documentation indicates that there is a  37 percent chance of a gap in the availability of two operational GOES- series satellites at any one time given the current October 2015 launch  readiness date and an orbital testing period, assuming a normal lifespan  for the satellites currently on-orbit. Any delays in the launch readiness  date for GOES-R, which is already at risk due to increasing development  costs and use of program reserves, would further increase the probability  of a gap in satellite continuity.

However, the GOES-R program is not  treating concerns in accordance with its risk management plan, which  considers these to be \u201ccandidate risks\u201d and requires their timely review  and disposition, as evidenced by the many concerns in the database that  were more than 3 months old and had not been assessed or  dispositioned. Unless NOAA follows its risk management plan by  promptly evaluating \u201cconcerns,\u201d it cannot ensure that it is adequately  managing the full set of risks that could impact the program.", "In summary, after spending about $3.3 billion on the now-defunct  NPOESS program, NOAA officials have established a $12.9-billion JPSS  program and made progress in launching NPP, establishing contracts for  the first JPSS satellite, and enhancing the ground systems controlling the  satellites and processing the satellite data. In the coming months,  program officials face changing requirements, technical issues on  individual sensors, key milestones in developing the JPSS satellite, and  important decisions on the spacecraft, launch vehicles, and instruments  that are not included on the JPSS satellite. In addition, NOAA has not  established plans to mitigate the almost certain satellite data gaps in the  afternoon orbit or the potential gaps in the early and mid-morning orbits.  These gaps will likely affect the accuracy and timeliness of weather  predictions and forecasts and could affect lives, property, military  operations, and commerce. Until NOAA identifies its mitigation options, it  may miss opportunities to leverage alternative satellite data sources.", "Completing many of GOES-R\u2019s early design activities is an  accomplishment for this complex program, but this accomplishment has  been accompanied by milestone delays and increased contractor cost  estimates for GOES-R\u2019s components. The unreliability of GOES-R\u2019s  schedules adds further uncertainty as to whether the program will meet its  commitments. NOAA has taken steps to improve schedule reliability, but  until the program implements and uses a full set of schedule best  practices throughout the life of the program, further delays to program  milestones may occur. Moreover, until all contractor and subcontractor  information is included in the program\u2019s integrated master schedule and  regular schedule risk assessments are conducted, program management  may not have timely and relevant information at its disposal for decision  making, undercutting the ability of the program office to manage this high- risk program.", "Chairman Broun, Chairman Harris, Ranking Member Tonko, Ranking  Member Miller, and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my  prepared statement.
