(1) Strategic planning at the corporate level: Strategic planning precedes technology development so managers can gauge market needs, identify the most desirable technologies, and prioritize resources. (2) Gated management reviews: A rigorous process is used to ensure a technology's relevancy and feasibility and enlist product line commitment to use the technologies once the labs are finished maturing them. (3)Corroborating tools: To secure commitment, technology transition agreements solidify and document specific cost, schedule, and performance metrics labs need to meet for transition to occur. Relationship managers address transition issues within the labs and product line teams and across both communities. Meaningful metrics gauge project progress and process effectiveness. Not only does DOD lack the breadth and depth of these techniques, the department routinely accepts high levels of technology risk at the start of major weapon acquisition programs. The acquisition community works with technologies before they are ready to be transitioned and takes on responsibility for technology development and product development concurrently. A defined phase for technology transition is not evident. These shortcomings contribute significantly to DOD's poor cost and schedule outcomes. A stark contrast exists between DOD's and private industry's environments for developing technology. The numerous examples of DOD programs that have incurred cost overruns, schedule delays, and reduced performance serve as reminders that inserting a few best practices and changing the mechanics of technology transition processes without changing the environment that determines incentives may not produce better outcomes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on the technological superiority  of its weapon systems and armed forces to protect U.S. interests at home  and abroad.

In fiscal year 2006, DOD plans to spend approximately $13 billion  in its science and technology efforts to develop technologies that are as  innovative as stealth and global positioning were when they were first  developed. In doing its work, the S&T community must strike a balance  between meeting the short-term needs of today\u2019s warfighters and the long- term needs of future years\u2019 warfighters. Achieving this balance is made  more challenging because of the need to keep pace with or exceed the  pace of innovation and to counter technologies developed by potential  U.S. adversaries.", "Although the United States has produced the best weapons in the world,  its acquisition programs often incur cost overruns, schedule delays, and  performance shortfalls that undermine DOD\u2019s buying power. This dilemma  is due in part to DOD\u2019s difficulty transitioning technologies from a  technology development environment to an acquisition program. Because  the acquisition community frequently pulls technologies too early, it takes  on the additional task of maturing the technologies\u2014an activity that is the  primary responsibility of technology developers\u2014at the start of an  acquisition program. The start of a program ushers in a high-cost,  delivery-oriented phase in which the acquisition community is supposed to  be focused on integrating subsystems and working on system development  and demonstration. DOD has continued to allow the acquisition  community to take over this task before the S&T community considers the  technologies ready for transition. Numerous GAO reports have addressed  the problems of proceeding with immature technologies and have  explained what leading commercial companies do to ward off such  problems.", "This report examines DOD\u2019s technology transition processes through the  prism of best practices. Specifically, our objectives are to (1) identify  techniques that commercial companies use to transition mature  technologies before the start of product development and (2) assess the  extent to which DOD is using these techniques. We also describe how the  environments at private companies and DOD differ with regard to  technology development. The overall effort to hand off and integrate  mature technologies is referred to in this report as technology transition.  Also in this report, the private sector acquisition community is generally  referred to as a product line or business unit. GAO has prepared this  report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct evaluations  on his own initiative as part of a continued effort to assist Congress in  overseeing DOD\u2019s technology and acquisition investments.", "In conducting our work, we interviewed lab and product line managers at  four leading commercial companies\u2014Boeing, IBM, Motorola, and 3M\u2014to  identify processes for successfully transitioning mature technologies.  These companies develop a variety of products such as the 787 airplane,  network servers, integrated radio communications and information  solutions, and fuel cell technology for cars, buses, trains, homes, and  businesses. We also conducted interviews and collected pertinent  documents from each of DOD\u2019s military services and the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is the central  science and technology organization for DOD.

Leading  companies know this and have established disciplined processes to  prioritize their technology investments based on market needs, eliminate  technologies that are not relevant or feasible, balance technology push and  customer pull, and then transition technologies to product development  efficiently. Overall, effective management of technology facilitates the  delivery of new, innovative products to the user in less time. While DOD is  very aware of the need for new advanced technology in its weapon  systems, it has not always been effective in transitioning mature and  relevant technologies to product development.", "Development of DOD\u2019s new weapon systems depends on two distinct  phases: technology development and product development. DOD relies on  its S&T community to identify, pursue, and develop new technologies that  improve and enhance military operations and ensure technological  superiority over adversaries. This includes the development of  technologies for new weapons programs as well as those that will be  inserted into existing systems. The acquisition community takes these new  technologies, develops weapon system programs, and delivers the  products\u2014that is, the weapon systems\u2014to the warfighter.

The budget category of  advanced component development and prototypes involves testing and  evaluating prototypes of systems or subsystems in a high-fidelity or  realistic environment before product development starts. DOD officials  say it is assumed that either the S&T community or the acquisition  community could carry out this work, but traditionally the acquisition side  prevails. After this point, additional technology-related activities are  completed as part of product development under the authority of the  acquisition community, namely, the program manager for a weapon  system.", "Prior GAO reports have said that DOD launches new weapon programs  with immature technology. We found this inability to mature the  technology before the start of product development to be a major  contributor to weapon system cost and schedule growth. In our March  2006 review of 52 major DOD weapon programs, we found that 90 percent  of the programs started with immature technologies. More than half of the  programs were working with immature technologies at design review,  when DOD acquisition policy expects the design to be stable. And by the  time production began, one-third of programs still did not have mature  technologies.", "Not surprisingly, we found that DOD research, development, test, and  evaluation cost estimates increased dramatically for programs having  immature technologies at program start.

Because the cost of developing new and breakthrough technologies  can be high, funding typically comes from the corporate level rather than  from a single product line unit, enabling the company\u2019s product lines to  manage only product development risk, not technology risk as well.", "The central focus of this report is on how the lab and the product line  communities work together to solidify the final steps of technology  transition.

Leading companies organize their research and development  activities into technological \u201cthrusts\u201d, or competencies that represent the  core markets of their businesses. 3M and the other companies we visited  undergo strategic planning at least annually, and this process enables  corporate management to conduct portfolio analysis, identify long-term  market needs, and match the projects in each thrust area to market needs.  Eventually, managers determine which projects appear to be relevant and  feasible, which ones are applicable for which products, whether the right  projects are getting the right resources, whether the company wants to be  first to market, and whether the final products should be released to the  marketplace as soon as possible or several years down the road. Managers  may decide to establish new thrust areas as new ideas come to light, rely  on outside suppliers for some technology, or hire new people to fill  technology voids. Projects that no longer are relevant or feasible are  eventually terminated. This type of strategic planning is critical to ensuring  that the right technologies ultimately transition to the right product line in  an economical and timely way.", "Each company we visited funds technology differently, however, all  ensure that funding for early technology projects is protected at the  corporate level and not immediately beholden to product lines. 3M, for  example, has 17 technological thrust areas, and the projects are directly  funded with seed money from the corporate level. IBM receives the  majority of its funding from the corporate level. IBM labs also receive and  manage funding from product lines for specific projects. Both Motorola  and Boeing require business units to fund a portion of lab costs each year  based on their historical usage of lab resources, but the labs have freedom  to use those funds in line with corporate strategy. Decisions are made at  least annually on the composition of projects in the portfolio so it includes  the most relevant and feasible projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leading Companies Use Gated Reviews to Validate Readiness for Technology Transition", "paragraphs": ["After technology projects are selected for funding, they enter the  development \u201cpipeline\u201d where a gated process is used to manage and  oversee technology exploration, development, and transition. At each  gated review, lab managers assess technology progress and ensure that  certain criteria are met before technologies can enter the next stage of  development. The final phase is dedicated to technology transition  activities. The number and names of the gates vary by company, but the  type of information collected and knowledge obtained are similar. For  example, 3M uses a three-gate process, Boeing has a four-gate process,  and Motorola has a five-gate process. Regardless of where the funds came  from\u2014a corporate or a product line unit\u2014labs are responsible for  managing, overseeing, and using the money to fund technology projects  until the projects have transitioned to a product line.

Funding goes to projects that are deemed relevant. Prior to the  gated review, technologists deliver to lab managers a preliminary  assessment of the competitiveness of the technology and a road map for  completion. Technologists must address key deliverables related to such  areas as manufacturing, intellectual property, marketing, life cycle  management, and plans for the next gate.", "Develop gate: Technologists develop prototypes of the project and  measure performance for relevancy and feasibility on an eventual product.  Technologists deepen their understanding of the technology, refine the  technology solution, identify the most attractive market segments for  introducing the technology, and select a product line that will incorporate  the technology into a new product. 3M and Motorola require product line  commitment to transition a technology before the gated review draws  near. This prevents labs from wasting valuable time and resources  developing technologies that product lines do not want. Projects that do  not gain product line commitment will either be terminated or go through  a different process to demonstrate their relevancy and feasibility. Motorola  leadership, for example, has a special program called an early stage  accelerator under which selected projects can obtain funds to build  additional prototypes to demonstrate the value of technology to product  line managers or potential customers. Senior lab managers carefully  monitor these projects through quarterly reviews to determine how they  are progressing. If the project is not making sufficient progress, the project  is quickly terminated so resources can be spent on other projects.", "Transition gate: Technologists demonstrate a prototype in an  operational environment. The product line maintains a \u201ccustomer\u201d role  until managers are confident that the technology will work in the intended  product. Then gradually, the responsibility for funding and further  developing the technology shifts from the lab to the product line. This shift  in responsibility requires up-front and continuous planning by both the lab  and product line communities to ensure a smooth transition. As shown in  figure 5, companies we visited plan for technology transition to occur  prior to program start. This provides product line managers sufficient time  to gain additional knowledge about a technology\u2019s attributes as they are  maturing it to its final form, fit, and function. Product line managers, who  concurrently have been working on the business case for the product, are  able to validate that the technology can be integrated into the preliminary  product design. In addition, they can develop more reliable product  development cost and revenue estimates before they are locked into  needing this technology as a product feature.", "During the transition phase, labs and product lines must complete a  number of activities for transition to go smoothly. For example, labs must  demonstrate that the technology meets product line cost, schedule, and  performance requirements. In addition, production costs must be  identified and acceptable to the product line. According to 3M officials,  past experience has shown that costly manufacturing is a major reason for  product line managers deciding not to transition a technology. Labs must  also address intellectual property concerns, a step that is crucial to the  company\u2019s ability to be a market leader. Product lines must address any  people or organizational issues, such as the transition of jobs and training  requirements that may result from using the new technology. They must  also work out any agreements with the labs for on-going support. At the  end of the phase, technical documentation related to the technology is  transitioned from the labs to the product line.", "Boeing Commercial Airplanes assesses the extent to which these  activities, as well as others, have been completed to determine whether a  particular technology is ready to transition. The information is then  summarized on a scorecard that lab and product line managers can use to  quickly identify areas that need additional attention. The scorecard is  updated continually and measures a technology\u2019s readiness from a  business and production standpoint as well as its technological readiness.  Boeing\u2019s labs have three phases for technology development, which they  call discovery, feasibility, and practicality, plus a technology transition  phase. Each technology is evaluated in 10 readiness categories, and bars  are plotted horizontally across the scorecard to indicate how much  objective evidence exists for technology readiness. Once a technology has  demonstrated full readiness in all 10 categories, it is ready to be  transitioned. Figure 6 shows a notional picture of a technology\u2019s readiness  at one point in time. Because the hypothetical technology has reached full  readiness in only five categories and is halfway through transition in one  category, the technology is not ready for transition. The lab and product  line would have to address issues involving readiness categories 3, 4, 6 and  9 before transition can begin or the technology is in jeopardy of not being  applied to a product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology Transition Is Bolstered by Formal Agreements, Relationship Managers, and Metrics", "paragraphs": ["Companies we visited use three tools to aid transition, including  technology transition agreements, relationship managers, and metrics.

As figure 7 shows, the  agreements should answer some basic questions.", "These formal agreements may also include identification of product line  resources needed to transition the technology, such as nonrecurring costs  to further mature the technology, as well as consideration of recurring  manufacturing costs associated with integrating the new technology on  the product. Metrics collected in the agreements are used by product line  managers to manage technology risk. For example, if the labs cannot  develop needed technology within cost and schedule parameters or with  specified performance characteristics, the product lines can terminate the  agreement and go with an alternative technology.", "At Motorola, agreements enable technology project leaders to customize  their work for a particular product line\u2019s needs. Product lines may request  that the labs identify alternative technologies for a particular product,  produce a detailed report about a specific technology, or conduct various  tests to demonstrate the relevancy or feasibility of a technology. Each of  these items becomes a \u201cdeliverable\u201d in the agreement. 3M uses transition  agreements only for technologies that are expected to go into a product.  3M\u2019s agreements incorporate many of the same metrics used by Motorola,  including feasibility, relevancy, and application of the technology. In  addition, agreements include an assessment of the product line\u2019s ability  and commitment to transition technology. For example, they evaluate a  product line\u2019s resource constraints that could inhibit a technology from  transitioning, such as asking if the technology is too expensive or if  manufacturing it would be too costly. 3M officials told us that some  agreements include loaning key lab technologists to the product line for a  period of time so product line teams can maintain momentum after the lab  has signed off and moved on to developing technology for other parts of  the company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship Managers", "paragraphs": ["3M, IBM, and Motorola use lab and product line relationship managers to  smooth transition. Relationship managers foster effective transition  practices by preventing the labs from pushing technologies that product  line managers do not want and by preventing product line managers from  pulling immature technologies from the labs.

Altogether, Motorola  has eight executive managers\u2014four in the labs and four on the product  line side. Motorola officials told us that this number provides a one-to-one  match between the labs and the product lines. Lab executive managers are  responsible for ensuring product line needs are identified and new  technology projects are started or existing projects are reprioritized to  meet those needs. Their counterparts have the final word on what priority  each technology project has with respect to the needs of the product line.  Lab and product line executive managers are required to sign off on key  technology projects and milestones for the current year.

Again, there  are four liaisons in the labs and four on the product line side. They are the  primary interface for coordination, collaboration, and communication  during technology development and transition. Liaisons in the lab have  broad oversight of technologies being developed and share information  about technology breakthroughs with their counterparts on the product  line side, and remove roadblocks for lab technologists. These lab liaisons  work intimately with their product line counterparts to approve  technology transition agreements and assess technology readiness. The  lab liaisons oversee 40 to 60 technology transition agreements at any one  time. Liaisons on the product line side are responsible for providing  information about the changing needs of the product lines on a more real- time basis. They determine product line needs and priorities during the  annual planning process and remove roadblocks for technologists on the  product line side. Lab and product line liaisons are incentivized through  their annual performance assessments and pay increases to work together  to ensure the successful transition of technologies.", "The most direct and constant communication is between the lab\u2019s  technologist, who developed the technology, and the product line\u2019s  technologist, who is responsible for maturing the technology for inclusion  into the product. These two technologists stay in continuous contact  because they are the ones who have the most working knowledge about  the technology. The lab technologist is expected to spend as much time as  needed to make sure that transition happens as smoothly as possible.

In addition, it identifies  and tracks the number of lab and product line people (headcount) needed  for development and transition. These metrics are not treated with the  same rigor as metrics that are used after product development begins.  Corporate managers understand that technology development must be  managed with more latitude to accommodate calculated risk taking. In  addition, Motorola asks each product line to fill out satisfaction surveys  twice a year to assess lab performance. Because relationships are at the  heart of the process, the product line\u2019s perceptions are of paramount  importance, making internal customer satisfaction a key metric. A  Motorola official indicated that satisfaction surveys are a ubiquitous part  of the Motorola culture. Not only do they help the labs improve, but they  help the company improve overall, the official said. The surveys also  provide compelling anecdotal information about performance problems  that need to be addressed by certain labs.", "In addition to technology-specific metrics, Boeing tracks the number of  technologies that were actually integrated into products. While the intent  is that all completed technologies will make it into a product, this does not  always happen because of changes in market requirements, timing, or  funding constraints. Boeing also has metrics that assess the technology\u2019s  impact on orders for new airplanes and on its ability to reduce  manufacturing costs. The labs, for example, have a responsibility for  improving the way Boeing designs and builds its products. As such, they  have goals for reducing recurring and nonrecurring costs and cycle time.  Finally, Boeing uses a metric that encourages the transfer of people, along  with the technologies, to the product line side.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the corporate level was more  proactive and provided high-level direction that drove several decisive  technological developments, including stealth; standoff precision strike;  and tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems that  have transformed U.S. military capabilities. Since the 1980\u2019s DDRE has  used a decentralized management approach, relying on the services and  agencies to determine and prioritize the most needed technology projects.  The report states that as a result, the department is not wellpositioned to  implement new operational capabilities needed for future warfighters,  including  identifying and tracking terrorists,   addressing commercialization and globalization issues,  rapidly evolving technologies such as bio- and nanotechnologies, and identifying the proper mix of short- and long-term projects to work on.", "One of the recommendations included in the report is for the  Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to  develop a strategic technology plan and that DDRE be tasked with  assuring that all research and development organizations are  implementing DDRE\u2019s strategic technology guidance. The board also  believes DDRE needs to be more involved in strategic challenges related  to (1) gathering and nurturing technology from a variety of sources,   (2) developing and exploiting technology to enable new disruptive  capabilities; (3) identifying and countering disruptive capabilities  developed by adversaries using readily available or advanced technology,  and (4) ensuring an adequate level of long-term research for DOD needs.  Without effective corporate level leadership, warfighter needs are  addressed in a decentralized, uncoordinated manner, thereby increasing  the risk that the department will not fulfill these needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Use a Disciplined, Gated Process to Test for Relevancy, Feasibility, and Transition Readiness", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s 5000 series acquisition policy specifies that technology  development should be separated from product development and that a  project shall not exit the technology development phase until the  technology has been demonstrated in a relevant environment. This is in  line with the practices we found at leading companies, with the exception  that the companies require technologies to be demonstrated in an  operational environment before program start, which is a higher degree of  readiness. However, the department lacks a structured, gated process for  managing technology development and transition, as well as criteria that  would allow decision makers to know when technology is ready to  progress from the technology development environment into an  acquisition program to begin product development. As a result, the  services continue to launch new programs with immature technologies,  and acquisition programs take on technology development  responsibilities, an activity that is considered too risky for commercial  companies we visited. The following figure shows where the technology  development phase occurs in DOD\u2019s acquisition process and the entrance  and exit criteria for that phase.", "As shown in the figure above, DOD has two phases prior to program start  (also referred to in DOD nomenclature as milestone B). The first is the  concept refinement phase, when acquisition programs refine the initial  concept and develop a technology development strategy that is supposed  to guide activities during the technology development phase. According to  the acquisition policy, the strategy should include    a discussion of the planned acquisition approach, including a summary of  the considerations and rationale concerning the approach;   a discussion of the planned strategy to manage research and development;    a complete description of the first technology demonstration; and    a test plan.", "The policy, however, does not address the role of the S&T community in  designing or supporting a technology development strategy. And according  to S&T officials, their role in this phase is minimal. We recently reported  that DOD skipped a formal milestone meeting that should take place at the  end of the concept refinement phase, referred to as milestone A, for   80 percent of the programs we reviewed. This inhibits the S&T and  acquisition communities\u2019 ability to create a realistic plan for developing  and maturing needed technologies prior to program start and executing a  plan once the program begins.", "During the technology development phase, the acquisition policy calls for  DOD to focus on the development, maturation, and demonstration of the  technologies needed for the capability under consideration. To exit this  phase, technologies should be demonstrated to be sufficiently mature.  DOD defines this as demonstrating technologies in a relevant environment.  (See app. IV for definitions of technology readiness.)", "When comparing the DOD process with that used by commercial  companies we visited, we identified two major differences. First, although  DOD policy states that the S&T community \u201cshall enable rapid, successful  transition \u2026 to useful military products,\u201d there is no defined transition  phase with criteria to facilitate assessment of a technology\u2019s readiness to  transition. Instead, the services have senior-level boards that review  projects on an annual basis to determine if they are on track relative to  cost, schedule, and performance goals set out for the program and rely on  a technology readiness tool to gauge development progress. The reviews  do not include a formal assessment of many of the technical and business  criteria contained in the Boeing scorecard, such as determining if the  costs, benefits, and risk are well understood and technology is affordable.  As a result, program managers often pull a technology from technology  developers before the program manager has the opportunity to validate  that the technology can be integrated into the preliminary product design  and to develop good product development estimates prior to the start of  system development. As stated earlier, commercial companies we visited  had a dedicated phase at the end of the technology development process  for shifting technology responsibilities to their product lines. We recently  reported that almost three-fourths of the programs started since the  acquisition policy was revised in 2000 began with critical technologies that  were not ready for product development. Seven of the nine programs we  reviewed more indepth, about 80 percent, were approved to begin  development even though program officials reported that technologies  were below readiness levels required for entering product development.  This included programs like the Future Combat System and the Joint  Strike Fighter.", "We found DOD generally views immature critical technologies at the  beginning of development as an acceptable risk as long as there is a plan  to mature the technologies by the time the program reaches its design  readiness review. In effect, the department views risk management plans  as an acceptable substitute for demonstrated knowledge. For example, the  Navy\u2019s Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft program had none of its critical  technologies mature at program initiation. Instead of holding the program  to the acquisition policy criteria for entering development, the decision  maker simply directed the Navy to work with the Office of the Secretary of  Defense to implement risk mitigation and technology maturation plans  during the integration phase of system development.", "Second, under DOD\u2019s current funding structure, the transition of  technology\u2014which should occur prior to the beginning of product  development and milestone B\u2014is funded and managed by acquisition  programs. This contrasts with the approach used by commercial  companies, where the lab manages and funds these activities. Commercial  firms find that holding their labs accountable for the management and  funding of technology as it transitions to a new product forces them to  deliver more quickly and efficiently and allows the product lines to focus  on product development and the risks associated with it. Figure 11  illustrates the difference in responsibility.", "As shown above, in the commercial companies we visited, product  developers are allowed to act like customers for emerging technologies;  they are not required to accept, manage, and fund technology risk. This  significantly improves the chances of their products reaching the market  quickly, at predictable cost, and with high quality. In DOD, major weapon  system acquisition programs pull technologies that are not yet ready for a  product in order to meet that product\u2019s requirements. The S&T  community, although still called upon to review technology readiness, has  no funds at stake and is no longer responsible for the risk from technology  at that point. This is a major contributor to the significant cost overruns  and late deliveries of major weapon systems to the warfighter in recent  years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Adopting Transition Tools, but Use Is Not Widespread", "paragraphs": ["DOD is using several tools we found were also being used by commercial  companies to facilitate the transition of technology to weapons programs.  For example, the services are using technology transition agreements for  some of their technology projects, DARPA is using relationship managers  to address transition issues, the services have established boards to  oversee and manage a portion of their technology portfolios, and DOD has  several new programs, including the Joint Capability Technology  Demonstration program to speed a technology\u2019s transition to a weapon  system. However, because of the newness or small amount of funding  associated with these tools, widespread use has yet to occur. We also  found that DOD is using technology-specific and status metrics, but does  not have sufficient measures in place to assess the impact of their  technology investments or technology transition processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technology Transition Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The services have recently begun using technology transition agreements  to formalize technical expectations labs must demonstrate in order for  acquisition programs to transition technologies into their programs. DOD  science and technology officials believe the agreements are a useful way  to hold the technology developers accountable and gauge lab progress  toward meeting technology specifications. We are encouraged by their use  of agreements, particularly in the Navy. Agreements we reviewed,  however, did not contain some of the information or metrics commercial  companies believe is valuable to track, and use thus far has been limited.", "The agreements we reviewed contained some of the same elements  included in agreements used by leading companies we visited, such as a  description of the technology project, key technology developer and  weapon system personnel associated with the project, and specific  performance characteristics that the lab must meet for transition to occur.  In addition, they identify the amount of funding acquisition programs will  have for transition and when that funding will be available. Unlike the  leading companies we visited, however, these agreements did not typically  require the technology developer to demonstrate cost metrics for the  technology to be included in a weapons program. Commercial companies,  for example, include an assessment of manufacturing costs that could be  expected if a technology were to be included on a new product and they  usually demand prototypes of the technology as demonstration of  readiness to transition. A recent Defense Science Board Report  highlighted the importance of addressing manufacturing concerns during  technology development. Excerpts are shown in figure 12.", "We also found that the services\u2019 use of technology transition agreements  has been very limited. For example, we found that the services have a  combined total of 224 applied and advanced technology projects that they  have identified as candidates for transition, of which 146\u2014or about   65 percent\u2014have technology transition agreements. The Navy accounted  for the greatest percentage, with 90 of its 115 projects having an  agreement, almost 80 percent. However, there are hundreds of other  military services applied and advanced technology research projects that  were not selected as candidates where agreements may also be useful. As  stated earlier, commercial companies we visited had agreements for nearly  all technology projects. The agreements were updated at least annually or  sooner if particular tasks were completed. Lab officials use metrics  included in the agreements, as well as other criteria, to determine if the  project should be continued.", "It should also be pointed out that while technology transition agreements  are useful tools for firming weapons program commitment to transition,  they do not guarantee transition success. For example, a Navy official told  us that about one-third of the projects that had been expected to transition  in fiscal year 2005 did not transition for the following reasons:    The technology did not meet the cost parameters required for transition to  occur.", "Weapon system requirements changed, forcing changes to the original  agreement.", "Program offices did not identify dollars in its budget to transition the  technology.", "A program office decided the technology was too risky compared with  current hardware in production.", "Air Force and Army officials told us they do not track information on why  their technologies do not transition. However, they have experienced  similar problems as the Navy. They also stated that some lab technologies  do not transition because prime contractors decide to use technologies  developed in-house, even though DOD technology developers met the  metrics included in the transition agreements. Because agreements are  usually established between the technology developers and program  offices prior to the selection of prime contractors, there is no assurance  that the technologies will transition. Even in cases where a prime  contractor is known, such as for ongoing development programs, the  prime contractor is not a party in the agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship Managers", "paragraphs": ["With the exception of DARPA, DOD does not use relationship managers in  the same manner as leading private companies. According to an Air Force  lab official, relationship managers market technologies being developed by  the labs or gather data about ongoing projects for senior lab management.  Most communication about technology transition in DOD takes place  through integrated product teams or during annual reviews of technology  projects by the senior-level oversight boards for each of the services. Use  of relationship managers for these purposes are helpful, but the managers  do not necessarily serve as points of contact within the labs and  acquisition communities, do not devote time toward efficiently  transitioning technologies to multiple weapon system programs, and do  not help identify and address systemic transition problems.", "Within DARPA, senior officers, called operational liaisons, focus on  marketing and transitioning DARPA-sponsored technologies. According to  the DARPA director, the liaisons have been very helpful with transitioning  technologies because they are well practiced at using the command chain  of their respective services and finding the right service contact at the  right time. The liaisons    provide operational advice for planning and strategy development;    provide an understanding of service perspectives, issues and needs so that  potential customers can be identified and effective agreements can be  written;    draft and coordinate agreements between DARPA and the services; and    direct technology insertion in the services.", "Figure 13 describes the impact that operational liaisons have had on  transitioning a DARPA-sponsored program called Boomerang. We believe  that DARPA\u2019s approach could serve as a model for how the military  services might establish more formal roles for communication between  the S&T and acquisition communities.", "The military services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense have a  variety of programs to help transition technologies to weapons systems or  directly to the warfighter. These programs, some of which are relatively  new and others that have been around for several years, have met with  some success. However, these programs represent a small portion of   $13 billion DOD spends on science and technology development. As such,  they cannot single-handedly overcome transition problems, but rather  demonstrate various ways to ease transition.", "In recent years, each of the military services has established senior-level  boards to oversee technology programs that include advanced and in some  cases applied research projects. This includes the Air Force\u2019s Advanced  Technology Demonstration program, the Army Technology Objectives  program, and the Navy\u2019s Future Naval Capabilities program. The boards,  which are comprised of representatives from the lab, acquisition, and  warfighter communities, are responsible for selecting projects to be  developed, allocating funding to those projects, and reviewing the  projects\u2019 progress on an annual basis. The boards emphasize transition  planning and can address obstacles to successful transition. According to  officials, these programs represent about $1.3 billion of DOD\u2019s S&T  budget.", "The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program and the newly  established Joint Capability Technology Demonstration program were  initiated by DOD as a way to get technologies that meet critical military  needs into the hands of users faster and at less cost than by the traditional  acquisition process. Under these programs, military operators test  prototypes that have already been developed and matured in realistic  settings. If they find the items to have military utility, DOD may choose to  buy additional quantities or just use the items remaining after the  demonstration. Fiscal year 2006 was the first year of a 3- to 5-year period  where the current Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program  will be phased out in favor of the new Joint Capability Technology  Demonstration program. Department officials believe the new joint  program offers improvements over the earlier program in that capabilities  will be demonstrated 1-2 years earlier, there is a greater focus on  combatant command needs during the selection process, and the Office of  the Secretary of Defense provides significantly more funding during the  first 2 years of the demonstration project.", "A big difference between the two programs is that the new joint program  is expected to provide a better path for the transition of technologies  because it includes funding for both advanced technology development  and advanced component development and prototypes. The Advanced  Concept Technology Demonstration program only includes funding for  advanced technology development. It must rely on the acquisition  community to identify advanced component development and prototype  funding for transitioning the technologies. An additional benefit is that the  Office of the Secretary of Defense is partnering with the Naval  Postgraduate School to conduct business case analysis for completed  demonstration projects. This type of analysis is expected to aid decision  makers in evaluating alternative approaches to the allocation of scarce  resources competing for transition funds.", "The Manufacturing Technology Program is aimed at quickly identifying  and solving production problems associated with technology transition. It  focuses on the needs of weapon system programs for affordable, low-risk  development and production. For example, one project, which was given  $730,000, was geared toward improving the reliability and strength of  large-diameter fasteners used to attach various components on the  Seawolf and Virginia Class submarines. Corrosion concerns required that  the existing fasteners be replaced at periodic intervals to preclude  catastrophic failure. Navy and commercial companies evaluated a wide  variety of materials for strength and corrosion resistance to determine the  best candidate material and then adjusted the material manufacturing  process to obtain the required strength and toughness levels to ensure the  fasteners could be produced without extraordinary measures or a  deterioration of the material properties. Among other things, program  officials expect the project to result in cost avoidance of $1.1 million per  fielded submarine per year and improved reliability.", "There are other, smaller programs that also focus on transition. Two of  these are the Foreign Comparative Testing Program, which focuses on  identifying, evaluating, and procuring technologies that have already been  developed and tested in other countries, and the Technology Transition  Initiative, which focuses on speeding the transition of technologies  developed by DOD\u2019s S&T programs into acquisition programs. These  programs received about $37 million and $29 million in fiscal 2006,  respectively. The Foreign Comparative Testing Program, for example,  successfully evaluated a South African mine-protected clearance vehicle  that will protect soldiers from the effects of landmine explosions during  route clearance operations.

However, the services  have few metrics that would enable them to gauge the impact of their  investments and the effectiveness of their processes for developing and  transitioning technology.", "DOD officials told us that establishing good, quantifiable metrics to  measure transition success is difficult to do. Some of the challenges they  face include determining    how long to track a technology after it has transitioned,    how to track and distinguish transition success when the same technology  is used on multiple weapons programs, and   how much credit to take when only portions of a technology transition to a  weapon program.", "Further, DOD S&T officials do not believe that they have enough resources  to track technology once technology developers finish working on a  project. They say that it would be very labor-intensive to track long-term  measures, such as the impact of transitioned technology in terms of cost  savings and improved performance. Instead, the services rely heavily on  projected cost, schedule, and performance improvements that are required  by S&T program management as part of the project selection process.

Examples from past initiatives serve as reminders that just changing the  mechanics of technology transition processes, without changing the  environment that determines incentives, may not produce better  outcomes. Private companies operate in a competitive environment that  demands speedy delivery of innovative, high-quality technologies and  products to satisfy market needs. If the company cannot meet those  criteria, it will cease to exist in that environment. On the other hand, DOD  operates in an environment with a complex variety of \u201ccustomers.\u201d These  complex relationships often hinder the ability of DDRE, its \u201ccorporate\u201d  component, to provide strategic leadership similar to that of the private  company. Success in this environment is often based on a single service\u2019s  ability to launch a program to address critical needs and to secure annual  funding for the program. The challenge for DOD and congressional  decision makers may not lie so much in the \u201chow to\u201d aspects of technology  transition as in creating stronger and more uniform incentives that  encourage the S&T and acquisition communities to work together to  deliver mature technologies to programs.", "Private firms must continually deliver innovative, reliable products to  market very quickly to prosper. The delivery-oriented environment that  private firms live in creates a need for strategic simplicity and directness  from leadership and forces product lines and labs to measure success in  terms of lower costs and increased revenue and market share. The ability  to deliver new, innovative, reliable products of high quality to market as  soon as possible drives revenue and market share. This environment  creates incentives to maintain an efficient technology base that is focused  on market needs and can efficiently transition feasible technologies into  new products, keeping costs down while achieving greater revenues.  Because commercial firms understand that they do not succeed until a  new, innovative product is delivered to the customer, they view successful  transition of technologies to products as a critical part of their value chain.  The corporation, therefore, insists on accountability from and supports its  technology developers with a strong strategic process for ensuring that its  product portfolio is balanced. It does not want too many programs vying  for scarce investment dollars.", "For example, IBM officials stated that poor strategic planning was one of  the problems the company had to address after it incurred an   $8 billion loss in 1992-1993. According to company officials, technologies  no longer could be developed for the sake of development; they had to be  aligned with a product line and have market potential to be funded. IBM  labs now conduct a situation analysis that takes an internal and external  look at technologies being developed and a gap analysis to determine  where IBM might be behind in technology development.", "At 3M, meeting market imperatives is critical and senior leadership has set  a goal to increase sales 5 to 8 percent annually through new products. In  this environment, the company has established a companywide initiative  referred to as 2X/3X. Generally, the goal is to double the number of new  ideas going into the product development pipeline and to triple the market  success of the products coming out of the pipeline.

This is a complex set of deliverables by any  measure. It creates an environment that makes it difficult for DDRE to  lead and has contributed to an undisciplined strategic planning process.  Success in this environment is often based on a service\u2019s ability to launch  a program to address critical needs and to secure annual funding for the  program. It is characterized by fierce competition among the services to  win scarce funding to begin major weapon system acquisition programs,  regardless of the readiness of technologies to meet far-reaching  requirements. As a result, programs are pressured to distinguish  themselves from other programs previously developed by promising new,  enhanced features such as being faster and/or more lethal than anything  else.

Rather than  addressing technology issues in a science and technology environment  before product development starts, acquisition programs carry significant  technology risk into product development. This brings with it a high risk  that costs will rise and deliveries to the warfighter will be delayed. In fact,  there is strong evidence that acquisition programs that start with immature  technologies encounter significantly poorer acquisition outcomes than  others. This approach is in sharp contrast to the approach taken in the  commercial world. High-performing companies solve technology  challenges in the S&T environment. To do this, they have put in place  processes and adopted techniques that are pertinent to DOD. Strong  strategic planning defines critical investment priorities, and a structured  process defines the path towards a technology\u2019s transition to product  development. This transition is supported by technology transition  agreements that hold the research labs accountable for what they must  deliver. They also include clarification of the responsibilities the product  developer has in accepting new technologies. Metrics are used to force  demonstration of relevancy and feasibility at key points in the process and  gauge the success of individual projects and the process itself. Funding for  technology development largely comes from the corporate level, with the  research labs having responsibility for technology development until  technology is matured and transitioned to the product line. This is critical  to success, because it allows product developers to play a customer role.  They are allowed to say no to technologies that are not ready for their  programs and can focus on their job at hand\u2014product integration,  supplier management, and quality.", "DOD has adopted some of these practices. The department has begun  using technology transition agreements and relationship managers and has  initiated programs that place greater emphasis on technology transition  planning. However, the reach of these initiatives is limited, and there is no  unified, corporate approach to using them at this point. We recognize that  the environment and incentives for DOD are very different than those of  commercial firms we visited. For commercial practices to work on a broad  scale, the DOD environment must be conducive for applying such  practices. DOD senior leadership is a critical factor in providing this  direction and vision as well as in maintaining the culture of the  organization. The department must devote greater attention to strategic  planning and technology development processes so that resources are  spent on technologies that can and will be transformed into capabilities  for the warfighter. In addition, the S&T and acquisition communities must  work together to expand the use of technology transition agreements and  relationship managers. Finally, the department should examine the way it  currently funds technology transition. It may benefit from an examination  of commercial companies\u2019 methods in this regard.

We understand the basic differences  in the environments, but believe there are many lessons that can be  gleaned from our commercial visits. While it is true that private companies  are motivated by profit, they can not achieve a profit without being  focused on the timely delivery of products to the market. We note in this  and other best practices reports that commercial firms have significant  pressures on them to deliver cutting edge technologies quickly. They often  bet their very existence on delivering new products and technologies  before anyone else does so. In some cases, such as medical systems, their  customers have urgent, life-or-death needs, similar to those of the  warfighters, that demand very complex technological solutions. The real  difference between these companies and the department is that they  understand the futility of promising more than can be delivered to the  market at any given point. They understand that, in the final analysis, they  only succeed\u2014or survive\u2014only by delivering needed capability. On the  other hand, the department\u2019s acquisition programs consistently accept  immature technologies into product development that become a major  cause of cost increases, schedule delays, and ultimately very late delivery  to the warfighter who needs the equipment.

DOD\u2019s comments appear in appendix II.", "DOD concurred with the recommendation that called for establishing a  gated process for developing and transitioning technologies. In its  response, the department stated that it has a gated process for programs  that have a formal milestone A decision point and that technology maturity  and technology readiness assessments are used in this process. DOD  explained that the technology maturity assessments, in particular, often  lead to risk mitigation plans, which include explicit gates that immature  technologies must pass through to become qualified for adoption.", "We are not confident that DOD\u2019s implementation plans are fully responsive  to this recommendation. First, the department does not have a process  similar to those that we found at commercial companies to actively  manage and make investment decisions across all technologies and  determine if an individual technology is ready to transition. In its  comments, DOD refers to a process for programs beginning at milestone  A. However, we have reported that 80 percent of the programs we  reviewed that passed milestone B since 2000 did not have a milestone A.", "Second, we found that even when technology readiness assessments  indicated that technologies were not ready to be included in an acquisition  program, DOD often decided to use them anyway. Third, risk mitigation  plans used by DOD are subjective engineering judgments and are of  limited value when evaluating the transition readiness of technologies.", "The department also concurred with our recommendation that it expand  the use of technology transition agreements to applied and advanced  development projects. However, in its response, DOD did not identify  specific actions it plans to take to implement this recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with the recommendation that it include  additional metrics in technology transition agreements. In its response, the  department indicated that it has taken steps to incorporate manufacturing  readiness assessments as a means to improve technology readiness and  that any additional metrics should be project-specific and included as exit  criteria as part of the technology transition agreement. We are encouraged  by DOD\u2019s recent development of manufacturing readiness levels and  believe they should be a mandatory tool for the S&T and acquisition  program managers to use to assess the manufacturability of a new  technology. While we agree that the department should develop additional  metrics on a project-by-project basis, we also believe that a more holistic  approach, as depicted earlier in the report, is needed to determine the  transition readiness of a particular technology. Transition readiness is not  solely dependent upon the technical maturity achieved by S&T, but is also  dependent upon the readiness of an acquisition program to accept the new  technology and therefore should include an assessment of other factors  such as cost, benefit, risk, scalability, and acquisition program  endorsement.", "DOD also partially concurred with the recommendation to expand the use  of relationship managers to address systemic transition issues and those  related to specific weapon system programs. In its response, DOD  indicated that it relies on written documents\u2014the technology maturity  assessments and technology transition agreements\u2014to facilitate  communication between the S&T and acquisition communities,  particularly at the executive level. As stated earlier, these documents do  not address many of the factors that could hinder transition. As DOD  states in its comments, technology transition is referred to as a \u201cbody- contact sport.\u201d We agree, and this is why our recommendation is aimed at  more direct person-to-person communication. Leading companies believe  relationship managers play a key role in their ability to successfully  transition technology. While DOD did acknowledge that its S&T  investment would benefit from expanded emphasis by staff at the  execution levels on technology transition issues, it did not directly address  the need for midlevel relationship managers. We continue to believe DOD  would benefit from the use of midlevel relationship managers. These  managers provide the back and forth communications between the S&T  and acquisition communities that help ensure that the right technology is  being developed in the time frame needed. These managers are also  uniquely positioned to ensure that technology is applied to multiple  platforms when applicable and can identify systemic transition problems  that should be addressed.", "DOD did not concur with the recommendation that it should develop  additional process-oriented metrics, even though it stated that it is  installing a process to do this through the use of technology maturity and  technology readiness assessments. DOD stated that it does not want to  commit to overly burdensome metrics that may be more oriented to  measuring the process for the sake of measurement. Like DOD, we do not  believe the department should develop metrics just for the sake of  measurement. Rather, we believe DOD should develop and use metrics  that allow DOD, Congress, and taxpayers to gauge the effectiveness of  DOD S&T investments, which are expected to reach about $13 billion this  year. The metrics that DOD references\u2014those derived from technology  maturity and technology readiness assessments\u2014are project-level metrics  rather than portfolio and process metrics that would allow the department  to analyze its investment and make adjustments appropriately.", "DOD also did not concur with the recommendation to set aside a portion  of advanced component development and prototype funds for the S&T  community to manage the transition of technologies to acquisition  programs. In its response, DOD stated that acquisition programs are best  suited for transitioning technology because they have the training and  discipline to field systems and have the responsibility to ensure a stable  design, identify a responsive and responsible contractor, manage  execution, and plan for life cycle support of the system. While DOD  discusses transition to the warfighter, our recommendation is aimed at  transitioning technology from S&T to acquisition programs. We found that  in the commercial world, the training and discipline for transitioning  technologies to product development is managed by the technology  development community and is adequately funded. DOD believes its  current approach of setting aside a small portion of S&T funds for  transition through programs such as the Advanced Concept Technology  Demonstration program, Joint Capability Technology Demonstration  program, the Technology Transition Initiative, Manufacturing Technology  program, and the Foreign Comparative Testing program is appropriate. We  continue to believe DOD\u2019s approach to funding transition is flawed and  that small pots of money for specific transition activities offer a piecemeal  solution to a more systemic problem. DOD currently uses some of its  advanced component development and prototype funds for S&T activities,  including transition. However, acquisition programs typically carry out  and fund these activities. We believe the S&T community should be  responsible for these activities and as such, should be given the  appropriate level of funding to carry them out. We believe DOD would be  better positioned to develop and deliver weapon systems more quickly to  its warfighters if the S&T community was responsible for developing,  maturing, and transitioning mature technologies to the acquisition  community and if the acquisition community focused solely on product  development activities and delivering weapon systems to the warfighter  That being said, we recognize that the acquisition and warfighting  communities play critical roles in this process and therefore must continue  to work toward setting realistic program requirements and establishing an  evolutionary approach for developing new weapon programs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and interested  congressional committees.

It  includes all scientific study and experimentation directed  towards increasing fundamental knowledge and  understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering,  environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national  security needs. It is farsighted high-payoff research that  provides the basis for technological progress.  2  Applied research is systemic study to understand the means  to meet a recognized and specific need. It is a systematic  expression and application of knowledge to develop useful  materials, devices, and systems or methods. Applied research  may translate promising basic research into solutions for  broadly defined military needs, short of system development.  Applied research precedes system-specific technology  investigations or development.  3  Advanced technology development includes development of  subsystems and components and efforts to integrate them  into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a  simulated environment. The results of this type of effort are  proof of technological feasibility and assessment of  subsystem and component operability and producibility rather  than the development of hardware for service use. Projects in  this category have a direct relevance to identified military  needs. Program elements in this category involve pre- acquisition efforts, such as system concept demonstration,  joint and service-specific experiments, or technology  demonstrations, and generally have technology readiness  levels (TRLs) of 4, 5, or 6. Projects in this category do not  necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement  phases, but should have the goal of moving out of science  and technology and into the acquisition process within years  defense program. Upon successful completion of projects that  have military utility, the technology should be available for  transition.  4  Advanced component development and prototypes consists of  efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies or  prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating  environment. These activities include system-specific efforts  that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to  operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and  subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex  system sand may involve risk reduction initiatives.
