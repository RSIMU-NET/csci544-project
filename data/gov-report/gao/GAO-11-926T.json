USPS recently summarized this situation as the equivalent of facing Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In August 2011, USPS outlined new proposals to address the crisis. USPS seeks legislation to remove itself from the federal health benefit program and sponsor its own program; change pension benefits for new employees; and eliminate the layoff provisions it negotiated with its unions in collective bargaining to accelerate its delivery, processing, and retail network and workforce downsizing. Other USPS proposals, such as moving to 5-day delivery, and pending legislation include additional options for consideration. This statement discusses (1) updated information on USPS's financial crisis and (2) GAO's review and analysis of proposals to address this crisis, including USPS's new proposals, and options in current legislation. The testimony is based primarily on GAO's review of pending legislation, past and ongoing work related to postal issues, as well as USPS's recent financial results and GAO's discussions with senior postal officials regarding USPS's recent proposals. GAO has reported that action by Congress and USPS is urgently needed to restore USPS's financial viability. GAO provided a draft statement to USPS for comments and did not receive any suggested changes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPS has experienced a cumulative net loss of nearly $20 billion over the last 5 fiscal years, including an $8.5 billion loss in 2010, and a net loss of $5.7 billion in the first 9 months of fiscal year 2011. USPS does not now have--nor does it expect to have--sufficient revenue to cover its costs without legislative changes. To conserve cash, USPS discontinued making its employer's contribution for the defined-benefit portion of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) in June 2011, which it estimated would reduce its costs by about $800 million this fiscal year. USPS has said that mail volume decline has outpaced even its most pessimistic forecasts. USPS urgently needs to restructure its networks and workforce as its financial condition and outlook have reached a crisis level. A variety of proposals have been made to address USPS's financial crisis. These proposals affect USPS cost savings, postal rates, customer convenience, pension benefits for new employees, employee health benefits, collective bargaining agreements, and delivery and retail services. GAO has identified key issues needing consideration in determining the merits of these proposals. Examples of specific proposals and key considerations include: (1) USPS proposal to sponsor its own health benefit plan: USPS expects to save costs by increasing employee contribution rates, fully utilizing Medicare benefits, and administering its plan more efficiently than OPM. However, it is not clear whether USPS can achieve planned cost savings and what the implications are for the federal budget, as USPS has requested about $42 billion in retiree health benefit assets be transferred from Treasury to a USPS Fund. (2) USPS proposal to seek reimbursement of its $6.9 billion FERS surplus: Reimbursing the entire surplus all at once is a risk as the current FERS surplus is an estimate that could change as economic or demographic assumptions change. The President's Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Request proposed amortizing the reimbursement over 30 years, which would be consistent with the approach taken for any deficits. (3) USPS proposal on workforce optimization: USPS expects to reduce costs by closing about 300 mail processing plants and 12,000 retail facilities; reducing service; and eliminating layoff protections in collective bargaining agreements so that it can reduce its total workforce by about 125,000 career employees by 2015. This proposal accelerates the pace of USPS actions in this area, but it is not clear how USPS will address public resistance to facility closures that could lengthen the timeframes for implementation; employee resistance to making legislative changes to layoff protections; and potential loss of customers if service declines or costs increase. Little time remains to prevent USPS---the largest federal civilian employer---from insolvency. The stark reality is that USPS's business model is broken. The decline in mail volumes is continuing. The gap between revenues and expenses is growing. USPS cannot continue providing services at current levels without dramatic changes in its cost structure. Difficult choices must be made.

USPS costs for participating in the federal government- sponsored pension, health benefit, and workers\u2019 compensation programs  totaled about $22 billion in fiscal year 2010, almost 30 percent of its total  expenses. This total included $5.8 billion for retirement benefits (FERS,  Social Security, and the Thrift Savings Plan), $12.8 billion for health  benefits, and $3.6 billion for workers\u2019 compensation expenses.

USPS employees  paid about 20 percent of their premium costs in fiscal year 2010 as  compared to about 28 percent paid by other federal employees. USPS  reported in its fiscal year 2010 annual report that its Retiree Health  Benefits Fund had assets of $42.5 billion. USPS\u2019s proposal stated that  these assets would cover 47 percent of all future liabilities for current and  future retirees. Going forward, USPS\u2019s health-related benefit costs will  continue to face pressure from rising health care premiums, continued  prefunding requirements, and increasing number of retirees (USPS  estimates that about 300,000 employees will be eligible to retire over the  next decade).", "USPS has proposed establishing and managing its own health benefits  program. Its proposal briefly discusses USPS\u2019s rationale, how it would go  about creating such a program, the governance and oversight structure,  and it views of the unions\u2019 role under the proposed process. While the  Postal Service believes it currently has authority to withdraw from the  FEHB program pursuant to section 1005(f) of title 39 of the United States  Code, it has stated that it will seek specific statutory authority to do so.  USPS is authorized to vary, modify, or add to certain fringe benefits, but  is prohibited from making any changes to fringe benefits that on the whole  are less favorable than the fringe benefits in effect when the Postal  Reorganization Act of 1970 was enacted. The Postmaster General has  stated, however, that USPS may alter benefits for certain categories of  employees under any health benefits program it would administer.", "Our April 2010 report on USPS\u2019s business model discussed several  options and related issues pertaining to assigning financial responsibility  for benefits to USPS, its employees, and current and future ratepayers.  Key considerations include improving USPS\u2019s poor financial condition  while keeping rates affordable, ensuring adequate funding to fulfill its  financial obligations pertaining to employee benefits, and minimizing risk  to the taxpayer if USPS would be unable to meet its responsibilities.  USPS has said it cannot afford its required prefunding payments to the  Retiree Health Benefits Fund on the basis of its significant mail volume  and revenue declines, large financial losses, and difficulties in reducing  costs. We have reported that Congress should consider a package of  actions, which could include providing financial relief to USPS by  modifying its retiree health benefit cost structure in a fiscally responsible  manner.", "Several legislative proposals have been made to defer costs by revising  statutory requirements, including extending and revising prefunding  payments to the Retiree Health Benefits Fund, with smaller payment  amounts in the short term followed by larger amounts later. Deferring  some prefunding of these benefits would serve as short-term fiscal relief.  However, deferrals also increase the risk that USPS will not be able to  make future payments as its core business declines. Therefore, it is  important that USPS continue to fund its retiree health benefit  obligations\u2014including prefunding these obligations\u2014to the maximum  extent that its finances permit.

How would  such a change impact USPS health benefit contribution rates and  costs? How would the current costs paid by USPS to OPM to  administer the program compare to those USPS expects to incur by  administering the program itself?", "Employee impacts \u2013 What would be the expected impact on  employees\u2019 contribution rates, costs, and benefits? What would be the  impact of this proposal on collective bargaining?", "Impact on other federal employees \u2013 How would the benefits,  contribution rates, and costs of other federal employees enrolled in  FEHB be impacted by this proposal? Also, how would non-USPS  federal employees who are currently enrolled in postal union  sponsored FEHB plans be impacted?", "Fiduciary responsibility \u2013 How does USPS plan to acquire the  experience needed to sponsor health benefit programs for over 1  million participants? Who would decide what the required funding  level and investment strategy should be? Also, if USPS defaults on  benefit payments, what would be the federal government\u2019s obligation?", "Oversight \u2013 How would disagreements between the proposed Plan  Management body and USPS and/or employees be resolved, e.g.  scope of coverage, procedures, etc.?", "Approximately 84 percent of eligible USPS employees are enrolled in  FERS, and about 16 percent are enrolled in CSRS or the Dual  CSRS/Social Security program; these programs are administered by the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM). At the end of fiscal year 2009,  OPM estimated that USPS had an unfunded CSRS liability of $7.3 billion  and a FERS surplus of $6.9 billion. USPS has asked Congress to enact  legislation that would allow it to access the FERS surplus.  To conserve  cash immediately, however, in June 2011, USPS discontinued making its  employer contribution payments for the defined benefit portion of FERS.   The current $6.9 billion FERS surplus is approximately equal to 2 years of  USPS\u2019s FERS contributions that it has stopped making.  Thus, if USPS  continues not to make its FERS payments, its FERS surplus will be  reduced by a commensurate amount.   USPS estimated this would  reduce its costs by about $800 million in the current fiscal year but would  not impact current or future postal retirees. Both USPS and the OPM  agreed to seek a resolution of the legal issues surrounding USPS\u2019s  decision to discontinue its FERS payments by requesting a legal opinion  from the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice.", "USPS has proposed legislation that would make new employees eligible  only for the Thrift Savings Plan (possibly modified) and Social Security.  New employees would not be eligible for the FERS defined benefit  annuity or CSRS.

There is disagreement regarding whether USPS has  \u201coverpaid\u201d CSRS between $50 billion and $75 billion. The USPS OIG and  Postal Regulatory Commission have asserted that the current method of  allocating pension costs for pay increases after 1971 results in the  inequitable allocation of pension obligations to USPS, and the USPS OIG  proposed an alternative allocation methodology. In response, the OPM  OIG has asserted that OPM does not have the authority to adopt this  proposal without further legislation, that a change in the allocation  methodology would shift substantial pension funding costs from USPS to  the U.S. Treasury, and that using the federal retirement program as a  vehicle through which to implement other policy objectives would be  unwise, inefficient, and harmful to the program itself.", "Table 2 describes key provisions from USPS\u2019s retirement-related  proposals, pending legislation (bills introduced in 2011 by Senators  Carper and Collins, and Representatives Issa and Lynch), the President\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Request, GAO\u2019s report on USPS\u2019s business  model (GAO-10-455), and a report by the USPS OIG, along with key  issues that we have identified.", "The following questions provide a starting point to consider USPS\u2019s  proposal to withdraw from the federal pension programs:", "USPS legal authority \u2013 USPS would require new statutory authority to  withdraw future employees from the federal pension annuity.

Although neither of these benefits  is discussed in USPS\u2019s recent draft proposals, legislation has been  introduced that would convert employees on long-term workers\u2019  compensation to federal retirement programs when they reach retirement  age. Furthermore, USPS offers employees life insurance coverage  through the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program.  USPS pays 100 percent of employee basic life insurance premiums, while  other federal agencies pay about 33 percent. One option discussed in our  April 2010 report would be for USPS to work with its unions in collective  bargaining to increase employee premium payments for these benefits\u2014 and, in doing so, reduce USPS\u2019s share to levels paid by most federal  agencies.

Technological innovations such as advanced sorting machines can  rapidly process and sequence mail, leaving less manual work for USPS  employees. Moreover, although customer visits and retail revenue have  declined, USPS has not made commensurate reductions in its retail  facilities.  USPS reports that about 35 percent of its retail sales are  performed at sites other than a traditional post office, such as stamp  purchases at grocery stores or on the Internet. Together, these and other  developments have resulted in the need for a smaller postal operational  network and workforce.", "During the past 12 years, USPS reported that it reduced its workforce by  235,000 career employees, primarily through attrition. Currently, USPS  has about 653,000 total employees, and has a goal of reducing that  number to 425,000 by 2015. USPS plans to increase the ratio of non- career to career employees and expects attrition to eliminate about  100,000 employees.  In order to meet its 2015 goal, USPS has asked for  legislation to eliminate the layoff provisions it has negotiated with its  unions in collective bargaining so that it can accelerate reducing its  workforce by an additional 125,000 career positions. Currently, USPS\u2019s  collective bargaining agreements with three of its major unions contain a  provision stating that USPS bargaining unit employees, who were  employed as of September 15, 1978, or, if hired after that date, have  completed 6 years of continuous service, are protected against any  involuntary layoff or force reduction.  The collective bargaining agreement  with its fourth major union states that that no bargaining unit employees  employed in the career work force will be laid off on an involuntary basis  during the period of the agreement.", "USPS has proposed initiatives to remove more than $11 billion in costs  from its networks and workforce. USPS plans to reduce the number of  processing plants from over 500 to fewer than 200 and has proposed  changing service standards to increase delivery time. USPS has  announced plans to streamline its postal-operated retail facilities from  32,000 to fewer than 20,000 by 2015, and has already begun studying  3,700 retail facilities for possible closure. It also plans to continue  increasing the number of locations where postal services are provided in  privately owned businesses. We recently reported on similar retail  restructuring efforts by some foreign posts and the lessons learned to  facilitate the transitions, which took time to phase in and gain  acceptance.

Further, USPS has  proposed increasing the efficiency of mail delivery by reducing delivery  service from 6 to 5-days and consolidating routes. Delivery remains the  most costly activity for USPS and involves more than 310,000 carriers  accounting for approximately 47 percent ($23 billion) of USPS\u2019s total  salary and benefit expenses in fiscal year 2010.
