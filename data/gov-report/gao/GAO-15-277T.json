The agency  reports that approximately 2.7 million active federal employees and nearly  2.5 million retired federal employees rely on its services.", "According to OPM, the retirement program serves current and former  federal employees by providing tools and options for retirement planning  and retirement compensation. Two defined-benefit retirement plans that  provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to federal employees  are administered by the agency: (1) the Civil Service Retirement System  (CSRS), which provides retirement benefits for most federal employees  hired before 1984 and (2) the Federal Employees Retirement System  (FERS), which covers most employees hired in or after 1984 and  provides benefits that include Social Security and a defined contribution  system.", "Retirement processing includes functions such as determining retirement  eligibility, inputting data into benefit calculators, and providing customer  service. The agency uses over 500 different procedures, laws, and  regulations, which are documented on the agency\u2019s internal website, to  process retirement applications. For example, the site contains  memorandums that outline new procedures for handling special  retirement applications, such as those for disability or court orders.

Initial modernization visions called for  developing an integrated system and automated processes to provide  prompt and complete benefit payments. However, following attempts over  more than two decades, the agency has not yet been successful in  achieving the modernized retirement system that it envisioned.", "In early 1987, OPM began a program called the FERS Automated  Processing System. However, after 8 years of planning, the agency  decided to reevaluate the program, and the Office of Management and  Budget requested an independent review of the program, which identified  various management weaknesses. The independent review suggested  areas for improvement and recommended terminating the program if  immediate action was not taken. In mid-1996, OPM terminated the  program.", "In 1997, OPM began planning a second modernization initiative, called  the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program. The agency  originally intended to structure the program as an acquisition of  commercially available hardware and software that would be modified in- house to meet its needs. From 1997 to 2001, OPM developed plans and  analyses and began developing business and security requirements for  the program. However, in June 2001, it decided to change the direction of  the retirement modernization initiative.", "In late 2001, retaining the name RSM, the agency embarked upon its  third initiative to modernize the retirement process and examined the  possibility of privately sourced technologies and tools. Toward this end,  the agency determined that contracting was a viable alternative and, in  2006, awarded three contracts for the automation of retirement  processing, the conversion of paper records to electronic files, and  consulting services to redesign its retirement operations.", "In February 2008, OPM renamed the program RetireEZ and deployed an  automated retirement processing system. However, by May 2008 the  agency determined that the system was not working as expected and  suspended system operation. In October 2008, after 5 months of  attempting to address quality issues, the agency terminated the contract  for the system. In November 2008, OPM began restructuring the program  and reported that its efforts to modernize retirement processing would  continue. However, after several years of trying to revitalize the program,  the agency terminated the retirement system modernization in February  2011.", "In mid-January 2012, OPM released a plan to undertake targeted,  incremental improvements to retirement processing rather than a large- scale modernization, which described planned actions in four areas: hiring and training 56 new staff to adjudicate retirement claims and 20  additional staff to support the claims process; establishing higher production standards and identifying potential working with other agencies to improve the accuracy and  completeness of the data they provide to OPM for use in retirement  processing; and improving the department\u2019s IT by pursuing a long-term data flow  strategy, exploring short-term strategies to leverage work performed  by other agencies, and reviewing and upgrading systems used by  retirement services.", "Through implementing these actions, OPM said that it aimed to eliminate  the agency\u2019s retirement processing backlog and accurately process 90  percent of its cases within 60 days by July 31, 2013. While its Fiscal Year  2013 Summary of Performance and Financial Information indicated that  the agency was on track to eliminate the backlog, the agency nonetheless  reported that two factors beyond its control prevented achieving the goal.First, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority and a Voluntary Separation  Incentive Program offered by the U.S. Postal Service increased OPM\u2019s  retirement processing workload by over 20,000 cases. Second, funding  reductions due to sequestration required the agency to curtail overtime  work on retirement processing in April 2013.", "In March 2014, OPM again articulated a retirement claims processing  improvement goal as part of its Fiscal Year 2014-2015 Agency Priority  Goals strategy. Specifically, the agency reiterated the goal to process 90  percent of retirement cases within 60 days, but extended the date for  doing so to July 2014. However, OPM did not achieve this goal, reporting  that 77.9 percent of cases were processed within 60 days in July 2014.

Effective project management allows the  performance, cost, and schedule of the overall project to be measured  and controlled in comparison to planned objectives. Although OPM  had defined major retirement modernization project components, it  had not defined the dependencies among them. Specifically, by not  identifying critical dependencies among project components, OPM  increased the risk that unforeseen delays in one activity could hinder  progress in other activities.", "Risk management entails identifying potential problems before they  occur. Risks should be identified as early as possible, analyzed,  mitigated, and tracked to closure. OPM officials acknowledged that  they did not have a process for identifying and tracking retirement  modernization project risks and mitigation strategies on a regular  basis but stated that the agency\u2019s project management consultant  would assist it in implementing a risk management process. Lacking  such a process, OPM did not have a mechanism to address potential  problems that could adversely impact the cost, schedule, and quality  of the retirement modernization project.", "Organizational change management includes preparing users for the  changes to how their work will be performed as a result of a new  system implementation. Effective organizational change management  includes plans to prepare users for impacts the new system might  have on their roles and responsibilities, and a process to manage  those changes.

At the time of our review, test results showed  that the new system had not performed as intended. Although the  agency planned to perform additional tests to verify that the system  would work as intended, the schedule for conducting these tests  became compressed, with several tests to be performed concurrently  rather than sequentially. The agency stated that a lack of testing  resources and the need for further system development, contributed  to the delay of planned tests and the need for concurrent testing. The  high degree of concurrent testing that OPM planned to meet its  February 2008 deployment schedule increased the risk that the  agency would not have the resources or time to verify that the  planned system worked as expected.", "Cost estimating is the identification of individual project cost elements,  using established methods and valid data to estimate future costs.  Establishing a reliable cost estimate is important for developing a  project budget and having a sound basis for measuring performance,  including comparing the actual and planned costs of project activities.  Although OPM developed a retirement modernization cost estimate, it  was not supported by the documentation that is fundamental to a  reliable cost estimate. Without a reliable cost estimate, OPM lacked a  sound basis for formulating retirement modernization budgets or for  developing the cost baseline that is necessary for measuring and  predicting project performance.", "Earned value management (EVM) is a tool for measuring program  progress by comparing the value of work accomplished with the  amount of work expected to be accomplished. Fundamental to reliable  EVM is the development of a baseline against which variances are  calculated. OPM used EVM to measure and report monthly  performance of the retirement modernization system. The reported  results indicated that the project was progressing almost exactly as  planned. However, this view of project performance was not reliable  because the baseline on which it was based did not reflect the full  scope of the project, had not been validated, and was unstable (i.e.,  subject to frequent changes). This EVM approach in effect ensured  that material variances from planned performance would not be  identified and that the state of the project would not be reliably  reported.", "We recommended that the Director of OPM conduct effective system  tests prior to system deployment and improve program cost estimation  and progress reporting. OPM stated that it concurred with our  recommendations and would take steps to address the weakness we  identified. Nevertheless, OPM deployed a limited initial version of the  modernized retirement system in February 2008. After unsuccessful  efforts to address system quality issues, the agency suspended system  operation, terminated the system contract, and began restructuring the  modernization effort.", "In April 2009, we again reported on OPM\u2019s retirement modernization,  noting that the agency still remained far from achieving the modernized   Specifically, we  retirement processing capabilities that it had planned.noted that significant weaknesses continued to exist in the areas of cost  estimating, progress reporting, and testing, while also noting two  additional weaknesses related to planning and oversight.", "Although it concurred with our January 2008 recommendation to  develop a revised cost estimate for the retirement modernization  effort, OPM had not completed initial steps for developing the new  estimate by the time we issued our report in April 2009. We reported  that the agency had not yet fully defined the estimate\u2019s purpose,  developed an estimating plan, or defined the project\u2019s characteristics.  By not completing these steps, OPM increased the risk that it would  produce an unreliable estimate and not have a sound basis for  measuring project performance and formulating retirement  modernization budgets.", "OPM also concurred with our January 2008 recommendation to  establish a basis for effective EVM but had not completed key steps  as of the time of our report. Specifically, despite planning to use EVM  to report the retirement modernization project\u2019s progress, the agency  had not developed a reliable cost estimate and a validated baseline.  Engaging in EVM reporting without first taking these fundamental  steps could have again rendered the agency\u2019s assessments  unreliable.", "As previously discussed, effective testing is an essential component  of any project that includes developing systems. To be effectively  managed, testing should be planned and conducted in a structured  and disciplined fashion. Beginning the test planning process in the  early stages of a project life cycle can reduce rework later. Early test  planning in coordination with requirements development can provide  major benefits. However, at the time of our April 2009 report, the  agency had not begun to plan test activities in coordination with  developing its requirements for the system it was planning at that  time. Consequently, OPM increased the risk that it would again deploy  a system that did not satisfy user expectations and meet  requirements.", "Project management principles and effective practices emphasize the  importance of having a plan that, among other things, incorporates all  the critical areas of system development and is to be used as a  means of determining what needs to be done, by whom, and when.  Although OPM had developed a variety of informal documents and  briefing slides that described retirement modernization activities, the  agency did not have a complete plan that described how the program  would proceed in the wake of its decision to terminate the system  contract.

However, meeting minutes indicated  that no discussion or action was taken to address these problems.  According to a member of the board, OPM had not established  guidance regarding how the board was to communicate  recommendations and needed corrective actions for investments it  oversaw. Without a fully functioning oversight body, OPM lacked  insight into the retirement modernization and the ability to make  needed course corrections that effective boards are intended to  provide.", "Our April 2009 report made new recommendations calling for OPM to  address the weaknesses in the retirement modernization project that we  identified.
