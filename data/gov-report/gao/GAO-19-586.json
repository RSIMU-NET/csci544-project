DLA uses reverse engineering to identify potential new sources for spare parts that are available from only one source and to achieve savings. DLA funded about 1,000 of the reverse engineering projects, while contractors funded the remaining 600 projects. Nearly two-thirds of all reverse engineering projects involved parts in five categories, with examples of the three largest categories illustrated in the figure.", "GAO found that the majority of contractors conducting reverse engineering for DLA were small businesses.

DLA is DOD\u2019s combat logistics  support agency and is responsible for purchasing, storing, and distributing  most consumable, expendable, and reparable parts, including spare  parts, for DOD. Military assets are often operational for decades and a  single contractor sometimes supplies the parts needed to sustain them.  This situation potentially leaves DLA vulnerable to higher costs and  disruption in supply if that supplier can no longer provide the part.", "If DLA cannot obtain needed items due to price or obsolescence, it can  attempt to reverse engineer the part.

DLA identified these three major subordinate commands  as having formal reverse engineering programs. DLA\u2019s data included  projects funded by contractors and projects funded by DLA. To categorize  the types of parts involved in reverse engineering, we compared the first  two digits in the national stock number for each part to its corresponding  Federal Supply Groups description, which DLA uses to identify parts. We  also analyzed DLA\u2019s reverse engineering data to identify the number of  contractors involved in reverse engineering as well as the amount of  savings reported by DLA.", "In addition, we compared data provided by DLA for contractors involved  in reverse engineering\u2014both those that supplied parts prior to reverse  engineering and those that conducted reverse engineering\u2014to small  business information in the System for Award Management and the  Federal Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation. We assessed  data reliability by (1) reviewing existing data and information about the  systems used to produce the data, (2) comparing the data provided to  documentation for a selection of reverse engineering projects, and (3)  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. Although we  found some inconsistencies in the data, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to discuss the number and types of reverse  engineering projects in DLA.", "In addition, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 19 reverse  engineering projects, involving 13 parts, chosen to obtain variety across  the following characteristics: DLA command, project completion status,  contractor- and DLA-funded projects, and types of entities conducting  reverse engineering efforts. For example, we sought to include projects  where the approved suppliers (prior to reverse engineering) or the  contractors conducting reverse engineering were small businesses. We  also included projects that reported savings as a result of reverse  engineering. For these selected 19 projects, we reviewed documentation  including requests for approval from military service engineers,  agreements between DLA and contractors, acquisition history  information, and documentation of prices paid to support savings  calculations. We identified 15 small businesses that were involved in  these 19 projects either as a small business whose parts had been  reverse engineered or as a small business that conducted reverse  engineering. We spoke with or received written responses from 10 of  these 15 small businesses. We also conducted follow-up with DLA  command officials to obtain additional information.", "To describe how DLA safeguards intellectual property within its reverse  engineering efforts, we reviewed relevant DOD procedures.

For these selected projects, we interviewed or received  written information from 10 of the 15 small businesses regarding how  DLA\u2019s reverse engineering affects small businesses and any concerns  about how their intellectual property is protected during the reverse  engineering process.

The technical data  package could be used for future competitive procurements when the  item is needed for sustainment purposes.", "DLA uses reverse engineering for several reasons, such as identifying  potential new sources for obsolete parts or those supplied by only one  source, increasing competition, and achieving savings. Parts are  identified for reverse engineering generally because the government does  not have necessary legal rights to the drawings or lacks data needed to  facilitate competitive procurements. However, reverse engineering is  generally considered the least attractive alternative for replenishing parts  because it is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, according to  DLA guidance, before starting reverse engineering DLA personnel should  try to buy data from the original equipment manufacturer, previous  manufacturing sources, or other data rights holder. DLA personnel also  need to consider the costs of acquiring the data rights before initiating  reverse engineering. DLA guidance for its reverse engineering processes  is the same regardless of the size of the businesses involved.", "In order to start a reverse engineering project, DLA has established  criteria, such as documenting a business case and showing that the part  meets certain yearly purchase thresholds. Specifically, according to DLA  guidance, procurements of the part over the past 2 years generally should  exceed $10,000 in each year. Additionally, the engineering support  activity at a military department (Army, Air Force, or Navy) responsible for  the part generally approves a project before reverse engineering can  begin. Once reverse engineering is completed, the technical data  package must be approved by the appropriate engineering support  activity.
