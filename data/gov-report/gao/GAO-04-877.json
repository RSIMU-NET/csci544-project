Disease surveillance is the process of reporting, collecting, analyzing, and exchanging information related to cases of infectious diseases. In this report GAO was asked to examine disease surveillance efforts in the United States. Specifically, GAO described (1) how state and federal public health officials conduct surveillance for infectious diseases and (2) initiatives intended to enhance disease surveillance. GAO reviewed documents, such as policy manuals and reports related to disease surveillance, and interviewed officials from selected federal departments and agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DOD), Agriculture (USDA), and Homeland Security (DHS) as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

At the state level, state health departments collect and analyze data on cases of infectious diseases. These data are required to be reported by health care providers and others to the state. State public health departments verify reported cases of diseases, monitor disease incidence, identify possible outbreaks within their state, and report this information to CDC. At the federal level, agencies and departments collect and analyze disease surveillance data and maintain disease surveillance systems. For example, CDC uses the reports of diseases from the states to monitor national health trends, formulate and implement prevention strategies, and evaluate state and federal disease prevention efforts. FDA analyzes information on outbreaks of infectious diseases that originate from foods that the agency regulates. Some federal agencies and departments also fund and operate their own disease surveillance systems and laboratory networks and have several means of sharing surveillance information with local, state, and international public health partners. State and federal public health officials have implemented a number of initiatives intended to enhance disease surveillance, but challenges remain. For example, officials have implemented and expanded syndromic surveillance systems, which monitor the frequency and distribution of health-related symptoms among people within a specific geographic area. Although syndromic surveillance systems are used by federal agencies and departments and in all of the states whose officials GAO interviewed, concerns have been raised about this approach to surveillance. Specifically, syndromic surveillance systems are relatively costly to maintain compared to other types of surveillance and are still largely untested. Public health officials are also implementing initiatives designed to enhance public health communications and disease reporting. For example, CDC is working to increase the number of participants using its public health communication systems. In addition, state public health departments and CDC are implementing an initiative designed to make electronic disease reporting more timely, accurate, and complete. However, the implementation of this initiative is incomplete. Finally, federal public health officials have enhanced federal coordination on disease surveillance and expanded training programs for epidemiologists and other public health experts. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said the report captures many important issues in surveillance. HHS also provided suggestions to clarify the discussion."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Infectious diseases account for millions of deaths every year. Although the  great majority of these deaths occur in developing countries, infectious  diseases are not confined by international borders and therefore present a  substantial threat to populations in all parts of the world, including the  United States. In recent years, the threat posed by infectious diseases has  grown. New diseases, unknown in the United States just a decade ago,  such as West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),  have emerged, and known infectious diseases once considered in decline  have reappeared with increased frequency. Furthermore, there is always  the potential for an infectious disease to develop into a widespread  outbreak\u2014which could have significant consequences. The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that if an influenza  pandemic were to occur in the United States, it could cause an estimated  314,000 to 734,000 hospitalizations and 89,000 to 207,000 deaths, with  associated costs ranging from $71 to $167 billion.

Disease  surveillance is the process of reporting, collecting, analyzing, and  exchanging information related to cases of infectious diseases. Disease  surveillance provides national and international public health authorities  with information for planning and managing efforts to control these  diseases. In the mid-1990s, public health experts in the United States and  abroad determined that infectious disease surveillance was inadequate  worldwide, and both the World Health Assembly and the President of the  United States called for concerted action to develop effective disease  surveillance and response capabilities. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine  (IOM) of the National Academies published a report that acknowledged  that the United States has taken some important steps over the past  decade to improve its disease surveillance and response capabilities, but  also emphasized the need for continued action.", "You asked us to examine disease surveillance efforts in the United States.

We also interviewed state  public health officials from the 11 states about their assessment of  enhancements and continuing weaknesses in disease surveillance efforts.  We also reviewed and analyzed related federal documents, such as policy  directives and annual reports, and we interviewed relevant federal health  officials. We focused our review of initiatives intended to enhance  surveillance on those currently under way or implemented since 2001.  Appendix I contains more details about our scope and methodology.

The West Nile virus, which  was first diagnosed in the United States in 1999, is an example of a  zoonotic disease. The West Nile virus can cause encephalitis, or  inflammation of the brain. Mosquitoes become infected with West Nile  virus when they feed on infected birds, and infected mosquitoes transmit  the virus to humans and animals by biting them. Other zoonotic diseases  include SARS, avian influenza, human monkeypox, and variant  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which scientists believe is linked to  eating beef from cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  (BSE) and is also called mad cow disease. Surveillance for zoonotic  diseases requires collaboration between animal and human disease  specialists.", "Disease surveillance provides information for action against infectious  disease threats. Basic infectious disease surveillance activities include  detecting and reporting cases of disease, analyzing and confirming this  information to identify possible outbreaks or longer-term trends, and  applying the information to inform public health decision-making.

Both the diseases considered notifiable and the  requirements for reporting them vary by state. Most states have their list of  notifiable diseases approximate a national list of notifiable diseases  maintained and revised by the Council of State and Territorial  Epidemiologists (CSTE) in collaboration with CDC. (See table 1 for the  2004 national list of notifiable diseases maintained by CSTE.) This national  list is reviewed annually and revised periodically. State lists of notifiable  diseases generally include cholera, plague, and yellow fever\u2014consistent  with WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations. On the other hand,  according to state and federal health officials, states modify their list of  notifiable diseases to reflect the public health needs of their region. States  may include diseases on their state list that impact their state but do not  appear on the national list. For example, one border state includes the  gastrointestinal disease amebiasis\u2014a disease most often found in the  United States among immigrants from developing countries\u2014in its state  list of notifiable diseases. However, amebiasis is not included on the  current national list of notifiable diseases. Conversely, states may exclude  diseases that are on the national list but have little relevance for their  state. For example, although Rocky Mountain spotted fever is listed on the  national list of notifiable diseases, it was excluded from one state\u2019s list we  reviewed because relatively few cases of this disease are reported in that  area. Appendix II provides a description of diseases on the national  notifiable disease list and other selected emerging infectious diseases.", "States also vary in their requirements for who should report notifiable  diseases, and the deadlines for reporting these diseases after they have  been diagnosed vary by disease. Officials from the 11 states we  interviewed told us that, in addition to health care providers, they require  clinical laboratories to report notifiable diseases. On the other hand,  some\u2014but not all\u2014of the11 states have expanded the responsibility for  reporting suspected notifiable diseases. Depending on the state, those  required to report suspected notifiable diseases can include veterinarians,  day care centers, hotels, and food service establishments. Penalties for not  reporting a notifiable disease vary by state. For example, failing to report a  notifiable disease in one state is a misdemeanor, and upon conviction,  violators may be fined from $50 to $1,000 and/or may be imprisoned for up  to 90 days. In another state, the penalty ranges from $25 to $300.  Depending on the contagiousness or virulence of the disease, some  diseases have to be reported more quickly than others. For example, in  one state, botulism must be reported immediately after a case or  suspected case is identified, while chronic hepatitis B must be reported  within one month of its identification. Similarly, in another state, Q fever  must be reported within one working day, while gonorrhea must be  reported within one week.", "Health care providers rely on a variety of public and private laboratories to  help them diagnose cases of notifiable diseases. In some cases only  laboratory results can definitively identify pathogens. Every state has at  least one state public health laboratory to support its infectious diseases  surveillance activities and other public health programs. State laboratories  conduct testing for routine surveillance or as part of clinical or  epidemiologic studies. For rare or unusual pathogens, these laboratories  provide diagnostic tests that are not always available in commercial  laboratories. For more common pathogens, these laboratories provide  testing using new technologies that still need controlled evaluation. State  public health laboratories also provide specialized testing for low- incidence, high-risk diseases, such as tuberculosis and botulism. Results  from state public health laboratories are used by epidemiologists to  document trends and identify events that may indicate an emerging  problem.", "Upon diagnosing a case involving a notifiable disease, local health  providers and others who report notifiable diseases are required to send  the reports to state health departments through a variety of state and  local disease reporting systems, which range from paper-based reporting  to secure, Internet-based systems. Our interviews of public health officials  in 11 states found that about half of these states have systems that allow  public health care providers to submit reports of notifiable diseases to  their state health department over the Internet. For example, state officials  in one state we interviewed said their public health department has  supported a state-wide Internet-based electronic communicable disease  reporting and outbreak alert system since 1995. Officials in another state  told us that since 2002, the state has had a secure statewide Web-based  hospital, laboratory, and physician disease-reporting system.", "State health officials conduct their own analysis of disease data to verify  cases, monitor the incidence of diseases, and identify possible outbreaks.  States voluntarily report their notifiable disease data to CDC, using  multiple and sometimes duplicative systems. For example, state officials  currently report information on gonorrhea to CDC through two CDC  systems: the Sexually Transmitted Disease Management Information  System (STD*MIS) and the National Electronic Telecommunications  System for Surveillance (NETSS). STD*MIS is a national electronic  surveillance system that tracks sexually transmitted diseases, including  gonorrhea throughout the United States. NETSS is a computerized public  health information system used for tracking notifiable diseases. Although  states are not legally required to report information on notifiable diseases  to CDC, CDC officials explained the agency makes such reporting from the  states a prerequisite for receiving certain types of CDC funding.

CDC,  for example, analyzes the reports it receives from state health departments  on cases of notifiable diseases in humans. CDC uses the reports from the  states to monitor national health trends, formulate and implement  prevention strategies, and evaluate state and federal disease prevention  efforts. The agency publishes current data on notifiable diseases in its  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Like CDC, USDA also collects  surveillance data from the states. Specifically, USDA collects information  from participating state veterinarians on the presence of specific  confirmed clinical diseases in specific livestock, poultry, and aquaculture  species in the United States. State animal health officials obtain this  information from multiple sources\u2014including veterinary laboratories,  public health laboratories, and veterinarians\u2014and report this information  to the National Animal Health Reporting System (NAHRS). Similarly,  FDA, often in cooperation with CDC, receives and interprets state data.  For example, FDA officials told us they analyze state information from  CDC on outbreaks of infectious diseases that originate from foods that  FDA regulates. FDA then uses this information to trace the regulated food  back to its origin and investigate possible sources of contamination. In  addition, FDA and CDC interpret data on emerging infectious diseases to  establish safeguards to minimize the risk of infectious disease  transmission from regulated biological products, such as blood and  vaccines.", "Federal agencies and departments also collect and analyze information  from international sources. For example, CDC and DOD obtain  information on potential outbreaks from WHO. According to CDC, in many  cases the initial alert of potential outbreaks is reported to WHO through  the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), a system  developed by Canadian health officials and used by WHO since 1997.  GPHIN is an Internet-based application that searches more than 950 news  feeds and discussion groups around the world in the media and on the  Internet. WHO then verifies the reported outbreak and, if necessary,  notifies the global health community. About 40 percent of the  approximately 200 outbreaks investigated and reported to WHO each year  come from the GPHIN.", "In addition to these formal mechanisms for collecting and analyzing data,  federal public health officials stressed the importance of obtaining  information through their contacts at state and local health departments,  other federal agencies and departments, foreign ministries of health, or  other international organizations. For example, according to state public  health officials, CDC learned of last year\u2019s monkeypox outbreak in one  state through a phone call from the state public health department  officials. After this initial contact, the state health department officials, in  collaboration with officials from CDC, arranged a conference call that  included federal officials from CDC and USDA, state and local health  department officials, health care providers, and hospital epidemiologists  to further share information on the outbreak."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies and Departments Operate and Fund Disease Surveillance Systems", "paragraphs": ["Some federal agencies and departments conduct disease surveillance  using disease surveillance systems they operate or fund.

In general, these surveillance systems  are distinguished from one another by the types of infectious diseases or  syndromes they monitor and the sources from which they collect data.  Some surveillance systems, known as sentinel surveillance systems, rely  on groups of selected health care providers who have agreed to routinely  supply information from clinical settings on targeted diseases. Other  systems, known as syndromic surveillance systems, monitor the frequency  and distribution of health-related symptoms\u2014otherwise known as  syndromes\u2014among people within a specific geographic area. Syndromic  surveillance systems are designed to detect anomalous increases in  certain syndromes, such as skin rashes, that may indicate the beginning of  an infectious disease outbreak. Because these systems monitor  symptoms and other signs of disease outbreaks instead of waiting for  clinically confirmed reports or diagnoses of a disease, some experts  believe that syndromic surveillance systems help public health officials  increase the speed with which they may identify outbreaks.", "There are a number of disease surveillance systems operating in the  United States that are operated or funded by federal agencies and  departments.

FoodNet is used to detect  cases or outbreaks of foodborne disease, identify their source, recognize  trends, and respond to outbreaks. Public health departments that  participate in FoodNet receive funds from CDC, USDA, and FDA to  systematically contact laboratories in their geographical areas and solicit  incidence data. According to CDC, as a result of this active solicitation,  FoodNet provides more accurate estimates of the occurrence of  foodborne diseases than are otherwise available.", "ESSENCE\u2014A DOD Syndromic Surveillance System  Similar to CDC, DOD maintains its own surveillance system.

Through HAN, CDC issues  health alerts and other public health bulletins to an estimated 1 million  public health officials, including physicians, nurses, laboratory staff, and  others. During the SARS outbreak, for instance, CDC used HAN to  disseminate what the agency knew about the emerging infectious disease.  Also, state officials we interviewed reported receiving updates through  HAN on the avian influenza outbreak in Asia. According to CDC, as of  March 2003, 89 percent of local health departments have high-speed  continuous Internet access and the ability to receive broadcast health  alerts.", "CDC also shares information on infectious diseases through a restricted  communication system, the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X).  Developed by CDC, this system is a secure, Web-based communication  system operating in all 50 states. CDC uses this system primarily to share  information relevant to disease outbreaks with state and local public  health officials and with other federal officials. CDC uses Epi-X to issue  emergency alerts, but unlike HAN, Epi-X also serves as a forum for routine  professional discussions and non-emergency inquiries. Authorized Epi-X  users can post questions and reports, query CDC, and receive feedback on  ongoing infectious disease control efforts. According to CDC, as of 2004,  over 1,200 public health officials at the federal, state, and local levels had  used the system to communicate with colleagues and experts, track  information for outbreak investigations and response efforts, conduct  online discussions, and request assistance. In addition, according to CDC,  it has agreements with Canada and Mexico that allow international public  health officials to become authorized Epi-X users. These international  users include officials from both the Canadian and Mexican Ministries of  Health and health officials in Mexican states that border the United States.  In addition, CDC staff assigned to WHO and health care providers working  internationally for the U.S. Department of State are authorized Epi-X  users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies and Departments Provide Training, Technical Assistance, and Funding", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies and departments also provide training, technical  assistance, and funding to state and international public health officials.  For example, to enhance the U.S. public health infrastructure for disease  surveillance and response to infectious diseases, CDC operates several  programs, including the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC)  program, the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program, and EIP. The  ELC program provides training, technical assistance, and funding to 58  state and local health departments. The program assists state and local  health departments in maintaining surveillance for infectious diseases,  providing technical support through laboratory services, and investigating  outbreaks. Additionally, the EIS is a 2-year postgraduate program intended  to increase the number of federally trained epidemiologists working in  public health. While the majority of EIS officers train at CDC headquarters,  others are trained at state and large local health departments. Graduates of  the program are employed in federal government, state health departments  and other health care settings. Further, the EIP\u2014which is a collaboration  among CDC, state health departments, and other public health partners\u2014 is a network of sites that acts as a national resource for the surveillance,  prevention, and control of emerging infectious diseases. These sites  conduct population-based surveillance for selected diseases or syndromes  and research that go beyond the routine functions of local health  departments to address issues in infectious diseases and public health.  CDC provided nearly $20 million in funding to EIPs in fiscal year 2003 in  order to support their surveillance and research activities.", "In selected foreign locations, CDC operates international training  programs, such as the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP). For  more than 20 years, CDC has collaborated with foreign ministries of health  around the world to help establish and conduct field epidemiology training  programs in those countries. CDC officials said that through FETP, CDC  trains approximately 50 to 60 physicians and social scientists each year  from these countries. This training in applied public health integrates  disease surveillance, applied research, prevention, and control activities.  Graduates of the FETP program serve in their native country and provide  links between CDC and their respective ministries of health. CDC officials  said that trainees from its international programs have frequently provided  important information on disease outbreaks. Another international  program sponsored by CDC is the International Emerging Infections  Program (IEIP). IEIP sites are modeled on the EIP sites in the United  States that integrate disease surveillance, applied research, training, and  prevention and control activities. According to CDC, the IEIP in Thailand  that was established in 2001 played a key role in the global response to the  SARS and avian influenza outbreaks. DOD has also taken steps to increase  the international disease surveillance expertise by providing various types  of laboratory and epidemiology training through its overseas laboratories.", "Some federal agencies and departments also provide direct technical  assistance to foreign countries both directly and through WHO. For  example, CDC officials told us they provide support in the form of  technical assistance and training that supports the development of major  international networks that are critical to enhancing global surveillance,  such as the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Additionally,  throughout the SARS outbreak, CDC was the foremost participant in  WHO\u2019s multilateral efforts to identify and respond to SARS in Asia, with  CDC officials constituting about two-thirds of the 115 public health  experts deployed to the region. CDC also contributed its expertise and  resources by conducting epidemiological studies, laboratory testing, and  clinical research on the disease. Specifically, CDC assigned  epidemiologists, laboratory scientists, hospital infection control  specialists, and environmental engineers to provide technical assistance in  Asia. CDC also assigned senior epidemiologists to work locally with a  WHO team to investigate the outbreak in China.

Officials from each of the state public  health departments we interviewed reported that at least one syndromic  surveillance system was used in their state. These systems collect  information on syndromes from a variety of sources. For example, the  Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system, used in four  of the states in our study, automatically gathers patient data from hospital  emergency room visits. This system identifies patients\u2019 chief medical  complaints, classifies the complaints according to syndrome, and  aggregates that data in order to look for anomalous increases in certain  syndromes that may reveal an infectious disease outbreak.", "Another syndromic surveillance system used by some state public health  officials that we interviewed, the National Retail Data Monitor (NRDM),  collects data from retail sources instead of hospitals. As of February 2004,  NRDM collected sales data from about 19,000 stores, including  pharmacies, in order to monitor sales patterns in such items as over-the  counter influenza medications for signs of a developing infectious disease  outbreak. The system looks for unusual sales patterns\u2014such as a spike in  the number of over-the-counter medications purchased in a particular city  or county\u2014that might indicate the onset of an infectious disease outbreak.  The system monitors the data automatically on a daily basis and generates  summaries of sales patterns using timelines and maps.", "At the federal level, CDC has recently introduced a new syndromic  surveillance system called BioSense. BioSense aggregates data from  numerous electronic sources to enhance early detection of possible  disease outbreaks, bioterrorist threats, or other urgent public health  threats. The data are collected and analyzed by CDC and also made  available to state and local public health departments. In the first quarter  of 2004, BioSense became available for use, gathering data from DOD and  the Department of Veterans Affairs medical treatment facilities in the  United States and more than 10,000 over-the-counter retail drug stores  nationwide. According to CDC, the agency plans to add other data  sources, such as data from laboratories, poison control centers, health  plan medical records, nursing call centers, emergency medical service  dispatches, health care provider billing claims, and pharmacy  prescriptions.", "Since the end of 2001, DOD has made enhancements designed to improve  its syndromic surveillance system, ESSENCE. Specifically, DOD expanded  ESSENCE to include data from all military treatment facilities worldwide  and data from various civilian sources, such as civilian intensive care  units, over-the-counter pharmacies, school attendance records and  laboratory test results. In addition, DOD officials told us they are in the  process of improving ESSENCE\u2019s mapping capabilities and developing  more advanced statistical algorithms for identifying anomalous increases  in syndromes. DOD officials also told us that they are exploring additional  data sources for ESSENCE, such as large health maintenance  organizations, and working on improving the speed at which the system\u2019s  data can be accessed.", "Although syndromic surveillance systems are used by federal agencies and  departments and in all 11 of the states whose officials we interviewed,  concerns about this approach to surveillance have been raised. Relative to  traditional methods of surveillance, syndromic surveillance systems are  costly to maintain and still largely untested. According to a recent IOM  report, the resource requirements for automatic reporting of syndromic  data from hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments are currently  high, but these costs may lessen over time with standardization of  software. Syndromic surveillance systems require relatively more  resources to operate than other types of surveillance systems, in part,  because their sensitivity makes them more likely to issue false alarms,  which in turn have the potential to overtax public health systems.  Furthermore, some state officials as well as public health experts noted  that it has not been demonstrated in a rigorous way that these systems can  detect emerging infectious diseases or bioterrorist events more rapidly  than they would otherwise be detected through traditional surveillance.  According to public health experts, evaluation tools, performance  measures and evidence-based standards for syndromic surveillance are  needed. CDC recently published a \u201cFramework for Evaluating Public  Health Surveillance Systems for Early Detection of Outbreaks.\u201d This  framework creates a standardized evaluation methodology intended to  help public health officials improve decision-making regarding the  implementation of syndromic and other surveillance systems for outbreak  detection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Health Officials Are Implementing Initiatives Designed to Enhance Public Health Communications and Disease Reporting, but Some Initiatives Are Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["CDC is taking steps to enhance its two public health communications  systems, HAN and Epi-X, which are used in disease surveillance and  response efforts.

Similarly, CDC has expanded Epi-X by giving  officials at other federal agencies and departments, such as DOD, the  ability to use the system. In addition, CDC is also adding users to Epi-X  from local health departments, giving access to CDC staff in other  countries, and making the system available to FETPs located in 21  countries. Finally, CDC is facilitating Epi-X\u2019s interface with other data  sources by allowing users to access GPHIN, the system that searches Web- based media for information on infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.", "In addition to the efforts to enhance communication systems, public  health officials are taking steps to enhance the reporting of notifiable  disease data and other surveillance information. Some of the state public  health officials we interviewed told us that they have implemented efforts  to increase health care providers\u2019 reporting of notifiable diseases to their  state health department. For example, an official from one state we  interviewed said that the state health department now uses liaisons that  regularly visit health care providers to establish regular communication  between the providers and local public health authorities. The liaisons  remind the providers of their responsibility for reporting cases of  notifiable diseases to the state. Similarly, the Commissioner of Health from  another state sent letters to health care providers in the state, reminding  the providers of their important role in recognizing an infectious disease  outbreak or bioterrorist event. The letter contained information on  changes to the state\u2019s notifiable disease list, a listing of references and  Internet sites for clinical information on specific pathogens, and  information on the Internet-based communication system the state  department of health used to disseminate and gather sensitive information  regarding disease surveillance.", "Despite some states\u2019 efforts to increase disease reporting by health care  providers, some public health experts believe that underreporting by  providers is still a problem. According to the IOM, many health care  providers do not fully understand their role in infectious disease  surveillance, including the importance of prompt reporting of clinical  information to relevant public health authorities. According to the study,  few medical or other health science schools\u2019 curricula emphasize the  importance of and the requirements for reporting diseases of public health  significance; residency programs seldom address the need for health care  provider participation in public health surveillance; and little, if any,  continuing medical education exists on the topic, nor is it widely  integrated into board certification exams. Furthermore, despite the  existence of state notifiable disease lists and related laws, some providers  may be unaware of basic reporting requirements. One study noted that  health care providers failed to report disease information because they  often lacked information about what, when, and how to report such  information.", "Other efforts by public health officials to enhance notifiable disease  reporting target the information technology used in such reporting. For  example, public health officials in several states told us that they are  enhancing their electronic systems to permit providers in their states to  report notifiable diseases to the states\u2019 health department. For example,  public health officials in one state told us that they are enhancing their  reporting system to permit 20,000 to 30,000 physicians to report 61  notifiable diseases using an integrated, secure, Web-based system.  Similarly, some states have also implemented electronic reporting systems  that obtain information on notifiable diseases directly from clinical  laboratories. When the laboratories conduct tests for health care providers  on cases that may involve notifiable diseases, in some states the results of  those tests\u2014if positive\u2014are automatically reported to the state health  department. Several state public health officials we interviewed told us  that they receive electronic laboratory reports from clinical laboratories in  their state. Other state officials told us that they were developing or  piloting this capability. According to state public health officials and IOM,  automated laboratory reporting of notifiable infectious diseases has been  shown to improve the timeliness of reporting on these diseases.", "At the federal level, CDC is deploying a technological initiative known as  NEDSS. According to CDC, this initiative is designed to make the  electronic reporting from both clinical laboratories and practitioners to  state and local health departments and from state and local health  departments to CDC more timely, accurate, and complete. CDC officials  said that NEDSS will facilitate reporting by supporting a unified and  standardized way of transmitting information to CDC, and result in the  integration of 60 to 100 different systems used by state health departments  to report disease data to CDC. As part of the NEDSS initiative, CDC is  developing an architecture that consists of a set of standards that can be  used for creating interoperable systems. These standards comprise   (1) data standards, (2) parameters for an Internet-based communications  infrastructure and (3) policy-level agreements on data access and sharing  as well as on protections for confidentiality. CDC has also developed  ready-to-use software\u2014the NEDSS-Base system (NBS)\u2014that operates  within these standards. State and local health departments that are  updating their reporting systems have the option of either using the NBS  software or developing their own systems based on the common NEDSS  architecture.", "According to CDC, when fully implemented, the use of NEDSS- architecture-compliant-software or NBS software by local and state public  health departments and CDC will allow public health partners to exchange  data, merge data from different laboratories, and obtain information on  cross-jurisdictional outbreaks. Whereas states currently use multiple and  sometimes duplicative systems to report different notifiable diseases to  CDC, NEDSS will replace many of these systems with a single system. For  example, the National Electronic Telecommunications System for  Surveillance (NETSS), STD*MIS (sexually transmitted diseases), TIMMS  (tuberculosis), STELLAR (lead poisoning in children) and EHARS (HIV)  will be consolidated through NEDSS.", "Despite the advantages that may be gained from creating interoperable  systems, the NEDSS initiative has not been implemented in many states.  The NEDSS initiative first began in fiscal year 2000, and by May 2004,  only 4 states that use the NBS software are able to transfer data to CDC.  According to CDC, 10 states are actively deploying NEDSS-architecture- compliant-software or NBS software and 16 states are in the preliminary  process of developing their technical and security infrastructure to  accommodate NEDSS standards. Some state officials told us that even  though they have developed electronic systems that comply with the  NEDSS standards, they have not been able to transfer data to CDC using  their systems because the systems are still not compatible. CDC officials  said that the national industry standards on design, development, and data  transport have continued to evolve and they are working with the states to  receive data from those who opted to use the NEDDS architecture to  develop their own compliant software."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Public Health Officials Have Enhanced Federal Coordination on Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Expanded Training Programs, but Surveillance Efforts Still Face Challenges", "paragraphs": ["CDC, USDA, and FDA have made recent efforts to enhance their  coordination of zoonotic disease surveillance.

As of May 2004, 10 veterinary  laboratories have been added to the LRN, and CDC officials told us that  they have plans to add more veterinary laboratories in the future. In  addition, CDC officials told us it has appointed a staff person whose  responsibility, in part, is to assist in finding ways to enhance zoonotic  disease coordination efforts among federal agencies and departments and  with other organizations. This person is helping CDC reconstruct a  working group of officials from CDC, USDA, and FDA to coordinate on  zoonotic disease surveillance.

CDC officials also said that the feasibility of a pilot  project to demonstrate this proposed integrated zoonotic disease  surveillance system is being explored. Finally, USDA officials told us that  they hired 23 wildlife biologists in the fall of 2003 to coordinate disease  surveillance, monitoring, and management activities among USDA, CDC,  states and other agencies. While each of these initiatives is intended to  enhance the surveillance of zoonotic diseases, each is still in the planning  stage or the very early stages of implementation.", "Another way CDC has worked to enhance disease surveillance is through  its support for epidemiological training programs. In general, these  programs are aimed at developing an experienced workforce for state and  local public health departments and disease surveillance systems. For  example, in recent years, CDC has expanded its EIS program. CDC has  increased the number of participants in this program from 148 in 2001 to  167 in 2003. During this time period, CDC has also increased the number of  EIS participants assigned to state and local health departments from 25-35  per year to about 50 per year. CDC has also enhanced the type of training  the participants receive. All participants now receive training in terrorism  preparedness and emergency response.", "CDC has also expanded its training programs intended to increase the  expertise involved in international disease surveillance efforts. For  example, CDC is helping to implement a comprehensive system of  surveillance and containment of global infectious diseases through the  expansion of its IEIP and the creation of the Field Epidemiology and  Laboratory Training Program (FELTP). CDC is enhancing a  comprehensive global surveillance and response network for infectious  diseases by adding two new IEIP sites in China and Kenya and by  expanding activities in the existing site in Thailand. CDC officials said that  the program in Kenya began in June 2004 and they may be able to begin  recruitment for the program in China by the end of 2004. CDC is  expanding its FETP program by creating a laboratory training component,  known as the FELTP. According to CDC officials, FELTPs are designed to  increase laboratory capacity in overseas locations. Currently, there is one  FELTP located in Kenya whose students recently began their training  program.", "The efforts to build disease surveillance capacities abroad, which were  discussed above, may also help domestic disease surveillance efforts.  According to a recent IOM report, surveillance of and response to  emerging infectious diseases in other parts of the world can directly  benefit the United States as well as the country in which the disease is  detected. According to the IOM, some disease outbreaks that have been  detected internationally allowed the United States to develop diagnostic  tests, prepare for influenza outbreaks, or recognize zoonotic threats like  avian influenza. Similarly, the IOM points out that coordination between  U.S. and European sentinel surveillance systems have allowed several  countries, including the United States, to remove products from the  market that were contaminated with pathogens.", "On the other hand, efforts to enhance international disease surveillance  still face challenges. Foremost among these are limitations in the amount  of surveillance information that many countries can collect and therefore  share with international partners. Many developing countries lack health  care infrastructures and the ability to administer simple diagnostic tests  for diseases such as tuberculosis. We have previously reported that few  developing countries have public heath laboratories. Also, many  developing countries lack the ability to compile basic health indices, such  as death rates, causes of death, or general disease burden. Furthermore,  even countries with public health infrastructures may lack developed  surveillance systems for reporting crucial disease information to  authorities.
