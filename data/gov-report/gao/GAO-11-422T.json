EPA's policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy, society, and government. As such, it operates in a highly complex and controversial regulatory arena. In recent years, GAO's work has identified several significant and persistent challenges across a range of EPA programs and activities and has proposed corrective actions to enable the agency to more effectively accomplish its mission. Based on this work, this testimony highlights some of the major management challenges facing EPA today, the agency's efforts to address them, and the work GAO believes remains to be done."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of recent GAO work, key management challenges facing EPA include the following: (1) Improving agencywide management. EPA has struggled for years to deploy its staff efficiently and in a manner that would do the most good. It has also sought to improve the reliability of its environmental enforcement and other program data, as well as its coordination among EPA offices and with other agencies to improve efficiency and leverage limited resources. Generally, the agency's initiatives in these areas have yet to achieve their intended goals. In this connection, GAO is currently examining the extent to which EPA is taking a coordinated approach in managing its laboratories. (2) Transforming EPA's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals. EPA has yet to develop sufficient chemical assessment information for limiting public exposure to many chemicals that may pose substantial health risks. As a consequence, GAO in February 2011 reaffirmed the need to transform EPA's process for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals by continuing it as one if GAO's \"high-risk\" areas warranting increased attention by Congress and the executive branch. (3) Reducing pollution in the nation's waters. Among the nation's most pressing water quality problems with which EPA and other stakeholders struggle are the contributions of diffuse, or \"nonpoint,\" sources of pollution and the challenges posed by deterioration in the nation's premier watersheds, such as the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes. Multibillion-dollar liabilities associated with replacing and upgrading the nation's aging water infrastructure are a looming issue that, if not sufficiently addressed, will impact water quality. (4) Addressing the cost and pace of cleanup at Superfund and other hazardous waste sites. EPA's Superfund program is intended to ensure the cleanup of hazardous waste sites on both private and public lands. Nonetheless, 30 years after the program began, GAO found that cleanup costs for remaining hazardous waste sites will not only be substantial, but that problems with the accuracy and completeness of data on the amount of remaining cleanup work prevent EPA from reliably estimating these costs. (5) Addressing the agency's emerging role in climate change issues. As a highly interdisciplinary issue, climate change poses management challenges for the federal government at large. For EPA, particular climate change-related challenges pertain to the legal and administrative barriers facing the agency in its ongoing efforts to reduce carbon emissions, its difficulties in coordinating activities involving numerous other agencies and other levels of government, and its efforts to account for and manage data on greenhouse gas emissions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made a number of recommendations intended to improve EPA's programs by, for example, improving the information upon which key regulatory decisions are based; improving oversight over enforcement and other key program activities; and improving EPA's coordination with other agencies in program delivery. EPA has concurred with most of the recommendations and has taken steps to implement some of them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss management challenges facing the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These challenges are made all  the more important by increased demand for improved government  performance and responsiveness, as well as greater accountability. EPA  operates in a highly complex and controversial regulatory arena, and its  policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy,  society, and government.", "As you know, EPA\u2019s responsibilities are carried out under a complex array  of environmental laws, including the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, the  Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and others. The legal framework  within which the agency operates is also shaped by numerous court orders  resulting from lawsuits that have been filed over the years by states,  concerned citizens, special interest groups, and others. Structurally, EPA  comprises headquarters offices largely aligned with its primary authorizing  statutes and 10 regional offices that help to implement these statutes  across the country. The regional offices possess considerable autonomy,  which has sometimes led to questions and concerns about variation from  region to region in enforcement and other aspects of program delivery.  The agency\u2019s budget, while rising in nominal terms from $7.8 billion for  fiscal year 2000 to $10.4 billion for fiscal year 2010, has remained relatively  flat in real terms.  EPA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget included about $1.1 billion  for clean air and climate change, $4.9 billion for clean water (which  includes federal funding for both the Clean Water and Drinking Water  state revolving funds), and $1.8 billion for land restoration.", "My testimony today updates our 2009 report on EPA\u2019s management  challenges and is drawn largely from our work over the last several years  (see Related GAO Products at the end of this statement). Many of these  reports included recommendations intended to improve EPA\u2019s programs  by enhancing the information it uses to manage its programs and  strengthening internal controls. EPA has generally concurred with our  recommendations and has taken steps to implement some of them. I will  highlight some notable issues arising from our recent work. Some are  long-standing issues involving the agency\u2019s core programs; others are  emerging challenges for which we believe the agency will need to become  better prepared. With this in mind, I would like to focus my remarks today  on the need to (1) improve key aspects of the agency\u2019s overall  management, (2) transform EPA\u2019s processes for assessing and controlling  toxic chemicals, (3) reduce pollution in the nation\u2019s waters, (4) address  the cost and pace of cleanup at Superfund and other hazardous waste  sites, and (5) address the agency\u2019s emerging role in climate change issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improving Agencywide Management", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s size, geographical dispersion, reliance on its partnership with state  and local governments, and broad and complex mission all combine to  make management of the agency a formidable challenge.

In 2008, we reported that rather than establishing a process for  budgeting and allocating human resources that fully considers the  agency\u2019s current workload, EPA makes requests for funding and staffing  by making incremental adjustments, largely based on historical  precedent. We noted that the agency has not comprehensively analyzed  its workload and workforce since the late 1980s to determine the optimal  numbers and distribution of staff agencywide. Moreover, EPA\u2019s human  capital management systems have not kept pace with changing legis requirements and priorities, changes in environmental conditions in  different regions of the country, and the much more active role that states  now play in carrying out day-to-day-activities of federal environmental  programs.", "To remedy its piecemeal methods for determining workload and staff  allocation, we recommended that EPA improve its workforce planning by  identifying the factors driving its workload and developing more accurate  allocation systems for deploying staff with the requisite skills and  capabilities to areas where they are most needed. The agency has taken  some recent steps to improve its workforce planning. For example, in 2009  it hired a contractor to provide information about the agency\u2019s workload  in several key areas, such as staffing levels and workload shifts. In  addition, the agency asked one of its advisory councils to help in  developing its next strategic workforce plan to supersede the last plan  established in 2006, which delegated responsibilities to the various offices.  We have not evaluated whether EPA has made meaningful progress in  these efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring Consistent Environmental Enforcement and Compliance Data", "paragraphs": ["EPA has authorized states to carry out many of the day-to-day  responsibilities for timely and appropriate enforcement of environmental  laws and regulations. We have noted instances in the past where EPA has  not (1) identified the causes of poorly performing state enforcement  programs, (2) informed the public about how well the states are  implementing their enforcement responsibilities, or (3) assessed the  performance of EPA\u2019s regional offices in carrying out their state oversight  responsibilities\u2014performance that has generally proven to be inconsistent  over the years.", "EPA has been slow to improve long-standing problems with often  incomplete and unreliable enforcement data. Among other things,  enforcement data are needed to accurately identify and characterize  regulated entities to improve the transparency and accuracy of the  agency\u2019s reports to Congress and the public when reporting on the  effectiveness of the enforcement programs. Furthermore, we have  reported problems in how EPA calculates and reports on measures of  program effectiveness, such as penalties, the value of injunctive relief, and  any resulting reduction in pollution. These problems may undermine the  transparency and accuracy of EPA\u2019s reported outcomes and cause the  agency to either over- or underreport its enforcement achievements.", "In recent years, we have recommended ways for EPA to enhance its  oversight of regional and state enforcement activities so as to implement  environmental programs consistent with the requirements of federal  statutes and regulations. In particular, we recommended that EPA develop  an action plan for addressing enforcement problems identified in state  programs; ensure that states have sufficient resources to implement and  enforce programs as authorized by EPA; and help the states improve their  capacity for enforcement. We also suggested that EPA (1) routinely  assess the performance of regional and state enforcement programs and  communicate the results of these assessments to the public and the  regulated industry and (2) disclose more information when reporting  penalties and estimates of the value of injunctive relief and pollution  reduction.", "EPA has generally agreed with our recommendations and is in the process  of implementing them. In particular, the agency has developed an initiative  known as the State Review Framework that it believes will (1) address  many of the long-term problems related to providing fair, consistent, and  transparent enforcement throughout the country and (2) obtain accurate  data that can be used to determine the extent of state compliance with  enforcement standards and the need for corrective actions. Still,  implementation of the framework is clearly a work in progress. During its  fiscal year 2008 evaluation of the framework, for example, EPA identified  significant noncompliance with water permitting requirements and an  unacceptably low level of enforcement activity. In response, in 2009 the  agency issued its Clean Water Act Enforcement Action Plan, which  described efforts to (1) raise the bar for EPA and state enforcement  performance; (2) inform the public clearly and fully about serious Clean  Water Act violations and actions to address them; and (3) use the latest  technology to transform the collection, use, and availability of EPA data.  In addition, EPA now publishes its State Review Framework reports and  data on enforcement performance on its Web site and has developed new  Web-based tools to help the public search and analyze the performance  data.", "EPA also stated that it would take actions to disclose more information  when reporting estimates of injunctive relief and pollution reductions and  consider our recommendation to report collected penalties. For example,  in 2010, EPA began reporting penalties in a manner that clearly indicates  that penalties are reported as assessed, rather than as collected, and began  properly presenting time-series data that are adjusted for inflation. Overall,  the agency\u2019s efforts in this area are still in their early stages, and their  success is uncertain. Much will depend on the continued commitment of  senior management, along with sufficient priority and resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordinating with Other Agencies to More Effectively Leverage Limited Resources", "paragraphs": ["EPA relies on other federal and state agencies to help implement its  programs. Given the federal deficit and the government\u2019s long-term fiscal  challenges, it is imperative that EPA improve coordination with its federal  and state partners to reduce administrative burdens, redundant activities,  and inefficient uses of federal resources. For example, EPA and other  federal agencies may work together to fund water infrastructure projects.  In 2009, we reported that EPA and six federal agencies obligated $1.4  billion for drinking water and wastewater projects to assist communities  in the U.S.-Mexico border region from fiscal years 2000 through 2008.  Nevertheless, we found that the agencies\u2019 efforts to fund these projects  were ineffective because the agencies, with the exception of the Indian  Health Service, had not comprehensively assessed the region\u2019s needs and  lacked coordinated policies and processes for selecting and building  projects. As a result, we suggested that Congress may wish to consider  establishing an interagency task force to develop a plan for coordinating  funding to address the region\u2019s most pressing needs.", "In addition to funding water infrastructure projects, EPA has coordinated  with numerous federal and state agencies as the lead agency in a multi- billion dollar effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay. We found, however,  that key commitments and plans were inconsistent with one another, and  some were viewed to be unachievable by some partners. In 2008, we  reported that the Chesapeake Bay Program (a partnership among EPA,  several states, and the Chesapeake Bay Commission) had taken several  actions in response to our findings, such as developing a strategic  framework to unify planning documents and identify how it will pursue its  goals.

Such  assessments are the cornerstone of scientifically sound environmental  decisions, policies, and regulations under a variety of statutes, including  TSCA. EPA assesses chemicals under its Integrated Risk Information  System (IRIS) program and is authorized under TSCA to obtain  information on the risks of chemicals and to control those it determines  pose an unreasonable risk. Because EPA had not developed sufficient  chemical assessment information under these programs to limit public  exposure to many chemicals that may pose substantial health risks, in  2009 we added this issue to our list of areas at high risk for waste, fraud,  abuse, and mismanagement or in need of broad-based transformation. In  a number of reports, we have also made recommendations to (1) improve  the timeliness and credibility of EPA\u2019s IRIS program, which provides  EPA\u2019s scientific position on the potential human health effects of more  than 540 chemicals, and (2) enhance EPA\u2019s ability under TSCA to, among  other things, obtain health and safety information from the chemical  industry.

In March 2008, we reported that IRIS\u2019 viability was at risk because  EPA had been unable to complete timely and credible chemical  assessments\u2014including those for chemicals of greatest concern, such as  formaldehyde and dioxin. Assessments of these two chemicals have been  in progress for 13 and 19 years, respectively. In addition, EPA had been  unable to decrease its long-standing backlog of ongoing assessments or to  keep its existing assessments current.", "In May 2009, EPA revised its IRIS assessment process. If implemented  effectively, these assessment reforms will be largely responsive to our  2008 recommendations. Among other things, they will restore EPA\u2019s  control of the process and increase its transparency. Specifically, under  the prior process, interagency reviews were required and managed by the  Office of Management and Budget, and EPA was not allowed to proceed  with assessments at various stages until the office agreed that EPA had  sufficiently responded to interagency comments. In contrast, under the  reforms, EPA is to manage the entire assessment process, and all written  comments on draft assessments provided during the interagency process  are to be part of the public record. It is too soon to determine whether the  reforms will be effective, but EPA reports it has made some progress in  addressing its assessment backlog.

In contrast to the approach taken by the European Union\u2014which  generally places the burden on companies to provide data on the  chemicals they produce and to address the risks posed by these chemicals  to human health and the environment\u2014TSCA generally places the burden  on EPA to obtain information about the roughly 80,000 chemicals in the  agency\u2019s TSCA inventory. For example, the act requires EPA to  demonstrate certain health or environmental risks before it can require  companies to further test their chemicals. Consequently, EPA does not  routinely assess the risks of the industrial chemicals already in use.", "For the approximately 700 new chemicals introduced into commerce  annually, chemical companies are required to provide EPA with certain  information in premanufacture notices, and EPA can ban or limit the  chemicals\u2019 use if the information is inadequate. Nevertheless, although 85  percent of the notices lack any health or safety test data, EPA does not  often use its authority to obtain more information. After our reports, EPA  began taking steps to address some of these issues. For example, under its  existing authorities, EPA has initiated actions on such chemicals as  mercury and lead to, for example, ban or phase out their use in certain  products. Most of these actions are in their early stages of development.", "As we reported in our February 2011 High-Risk Update, EPA needs to  continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to and support of the IRIS  program and its TSCA initiatives. Specifically, we stated that EPA needs to  ensure that its 2009 IRIS reforms are implemented effectively and that the  program can routinely provide timely and credible assessments. Regarding  TSCA, we have recommended both statutory and regulatory changes to,  among other things, provide EPA with additional authorities to obtain  health and safety information from the chemical industry and to shift more  of the burden to chemical companies for demonstrating the safety of their  chemicals.

Specifically, according to EPA, the agency plans to propose a new rule  that would regulate, in a single rule, a range of nanoscale versions of  existing chemicals as significant new uses of those chemicals. EPA also  plans to require companies to provide certain information on  nanomaterials\u2014including production volume, methods of manufacture  and processing, exposure and release, and available health and safety  studies\u2014and plans to require companies to generate test data on the  health effects of different nanomaterials. At the time our report was  released, EPA reported that it planned to propose these rules by  December 2010, but has not yet done so. While EPA continues to work on  these rules, however, products may be entering the market without EPA  review of available information on their potential risk.

Since that time,  however, other challenges have emerged and continue to confront EPA  and other levels of government in their efforts to ensure safe and abundant  water supplies for the American people. These challenges include (1) the  need to focus more attention on diffuse, or \u201cnonpoint,\u201d sources of  pollution to address the most significant of the nation\u2019s remaining water  quality problems; (2) the unique challenges posed by deterioration in the  nation\u2019s premier watersheds including, among others, the Chesapeake Bay  and Great Lakes; and (3) daunting challenges posed by the multibillion  dollar liabilities associated with replacing, maintaining, and building new  water infrastructure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Controlling Nonpoint Sources of Pollution", "paragraphs": ["The Clean Water Act\u2019s effectiveness has become increasingly challenged  by a recognition that the largest share of the nation\u2019s remaining water  quality problems are more decentralized and diffuse in nature\u2014and  therefore more difficult to monitor and regulate. One such nonpoint  pollution source, for example, is urban storm water runoff. Pollutants and  sediment carried by storm water, as well as the volume and temperature of  runoff, can alter aquatic habitats and make it hard for fish and other  organisms to survive. Polluted storm water runoff can also make fish and  shellfish unsafe to eat and can adversely affect people using fresh- and  saltwater areas for recreation. In 2007, we reported that while many  communities were still implementing their first permits for controlling  storm water runoff, several factors influence the extent to which EPA\u2019s  storm water program burdens a community, such as prior storm water  management experience. We recommended that EPA evaluate the  implementation of its storm water program, issue additional program  guidance, and consider regulatory changes to improve the quality and  consistency of activity reporting by communities. EPA agreed with our  recommendations to develop guidance to help the agency obtain better  data to evaluate the program and provided additional program guidance to  states and regions on such items as storm water pollution prevention  plans. In 2009, the agency issued a guide to assist permit writers in  strengthening storm water permits in 2010.", "The agricultural sector accounts for a large share of water problems  stemming from nonpoint sources and therefore much of the effort to  control such pollution lies within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department  of Agriculture. Crop production, for example, impairs water quality as  pesticides, fertilizer, and sediment run off fields and into nearby water  bodies. Of particular note, a 10-year, nationwide study published in 2006  by the U.S. Geological Survey detected pesticides in 97 percent of streams  in agricultural and urban watersheds. In 2009, we reported that many  experts believe that the increased use of pesticides (insecticides and  herbicides) related in particular to increased crop production for biofuels,  will likely further degrade surface and ground water quality.", "Another major source of agriculture-related pollution stems from  discharges associated with large-scale animal feeding operations. More  than a dozen government-sponsored or peer-reviewed studies since 2002  on water pollutants emitted by concentrated animal-feeding operations  found increased levels of phosphorus, nitrogen, or hormones in surface  water and groundwater near animal-feeding operations. Excessive  amounts of these nutrients can deplete oxygen in water, which could  result in fish deaths, reduced aquatic diversity, and illness in infants. Our  2008 report on the subject found that despite its long-term regulation of  concentrated animal-feeding operations, EPA still lacks comprehensive  and reliable data on the number, location, and size of the operations that  have been issued permits and the amounts of discharge they release. As a  result, EPA has neither the information it needs to assess the extent to  which these concentrated animal-feeding operations may be contributing  to water pollution, nor the information it needs to ensure compliance with  the Clean Water Act.", "The question of how well EPA is coordinating its own efforts to control  agricultural pollution with Agriculture is an important part of our ongoing  review of the agency\u2019s Nonpoint Source Management Program, established  under section 319 of the Clean Water Act. This program supports state  nonpoint source management programs, providing funds to states to  implement projects directed toward resolving nonpoint source pollution  problems. Among the key issues being addressed in this broad program  review are the extent to which EPA coordinates the implementation of its  section 319 program with similar efforts to control agricultural nonpoint  sources of pollution undertaken by Agriculture, as well as with other  federally funded efforts to control nonpoint sources of pollution (including  efforts funded through EPA\u2019s own Clean Water State Revolving Fund)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emphasizing a Watershed- Based Approach", "paragraphs": ["EPA has increasingly emphasized a \u201cwatershed-based approach\u201d that  attempts to restore and protect the nation\u2019s water resources by taking into  account the full range of stresses emanating from all pollution sources.

EPA partners with federal, state, and local agencies  and nongovernmental organizations to develop and implement approaches  that reduce pollution in our nation\u2019s significant water bodies.", "Nonetheless, after decades of effort and expense by EPA and its partners  to spearhead restoration efforts for these watersheds, we reported that  these efforts have been impeded by a lack of targeted strategies; poor  coordination among federal, state, and local stakeholders; and unrealistic  goals for ensuring that limited restoration resources are being used for the  most effective restoration activities. In 2006, for example, we  recommended that EPA ensure that the Chesapeake Bay Program develop  a coordinated implementation strategy unifying its various planning  documents and establishing a means to better target its limited resources  to the most cost-effective restoration activities. Along similar lines, in  2008 we recommended that EPA develop for its Great Lakes Initiative a  more consistent permitting strategy for controlling mercury and gather  more information to help it develop water quality standards and assess the  effect of programs intended to minimize pollutants that are exceeding  standards.", "EPA has taken some actions in response to our recommendations.

Chaired by EPA, the  committee includes six other federal agencies. Part of its responsibilities  included developing a strategy for coordinated implementation of existing  programs and projects to guide efforts to protect and restore Chesapeake  Bay.

Many of the wastewater  treatment plants and other water infrastructure built in those years,  however, have since reached, or will soon reach, the end of their design  lives.

We have noted in the past that better management techniques  can, at least to some extent, help utilities make the best use of available  dollars in their struggle to meet their infrastructure needs. We  recommended comprehensive asset management\u2014a technique whereby  water systems systematically identify their needs, set priorities and better  target their investments\u2014as a tool for helping utilities make better use of  available funds. However, additional funds\u2014or revenue from rate  increases\u2014will still likely be needed to address future needs.", "To address options for alternative funding sources for these infrastructure  needs, we have issued reports providing information on various proposals  to develop alternative funding sources and mechanisms to address current  and projected water infrastructure needs. In 2009, we reviewed one  proposal to establish a Clean Water Trust Fund, which would provide a  dedicated source of federal funding for wastewater infrastructure.  Stakeholders we interviewed disagreed over whether EPA should  administer such a trust fund as part of the Clean Water State Revolving  Fund. These stakeholders also disagreed over whether funding should be  provided as loans or grants to recipients, although a majority did agree  that funds should pay for capital projects. We also discussed potential  revenue sources for funding a Clean Water Trust Fund and obstacles to  generating revenue from these sources.", "In 2010, we examined two other proposed alternative funding sources for  water infrastructure projects: a national infrastructure bank and public- private partnerships. Concerning an infrastructure bank, stakeholders  disagreed over whether an infrastructure bank should be administered by  a federal agency or structured as a government corporation or other entity  and over which types of projects\u2014such as large infrastructure projects or  small ones\u2014should be eligible for bank financing. Stakeholders did agree,  however, that federal funds should be used to finance a bank initially but  that other mechanisms could be used to generate funds for financing  projects over the long term. Regarding public-private partnerships,  officials for the 7 municipalities that had experience with such  arrangements said that advantages of public-private partnerships include  access to nontraditional funding sources, creating potential efficiency  through economies of scale, and completing projects more quickly. These  officials also identified challenges to public-private partnerships, such as  local opposition to potential or perceived rate increases, higher interest  rates charged by private entities involved in the partnership, and increased  project costs because of complex contracts and arrangements.", "As a related matter, in 2010, we reviewed 14 states\u2019 spending of Recovery  Act funding on water infrastructure projects. The Recovery Act provided  $6 billion in additional funding for states, $2 billion for the Drinking Water  State Revolving Fund and $4 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving  Fund. We found that these states allocated the funding to 504 drinking  water projects and 890 clean water projects. We also found that the states  met Recovery Act requirements for providing Clean Water revolving fund  assistance for \u201cgreen\u201d projects (projects that included environmentally  friendly infrastructure, provided water- or energy-efficiency  improvements, or other environmentally innovative activities). We found,  however, that attention and monitoring by EPA and the states of Recovery  Act projects could be strengthened.

While responsible parties are liable  for conducting or paying for site cleanup of hazardous substances\u2014and  EPA can seek reimbursement for its cleanup costs from these parties\u2014the  parties in some cases cannot be identified or may be unwilling or  financially unable to perform the cleanup. To fund EPA-led cleanups at  nonfederal National Priorities sites, EPA uses the Hazardous Substance  Superfund (trust fund) from which EPA receives annual appropriations.  Historically, the trust fund was financed primarily by taxes on crude oil  and certain chemicals, as well as an environmental tax on corporations  based on their taxable income. The authority for these taxes expired in  1995, however, and shortly thereafter the balance in the trust fund started  to diminish. Since 2001, appropriations from general revenues have been  the largest source of funding for the trust fund. At the start of fiscal year  2009, the trust fund had a balance of $137 million. Superfund program  appropriations have averaged about $1.2 billion annually since 1981,  although the annual level of these appropriated funds has generally  declined in recent years when adjusted for inflation.", "In June 2010 we reported that EPA\u2019s cost to remediate existing and future  National Priorities sites will likely exceed current funding levels.", "Considerable work remains at most nonfederal sites on the list with  unknown or unacceptable human exposures, and some site cleanups have  not been funded at a level that is sufficient to ensure meaningful results.  Moreover, site costs are likely to increase because, according to EPA, in  the program\u2019s early years the agency focused resources on sites that  needed less construction work and were farther along in the cleanup  process. Consequently, the sites that have been on the National Priorities  List the longest without completing construction of cleanup remedies are  likely to face more complex and costly future cleanup work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resolving Data Limitations Hindering Estimates of Program Costs", "paragraphs": ["While remedial actions have been implemented or are under way at most  sites on the National Priorities List, the amount of work remaining is  unclear because, as we reported in July 2009, data on whether  construction is complete at sites do not provide a clear picture of the  amount of work that actually remains at sites, and the progress of cleanup  is even less clear for sites where construction is not complete. EPA  program status reports do not provide information on the number and  cleanup status of megasites\u2014sites with actual or expected total cleanup  costs, including removal and remedial action costs, that are expected to  amount to $50 million or more (especially mining and sediment sites). This  information could help indicate the types of conditions driving EPA\u2019s  remedy decisions at sites that were listed more recently, as well as the  impediments to cleanup progress at older sites. Additionally, these reports  do not provide information on the number of sites where responsible  parties are financially unable to help pay for cleanup activities or on the  potential impact on EPA\u2019s ability to carry out cleanup activities when it  cannot obtain reimbursement from responsible parties for agency cleanup  costs. Such information could help indicate the factors that are driving  program expenditures and potential future costs.", "Accordingly, we recommended that EPA assess the comprehensiveness  and reliability of the data the agency collects and, where necessary,  improve the data to provide aggregated information on (1) the status and  cost of cleanups at individual sites, particularly complex and expensive  sites; (2) the extent to which there are viable responsible parties at sites  on the National Priorities List; and (3) the potential financial impacts from  EPA\u2019s inability to obtain reimbursement for agency cleanup costs from  nonviable responsible parties.

We believe these  data are essential to assess EPA\u2019s future funding needs.", "As we reported in May 2010, most EPA regional offices expect an increase  in the number of sites added to the National Priorities List over the next 5  years but cannot estimate the associated cleanup costs. One factor that  could increase the number of sites eligible for the list is whether EPA  begins to assess the risks of subsurface hazardous substances leaking  upward into homes and businesses (vapor intrusion).

First, poor coordination with regulators and incomplete record reviews  have resulted in poor decision making, such as placing military personnel  in housing at risk of contamination, ultimately leading to their evacuation.  Second, because DOD had not signed interagency agreements at some of  its National Priorities List sites, EPA lacked the mechanisms to ensure that  cleanup proceeds expeditiously, is properly done, and has public input as  required by law. Third, DOD\u2019s use of performance-based contracts to clean  up installations has affected how the cleanup work was scoped and  conducted and has created pressure on contractors to operate within price  caps and meet deadlines, which may conflict with regulatory review times  and encourage the department to take shortcuts.

This finding, known as the Endangerment Finding, is the  foundation for all of EPA\u2019s efforts to regulate greenhouse gases under the  Clean Air Act. Twenty-six lawsuits have been filed challenging the  endangerment finding for greenhouse gases.

Carbon capture and storage involves capturing carbon dioxide  from a power plant\u2019s emissions, transporting it to an underground storage  location, and then injecting it into a geologic formation for long-term  storage. In addition to its formidable technological challenges, we noted  that carbon capture and storage faces significant legal and regulatory  uncertainties. We noted that EPA was addressing some of these  uncertainties (specifically by issuing a rule to govern underground  injection of carbon dioxide for geologic sequestration), but that \u201cmany of  them fall within the domain of the Departments of Energy, the Interior,  Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and other  agencies in a manner that would require collaboration between agencies  and, in many cases, coordination with state governments and other  entities.\u201d", "We recommended that EPA more comprehensively examine barriers to  the development of carbon capture and storage by identifying key issues  that fall outside the agency\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Act authority.
