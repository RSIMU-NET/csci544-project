In 1937, the Congress created a program that provided low-cost loans to ranchers, farmers, and rural residents of 17 arid and semiarid western states for water storage projects. Since that time, the Congress has changed the program to also fund water distribution systems and waste disposal facilities and to provide grant funds in addition to loans. Currently, the program, known as the Water and Waste Disposal Program, offers grants and loans to construct or modify water and/or sewer systems in rural communities that cannot obtain funding from other sources. Administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), this program is now the major federal program providing such loan and grant funds to rural America."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USDA Allocates Loan and Grant Funds to State Offices Through a Formula", "paragraphs": ["USDA administers the Water and Waste Disposal Program\u2014referred to in this report as the water and sewer program\u2014through its Rural Utilities Service. To be eligible for this program, a rural community must have a population of 10,000 or less and be financially needy, meeting low-income criteria.", "USDA headquarters allocates both loan and grant funds to its state offices through an allocation formula that it established through regulations. The formula consists of three weighted factors: rural population (50 percent), rural poverty (25 percent), and rural unemployment (25 percent). No state may receive more than 5 percent of the total loan and grant funds initially allocated. About 10 percent of both loan and grant funds are set aside in a reserve pool for emergencies, cost overruns, and other unforeseen problems. Furthermore, twice a year, USDA headquarters withdraws to its reserve pool a portion of the unobligated loan and grant funds that may remain in a state\u2019s accounts. State offices can request pooled funds and receive funding above a state\u2019s initial allocation; USDA headquarters determines how pooled funds will be distributed. Generally, these pooled funds are used to provide supplemental funding for projects that are ready to be approved. In the following fiscal year, the states receive their allocations on the basis of the formula, not on whether they spent the prior year\u2019s allocation. In fiscal year 1995, USDA headquarters withdrew about $60 million in loan and grant funds as a result of the pooling process.", "The water and sewer program has been funded at an average of $1 billion per year for the last 6 fiscal years; funding in fiscal year 1994 was about $1.3 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Administers the Water and Sewer Program Through State and District Offices", "paragraphs": ["USDA administers the water and sewer program through a network of state and district offices.

District offices administer the loan and grant program at the local level and serve as the point of contact for communities seeking assistance. Through a preapplication process, a district office obtains preliminary information to determine a community\u2019s eligibility for assistance and the proposed project\u2019s feasibility. If the community meets these requirements and funds are available, the district office asks the community to prepare a full application package.", "The district office provides the state office with data on the project, including the application package and the district office\u2019s recommendation for approval.

USDA state and district offices determine the community\u2019s ability to repay a loan, including consideration of the community\u2019s outstanding debt to USDA. These offices initially attempt to finance the project through a loan. Since USDA expects its loans to be fully repaid, district and state offices estimate what the average monthly user charges for the water and/or sewer services would have to be in order to sufficiently cover anticipated costs and avoid defaulting on the loan. Typically, a community repays its loan through monthly charges collected from the residents who use these services.", "If USDA state and district offices conclude that the loan amount would result in an onerous user charge, they consider replacing a portion of the loan with a grant to bring the user charge down to a more manageable level. In addition, officials in some states encourage the local community to obtain funding from other sources, such as state and/or other federal agencies, to reduce the amount of the USDA loan and grant funds needed. The grant amount that USDA state and district offices provide for a specific project can vary for several reasons\u2014for example, the amount of grant funds on hand, the urgency for the project, and competing demands for grant funds within the district and across the state.", "There are two principal limits on the grant provided for a particular project. First, legislation limits the amount of the grant to 75 percent of the project development costs and provides for higher grants for projects in communities that have lower population and income levels. By regulation, USDA limits some communities having a somewhat higher median household income to a maximum grant of 55 percent of the project development costs. Second, under USDA regulations, grants cannot be so large that they cause average monthly user charges to be lower than those prevailing in the area. A state office may also fund a project at less than the allowable amount if its grant allocations are not sufficient to provide maximum grant funds for that project.", "To determine the yearly user charge for a project, USDA state and district offices consider costs in four categories: debt service, operations and maintenance, reserve fund, and other costs. These offices add the yearly debt service calculation\u2014including outstanding USDA debt\u2014to the yearly costs for operations and maintenance to arrive at the total yearly cost.", "When applicable, these offices also add the cost of maintaining a reserve fund (generally 10 percent of debt service), which is used to replace certain types of equipment that have a relatively short useful life. This reserve fund should not be large enough to build a substantial surplus. Ordinarily, the total reserve will be equal to one average annual loan installment, accumulating at a rate of one-tenth of the total each year. In addition, USDA state and district offices may consider other costs, such as funded depreciation and delinquent accounts. To arrive at the total grant amount, these offices determine how much debt service a community can afford.

A community may not receive the maximum grant if further calculations of the debt service amount that the community can afford reveal that the grant should be less. A key factor in estimating affordability is determining how much the average customer can pay for water and/or sewer service on the basis of a community\u2019s median household income. USDA officials may override this affordability measure and increase or decrease the grant amount to bring the user charge in line with the average charges paid by comparable communities for similar systems.

But the formula\u2019s reliance on poverty data can result in more funding to a state that has more resources to help itself than its poverty data would indicate. Such a state may have both a relatively high average income and a high level of poverty. Also, poverty data are not adjusted for cost-of-living differences across states.", "Second, the formula partially provides a means for measuring a state\u2019s ability to pay for needed water or sewer services. The current formula\u2019s unemployment factor provides an indirect measure of a state\u2019s financial capacity but does not directly address a state\u2019s ability to pay for services.

According to USDA, rural workers are more likely to rely on two or more part-time jobs rather than one full-time job. These part-time jobs do not show up in unemployment statistics. Also, the unemployment rate may not be representative of the economic condition of self-employed farmers, whose employment status is unlikely to change in good or bad times.", "On the other hand, the current formula does not adjust for cost differences. It does not recognize that the costs for building and maintaining water and sewer projects differ from one state to another. These costs can differ because of state-to-state differences in labor costs or other inputs as well as the amount of resources needed to accomplish the project.
