The total number of women's teams increased by 3,784 teams, compared to an increase of 36 men's teams. In all, 963 schools added teams and 307 discontinued teams since 1992-93. The two factors cited most often as greatly influencing the decision to add or discontinue teams were the need to address student interest in particular sports and the need to meet gender equity goals and requirements. Schools that discontinued men's teams also found the need to reallocate the athletic budget to other sports. Colleges and universities that discontinued a team typically took three months or less between originating the proposal and making the final decision. Most schools informed members of the campus community of the possibility that the team would be discontinued, and most held meetings with campus groups before making the final decision. Most schools offered to help affected athletes transfer to other schools, and students receiving athletics-related financial aid continued to receive financial aid for at least some period after the team was disbanded. Schools that were able to add one or more teams without discontinuing others used various strategies to increase athletic program revenue and contain costs. Some schools relied on the institution's general fund, while others used private sources and athletic facility rental fees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 400,000 American undergraduate college and university students  participate in intercollegiate athletics each year. During the last 2 decades,  the number of college athletes and the sports in which they participate  have changed markedly. Colleges and universities across the country have  added many sports teams and discontinued others. In response to these  changes, the Congress included provisions in the Higher Education  Amendments of 1998 that require GAO to study participation in athletics,  including schools\u2019 decisions to add or discontinue sports teams. While the  mandate also required information on high school and 2-year college  athletics, because of limited readily available information and the difficulty  of collecting comparable information from these schools, as agreed with  your offices, we focused only on 4-year intercollegiate athletics. This report  answers the following questions:  How did the number of men\u2019s and women\u2019s intercollegiate sports  participants and teams at 4-year colleges and universities change in the  2 decades since the1981\u201382 school year?", "How many colleges and universities added and discontinued teams  since the 1992\u201393 school year, and what influenced their most recent  decisions to add and discontinue teams?", "How did colleges and universities make and implement decisions to  discontinue intercollegiate sports teams?", "When colleges and universities added teams, what types of strategies  did they use to avoid discontinuing sports teams or severely reducing  their funding?", "To determine changes in the numbers of participants and teams at 4-year  colleges and universities, we obtained statistics from the two largest  national intercollegiate sports associations for 4-year colleges and  universities\u2014the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the  National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Information for  these schools covered 18 years\u2014school years 1981\u201382 through 1998\u201399.  Although these data are unverified, they are widely used by researchers to  study this topic. To gather information to respond to the other questions,  we sent a questionnaire covering the 1992\u201393 to 1999\u20132000 school years to  athletic directors at all 1,310 4-year schools that belong to one of these two  associations. We received responses from 91 percent of these schools. For  detailed information on schools\u2019 experiences in attempting to add sports  teams without substantially reducing opportunities for other athletes, we  also visited four colleges and universities.

At many  schools, intercollegiate athletic competition serves primarily to meet the  needs of student-athletes\u2014to give them opportunities to develop their  athletic ability as they pursue their courses of study. Schools also view  intercollegiate athletics as a means of recruiting prospective students. At  schools with large athletic programs, sports serve as an important focal  point for students, faculty and staff, alumni, surrounding communities, and  the national television audience.", "Typically, schools with the largest number of athletic programs and  facilities belong to Division I-A of the NCAA, and those with smaller  programs are members of NCAA Divisions II or III or the second major  national collegiate association, NAIA. Most 4-year postsecondary  institutions with intercollegiate athletic programs participate in one of  these two associations. NCAA, the larger, administers intercollegiate  athletics for over 1,000 4-year (baccalaureate degree-granting) schools.  Division I member schools are further divided into three categories\u2014I-A, I- AA, and I-AAA\u2014with those that have larger football programs generally  placed in I-A and those without football programs in I-AAA. Division I-AA  schools sponsor football but are not subject to the spectator attendance  requirements that apply to Division I-A schools. In April 2000, NAIA  consisted of 330 member institutions. The NAIA does not have divisions  except for basketball and football, which each have Divisions I and II.", "Although no federal monies fund intercollegiate sports programs, federal  involvement has arisen in part as a result of civil rights legislation. For  example, at schools receiving federal financial assistance, all education  programs and activities\u2014including intercollegiate athletic programs\u2014are  subject to title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits  discrimination on the basis of sex. Federal regulations implementing title  IX require that men and women be provided equitable opportunities to  participate in intercollegiate athletics, and equitable scholarships, facilities,  equipment, supplies, and other benefits. The Department of Education\u2019s  Office for Civil Rights assesses schools\u2019 compliance with these  requirements. To comply with requirements concerning equitable  opportunities to participate in intercollegiate sports, schools must meet  any one of the three following criteria, which Education refers to as parts  of a three-part test: (1) intercollegiate-level participation opportunities for  male and female students are provided in numbers substantially  proportionate to their respective enrollments, or (2) the institution can  show a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is  demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the  members of the underrepresented gender, or (3) it can be demonstrated  that the interests and abilities of the members of the underrepresented  gender have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Women Made Substantial Gains in Intercollegiate Sports Participation", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1980s, the number of women participating in intercollegiate  sports has increased substantially.

The smaller Division I-A school revitalized a business  relationship with the chief executive officer of a local private firm. This  individual\u2019s prominence, in turn, encouraged financial support from the  rest of the business community. Substantial donations from fans and locally  based corporations also enabled the school to add new teams and build  facilities such as a new football stadium, a sports complex with a softball  field, a track, a soccer field, and a planned Olympic-sized pool. Similarly, at  the larger Division I-A school, large donations helped the school to add  teams and increase the capacity of its football stadium, build a new  basketball and ice hockey arena, and upgrade locker facilities.", "Rental fees. Another revenue-generating strategy was to rent out athletic  facilities for other purposes and use the fees to expand the athletic  program. For example, the football stadiums or basketball arenas at the  Division I-A schools were used to host cultural and entertainment events  such as concerts, or to serve as venues for prominent athletic events such  as a World Cup soccer match. In addition, the smaller Division I-A school  took advantage of its proximity to a prominent venue by letting the public  use the football stadium parking lot to accommodate overflow event  parking; the annual proceeds of $200,000 were all allocated to the women\u2019s  program. At the Division III school, local high school teams rented the  football field for practice and special athletic events.", "In addition to focusing on raising revenue, one athletic director told us that  it was important to maintain flexibility in the use of funds available to the  athletic department. For example, the larger Division I-A school\u2019s athletic  department requires that any earnings in excess of a specified rate of return  on endowment funds designated for specific teams be available for general  intercollegiate athletic department uses. This gives the athletic director  greater flexibility in allocating resources.", "All four schools we visited also took various steps to reduce current or  avoid incurring additional expenditures. These included the following  strategies:   Recruiting most prospective student-athletes via telephone rather than   Denying requests for some teams to be elevated from club to varsity   Replacing a retiring full-time faculty member with a coach who also  assumed other administrative duties,   Limiting the size of the football team roster,  Trimming administrative costs,   Not awarding the maximum number of scholarships allowed, and  Limiting team travel outside the region to one trip every 2 to 3 years to  minimize travel expenses.", "Another cost-containment strategy involved establishing partnerships  between the school and the local community. Such partnerships reflected  the schools\u2019 ability to capitalize on the unique characteristics of their  geographic location. For example, the larger Division I-A school planned to  undertake a cost-sharing project with the city and local school district to  build a boathouse on a local river that would accommodate rowing teams  from the university, high school, and general public. The smaller Division I- A school teamed with a local hospital offering a nationally recognized  sports medicine program. Through the arrangement, the hospital provides  free services, including a portable medical facility at sports events and  physical screenings for each athlete. The Division III school formed a  partnership with a locally based professional men\u2019s basketball team.

Some schools were members of both  associations. For example, of the 787 NCAA members and 515 NAIA  members in 1981\u201382, 117 were dual-membership schools. By 1998\u201399,  NCAA had 1,041 members and NAIA had 339 members, 61 of which were  dual members as of April 1999, according to the NCAA. Based on the  number of teams and average team sizes, we estimated that these schools  accounted for about 3 percent of male and 2 percent of female participants  in 1997\u201398. Because dual-membership schools report their participation  statistics to both associations, we counted their statistics only once to  avoid double-counting the numbers of teams and participants. The adjusted  participation statistics were used to calculate net change in number of  teams, number of participants, and participation rates between 1981\u201382  and 1998\u201399. To estimate rates of participation, we divided the total  estimated number of participants for both associations by the estimated  total number of full-time undergraduates enrolled at all 4-year institutions.  To the extent that an individual student participated in more than one  sport, our calculation of the number of participants may be overstated  because these individuals are counted more than once in the statistics. In  addition, some 4-year institutions are not members of either NAIA or  NCAA, and they were excluded from our analyses. Although we did not  verify the accuracy of the statistics provided by the NCAA and NAIA, they  are the best available data and are widely used by researchers to study  intercollegiate athletic participation.", "To respond to the other three questions, we developed and administered a  questionnaire to gather information from athletic directors at all 4-year  colleges and universities that were members of either the NAIA or NCAA.  We pretested a draft questionnaire at six schools and subsequently revised  it based on their comments. In May 2000, we mailed the final questionnaire  to 1,310 institutions including 326 NAIA members and 1,040 NCAA  members (both active and provisional members.) This included 56 4-year  colleges and universities that were members of both NCAA and NAIA. By  October 2000, we had received 1,191 usable questionnaire responses for an  overall response rate of 91 percent. In some cases, however, respondents  did not respond to all applicable questions.", "The questionnaire asked athletic directors for the total number of women\u2019s  and men\u2019s intercollegiate sports teams added and discontinued during the  1992\u201393 to 1999\u20132000 school-year period. When calculating the number of  new teams added, we excluded teams that had not yet begun participating  in intercollegiate competition by the end of the 1999\u20132000 school year.  Similarly, when calculating the number of teams discontinued, we excluded  teams whose last day of intercollegiate competition was after the end of the  1999\u20132000 school year. We asked each school that added or discontinued a  team to respond to additional questions concerning only the most recently  added and most recently discontinued men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports teams.  We reviewed athletic directors\u2019 questionnaire responses for consistency  and in many cases contacted them or their staff to resolve inconsistencies,  but we did not otherwise verify the information provided in the  questionnaire responses.", "To identify types of strategies that colleges and universities used to avoid  discontinuing sports teams or severely reducing their funding, we used the  questionnaire to collect information on how schools paid for new teams.  We analyzed these responses for schools that had added some teams  without discontinuing others. To get some specific examples of how  schools augmented their athletic program without eliminating teams or  severely reducing their funding, we visited four selected colleges and  universities that were NCAA member schools. We chose these schools in  order to achieve variation in a number of characteristics, including  geographic diversity, whether the school was public or private, size of the  athletic department budget, whether the school awarded athletic  scholarships, whether sports were profitable, and whether the school  sponsored football. At each school, we interviewed the athletic director  and other staff involved in administering the athletic program and toured  the athletic facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Joel I.
