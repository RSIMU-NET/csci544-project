GAO reviewed (1) plants' performance in controlling and accounting for their spent nuclear fuel, (2) the effectiveness of NRC's regulations and oversight of the plants' performance, and (3) NRC's actions to respond to plants' problems controlling their spent fuel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear power plants' performance in controlling and accounting for their spent fuel has been uneven. Most recently, three plants--Vermont Yankee and Humboldt Bay (California) in 2004 and Millstone (Connecticut) in 2000--have reported missing spent fuel. Earlier, several other plants also had missing or unaccounted for spent fuel rods or rod fragments. NRC regulations require plants to maintain accurate records of their spent nuclear fuel and to conduct a physical inventory of the material at least once a year. The regulations, however, do not specify how physical inventories are to be done. As a result, plants differ in the regulations' implementation. For example, physical inventories at plants varied from a comprehensive verification of the spent fuel to an office review of the records and paperwork for consistency. Additionally, NRC regulations do not specify how individual fuel rods or segments are to be tracked. As a result, plants employ various methods for storing and accounting for this material. Further, NRC stopped inspecting plants' material control and accounting programs in 1988. According to NRC officials, there was no indication that inspections of these programs were needed until the event at Millstone. NRC is collecting information on plants' spent fuel programs to decide if it needs to revise its regulations and/or oversight. In addition to reviewing specific instances of missing fuel, NRC has had its inspectors collect basic information on all facilities' programs. It has also contracted with the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to review NRC's material control and accounting programs for nuclear material, including spent fuel. It further plans to request information from plant sites and visit over a dozen of them for more detailed inspection. These more detailed inspections may not be completed until late 2005, over 5 years after the instance at Millstone that initiated NRC's efforts. However, we believe NRC has already collected considerable information indicating problems or weaknesses in plants' material control and accounting programs for spent fuel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Spent nuclear fuel\u2014the used fuel periodically removed from reactors in  nuclear power plants\u2014is one of the most hazardous materials made by  humans. Without protective shielding, the fuel\u2019s intense radiation can kill a  person within minutes if directly exposed to it or cause cancer in those  exposed to smaller doses. The nation\u2019s 103 operating nuclear power plants,  which generate about 20 percent of U.S. electricity, annually produce over  2,000 metric tons of spent fuel. Absent a national repository, these  materials must be stored on site. Given the potential harm to human health  and the environment, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires  licensees or operators of commercial nuclear power plants to strictly  control and account for their spent fuel. However, several recent  discoveries of missing or unaccounted-for spent fuel have raised concerns  about nuclear power plants\u2019 control over these materials and NRC\u2019s  oversight. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, heightened these  concerns by raising questions about whether these highly radioactive  materials could be diverted or stolen and used maliciously.", "A commercial nuclear power plant\u2019s reactor is fueled by small ceramic  pellets of uranium, roughly the size of the tip of one\u2019s little finger. These  pellets are placed end-to-end inside hollow metal tubes (made today of  zirconium alloy), which are then gas pressurized and welded closed. The  filled metal tubes are called fuel rods or pins. Rods are grouped together  into fuel assemblies (also known as fuel bundles), typically about 5 to 10  inches square and 12 to 14 feet long, and placed in the reactor core.  Depending on the type of reactor, an assembly consists of 36 to 289 rods and the core contains from 150 to 800 assemblies. An assembly can weigh  over half a ton. About every 12 to 18 months, the reactor must shut down  for refueling. During this time, about one-fourth to one-third of the fuel  assemblies are removed from the reactor core and replaced with new fuel  assemblies. Removed assemblies are those that have become too  inefficient to power the nuclear reaction (but which have become intensely  radioactive and will continue to generate some amount of heat for tens of  thousands of years).", "When removed from the reactor, spent fuel assemblies are placed in racks  in a spent fuel pool. Spent fuel pools are typically 40-foot deep, steel-lined,  concrete vaults filled with water. Water is a natural barrier to radiation, and  it allows the fuel to cool as it becomes less radioactive. Over the course of  years, the spent fuel within the pools has been typically moved or  rearranged to accommodate more spent fuel while maintaining safety. At  some nuclear power sites, spent fuel has also been transferred to dry  storage casks to await permanent disposition at a national repository for  spent fuel, such as the deep underground repository planned at Yucca  Mountain, Nevada. Spent fuel is typically cooled for 5 years before it can be  moved to dry storage casks, which are extremely large and heavy  containers made of steel or steel surrounded by additional concrete that  can hold from 7 to 68 fuel assemblies. However, the majority of spent fuel  at nuclear power plants remains within spent fuel pools. In addition, at a  number of nuclear power plants, fuel assemblies have been disassembled  or reconstituted due to damaged or leaking fuel rods or for inspection and  testing purposes. Disassembly or reconstitution is a delicate process  involving heavy machinery. These individual fuel rods and, if broken, rod  fragments are also stored in the spent fuel pool, either placed at the bottom  or in special containers, repackaged, or in some cases, put back into the  parent spent fuel assembly.", "This report discusses (1) nuclear power plants\u2019 performance in controlling  and accounting for their spent nuclear fuel, (2) the effectiveness of NRC\u2019s  regulations and oversight of nuclear power plants\u2019 performance in  controlling and accounting for spent nuclear fuel, and (3) actions that NRC  is taking in response to licensees\u2019 spent fuel control and accounting  difficulties. In the context of this report, control and accounting for spent  nuclear fuel refers to plants\u2019 tracking of and record-keeping for the  movement and storage of their spent nuclear fuel. We did not assess plants\u2019  safety procedures for the handling or storage of spent fuel or plant security  and the vulnerability of spent fuel to theft or terrorist attacks.", "To assess nuclear power plants\u2019 performance in controlling and accounting  for their spent nuclear fuel, we reviewed and analyzed relevant documents,  including NRC and nuclear power plant licensees\u2019 event reports, NRC  studies and investigations of missing fuel rods, and other related  documents. We also interviewed NRC and nuclear power plants officials.  To assess NRC\u2019s material control and accounting requirements for spent  fuel stored at nuclear power sites, we reviewed and analyzed relevant  regulations, NRC orders and policies, and interviewed NRC and industry  officials to identify the key NRC requirements and how they are  implemented. To determine how NRC performs oversight of nuclear power  plant material control and accounting activities, we reviewed NRC  inspection policies, instructions, and reports; analyzed relevant Inspector  General reports and internal NRC analyses and studies; interviewed  appropriate NRC program and regional officials; and conducted an e-mail  survey of all NRC lead/senior inspectors located on site at plants about  inspection practices, management controls, and suggestions for  improvements, if viewed necessary. To determine the status of NRC actions  and plans in response to licensees\u2019 spent fuel control and accounting  problems, we reviewed internal NRC memoranda, instructions, and reports  and interviewed appropriate program officials.", "A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is presented in  appendix I.

It is responsible  for ensuring that those who use radioactive material\u2014in generating  electricity, for experiments at universities, and for other uses such as in  construction and medicine\u2014do so in a manner that protects the public, the  environment, and workers. NRC has issued licenses to the 103 operating  nuclear power plants and the 7 facilities that produce fuel for these plants.  In addition, NRC, or the 33 states that have agreements with NRC, regulates  about 22,000 other entities that use nuclear materials. For example, in the  medical field, nuclear material licensees annually perform millions of  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures using radioactive material.", "NRC is headed by a five-member commission appointed by the President  and confirmed by the Senate. The President designates one commissioner  as Chairman and official spokesperson. NRC has over 3,000 employees who  work in its headquarters office in Rockville, Maryland, and its four regional  offices. NRC is financed primarily by fees it imposes on commercial users  of the nuclear material that it regulates. For fiscal year 2005, NRC\u2019s  appropriated budget of $669 million included approximately $540 million  financed by these fees.", "NRC regulates the nation\u2019s commercial nuclear power plants by  establishing requirements for plant owners and operators to follow in the  design, construction, and operation of nuclear reactors. NRC also licenses  the reactors and the people who operate them. To ensure that nuclear  reactors are operated within their licensing requirements and technical  specifications, NRC oversees them by inspecting activities at the plants and  assessing plant performance. NRC\u2019s inspections consist of both baseline  inspections and supplemental inspections to assess particular licensee  programs or issues that arise at a particular power plant. Inspections may  also occur in response to a specific operational problem or event that has  occurred at a plant. NRC maintains from two to three inspectors at every  operating nuclear power site in the United States and supplements the  inspections conducted by these resident inspectors with inspections  conducted by staff from headquarters and/or its regional offices. Generally,  inspectors verify that the plant\u2019s operator qualifications and operations,  engineering, maintenance, fuel handling, security, emergency  preparedness, and environmental and radiation protection programs are  adequate and comply with NRC requirements. An important part of NRC\u2019s  regulatory strategy is that licensees have programs that include monitoring,  maintenance, and inspection to ensure safe operations.", "In addition to the construction and operation of commercial nuclear power  plants, NRC regulates the storage, transportation (together with the  Department of Transportation), and disposal of spent fuel. Although  nuclear power licensees ship a small amount of spent fuel off site for  storage and some fuel is stored in dry casks on site, most spent fuel is taken  from the reactor and moved directly to the nuclear power site\u2019s spent fuel  pool.", "Spent fuel pools are constructed according to NRC requirements, typically  with 4- to 6-foot thick steel-lined concrete walls and floors. Pools are  typically 30 to 60 feet long, 20 to 40 feet wide, and 40 feet deep. The  location of these pools is dependent on the type of reactor. Essentially, all  commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States are one of two  types, either a boiling water reactor or a pressurized water reactor.For  most boiling water reactors, the pools are located close to the reactors,  several stories above ground. For pressurized water reactors, the pools are  located in structures outside the reactor building, on the ground or partially  embedded in the ground. Regardless of reactor type, these pools are  required by NRC to be constructed to protect the public against radiation  exposure, even after a natural disaster, such as an earthquake. The water in  the pool is constantly cooled and circulated, and the fuel assemblies are  generally 20 feet below the surface of the water.", "In 1982, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Congress directed the  Department of Energy (DOE) to construct an underground repository for  the disposal of spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste. The  Congress amended the act in 1987 and required DOE to only consider  Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a potential site for the repository. In 2002, the  President recommended to the Congress, and the Congress approved,  Yucca Mountain as a suitable site for the development of a permanent high- level waste repository. For a variety of reasons, DOE is unlikely to open the  repository in 2010 as planned.", "Lacking a long-term disposal option now, some nuclear utilities must move  a portion of their spent fuel into dry storage or face shutting down their  plants because their spent fuel pools are reaching capacity. The majority of  dry storage facilities are located on site but licensed at a different time  from the power plant. These facilities are known as independent spent fuel  storage installations, or ISFSIs. Once dry storage is approved by NRC,  spent fuel is loaded into dry storage casks, which are steel containers  surrounded by additional steel, concrete, or other material meant to  provide radiation shielding, and are backfilled with inert gas. The full casks  are welded or bolted shut and placed either horizontally or vertically in  concrete vaults or on a concrete pad, depending on the design. Dry storage  casks are very large. According to NRC, a vertical cask may be 20 feet tall  and 9 feet in diameter and could weigh 125 tons fully loaded. Once in place,  the fuel is cooled by air. NRC requires these storage systems to be capable  of protecting against radiation exposure and surviving natural disasters.  Because the move to dry storage is time consuming and expensive, utilities  are, wherever possible, modifying wet pool storage capacity so they can  store larger quantities of spent fuel in these pools.", "To ensure that all spent fuel is accounted for and that unauthorized acts  such as theft or diversion are detected, NRC regulations require each  licensee to (1) establish, maintain, and follow written procedures that are  sufficient to enable the licensee to control and account for the material in  storage; (2) conduct a physical inventory of the spent fuel; and (3) maintain  records of receipt as well as records on the inventory (including location),  disposal, and transfer of the material. The physical inventory is required to  be performed at intervals not to exceed 12 months. Compliance with these  requirements is a condition of each plant\u2019s operating license.", "There is a high public perception and fear that spent nuclear fuel, if lost or  stolen, could be used maliciously. According to NRC, the control of spent  fuel is of great importance because of the potential health and safety  implications. However, NRC stated that the very high radiation level of  spent fuel makes its theft difficult, dangerous, and very unlikely. NRC also  explained that individual spent fuel rods contain only a very small amount  of nuclear material, making it unlikely that stolen rods could be used to  manufacture a weapon. Theft of many rods would be necessary to acquire  enough material to manufacture a weapon. To expose a large number of  people to the harmful effects of radiation, the spent fuel would have to be  released from its protective containers and dispersed over a wide or  densely populated area. Unlike many other hazardous materials, spent fuel  is neither explosive nor volatile. Putting the material in a dispersible form  would be a difficult and dangerous task involving extensive preparation  using special equipment and radiation shielding. In the event of a dispersal,  the most significant health effects would involve persons who inhaled very  small particles. Such particles would be absorbed into the body and  possibly remain there for many years.", "According to NRC officials, protective systems at nuclear power reactors  are designed using the concept of \u201cdefense in depth.\u201d The officials pointed  out that it is very unlikely that pieces of spent fuel could be out in the  public domain because power reactors have layers of protection and  controls to detect and prevent spent fuel from leaving the spent fuel pool.  Material control and accounting is one of these layers. Physical security,  another layer, relies on measures such as portal radiation monitors, fences,  guards, locks, and limited access. Additional layers relate to safety. For  example, reactors store spent fuel under at least 20 feet of water because of  the heat and radiation. If an item of spent fuel is raised out of the spent fuel  pool, extremely sensitive detectors in the pool area alarm. The officials said  that NRC requires licensees to respond to these alarms and keep records of  them. All parties agree that it is very important to fully account for this  material."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nuclear Power Plants Have Had Unaccounted-For Spent Nuclear Fuel", "paragraphs": ["Three nuclear power plants have recently reported the discovery of missing  or unaccounted-for spent nuclear fuel to NRC.

Other plants have also identified possible instances of lost  or unaccounted-for spent fuel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Millstone", "paragraphs": ["At Millstone, two nuclear fuel rods were discovered to be missing when, in  November 2000, the licensee, Northeast Utilities, was involved in a records  reconciliation and verification effort to support preparations to move spent  fuel into dry cask storage. The location of the two full-length fuel rods was  not properly reflected in special nuclear material records. The licensee  reported that in 1972, a fuel assembly was disassembled after it was  removed from the reactor during a shutdown. In 1974 when the fuel  assembly was reassembled, two rods that were damaged were not placed  back into the assembly. Instead, they were placed in a container for  individual rods and stored in the spent fuel pool. Records dated 1979 and  1980 show the individual fuel rods in the container in the spent fuel pool.  However, spent fuel pool map records after 1980 do not show either the  fuel rods or the container. Records do not indicate what happened to these  rods. The licensee\u2019s investigations of the loss centered on the significant  spent fuel pool activities that occurred between 1980 and 1992, which  potentially related to the missing fuel rods. These activities included two  re-racks, which modified the racks to accommodate more fuel assemblies,  and several shipments to facilities licensed to receive irradiated nonfuel  components. The unaccounted-for material from Millstone was never  found; the licensee concluded that the rods were shipped to a low-level  waste disposal facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. NRC undertook a  special inspection to review the licensee\u2019s efforts to locate the missing fuel  rods and in February 2002 agreed with the licensee that the two missing  rods were most likely shipped to the Barnwell facility. In June 2002, NRC  took enforcement action against the licensee and fined the licensee  $288,000 for failure to adequately account for the special nuclear material  contained in the two fuel rods and for failure to report missing material to  NRC in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vermont Yankee", "paragraphs": ["Spent fuel at Vermont Yankee was discovered missing in April 2004, as the  NRC resident inspectors at the plant conducted an inspection required by  NRC headquarters in response to the lost spent fuel rods at Millstone. The  resident inspectors found that although the licensee had been performing  an annual physical inventory of the spent fuel pool, the inventory did not  verify that two fuel rod segments contained in a special container stored on  the bottom of the pool were still present in the container. In responding to  the NRC senior resident inspector\u2019s questions, the licensee determined that  two spent fuel rod pieces, the product of a 1979 fuel reconstitution to  replace corroded fuel rods that had failed, were not in the storage location  identified in the inventory records. The two fuel rod pieces were  approximately one-half inch in diameter by approximately 9 inches and  17.75 inches in length.", "The Vermont Yankee licensee formed an investigation team to search for  the fuel rod pieces. According to the licensee, the investigation included  inspecting the spent fuel pool, reviewing documents, interviewing past and  present Vermont Yankee employees, and interviewing contractors that had  been associated with spent fuel pool activities and radioactive waste  operations at Vermont Yankee. In July 2004, after identifying an aluminum  cylinder in the spent fuel pool as potentially containing the two fuel rod  pieces, the licensee opened and inspected the cylinder, which in fact  contained the two fuel rod pieces. The licensee concluded that the root  causes of this event were that (1) the special nuclear material account  devices used in inventorying the material had not been properly maintained  and (2) the plant\u2019s special nuclear material inventory and accountability  procedures did not provide guidance for controlling pieces of special  nuclear material as they do for whole fuel assemblies. According to a  licensee representative, it cost the licensee several million dollars to locate  the spent fuel rod pieces and review the plant\u2019s material control and  accounting procedures and activities to determine the root causes of this  incident. The licensee representative also told us that the plant has already  taken or is in the process of taking various corrective actions. For example,  the plant has revised its material control and accounting procedures to  reflect the findings of the root cause analysis.", "NRC conducted a special inspection to review the results of the licensee\u2019s  investigation at Vermont Yankee, assess the licensee\u2019s determination of the  root cause, determine whether the licensee and its predecessor were in  compliance with applicable regulations, and identify which findings or  observations may have implications for other nuclear power plants. The  inspection was performed from April through August 2004, and a report  was issued to the licensee in December 2004. NRC inspectors concluded  that the licensee and its predecessor did not keep adequate special nuclear  material inventory records of the two spent fuel rod pieces, did not follow  the licensee\u2019s written procedures when the two spent fuel rod pieces were  moved to a fuel storage container, and did not conduct adequate periodic  physical inventories of the two spent fuel rod pieces. NRC inspectors also  concluded that because the two spent fuel rod pieces remained in the  Vermont Yankee spent fuel pool the entire time the apparent violation  existed, no actual safety consequence resulted from this apparent violation.  Nevertheless, NRC considered the apparent violation a potentially  significant failure of the licensee\u2019s material control and accounting  program.

A plant record  from 1968 indicated that the three fuel rod segments were stored in the  spent fuel pool in a small container. However, licensee spent fuel shipment  records indicated that the entire fuel assembly, including the rod segments,  had been sent off site for reprocessing in 1969. The licensee notified NRC  of the record discrepancy in the records and the apparent loss of  accountability records for the special nuclear material. The licensee  implemented a program to search the spent fuel pool for the fuel rod  segments, review additional plant records, and interview plant personnel  who were on site during the 1968 to 1969 time period.", "In November 2004, NRC officials initiated a special inspection that included  a review of the licensee material control and accounting procedures.

The material from its spent fuel pool is  being moved to dry cask storage. In 1974, a failed fuel assembly was being  disassembled because it was leaking. A fuel rod from this assembly was  found to be completely broken in two. The broken rod was supposed to  have been put in a fuel rod storage basket in the spent fuel pool. In 1997, an  attempt was made to verify the presence of the 16-inch fuel rod segment  before the basket was placed into a dry storage cask. The attempt failed,  and because the basket was too tall, it was not placed into the dry storage  cask at that time. In October 2001, because of the case of the lost fuel rods  at Millstone, the licensee decided to again inspect the basket to verify the  presence of the fuel rod segment. While the licensee successfully examined  the basket, it did not find the fuel rod segment. The licensee undertook a  complete review of the site\u2019s spent fuel records and concluded that the  accounting failure resulted from (1) the poor visual clarity in the spent fuel  pool at the time the fuel rod fragment was being placed in the basket and  (2) inadequate care by the operators performing the task. The licensee also  concluded that the fuel rod segment did not contain any fuel pellets  because when the fuel rod broke, the pellets were ejected into the reactor  cooling system and ultimately ground into powder. In January 2002, when  NRC regional inspectors performed a special inspection at the plant  concerning this issue, the inspectors did not take issue with the licensee\u2019s  conclusions concerning the missing fuel rod.

NRC\u2019s inspections at plants in response to  the Millstone incident revealed that many nuclear power sites (a site may  consist of more than one plant) had removed spent fuel rods from fuel  assemblies or had reconstituted fuel assemblies. In performing these  inspections, NRC inspectors were to obtain from the licensee a list of all  irradiated or spent fuel rods that have been removed from their parent  assembly. Using the current fuel pool map, the inspectors were to identify  the presumed location of the separated rods. Then, by observing from the  edge of the pool, the inspector was to answer whether there were rods in  all of the locations on the map identified as containing separate rods. At  some of these sites, this was not possible. Some containers where rods  were presumably stored were closed or their contents were not visible.

Each record of receipt, acquisition, or  physical inventory of special nuclear material must be retained as long as  the licensee has possession of the material and for 3 years following any  transfer of such material. Physical inventories of special nuclear material  must be performed at least annually. However, NRC guidance for material  control and accounting of spent nuclear fuel does not characterize what  constitutes a physical inventory nor how to conduct one.", "NRC regulations define physical inventory as the means to determine on a  measured basis the quantity of special nuclear material on hand at a given  time. The regulations also state that the methods of physical inventory and  associated measurements will vary depending on the material being  inventoried and the processes involved. As a result, licensees implement  the physical inventory requirement in different ways. NRC resident  inspectors found that inventories may include anything from comparing a  map with the assembly racks in the spent fuel pool to performing a  comprehensive identification of fuel assemblies according to their serial  numbers. For example, at one site, the NRC resident inspector reported  that the annual inventory is performed in a \u201cpiece counting\u201d manner and  does not specifically verify the bundle serial number and fuel pool location.  At another site, the NRC resident inspector reported that the annual  inventory is only conducted for special nuclear material that has been  moved since the last audit. Further, according to an NRC program official,  no definition of physical inventory is provided in NRC\u2019s regulatory  guidance for spent fuel because the concept of physical inventory is a  simple \u201cfirst course in accounting\u201d term. That is, a physical identification of  items for the purpose of determining the number of items physically on  hand and for comparison with a \u201cbook\u201d record, which is the listing of items  according to the accounting records. This NRC official also stated that it\u2019s  what large retailers do at least once a year, it\u2019s a well-understood concept,  and it has never been thought to require clarification until now. An NRC  resident inspector at still another site told us that the annual physical  inventory was an office paperwork review to ensure that all the \u201ci\u2019s were  dotted and t\u2019s were crossed\u201d from past material movements and transfers.  The resident inspector added that the licensee had never actually opened  its storage container to visually verify the accuracy of the paperwork. In  responding to our survey, several resident inspectors suggested that if  licensees sealed their containers\u2014for example, with tamper-safe sealing\u2014 the containers would not have to be opened during the physical inventory.  According to NRC officials, verification of items in spent fuel pools is  difficult and time consuming, raises concerns about radiation exposure,  and can be costly.", "Additionally, although NRC regulations state that licensees are to control  and account for all special nuclear material, the regulations do not  specifically require licensees to track individual fuel rods or fragments that  may be stored in their spent fuel pools. Further, individual rods, fragments,  or other controlled special nuclear material may or may not be specifically  accounted for in licensees\u2019 inventories. As a result, licensees employed  various methods of storing and accounting for this material. For example,  according to an NRC resident inspector, at one plant the spent fuel rods are  in a closed container in a designated area of the spent fuel pool. According  to the licensee\u2019s procedures, the canister is opened every 6 years and the  presence of the correct number of rods is verified. At another plant, the  licensee told the resident inspector that it was not sure how many fuel rod  fragments are in two storage baskets or how the fragments might be  divided up between the baskets. In responding to our survey, several NRC  resident inspectors described current practices and offered suggestions for  best practices for storing and controlling loose rods and segments. Several  respondents described placing loose spent fuel in \u201cdummy\u201d or \u201cskeleton\u201d  fuel assemblies, which are empty of fuel, or only in specially designed and  approved containers placed in designated cells and racks in the spent fuel  pool. In addition, one resident inspector suggested that given that fuel rod  breaks are often the result of reconstitution, a best practice would be for  the reconstitution of fuel assemblies to be done off site.", "Licensees of nuclear power plants also control and account for their  inventories of spent fuel to help meet requirements relating to U.S. treaty  obligations for the control of nuclear material. NRC regulations require  power reactor licensees to submit a Nuclear Material Transaction Report to  the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System every time their  facilities receive or transfer special nuclear material or make corrections to  their material balances. At least once a year, licensees must also submit to  the system material balance reports concerning special nuclear material  received, produced, possessed, transferred, consumed, disposed of, or lost,  and inventory composition reports. This system, which is managed by the  DOE and partially supported by NRC, is operated by a DOE contractor.  Because reporting to the system is done in the amount or weight of the  nuclear material, such as plutonium, rather than the number of items of  spent fuel, nuclear power plant licensees use complex computer programs  to provide estimates of the amount of special nuclear material that these  items contain. According to plant officials we spoke with, their sites send  their annual inventory information to their corporate headquarters to be  calculated and reported to the Nuclear Materials Management and  Safeguards System contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Does Not Monitor Plants\u2019 Compliance with Its Material Control and Accounting Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Since 1988, NRC inspections of power reactor licensees\u2019 compliance with  material control and accounting requirements have been done on an  exception-only basis\u2014that is, if a particular problem or incident was  reported by the licensee or identified by NRC that warranted investigating.  Since 1988, NRC has not routinely monitored licensee compliance with  material control and accounting regulations or verified that licensees\u2019  inventories are complete and accurate.", "In 1984, NRC\u2019s overall inspection program for monitoring nuclear power  plants\u2019 compliance with their licenses had three parts: (1) a minimum  program to be completed at all operating nuclear facilities without  exception, (2) a basic program to be completed at all operating facilities,  but under some circumstances parts did not have to be completed because  of extraordinary demands on limited inspection resources, and (3) a  supplemental program of additional inspections to be done on the basis of  an assessed need or problems at a facility. According to NRC, the basic  program included material control and accounting inspections to be  conducted once every 3 years. In 1988, according to NRC officials, this  requirement for the periodic inspections of material control and accounting was discontinued. Officials said that although there is no written  documentation available, these inspections were discontinued because  spent fuel stored in spent fuel pools was considered to be \u201cself protecting;\u201d  that is, the fuel bundles are heavy, highly radioactive, and contained in 40- foot deep pools of water. Spent fuel was viewed as a low-risk danger to  public health and the environment and a low priority for use of NRC\u2019s  resources.", "NRC substantially revised its nuclear reactor oversight process in 2000, but  did not reinstitute routine material control and accounting inspections.  According to NRC, the new process\u2014called the Reactor Oversight  Process\u2014uses more objective, timely, and safety-significant criteria in  assessing nuclear plant performance. NRC stated that the revised program  includes baseline inspections common to all nuclear plants and focuses on  activities and systems that are risk significant\u2014that is, those activities and  systems that have a potential to trigger an accident, increase the  consequences of an accident, or mitigate the effects of an accident. The  Reactor Oversight Process also allows for inspections beyond the baseline  program if there are operational problems or events that NRC believes  require greater scrutiny. Material control and accounting fall under this  criteria. When the new process was being developed, NRC officials  continued to believe that the material in spent fuel pools was self  protecting and that it was appropriate to perform material control and  accounting inspections on an exception-only basis. NRC officials told us  that there were no indications prior to the discovery of missing fuel rods at  Millstone that routine inspections were needed.", "According to NRC officials, a few Reactor Oversight Process inspections  can indirectly involve NRC inspections of licensees\u2019 material control and  accounting programs. One of these inspections is of licensee operations  during refueling of the reactor. This inspection includes verifying that the  location of fuel assemblies is being tracked and that discharged fuel  assemblies are placed in permissible locations in the spent fuel pool. To  perform such an inspection, NRC inspectors observe the movement of a  sample of fuel bundles between the reactor core and the spent fuel pool.  NRC officials told us that material control and accounting problems with  spent fuel may also be reviewed under plant status inspections. These  inspections involve a number of activities surrounding NRC resident  inspectors\u2019 efforts to be aware of emergent plant issues, potential adverse  trends, equipment problems, and other ongoing activities that may impact  the plant\u2019s safety risks. These efforts include control room walkdowns,  attending licensee meetings, and weekly plant tours. Inspectors generally  would not learn of material control and accounting problems during one of  these inspectors unless the licensee was aware of them and raised them  during meetings with the inspectors.

In phase I, NRC regional and/or resident inspectors determined  if nuclear power plant licensees had ever removed irradiated (spent) fuel  rods from an assembly or had reconstituted fuel assemblies. For licensees  that had removed rods or reconstituted assemblies, phase II was  conducted. During phase II, inspectors used inspections and interviews to  fill out a questionnaire about the licensees\u2019 material control and accounting  programs. Among the questions were the following:  Does the licensee have a program that tracks individual fuel rods from  the point of removal from a fuel assembly to where they are stored in  the spent fuel pool and to their final destination?", "Are there rods in all of the locations identified on the spent fuel map (or  equivalent) as containing separated rods? (The inspectors were  instructed to obtain from licensees a list of all spent fuel rods that had  been removed from their parent assembly and, to the extent possible,  answer this question by observing from the edge of the spent fuel pool.

Our survey of NRC\u2019s senior resident inspectors identified some differences  in what the inspectors did to answer the phase II questions. The inspectors  generally interviewed licensee staff and reviewed licensees\u2019 records and  written procedures.

Its four principal tasks were to (1) review  NRC\u2019s current material control and accounting requirements, (2) discuss  material control and accounting with current and former employees  involved in these activities, (3) visit selected facilities representing  different types of special nuclear material licensees to explore current  material control and accounting requirements and inspection practices at  each site, and (4) develop a report that offers Oak Ridge\u2019s views on NRC\u2019s  material control and accounting requirements across the range of NRC- licensed facilities, discusses any concerns or deficiencies with the current  regulations and inspection practices, and provides specific  recommendations for programmatic changes. Oak Ridge submitted its  report in August 2004 and concluded its work with a management briefing  in October 2004. NRC is currently reviewing the report.

In its report, the OIG concluded that NRC\u2019s oversight did not  provide adequate assurance that all licensees properly control and account  for special nuclear material. The OIG found that NRC performed limited  inspections of licensees\u2019 material control and accounting activities and  could not assure the reliability of the tracking system for special nuclear  material. It stated that NRC managers believed that most spent fuel is self- protecting from a health and safety point of view and that the risk of  undetected loss, theft, or diversion of special nuclear material at power  reactors is low. Therefore, according to the OIG, NRC trusts power reactor  licensees to implement their material control and accounting activities  effectively. The OIG further concluded that without adequate routine  inspections of these activities, NRC cannot reasonably ensure that  licensees are controlling and fully accounting for special nuclear material.  The OIG recommended, among other things, that NRC conduct periodic  inspections to verify that licensees comply with material control and  accounting requirements, including, but not limited to, visual inspection of  licensees\u2019 special nuclear material inventories and validation of report  information.", "In its October 2003 response to the OIG recommendation, NRC said that its  staff planned to perform a review of the agency\u2019s material control and  accounting program (which it did by commissioning the Oak Ridge study)  as part of a comprehensive review of the agency\u2019s safeguards and security  program. NRC added that based on the results of the program review, the  staff will determine what changes need to be made to the inspection  program. According to NRC\u2019s response, any decision to change the  inspection program would be made during fiscal year 2005, following  completion of the program review. In February 2004, the OIG responded by  stating that delaying any decision to make changes to the material control  and accounting inspection program until fiscal year 2005 was untimely and  did not reflect the importance of ensuring licensee\u2019s compliance with  material control and accounting requirements. In March 2004, NRC replied  that the staff considered the program review to be vital to developing and  documenting the regulatory basis for subsequent permanent revisions to  the inspection program.

A number of plants have experienced  instances of missing or unaccounted-for spent fuel, and NRC has identified  weaknesses in the material control and accounting programs at various  other plants. Contributing to this unevenness is the fact that NRC  regulations do not specifically require plants to control and account for  loose rods or segments of rods. Although loose spent fuel rods do not  appear to have been a concern when NRC developed its regulations, recent  information collected by NRC indicates that most plants have removed  rods from their fuel assemblies or reconstituted fuel assemblies. NRC data  further indicate that plants are treating loose rods and segments differently  under their material control and accounting programs. The absence of  specific guidance in NRC regulations for how licensees should conduct  physical inventories has also resulted in unevenness in licensees\u2019  compliance with these important requirements.", "Loose spent fuel rods and rod segments also were not an issue when NRC  stopped inspecting licensees\u2019 compliance with material control and  accounting regulations. Spent fuel was generally viewed in terms of fuel  assemblies, which NRC considered to be, in effect, self-protecting because  of their high radioactivity and large size and weight. However, individual  rods, and especially rod segments, are also highly radioactive and are much  smaller and lighter than fuel assemblies. This issue was first raised in 2000,  with the loss of spent fuel rods at Millstone. The occurrences of missing or  unaccounted-for spent fuel rods and the unevenness in licensees\u2019  compliance with material control and accounting requirements highlight  the need for more effective oversight of these programs. In the aftermath of  terrorist attacks on the United States, material control and accounting of  spent nuclear fuel has become more important. Material control and  accounting requirements are of great importance because of the potential  health and safety consequences of failing to effectively account for and  control spent nuclear fuel. While NRC\u2019s multifaceted and phased approach  to these issues may have been appropriate in the initial context of a single  incident at Millstone, waiting longer to make a decision on changes in the  agency\u2019s regulations and oversight is\u2014as the OIG stated in February  2004\u2014not timely and does not fully reflect the importance of ensuring that  licensees comply with control and accounting requirements for spent fuel.

According to NRC, its current regulations are clear  that licensees are required to keep complete records of and conduct annual  physical inventories of all special nuclear material, but the implementation  guidance does need to be enhanced. Regarding our recommendation that  NRC develop and implement appropriate inspection procedures to verify  compliance and assess the effectiveness of licensees\u2019 material control and  accounting programs for spent fuel, NRC said that it plans to revise its  existing procedures for inspecting material control and accounting for  spent nuclear fuel to include instruction on inspecting control and  accounting of rods and pieces.", "In addition to comments directly relating to our recommendations, NRC  offered a number of comments concerning the report\u2019s context. For  example, NRC said that its development and issuance of its temporary  instruction was postponed by the need to devote NRC\u2019s limited resources  to areas requiring more immediate attention, especially the comprehensive  security and radiological protection activities conducted after the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. NRC also said that the report needs  to provide balance by giving credit to NRC for making prioritized decisions  based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, risk of  malevolent action, attractiveness of the material for potential malevolent  activities, other controls, and available personnel resources. According to  NRC, there is no reason to conclude that any of the missing fuel segments  were removed for any malevolent purpose. NRC further stated that the  report does not make sufficiently clear that the problems at Vermont  Yankee were identified as a direct result of NRC\u2019s implementation of its  temporary instruction and that implementation of the temporary  instruction also helped identify the problems at Humboldt Bay. We believe  that our report provides sufficient context for the issues relating to the  instances of unaccounted-for spent nuclear fuel.

In addition,  we edited all completed surveys for consistency and contacted NRC  inspectors to clarify responses whenever necessary.

Because only one of the two or three inspectors assigned  to each site is designated as the lead NRC authority, we sent our survey to  that person. Therefore, we sent our survey to a total of 65 senior/lead NRC  inspectors. We expected that given their experience, the lead/senior  inspector would obtain additional views and input from the other resident  inspectors if they felt it was needed. For example, this additional input  would be important if the other inspectors performed the requirements of  the temporary instruction for inspection of material control and accounting  at nuclear power sites, or if the senior resident was newer to and,  therefore, less familiar with the practices and history of the material  control and accounting program at the site.
