According to FAA officials, the amount of airspace that FAA closes to other airspace users is larger and remains closed longer than may be needed to ensure public safety. To help remedy this situation, FAA is piloting prototype technologies that would collect launch vehicles' location data in real-time and transmit them to air traffic controllers. Officials said the earliest these technologies could be implemented would be 2022. In March 2019, FAA published an announcement seeking interest from industry on partnering with FAA to further develop the technologies. Meanwhile, FAA is assessing how existing air traffic control technologies could be used to help reduce the effects of launches on other airspace users.", "Since 2016, AST has taken steps to improve how it determines its current workforce needs to carry out its mission including licensing commercial launch vehicle operations. These steps include more comprehensively monitoring staff time spent on specific activities and measuring the volume of the staff's work. While AST officials told us that AST is planning to continue to improve its workforce-planning efforts, GAO found that some aspects of AST's efforts fall short of key principles of strategic workforce planning. Such principles underscore the importance of determining both current and future workforce needs and identifying potential gaps in employee skills. For example:", "AST does not project its workload beyond a 2-year budget cycle, limiting its ability to effectively and strategically plan for its longer-term workforce needs. According to officials, it can take a few years for engineers with certain skills to be trained and have sufficient experience to lead projects. Further, AST officials told GAO that hiring technically qualified personnel, including positions that require considerable training and experience to be a fully functioning employee, is challenging. AST officials said that they are considering projecting their workload estimates further into the future, but they have neither formally committed to doing so nor established a timeline with milestones.", "AST officials acknowledged that the information AST currently collects on the skills of its staff is not sufficient to allow them to identify gaps between the skills and competencies needed and those that its workforce currently possesses or may need in the future, such as expertise in flight safety analysis. AST officials told GAO that they plan to develop a tool that could collect information annually from staff and managers about the specific skills and competencies that individual staff currently possess. As of May 2019, however, AST had neither developed a draft of the tool nor established a timeline for finalizing it. Without this information, AST lacks reasonable assurance that its current workforce possesses the requisite skills and competencies, and AST may not be best positioned to proactively determine how to align its staff to carry out its mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations on workforce planning to AST, including that AST establish a timeline for finalizing longer-term workload projections and that AST ensure that it collects information from staff on skills and competencies in those areas that are currently needed and may be needed in the future.

In 2017, 7 of the 22 FAA-licensed launches conducted in the United  States contained a payload from a non-U.S. launch customer, including  several communications satellite operators and one civilian space  agency, according to FAA. Similarly, some U.S. launch customers we  interviewed said they have used non-U.S. launch providers.", "According to representatives of the seven domestic and non-U.S.  companies we interviewed that use launch services for placing their  products into Earth orbit or other trajectories, several factors influence  their selection of a launch provider. Many of these representatives  acknowledged that as part of their business decision, a prerequisite is  that the launch provider\u2019s vehicle and launch site must have the  capabilities to meet the customer\u2019s mission requirements, such as having  the capability to bring the payload to the desired orbit at the desired time.  That capability, in turn, depends on factors such as the lift capacity of a  provider\u2019s launch vehicle\u2014which dictates the maximum weight the  vehicle can carry\u2014and the geographic locations of its launch sites. For  example, launch vehicles operating from sites closer to the equator can  place payloads into certain orbits using less fuel due to Earth\u2019s rotational  velocity. The direction a launch vehicle can travel from a launch site also  affects the orbits into which the vehicle can most efficiently place a  payload. For example, Vandenberg Air Force Base in California\u2014which  allows launch vehicles to travel west over the Pacific Ocean\u2014is more  efficient for certain orbits, while Cape Canaveral\u2014which allows vehicles  to travel east over the Atlantic Ocean\u2014is more efficient for others.", "Beyond selecting a launch provider that has capabilities to meet a launch  customer\u2019s mission requirements, six of the seven launch customers we  spoke with said the price of a launch is a key deciding factor. For  example, a representative from an international satellite operations  company told us that the company achieved significant savings by  procuring a series of launches from its selected provider. According to the  representative, using a different launch provider would have cost almost  twice as much\u2014a price that would have forced the company to delay its  launch plans. According to data published in FAA\u2019s Annual Compendium  of Commercial Space Transportation: 2018, there is wide variation in the  commercial price of launches worldwide, ranging from an estimated $62  million to $178 million per launch. The exact price paid for many  launches is considered proprietary by both launch customers and  commercial launch companies, and is therefore not reported publicly.  Moreover, price can be affected by the size and weight of the payload,  the intended orbit being reached, and other mission-related factors. As a  result, direct comparison of launch prices is difficult.", "In addition to price, a launch provider\u2019s availability and reliability are also  key factors, according to launch customers we spoke with. Six of the  launch customers we spoke with mentioned availability as a key factor,  which is the launch customer\u2019s ability to reserve a place on the launch  provider\u2019s launch schedule. For example, a representative from a  domestic small satellite operations company said it can be difficult to find  available launches in the United States because the company relies on  sharing launches with larger payloads, and few U.S. launches travel to  the company\u2019s desired orbit. As a result, the company has procured  launch services from Indian and Russian launch providers. Five launch  customers mentioned reliability\u2014generally a launch vehicle\u2019s history of  successful launches\u2014as a key factor, in part due to the financial impact  of a failed launch. For example, a representative from a non-U.S.-based  satellite operations company said that in the event of a failed launch,  insurance would generally cover the cost of the lost payload, but not lost  revenue that would have been generated by the payload in orbit.", "Some launch customers noted that choosing a launch provider is a  complex decision, and that the key factors they consider can be  interdependent. For example, the representative from the non-U.S.-based  satellite operations company said that while a launch provider may offer a  lower price on a less reliable vehicle, the lack of reliability could increase  the customer\u2019s payload insurance costs, effectively increasing the launch  price.

FAA officials told us that they  would like to implement a system whereby applicants, for the first  time, would submit applications electronically to an FAA-sponsored  system rather than by hard copy or attachments to an email.  According to the preamble of the NPRM, FAA\u2019s proposal would allow  an applicant to submit its application by email as a link to a secure  server, and would remove the requirement that an application be in a  format that cannot be altered.

FAA has the  responsibility for ensuring the safe and efficient use of the NAS, a limited  national resource, for and by all users, including commercial and  business airlines and commercial launch providers, among others. To this  end, according to FAA officials and documents describing operational  procedures and risk evaluation, FAA takes measures during a  commercial space operation aimed at preventing fatalities, injuries, and  property damage, and ensuring that nothing interferes with the launch  vehicle\u2019s operations.", "FAA\u2019s current approach, as described in documents that explain how FAA  mitigates risk to people and property during a space launch, is to close  the airspace around a commercial launch operation\u2014in some cases  hundreds of square miles for several hours\u2014to other airspace users,  such as commercial airlines. Prior to launch, FAA establishes the size  and duration of the airspace closure, also known as an aircraft hazard  area, and, days ahead, notifies potentially affected airspace users about  the upcoming closure. FAA calculates the size and boundaries of the  aircraft hazard area generally based on the risk to life and property posed  by a launch vehicle\u2019s expected trajectory, as well as potential trajectories  in the case of a vehicle\u2019s failure and the subsequent paths of falling  debris. The duration of the closure is generally dependent on the period  of time in which the launch or reentry is expected to occur\u2014known as a  launch window\u2014which varies by the type of launch or reentry vehicle,  among other things. The aircraft hazard area extends from sea level up to  unlimited height, and generally does not change in size or shape during  the entirety of the launch window (see fig. 7).", "According to FAA officials, the designated aircraft hazard areas are larger  and remain in effect longer than may actually be needed to ensure public  safety. For example, according to FAA officials and launch  documentation, to protect public safety, the duration of an airspace  closure is always longer than the launch window. In fact, in some cases,  the airspace closure may be scheduled for more than 3 hours, which is  substantially longer than the time typically required for space launch and  reentry operations from Cape Canaveral (about 30 minutes). FAA officials  explained that they are not able to monitor or respond to dynamic  circumstances associated with space launch vehicles in the NAS in real- time. As a result, FAA closes the airspace for when and where it is  potentially\u2014rather than actually\u2014hazardous.", "FAA officials told us that the agency\u2019s approach to date for  accommodating space launch operations into the NAS has helped ensure  public safety during launches. For instance, during fiscal years 1989  through 2018, FAA reported that it licensed 357 launches or reentries,  and in this time there were no fatalities, serious injuries, or significant  property damage to the uninvolved public. However, according to FAA  officials and research, FAA\u2019s approach creates inefficiencies in how the  airspace around launch operations is used\u2014such as causing flight delays  for commercial airlines. FAA officials and commercial space industry  representatives said it also makes scheduling these operations more  challenging for launch providers, and affects FAA\u2019s operational efficiency.  The effects on each of these groups are described below.", "Commercial airlines. FAA has estimated that, in fiscal year 2017,  about 1,200 commercial airline flights were directly affected\u2014that is,  rerouted or delayed\u2014around 22 space launch operations, resulting in  an estimated 39,000 additional miles flown. The majority of these  miles were flown in proximity to Cape Canaveral in Florida, which  hosted the majority of domestic launches that year. FAA further  estimated that, of the 15 space launches from January to October  2018 around Florida where airspace tends to be busy due to the high  volume of commercial airline traffic along the East Coast, an average  of 60 aircraft per launch were directly affected. For all commercial  launch sites, FAA estimates that the number of directly affected  aircraft ranged up to 153 for an individual launch with an average of  fewer than 10 aircraft per launch outside of the Florida area.  According to FAA officials, these estimates are based on historical  data on the number of aircraft that typically fly through that area at the  time of the airspace closure. Because launches can be delayed by  hours or days for reasons such as unforeseen weather conditions or  technological issues, airlines and other affected airspace users may  face challenges when attempting to plan around a launch to avoid  flight reroutings and delays. Representatives of a major airline trade  association told us that the spread of launch activity beyond Cape  Canaveral, as well as the development of new launch vehicles, has  heightened their concerns about inefficiencies in how airspace around  launch operations is used.", "Launch providers. The size and duration of aircraft hazard areas can  make it difficult for FAA to find time slots to accommodate commercial  space launches because of its responsibility to ensure the efficient  use of the national airspace, a limited resource. All the launch  providers we spoke with that had conducted launches at U.S.  commercial launch sites said they have been able to find suitable  launch windows that met with FAA approval. However, one launch  provider told us of an occasion when FAA had denied the originally  requested launch date and time because it fell within a time of  unusually congested airspace. In addition, more than half of the  launch providers told us that they anticipate challenges obtaining  approval for a requested launch date or time in the future.", "FAA. In addition to effects on NAS users, FAA officials told us that  FAA itself also experiences operational inefficiencies in managing air  traffic during launches. This inefficiency is, in part, because FAA\u2019s  current policies and procedures were developed for aircraft operations  and either have not yet been fully adapted for commercial space  operations, or a relevant policy or process is missing altogether. For  example, FAA\u2019s current procedures for launch providers and FAA to  follow when they request, schedule, and conduct launches require  different FAA facilities to negotiate unique agreements for each  separately licensed operation or activity. This process can be time- consuming. For example, one launch provider told us that it took 1\u00bd  years to finalize minor changes to a letter of agreement.

FAA officials told us that the committee anticipates  issuing a report and recommendations to FAA in April 2019, and some  members of the committee highlighted that the meetings benefited their  understanding of other users\u2019 unique needs; economic benefits; and  experiences with regard to integrating space operations.", "Also, an FAA official said the agency has sponsored four \u201cIndustry Days\u201d  events since 2014 for the commercial space industry. At each event,  multiple FAA offices discussed their roles and responsibilities associated  with space launches and answered questions from industry. For the first  time, at its 2018 event, FAA invited aviation industry representatives to  encourage continued dialogue between the commercial space and  aviation industries. FAA officials also noted that they solicited ideas on  priority actions from participants and are currently reviewing those ideas  to help inform their next steps.

The capability to launch payloads into space enables national security  missions, mobile communications, and scientific research, among many  other applications. AST\u2019s role as a regulator of commercial space launch  providers is fundamental to the continued safe growth of the industry.  With the anticipated growth and potential organizational restructuring of  AST, as well as the evolution of the commercial space transportation  industry, it is vital that AST ensure that the size, composition, and skills of  its workforce are aligned with its projected workload, based on anticipated  future mission and programmatic goals. AST\u2019s workforce plan states that  AST needs additional staff in nearly all areas. However, current budget  and long-term fiscal pressures heighten the need for agencies to  strategically manage their workforce, a process that includes making  strategic decisions about how and where to prioritize limited resources.  AST does not have a complete understanding of its current and projected  workload, nor does it know the number of staff and types of staff skills  and competencies necessary to meet those workload needs. Without this  information, AST risks managing its workforce reactively to a rapidly  changing environment instead of strategically planning for the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to FAA:  1.  The Associate Administrator of AST should develop workload metrics  that encompass the whole office and that would allow AST to  determine an appropriate workforce size and composition.  (Recommendation 1)  2.  The Associate Administrator of AST should establish a timeline for  finalizing workload projections that extend beyond the 2-year budget  cycle and that include an approach for addressing uncertainty.  (Recommendation 2)  3.  The Associate Administrator of AST should ensure that its skills  assessment survey collects information from staff on skills and  competencies in those areas that are both currently needed and may  be needed in the future. (Recommendation 3)  4.  The Associate Administrator of AST should develop and document a  plan for periodically assessing whether staff possess the necessary  skills and competencies to achieve programmatic goals, such as  annually administering a skills assessment survey.
