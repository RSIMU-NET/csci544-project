This incident raised concerns about the risks posed by similar facilities across the country. OSHA and EPA play a central role in protecting workers and communities from chemical accidents, and DHS administers a chemical facility security program. GAO was asked to examine oversight of ammonium nitrate facilities in the United States and other countries. This report addresses (1) how many facilities have ammonium nitrate in the United States, (2) how OSHA and EPA regulate and oversee facilities that have ammonium nitrate, and (3) what approaches selected other countries have adopted for regulating and overseeing facilities with ammonium nitrate. GAO analyzed available federal data and data from selected states with high use of ammonium nitrate; reviewed federal laws and regulations; and interviewed government officials, chemical safety experts, and industry representatives in the United States and selected countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal data provide insight into the number of facilities in the United States with ammonium nitrate but do not provide a complete picture because of reporting exemptions and other data limitations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) do not require facilities to report their ammonium nitrate holdings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires facilities with certain quantities of ammonium nitrate to report their holdings for security purposes. While the total number of facilities in the United States with ammonium nitrate is unknown, as of August 2013, at least 1,300 facilities in 47 states reported to DHS that they had reportable quantities of ammonium nitrate. Federal law also requires certain facilities to report their ammonium nitrate holdings to state and local authorities for emergency planning purposes, but these data are not routinely shared with federal agencies. According to EPA, states are not required to report these data to federal agencies, and each state determines how to share its data. As part of an Executive Order on Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security issued in August 2013, federal agencies are exploring options for improving data sharing, but this work is not yet complete.", "OSHA and EPA provide limited oversight of facilities that have ammonium nitrate. OSHA's regulations include provisions for the storage of ammonium nitrate, but the agency has done little outreach to increase awareness of these regulations within the fertilizer industry, a primary user. In addition, the regulations have not been significantly revised since 1971 and allow storage of ammonium nitrate in wooden buildings, which could increase the risk of fire and explosion. Other OSHA and EPA chemical safety regulations\u2014which require facilities to complete hazard assessments, use procedures to prevent and respond to accidents, and conduct routine compliance audits\u2014do not apply to ammonium nitrate. Furthermore, although OSHA targets worksites in certain industries for inspection, its inspection programs do not target facilities with ammonium nitrate and, according to OSHA officials, information on these facilities is not available to them to use for targeting the facilities. International chemical safety guidance suggests authorities should provide facilities information on how regulatory requirements can be met and periodically inspect them.", "GAO reviewed approaches to overseeing facilities with ammonium nitrate in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, selected in part based on recommendations from chemical safety experts. According to foreign officials and government documents, these countries require facilities with specified quantities of ammonium nitrate to assess its risk and develop plans or policies to prevent chemical accidents. For example, Canadian officials said facilities with 22 tons or more of ammonium nitrate are required to complete a risk assessment and an emergency plan. Some countries' storage requirements also restrict the use of wood to store ammonium nitrate. For example, officials told GAO that France restricted the use of wood for storing ammonium nitrate fertilizer after several incidents involving ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and German officials told GAO that certain ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based preparations must be separated from combustible materials by brick or concrete walls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that federal agencies improve data sharing, OSHA and EPA consider revising their related regulations to cover ammonium nitrate, and OSHA conduct outreach to the fertilizer industry and target high risk facilities for inspection.

The explosion  severely damaged or destroyed nearly 200 homes, three nearby schools,  a nursing home, and an apartment complex. While ammonium nitrate is  widely used in agriculture, mining, and other industries, the Texas tragedy  underscores the need for great care in its storage and handling. Today,  significant quantities of ammonium nitrate fertilizer are stored in facilities  across the United States. In 2012, use of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in  the United States amounted to 853,093 tons. In 2010, U.S. companies  reported producing about 7.5 million tons of ammonium nitrate. The total  number and location of facilities in the United States in which ammonium  nitrate is stored, however, is not known.", "In response to the explosion in West, Texas, President Obama issued an  Executive Order on August 1, 2013 designed to improve the safety and  security of chemical facilities and reduce the risks that hazardous  chemicals pose to workers and communities. The order, which includes  a focus on ammonium nitrate, established a federal working group to  improve federal coordination with state and local partners; enhance  federal agency coordination and information sharing; modernize policies,  regulations, and standards; and work with stakeholders to identify best  practices.", "Several federal agencies are involved in regulating facilities with  hazardous chemicals, but the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) play central roles in protecting workers and communities  from chemical accidents at facilities. In addition, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) administers a chemical facility security  program, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS)  program, which requires certain chemical facilities to report information to  DHS and, in some instances, take additional steps to secure their  facilities. You asked us to examine federal oversight of facilities with  ammonium nitrate in the United States and approaches used by other  countries. For this review we addressed the following questions: (1) How  many facilities in the United States have ammonium nitrate? (2) How do  OSHA and EPA regulate and oversee facilities that have ammonium  nitrate? (3) What approaches have selected other countries adopted for  regulating and overseeing facilities with ammonium nitrate?", "To answer question 1, we analyzed data from DHS\u2019s CFATS program  and other sources on the number and types of facilities that reported  having ammonium nitrate as of August 2013 and documented the  limitations of the data. To assess the reliability of the CFATS data, we  reviewed agency documentation, interviewed DHS officials, and  performed electronic testing of required data elements. We also  requested state data on facilities that reported having ammonium nitrate  from four states with high ammonium nitrate fertilizer consumption\u2013 Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas\u2013and received data from  Texas and Alabama. We compared data collected by DHS to other data  sources, including chemical inventory data from Alabama and Texas,  which were identified as leading users of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and  trade data collected by DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection agency on  U.S. imports and exports of ammonium nitrate. Our primary purpose in  comparing CFATS data with data from other sources was to determine  whether the CFATS data represent a complete count of facilities with  ammonium nitrate. We determined that the CFATS data were sufficiently  reliable for purposes of providing the number and type of facilities that  reported having ammonium nitrate at levels that met thresholds for  reporting under CFATS. As we discuss later in this report, certain  limitations of the data did not allow us to determine whether all facilities  that should have reported to DHS actually did so.", "For question 2, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations,  focusing on OSHA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s regulations, including the types of  facilities covered by the regulations. We also interviewed federal agency  officials regarding their oversight practices.", "To describe the approaches selected other countries have adopted for  regulating and overseeing facilities with ammonium nitrate, we reviewed  approaches used by selected member countries of the European Union  (EU) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD): Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. To select  these four countries, we considered the extent to which the countries use  ammonium nitrate fertilizer, the results of our literature search, and  recommendations from our interviews with chemical safety experts. There  are key differences between the United States and these other countries,  including the size of the country, the size of the agriculture industry, and  the amount of ammonium nitrate used. We interviewed government  officials from the EU and the countries selected and reviewed documents  provided by the officials. We did not conduct an independent legal  analysis to verify the information provided about the laws, regulations, or  policies of the foreign countries selected for this study. We also  interviewed U.S. and international fertilizer industry associations,  chemical safety experts, and federal officials to obtain their views on U.S.  chemical safety regulations and oversight, and the practices of the  selected countries.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 to May 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, ammonium nitrate fertilizer may  be produced and sold in liquid form or as solid granules. According to  The Fertilizer Institute, solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer is used heavily by  farmers in Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas primarily on  pastureland, hay, fruit, and vegetable crops. In addition to its agricultural  benefits, ammonium nitrate can be mixed with fuel oil or other additives  and used by the mining and construction industries as an explosive for  blasting.", "While ammonium nitrate can increase agricultural productivity, use of this  chemical poses a safety and health risk because it can intensify a fire  and, under certain circumstances, explode. Ammonium nitrate by itself  does not burn, but it increases the risk of fire if it comes in contact with  combustible materials. Ammonium nitrate that is stored in a confined  space and reaches high temperatures can explode. An explosion is  more likely to occur if ammonium nitrate is contaminated by certain  materials, such as fuel oil, or if it is stored in large stacks.", "Because of ammonium nitrate\u2019s potential to facilitate an explosion,  facilities storing ammonium nitrate may pose a security threat in part  because it can be used to make weapons. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer  has been used by domestic and international terrorists to make explosive  devices. For example, on April 19, 1995, ammonium nitrate fertilizer\u2014 mixed with fuel oil\u2014was used by a domestic terrorist to blow up a federal  building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The explosion killed 168 people  and injured hundreds more.", "Ammonium nitrate has been involved in several major chemical accidents  over the past century, including explosions in the United States and  Europe. In addition to killing at least 14 people and injuring more than 200  others, the explosion in West, Texas severely damaged or destroyed  nearly 200 homes; an apartment complex; and three schools that were, at  the time, unoccupied (see fig. 1). Prior to that incident, an explosion in  1994 involving ammonium nitrate at a factory in Port Neal, Iowa killed four  workers and injured 18 people. In 1947, explosions aboard two ships  holding thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer killed more than  500 people, injured approximately 3,500, and devastated large areas of  industrial and residential buildings in Texas City, Texas. In Europe,  accidents involving ammonium nitrate have occurred in Germany,  Belgium, and France. A 1921 accident in Germany and one in Belgium in  1942 caused hundreds of deaths after explosives were used to break up  piles of hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate, resulting in large scale  detonations. In France, a ship carrying more than 3,000 tons of  ammonium nitrate exploded in 1947, a few months after the Texas City  disaster, after pressurized steam was injected into the storage area in an  attempt to put out a fire. In 2001, an explosion at a fertilizer plant in  Toulouse, France involving between 22 and132 tons of ammonium nitrate  resulted in 30 deaths, thousands of injuries requiring hospitalization, and  widespread property damage. Past accidents also indicate that smaller  quantities of ammonium nitrate can cause substantial damage. For  example, in 2003, an explosion of less than 6 tons of ammonium nitrate in  a barn in rural France injured 23 people and caused significant property  damage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies\u2019 Responsibilities for Promoting Chemical Safety and Security", "paragraphs": ["OSHA and EPA play key roles in protecting the public from the effects of  chemical accidents, with EPA focusing on the environment and public  health and OSHA focusing on worker safety and health. Under the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), OSHA is the  federal agency responsible for setting and enforcing regulations to protect  workers from hazards in the workplace, including exposure to hazardous  chemicals. In addition, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990  designated roles for both OSHA and EPA with respect to preventing  chemical accidents and preparing for the consequences of chemical  accidents. In response to requirements in this act, OSHA issued  Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations in 1992 to protect  workers engaged in processes that involve certain highly hazardous  chemicals, and EPA issued Risk Management Program (RMP)  regulations in 1996 to require facilities handling particular chemicals to  plan how to prevent and address chemical accidents. The PSM and  RMP regulations each apply to processes involving a specified list of  chemicals above threshold quantities, and require covered facilities to  take certain steps to prevent and prepare for chemical accidents.  However, neither OSHA\u2019s PSM regulations nor EPA\u2019s RMP regulations  cover ammonium nitrate.", "The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986  (EPCRA) establishes authorities for emergency planning and  preparedness and emergency release notification reporting, among other  things. Under section 312 of EPCRA and EPA regulations, facilities with  certain hazardous chemicals in amounts at or above threshold levels\u2014 including ammonium nitrate in some circumstances\u2014are required to  annually submit chemical inventory forms to state and local authorities to  help emergency response officials prepare for and respond to chemical  incidents.", "For purposes of enhancing chemical facility security, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards  (CFATS) program requires facilities possessing certain chemicals at or  above threshold quantities\u2013including some types of ammonium nitrate\u2013to  submit reports to DHS with information about the facility and the regulated  chemicals present on site. Among other things, DHS collects information  on the quantities of certain hazardous chemicals held at facilities, the  location of the facilities, and their industry codes. DHS set different  threshold quantities for reporting based on the type of ammonium nitrate  and the type of security risk presented (see table 1).", "Not all facilities with ammonium nitrate, however, are required to file  CFATS reports with DHS. First, facilities are only required to report if they  are holding amounts equal to or greater than threshold quantities of  specific types of ammonium nitrate. Also, DHS does not require certain  agricultural producers to report their chemical holdings to DHS. In  addition, DHS\u2019s reporting threshold for ammonium nitrate fertilizer only  applies to quantities held in transportable containers such as cylinders,  bulk bags, bottles (inside or outside of boxes), cargo tanks, and tank  cars. Finally, there are several statutory exemptions to CFATS  requirements. Specifically, CFATS does not apply to public water systems  or treatment works, any facility that is owned or operated by the  Department of Defense or the Department of Energy, facilities regulated  by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or facilities covered by the  Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 administered by the Coast  Guard.", "Other federal agencies regulate different aspects of the use of hazardous  chemicals. For example, the Department of Transportation regulates the  transport of hazardous materials, the Coast Guard inspects containers of  hazardous materials at ports and waterways, and the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in the Department of Justice  regulates the manufacture, distribution, and storage of explosive  materials, including blasting agents and other explosive materials  containing ammonium nitrate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Government Responsibilities for Promoting Chemical Safety", "paragraphs": ["State and local government agencies are also involved in regulating  hazardous chemical facilities under federal laws and their own state or  local laws.

As a result, private sector  workplaces in 21 states and Puerto Rico are regulated and inspected by  state occupational safety and health agencies rather than OSHA.  Similarly, EPA has delegated its authority to implement and enforce the  Risk Management Program to nine states and five counties.

In these two states, we  found that the data from each of the sources provided to us differed and  that no single count of such facilities, whether from the state or DHS,  represented a comprehensive picture of facilities with ammonium nitrate.", "For Texas, we reviewed three sources of data on facilities that have  ammonium nitrate: (1) EPCRA data from the Texas Department of State  Health Services; (2) a list of facilities that registered with the Office of the  Texas State Chemist as having plans to produce, store, or sell  ammonium nitrate; and (3) DHS\u2019s CFATS data. We compared data  from all three of these sources and found 189 facilities that reported  having ammonium nitrate (see fig. 2). Of these 189 facilities, 52 filed  CFATS reports with DHS.

DHS  officials told us the agency has begun an effort to obtain lists of chemical  facilities the states have compiled and compare them with its CFATS data  to identify facilities that should have filed CFATS reports but did not. This  effort is still under way.

From these two sources, we found 91 facilities that reported having  ammonium nitrate\u2014 57 that filed EPCRA reports with the state  Department of Environmental Management and 71 that filed CFATS  reports with DHS. Thirty-seven of the facilities filed reports with both the  state and DHS.

Using the data from the Customs and Border  Protection agency, we identified 205 facilities that imported ammonium  nitrate products and 81 facilities that exported ammonium nitrate products  in fiscal year 2013. The majority of these facilities reported importing or  exporting mixtures of ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate or  mixtures of urea and ammonium nitrate. Eight of these facilities filed  CFATS reports with DHS. Moreover, we found about 100 facilities that  imported or exported a form of ammonium nitrate that may be subject to  DHS\u2019s CFATS requirements for reporting quantities over 2,000 pounds  but did not file a report. These facilities, however, may not be required to  file CFATS reports.

Data were not readily available to determine whether they met all of  DHS\u2019s reporting requirements for the CFATS program. In addition,  according to DHS officials, other data limitations could explain some of  the differences between the CFATS data and the federal trade data. For  example, facilities may submit reports to the different agencies using  different names and addresses. According to DHS, different people in the  facility may prepare the different reports; the facility may define the  perimeters of each site differently; or the corporate structure or  nomenclature may have changed from the time one report was submitted  to the next reporting period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Reporting Criteria, Including Exemptions, and Facilities\u2019 Failure to File Required Reports Also Prevent Full Identification of Facilities with Ammonium Nitrate", "paragraphs": ["The total number of facilities with ammonium nitrate is also difficult to  determine because of the variation in reporting criteria, including  exemptions for some facilities from reporting to either their state or to  DHS.

In addition, DHS\u2019s reporting threshold for ammonium  nitrate fertilizer only applies to quantities held in transportable containers  such as cylinders, bulk bags, bottles (inside or outside of boxes), cargo  tanks, and tank cars. Also, EPCRA does not require retailers to report  fertilizer held for sale to the ultimate customer. However, an August 2013  chemical advisory on ammonium nitrate issued jointly by EPA, OSHA,  and ATF clarified that EPCRA requires fertilizer distributors to report  ammonium nitrate that is blended or mixed with other chemicals on site.

The facility in West, Texas had not  filed a CFATS report to DHS but, in 2012, this facility filed an EPRCA  form with the state, reporting that it had 270 tons of ammonium nitrate.  According to DHS officials, the agency does not know with certainty  whether the West, Texas facility should have reported its ammonium  nitrate to DHS because the agency did not visit the facility after the  explosion and it does not know the manner in which the facility held its  ammonium nitrate prior to the explosion. Following the explosion at the  facility in West, Texas, DHS obtained data from the state of Texas and  compared the state data to the facilities that reported to DHS. As a result  of this data matching effort, DHS sent out 106 letters to other potentially  noncompliant facilities in Texas. According to DHS, many of the Texas  facilities that received the letter said they do not actually possess  ammonium nitrate or do not meet the criteria to require reporting under  CFATS.

OSHA\u2019s regulations include requirements that  could reduce the fire and explosion hazards associated with ammonium  nitrate, such as required fire protection measures, limits on stack size,  and requirements related to separating ammonium nitrate from  combustible and other contaminating materials. However, the regulations  do not categorically prohibit employers from storing ammonium nitrate in  wooden bins and buildings. In addition, if the facilities were in existence  at the time the regulations were issued in 1971, OSHA\u2019s regulations allow  the use of storage buildings not in strict conformity with the regulations if  such use does not constitute a hazard to life. Some of the provisions of  OSHA\u2019s ammonium nitrate storage regulations are described in table 3.", "Recently, OSHA, EPA, and ATF jointly issued a chemical advisory that  recommends that facilities store ammonium nitrate in non-combustible  buildings. Similarly, following the explosion in West, Texas, the National  Fire Protection Association is considering changes to its ammonium  nitrate storage provisions, which are part of its hazardous materials  consensus standard, including restricting the use of wood to store  ammonium nitrate.", "In addition to storage requirements, OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication  regulations require that employers whose workers are exposed to  hazardous chemicals, including ammonium nitrate, inform their workers of  the dangers and train them to handle the materials appropriately.  Employers are required to use labels, training, and safety data sheets to  inform workers of chemical hazards in the workplace. Safety data  sheets are written documents with details on the hazards associated with  each chemical, measures workers can take to protect themselves, actions  workers should take in case of an emergency, and safety precautions for  handling and storing the chemical."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA Has Conducted Little Outreach to the Fertilizer Industry to Increase Awareness of Its Ammonium Nitrate Storage Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Until the explosion in West, Texas, OSHA had not reached out to the  fertilizer industry to inform its members of OSHA\u2019s requirements for the  storage of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

In addition, in February 2014, OSHA announced that  the agency is working with the fertilizer industry to remind employers of  the importance of safely storing and handling ammonium nitrate. OSHA  published a letter on its website that provides employers with legal  requirements and best practice recommendations for safely storing and  handling ammonium nitrate. In the letter, OSHA states that the agency  will enforce the requirements of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.109(i) for storage of  ammonium nitrate, including at facilities in non-explosives industries.  According to the announcement, fertilizer industry associations will share  the letter with facilities across the country.", "Fertilizer industry representatives we interviewed said that, prior to the  explosion in West, Texas, they did not know that OSHA\u2019s ammonium  nitrate storage regulations applied to the fertilizer industry, and they  suggested that OSHA reach out to the fertilizer industry to help prevent  another incident. Industry representatives explained that their  understanding was based on a proposed rule published by OSHA in the  Federal Register on April 13, 2007, which proposed revisions to the  Explosives and Blasting Agents regulation. In that notice, OSHA  proposed a change to the ammonium nitrate storage requirements \u201cto  clarify that OSHA intends the requirements to apply to ammonium nitrate  that will be used in the manufacture of explosives.\u201d Although this  proposed rule was never finalized, the industry representatives told us  they relied on this statement to mean OSHA did not intend the storage  requirements to apply to ammonium nitrate fertilizer.", "In addition, we reviewed the safety data sheets developed by four U.S.  producers of solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer and found that only one  company\u2019s sheet listed OSHA\u2019s Explosives and Blasting Agents  regulations as applicable to the storage and handling of ammonium  nitrate fertilizer.

In addition, officials with the Asmark Institute, a nonprofit  resource center for agricultural retailers in the United States, said they  developed their own compliance assessment tool for agricultural retailers.  The Fertilizer Institute and the Agricultural Retailers Association selected  the Asmark Institute to develop a database that will include information on  audit reports and scores from the third party audits.

As part of its enforcement efforts, OSHA  randomly selects facilities for inspection as part of a national emphasis  program for chemical facilities it initiated in 2011. However, these  inspections are for facilities and chemicals covered under its Process  Safety Management (PSM) regulations, which do not include ammonium  nitrate. According to OSHA officials, facilities that blend and store  ammonium nitrate fertilizer fall outside the scope of this national  emphasis program.

These regulations  apply to processes involving listed chemicals in amounts at or above  threshold quantities. Employers subject to the PSM regulations are  required to take specified steps, which include evaluating the hazards  associated with the process, as well as developing and implementing  operating procedures, employee training, emergency action plans, and  compliance audits at least every 3 years, among other requirements.  Despite the hazards of ammonium nitrate, this chemical is not listed as  one of the chemicals subject to these regulations. OSHA officials told us  they did not know why ammonium nitrate was not included when the  regulation was first issued. According to the August 2013 chemical  advisory, although ammonium nitrate is not covered by the PSM  regulations, the production or use of ammonium nitrate may involve PSM- listed chemicals, and the manufacture of explosives, which may involve  ammonium nitrate, is covered by the regulations. In the late 1990s, OSHA  staff drafted a proposal for expanding PSM regulations to cover  ammonium nitrate and other reactive chemicals, but it was not reviewed  by agency policy officials and was never published in the Federal  Register for public comment.", "In addition, retail facilities, which may include facilities that store and  blend fertilizer for direct sale to end users, are exempt from OSHA\u2019s PSM  regulations. In the preamble to the final rule for the PSM regulations,  OSHA stated that retailers are not likely to store large quantities of  hazardous chemicals, and that a large chemical release would be  unlikely.

At a minimum,  EU officials told us that EU member countries must comply with the  Seveso Directive, although they have the option to adopt more stringent  requirements. The legislation was adopted after a chemical accident in  Seveso, Italy in 1976 that exposed thousands of people to the toxic  chemical known as dioxin. Under the Seveso Directive, last updated in  2012, member countries are to require facilities with large amounts of  ammonium nitrate fertilizer to notify the appropriate authority in their  respective country, adopt a major accident prevention policy, and in some  cases, develop a detailed safety report (see table 5).", "Some countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, have other  requirements for notifying authorities about the types and quantities of  chemicals at facilities, including certain types of ammonium nitrate.

Specifically, according to documents provided  by French officials, the regulations direct facilities not to store ammonium  nitrate fertilizer in structures with wood walls or sides. According to an  official in Germany, strict storage requirements for using certain types of  ammonium nitrate fertilizer have led many farmers to voluntarily use an  alternative type of fertilizer, known as calcium ammonium nitrate., For  example, she explained that, in Germany, certain kinds of ammonium  nitrate must be divided into quantities of 28 tons prior to storage, and  quantities are separated by concrete walls. In addition, certain ammonium  nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based preparations must be separated  from combustible materials, for example by brick or concrete walls.

However,  given the various reporting requirements and numerous reporting  exemptions, some facilities may be uncertain about what to report to  whom. Through the new Executive Order, federal agencies including  DHS, EPA, and OSHA have the opportunity to work together on data  sharing initiatives to help identify facilities with ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Such data sharing could help federal agencies identify facilities that are  not complying with their regulations and enable OSHA to target high risk  facilities with ammonium nitrate for inspection. Without improved  coordination among the various federal and state agencies that collect  data on facilities that store potentially hazardous chemicals, identifying  facilities with ammonium nitrate for purposes of increasing awareness of  the hazards and improving regulatory compliance will remain a challenge.", "Although OSHA has requirements for storing ammonium nitrate fertilizer  in its Explosives and Blasting Agents regulations that could reduce the  likelihood of an explosion, OSHA has done little to ensure that the  fertilizer industry, which is one of the primary users of ammonium nitrate,  understands how to comply with its existing regulations.

However, without additional action by OSHA to promote  awareness of how to comply with its regulations, fertilizer facilities may  not know whether their practices are in compliance with OSHA\u2019s existing  ammonium nitrate storage regulations or if changes need to be made.  Moreover, unless OSHA takes steps to leverage additional resources to  support its enforcement efforts, whether through enhanced targeting or  coordination with other agencies or outside parties, beginning with  encouraging voluntary compliance with ammonium nitrate regulations  through various industry initiatives, it will not know the extent to which  dangerous conditions at some facilities may continue to exist.", "While much can be achieved under current regulations, OSHA and EPA\u2019s  regulations contain gaps with respect to ammonium nitrate that may allow  unsafe facilities to operate and poor planning to persist.

For example, other countries we reviewed have  revisited and updated their ammonium nitrate regulations and the  National Fire Protection Association is considering making changes to its  ammonium nitrate storage standards as a result of the explosion in West,  Texas. In addition, as a result of incidents involving ammonium nitrate  abroad, countries in the European Union and Canada require facilities to  assess the risks of working with ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and the  European Union requires member countries to routinely inspect facilities  that have very large quantities of it. These approaches offer examples of  how the risks of ammonium nitrate can be managed.
