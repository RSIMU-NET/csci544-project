Agencies need to identify the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to current and future demands. Key practices include identifying and assessing existing skills, competencies, and skills gaps.", "Acquire and assign talent.

Today\u2019s hearing is especially  timely because next month marks the 70th anniversary of the act that  currently organizes federal positions for purposes of pay and other  activities: the Classification Act of 1949. This law was created for a type  of federal work and workforce of a different era, and is one of several  building blocks of the federal personnel system that are outmoded and  hampering agencies\u2019 talent management efforts.", "The federal workforce is critical to federal agencies\u2019 ability to address the  complex social, economic, and security challenges facing the country.  However, across government, mission critical skill gaps are undermining  the ability of federal agencies to carry out their missions. Last week, for  example, we testified on how difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled  health care providers and human resource staff at the Veterans Health  Administration\u2019s (VHA) medical centers led to mission-critical skill gaps  that make it difficult to meet the health care needs of veterans. We first  added federal strategic human capital management to our list of high-risk  government programs and operations in 2001. Although Congress,  OPM, and individual agencies have made improvements since then,  federal human capital management remains a high-risk area because  mission-critical skills gaps within the federal workforce pose a high risk to  the nation.", "My remarks today focus on (1) key hiring and other human capital  management challenges facing federal agencies, and (2) talent management strategies we have identified from our prior work that  agencies can use to be more attractive employers in a tight labor market.  The bottom line is that while agencies\u2019 efforts to recruit and retain the staff  needed to carry out their missions face a number of hurdles, agencies still  have a number of strategies they can leverage within their existing  authorities and flexibilities to be more competitive for top talent.", "This testimony is based on our large body of work on federal human  capital management issued primarily between July 2014 and July 2019.  We reviewed government-wide employment data and interviewed officials  from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and subject matter  specialists from think tanks, academia, government employee unions,  and other areas. More detailed information on our objectives, scope, and  methodology for that work can be found in the issued reports.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Twenty-one of these priority  recommendations are aimed at addressing government-wide human  capital challenges, including some of the ones discussed above. OPM  agreed or partially agreed with most of these recommendations. OPM has  implemented 10 of these priority recommendations to date, but needs to  take additional action on the other 11. For example, OPM should continue  to streamline hiring authorities to strengthen the government\u2019s ability to  compete in the labor market for top talent and improve the federal hiring  process. We will continue to monitor OPM\u2019s progress in implementing our  recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Human Capital Management Challenges are Long- Standing and Systemic", "paragraphs": ["The government\u2019s system of current employment policies was designed  generations ago for a workforce and types of work that largely no longer  exist. Much has changed since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and  the Classification Act of 1949 laid the foundation of today\u2019s federal  personnel system. We have identified several structural challenges  within the federal human capital system that impede the ability of  agencies to recruit, retain, and develop employees, both today and in the  future. For example:", "Classification system. The General Schedule classification  system\u2014which defines and organizes federal positions, primarily to  assign rates of pay\u2014has not kept pace with the government\u2019s  evolving requirements.", "Recruiting and hiring. Federal agencies need a hiring process that is  applicant friendly and flexible, and meets policy requirements.", "Pay system. Employees are compensated through an outmoded  system that (1) rewards length of service rather than individual  performance and contributions, and (2) automatically provides across- the-board annual pay increases, even to poor performers.", "Performance management. Federal agencies have faced long- standing challenges developing modern, credible, and effective  employee performance management systems and dealing with poor  performers.", "Additionally, the changing nature of federal work and high percentage of  employees eligible for retirement could produce gaps in leadership and  institutional knowledge. It could also threaten to aggravate the problems  created from existing skills gaps. For example, 31.6 percent of permanent  federal employees who were on board as of September 30, 2017 will be  eligible to retire in the next five years, with some agencies, such as the  Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental  Protection Agency, having particularly high levels of employees eligible to  retire.", "In March 2019, we identified key trends in agency operations and  attitudes toward work that are affecting how federal work is done and  consequently, the skills and competencies that workers will need to  accomplish agency missions (see fig. 1). Agencies will need to apply  talent management strategies that are adapted to these trends to recruit,  develop, and retain a high-performing workforce and better meet their  missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Talent Management Strategies Can Help Agencies Be More Competitive in a Tight Labor Market", "paragraphs": ["In light of trends and other challenges facing the government\u2019s human  capital management efforts, our prior work has identified actionable  strategies that agencies may be able to use to effectively manage the  future federal workforce in key talent management areas (see table 2).  We noted that while these strategies are not an exhaustive list,  collectively they suggest basic steps that agencies can take within  existing authorities to position themselves to meet their talent needs.  These practices are based on our review of related reports, group  interviews with federal Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO), and  interviews with selected private organizations and foreign governments.", "For each strategy, we highlight examples of the challenges agencies  face, actions OPM can take to implement related recommendations from  our prior work, and practices that may help agencies implement the  strategy.", "Align human capital strategy with current and future mission  requirements. With shifting attitudes toward work, technological  advances, and increased reliance on nonfederal partners, agencies need  to identify the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to current and  future demands. Key practices include identifying and assessing existing  skills, competencies, and skills gaps.", "In May 2014, we reported that agencies should be aware of existing skills  and competencies in their workforce to help inform workforce planning.  As one example, the Department of the Treasury CHCO told us that,  following the Puerto Rico debt crisis\u2014where it needed to be able to  identify the necessary skills to manage the crisis\u2014the agency decided to  implement an Integrated Talent Management System to facilitate  workforce and succession planning as well as learning and performance  management.", "Acquire and assign talent. To ensure agencies have the talent capacity  to address evolving mission requirements and negative perceptions by  some of federal work (e.g., that it is too bureaucratic), agencies can  cultivate a diverse talent pipeline through strategic partnerships with  academic and other institutions, highlight their respective missions, recruit  early in the school year, support rotations, and assign talent where  needed.", "As one example, consulting firm representatives that we interviewed for  our prior work stated that their internship programs are among their most  successful practices for cultivating a talent pipeline because the firms can  offer full-time positions to rising seniors during the internship. A  representative from one consulting firm said that, after experiencing  challenges in recruiting on college campuses, the firm built a competitive  internship program to promote the firm\u2019s brand and reputation.  Participants in the firm\u2019s 10-week program are paid and assigned  challenging projects, and successful participants are given job offers upon  completion. According to the representative, approximately a quarter of  the firm\u2019s workforce is former interns. Similarly, CHCOs and federal  employee and management group representatives we interviewed noted  that internships are important for establishing a pipeline for recruitment.", "The federal government\u2019s Pathways Programs, which consist of the  Internship Program, the Recent Graduates Program, and the Presidential  Management Fellows Program, were designed to promote employment  opportunities for students and recent graduates by providing distinct  paths to federal internships and potential careers in government. The  Internship Program provides paid opportunities for students (high school,  vocational, technical, undergraduate, and graduate) to work in agencies  and explore federal careers while still in school. Students who  successfully complete academic and program requirements may be  eligible for non-competitive conversion to a term or permanent position in  the civil service.", "In our prior work, we have also reported on the importance of cultivating a  diverse talent pipeline through active campus recruiting which includes  developing long-term institutional relationships with faculty, administrators  and students, and by building a \u201cbrand\u201d on campus. Other strategies to  expand a talent pool include developing strategic partnerships with such  entities as trade schools, apprentice programs, and affinity organizations  from across the country.", "Another strategy for attracting strong candidates is for agencies to  highlight their missions and innovative work, which, according to our  expert and CHCO interviews, can help counter negative perceptions of  federal employment. For example, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) provides \u201cDay in the Life\u201d information on its work to promote public  awareness of how its everyday tasks tie in with its mission of protecting  the United States, according to the DHS CHCO. The DHS CHCO stated  that promoting agency mission can be done while cultivating a talent  pipeline and assessing applicants\u2019 abilities. The department holds  recruitment events where potential candidates can participate in law  enforcement-related activities such as fitness testing. The CHCO noted  that these events both promote homeland security careers and help  prospective candidates determine if a position is a good fit for them.", "Incentivize and compensate employees. While federal agencies may  struggle to offer competitive pay in certain labor markets, they can  leverage existing incentives that appeal to workers\u2019 desire to set a  schedule and to work in locations that provide work-life balance.  However, agencies do not always promote these benefits and incentives  as part of a total compensation package, in part because managers are  not always aware of the importance of doing so. Some agencies are  addressing this issue by advertising and helping employees use available  benefits, work-life balance programs, and other resources. For example,  the National Science Foundation offers employees many opportunities to  learn about existing benefits, according to the foundation\u2019s CHCO. These  opportunities include triannual retirement seminars where employees  receive personalized retirement estimates, quarterly financial planning  seminars where employees receive a free 1-hour consultation, and  annual benefit fairs where employees can learn about various health care  providers, the work-life programs, and the employee assistance program.", "Our prior analysis of CHCO and expert interviews also found that  employees may value different benefits and incentives depending on their  stage in life. By better understanding the desires of the workforce at  various life stages, agencies can better tailor benefits packages and  incentives to their employees. For example, the Social Security  Administration\u2019s CHCO said that the agency\u2019s younger workers value  work-life and wellness programs, so the agency implemented a health- tracking program and a fitness discount program for all employees.  CHCOs also suggested identifying and incorporating the benefits that  would be most useful to various groups of employees, such as  sabbaticals for midlevel employees or paid parental leave for employees  starting families. One CHCO found that her cybersecurity workforce  values subsidies for training and additional certifications more than bonus  pay.", "Further, OPM\u2019s 2018 Federal Work-Life Survey Governmentwide Report  found that the number of respondents who anticipate adult dependent  care responsibilities in the next 5 years (31 percent) is double the number  of respondents with current adult dependent care needs (15 percent).  OPM officials stated in light of this change, agencies may need to provide  greater workplace flexibilities and other support services to retain talent.  Some CHCOs we interviewed for prior work said that they believe that  paid parental leave could be a powerful retention tool for federal workers.  Representatives from consulting firms that we interviewed said that they  have observed positive impacts from these types of benefit programs. For  example, representatives from one firm said that providing employees  with peace of mind when managing life events helps them feel more  committed to the organization.", "Engage employees. Engaged employees are more productive and less  likely to leave, according to OPM. Agencies can better ensure their  workforces are engaged by managing employee performance, involving  employees in decisions, and developing employees.", "Experts we interviewed for prior work said that employees desire an  environment where they can collaborate with their peers and feel a sense  of comradery. In contrast, even a small number of poor performers can  negatively affect employee morale and agencies\u2019 capacity to meet their  mission, according to CHCOs and our previous work. In the 2017 Federal  Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), 64 percent of federal employee  respondents agreed that their supervisor provides them with constructive  suggestions to improve job performance and 31 percent agreed that  steps are taken to deal with poor performers.", "Without effective performance management, agencies risk not only losing  the skills of top talent, they also risk missing the opportunity to effectively  address increasingly complex and evolving mission challenges. Agencies  can make performance management more effective by improving the  selection and training of supervisors and managers, creating a \u201cline of  sight\u201d between individual performance and organizational results, and  implementing meaningful reward programs.", "Our prior analysis found that employees seek autonomy in the workplace,  meaningful work, and opportunities to achieve results by developing  creative and innovative solutions. Also, experts noted that in some  cases, connecting federal employees to a sense of inclusion and meaning  can compensate for the opportunity to make higher salaries in other  sectors. Creating an inclusive work environment is one practice that can  help increase employee involvement in decisions.", "CHCOs and federal employee and management group representatives  said that more can be done to prioritize training, even in an era of  resource constraints. In 2017, only 55 percent of FEVS respondents were  satisfied with training. As an example of an agency prioritizing training  efforts, the Social Security Administration has national and regional  development programs that offer 12 to 18 months of training and rotations  for entry-, mid-, and senior-level employees to strengthen foundational,  technical, and leadership knowledge and skills, according to the agency\u2019s  CHCO. For example, its Leadership Development Program assigns  selected GS-9 through GS-12 employees to developmental assignments  in new areas of work, and provides leadership training that broadens their  perspective of the agency\u2019s mission.", "Chairman Connolly, Ranking Member Meadows, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
