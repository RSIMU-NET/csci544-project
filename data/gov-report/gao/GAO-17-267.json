The projects include the development of a modernized system in two versions. The first version was planned to provide support for business needs of the agency's existing grant monitoring process. The second version is to provide additional functionality to support monitoring within a yet-to-be-defined risk-based process. CNCS officials and the development contractor responsible for delivering the first version of the system agreed to a set of requirements that address business needs for improving outcomes of the existing monitoring process. However, because business needs for a risk-based monitoring process have not been determined, OIT officials and system stakeholders have not defined requirements for the second version of the future system, as intended by CNCS's IT modernization plans.", "CNCS has taken steps to help avoid continued delays, but progress toward delivering the system has been limited. In July 2015, CNCS initiated a project that was to deliver the first version of the system in April 2016. After subsequent delays, agency officials updated plans to reflect a September 2016 delivery. However, as of July 2017, this version had not been delivered, and the delivery date was changed to October 2017. Successful development and delivery of IT systems relies on adherance to key practices for managing project schedules and testing. However, weaknesses in CNCS's practices introduced risks to successful delivery of the system. In particular, the system development project schedules could not be used to track progress because they did not include actual dates when activities were started and finished. In addition, although CNCS and its contractor conducted testing according to plans, the grant monitoring system was not included in all phases of testing. Agency officials used other tools to track progress, and plans did not require them to conduct all stages of testing for the system. However, unless CNCS officials improve system development practices for managing project schedules and testing, they will continue to introduce risks to successful delivery of system functionality that supports grant monitoring.", "The grant monitoring system development project experienced delays when CNCS did not initially conduct oversight needed to ensure that the contractor took corrective actions as planned. In monitoring the contractor's performance during system development and testing, agency officials enhanced oversight to avoid continued delays. In ongoing management reviews of the project, CNCS officials reported that, since the last corrective action plan was provided by the contractor in December 2016, performance has improved and the project is on track to deliver the first version of the grant monitoring system in October 2017.", "However, successful delivery of system functionality that supports the agency's grant monitoring process will remain at risk unless CNCS takes steps to correct weaknesses in system development practices for managing project schedules and testing. Further, CNCS's grant monitoring officers will continue to rely on an outdated legacy system to support the processes they follow for monitoring the use of millions of dollars of grant funds awarded each year."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending three actions to improve CNCS's practices for defining requirements and developing schedules and test plans for grant monitoring system development.

For example, the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993  established the CNCS and authorized it to make grants such as through  the AmeriCorps state and national grant programs. The act also made the  agency responsible for administering Volunteers in Service to America  (VISTA) and National Senior Volunteer Corps. The Serve America Act  was also enacted in 2009, which gave CNCS responsibility for  administering several newly established programs, such as the Social  Innovation Funds, which provide community-level grants.", "CNCS grants are typically awarded to fund programs for a 3-year period,  with funds distributed annually.

The  program officers focus on issues related to grantee performance and  compliance with program objectives, while the grant officers focus on  grantees\u2019 financial issues and performance.", "The program and grant officers use IT systems to support monitoring and  related activities. These systems are developed and maintained by the  Office of Information Technology (OIT). This office is led by the agency\u2019s  CIO, who reports to the Chief Operating Officer. Figure 1 illustrates the  position of the grant management entities within the agency as of April  2017.", "To manage its grant program, CNCS conducts a four-phase process that  covers pre-award grant reviews through actions taken to close out the  grants when the period of related projects expires. According to CNCS  policy, during the pre-award phase (before CNCS makes a grant award),  grant officers evaluate the potential grantee\u2019s financial management  capabilities and other aspects, such as whether the grantee has any open  audit findings on any current or prior grants, to determine if the grant  should be awarded.", "Once grants are awarded for the upcoming fiscal year, CNCS program  and grant officers take steps to assess the grants and plan for monitoring  the use of funds provided to the grantees. During the agency\u2019s annual  assessment phase, which is conducted between August and October of  each year, the officers establish the upcoming year\u2019s monitoring plan.  During the monitoring phase, program and grant officers carry out the  plans made during the assessment phase.", "Lastly, when the period of the project supported by a grant expires, the  grant is closed. During closeout and no later than 90 days after the  expiration date of the grant, grantees submit required documentation to  their grant officer and pay any outstanding obligations. CNCS\u2019s program  and grant officers verify completion of these actions and reconcile funds,  then notify grantees when they have met all programmatic and fiscal  requirements of the award. At that time, the grant is officially closed. An  overview of the four phases of the monitoring process is depicted in figure  2.", "Grant monitoring activities are initiated by program and grant officers  during the assessment phase, when awarded grants are assessed, rated,  and prioritized, and monitoring plans are made. The assessment phase is  made up of four steps.", "In the first step of the assessment phase, officers determine which  grants are to be monitored in the upcoming year. The universe of  grants being assessed typically includes all grants that are active at  the time CNCS is ready to begin the assessment phase, usually in  mid-August of each year, and that are expected to be active during  the fiscal year beginning in October.", "At the second step of the process, the officers further assess each of  the grants to be monitored to identify potential vulnerabilities based on  a set of criteria related to program compliance, financial weakness, or  other issues defined by the program and grant officers. CNCS defined  19 criteria that indicate a grant\u2019s potential vulnerabilities to be  examined during an assessment. The officers may consider other  key concerns or challenges in their assessment on a case-by-case  basis.", "Based on the outcomes of the second step, a third step is taken to  determine the priority of each grant for monitoring purposes. Each  grant is rated as high, medium, or low priority to determine the types  of monitoring activities to be conducted during the year. The three  priority categories are determined based on the presence of any of  the pre-determined 19 criteria and an automated scoring process  performed by the IT system that is used to support the agency\u2019s grant  monitoring process. The plan typically is to be prepared by the end of  October.", "Finally, during the fourth step of the annual assessment, program and  grant officers plan the monitoring activities for each grant that are to  be conducted during the year, based on the priority ratings  determined during the third step. For example, grant monitoring plans  may include on-site compliance visits to the grantees\u2019 facilities, desk  reviews of documentation submitted by the grantees, reviews of  grantees\u2019 financial activities, and follow-up visits based on the  outcomes of compliance visits and other reviews.", "The monitoring phase is conducted each year between October and  August, when program and grant officers are to complete the activities  described in their plans. During that time, they may add or omit activities,  with supervisory approval, for a number of reasons. For example,  program and grant officers may consider adding an activity for a grantee  based on newly identified issues, such as findings of the OIG that suggest  the grantee may have demonstrated poor financial management  capabilities in the past. In such cases, the officers may add additional on- site or follow-up visits to their plans.", "The officers produce reports on the progress made by grantees to  accomplish the objectives and meet performance measures associated  with a particular grant. For example, the reports could include data that  reflect the number of individuals who received assistance in disaster  preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts; the percentage  of economically disadvantaged people who received housing-related  support; or the percentage of students served by a grant program who  showed improvements in academic performance. In addition, the officers  review grantees\u2019 financial status reports that identify funds expended  compared to funds allocated for the grantees\u2019 awards through the CNCS  budget. The information reported is used by the program and grant  officers to help them identify areas that may need more focused attention  or targeted monitoring.", "In our March 2017 report on CNCS\u2019s efforts to improve grant monitoring,  we noted that the agency\u2019s annual assessment process may not result in  the riskiest grants receiving a high priority for monitoring because of  limitations in its scoring model. We also noted that CNCS has not  evaluated its monitoring efforts to identify opportunities to improve its  assessment of, and response to, risks related to grant management. We  recommended that CNCS, as part of its efforts to establish enterprise- wide risk-based management, develop a risk-based approach to grant  monitoring and establish a policy to ensure that all grants expected to be  active in a fiscal year are assessed for potential risk. Such an approach  would incorporate key practices, such as identifying risks relevant to the  use of funds awarded by the grant program, analyzing and responding to  the risks, and addressing risks as part of the grant monitoring process.

Such  evaluations are based on the 19 criteria that were defined to determine  the priority of the grants to be monitored and the monitoring activities to  be conducted. The officers indicate which of the criteria are present by  choosing \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d from a drop-down list. Then, based on the criteria,  the system sorts and rates the priority of each grant as high, medium, or  low.

The program and grant officers also use eGrants to generate  notification letters that are sent to grantees to schedule a site visit. After  the visit has been conducted, the grant or program officers enter  information regarding the results of the visit into the system, along with  the grantee\u2019s responses.", "After a site visit, the officers may also identify follow-up actions to be  taken and use eGrants to record those actions. The program and grant  officers also use the system to generate reports on the progress of the  grantees toward addressing any deficiencies identified as a result of  monitoring activities they conducted. Grant officers also enter information  about the results of financial reviews into the system.", "However, CNCS has encountered challenges in using eGrants. For  example, according to CNCS\u2019s February 2013 IT Modernization Plan,  data and information are not standardized and are entered into the grant  management and monitoring systems with limited checks and validation,  which results in data quality issues. In addition, according to the plan,  technical limitations of eGrants make it difficult and time-consuming to  integrate data from multiple sources and filter out inaccuracies. For  example, agency officials stated that initiatives such as reporting on state- level grants require significant intervention by technical staff to obtain,  integrate, and analyze data due to the disparate nature of the way the  data are stored.", "In October 2013, the CNCS OIG also reported problems with the  agency\u2019s legacy IT system used to support monitoring activities. The  OIG reported that eGrants was inefficient and ineffective at supporting  monitoring officers\u2019 efforts to predict and detect improper use of funds  awarded by CNCS grants. The OIG noted that, although the agency had  collected data from its grantees to monitor their use of funds, its outdated  systems did not provide the kind of data analytics capabilities needed to  monitor early detection of fraud and mismanagement of grant funds. For  example, the OIG reported that CNCS could not readily compare  information across grants awarded or among the grantee population to  identify anomalies and outliers that indicate potentially improper use of  funds. The OIG further reported that the agency was falling behind in its  efforts to increase the use of technology to support improved risk  management practices, relying instead on inefficient processes for  conducting oversight of the use of grant funds.", "Recognizing the growing gap between its business needs and its IT  infrastructure, CNCS engaged a contractor to provide guidance on  modernizing its infrastructure. In May 2014, the contractor reported the  results of its independent evaluation of the agency\u2019s IT strategy,  modernization plan, technology adoption, and costs for supporting  CNCS\u2019s strategic goals. The evaluation highlighted the limited system  collaboration and communication capabilities among CNCS end users,  data inconsistency, system availability issues, and data transparency and  reporting issues as areas needing improvement. In its report, the  contractor noted that CNCS had been slowly migrating its legacy grant  management system to a new, more current technology, but that its  efforts had not kept pace with mission-related programmatic demands.  Consequently, program staff had developed workaround solutions to  manage critical information accessed from multiple disparate sources,  such as spreadsheets, e-mail, local and shared files, and local databases.", "Our March 2017 report on CNCS\u2019s grant monitoring process identified  similar problems associated with eGrants.

We also  discussed system users\u2019 concerns regarding the usability of eGrants and  its lack of integration with other tools used to collect monitoring data. For  example, although each program officer has an electronic monitoring tool  to use when conducting on-site monitoring, the data collected using these  tools are not automatically integrated into and analyzed by eGrants. We  further noted CNCS officials\u2019 concerns that the agency\u2019s existing IT  environment did not provide automated mechanisms, such as trend  analyses, that could help them identify patterns of potentially improper  use of funds and risk factors to be considered when monitoring grants  within a risk-based management approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CNCS\u2019s IT Modernization Program", "paragraphs": ["In February 2013, CNCS\u2019 CIO released its IT modernization plan that  describes a program intended to result in the development of systems to  improve support of the agency\u2019s grant management activities.

According to GAO\u2019s guide, managers are to identify a baseline, or target,  schedule that is to be maintained and updated with actual dates when  activities are started and finished. The baseline is used to measure and  monitor the performance of projects and to determine when actual dates  differ from baseline dates and may affect future work. Further, it is useful  in determining when strategies are needed to allocate resources more  efficiently to meet time constraints.

Specifically, the schedule that CNCS approved  established baseline start and finish dates for activities, but did not reflect  actual dates for managing the GMM Phase 1 system development  projects, including the first version of the grant monitoring system. For  example, one version of the schedule identified a testing activity for the  grant monitoring system to take place from April 2016 through June 2016,  but the schedule did not include dates for when the activity was actually  started and completed. Another later version of the schedule included a  planned delivery date of October 2017 for the system, but did not include  the originally planned date of April 2016.

For  example, the officials stated that they used a field included in the  schedules for entering notes to identify actions that needed to be taken to  complete activities and to track the status of each of the actions.  However, in many cases, OIT officials included certain program-level  actions and completion dates in the notes, but they did not record the  status of the actions.

The officials stated that, in managing the development of the  overall GMM program, they tested more than 50 percent of other Phase I  systems\u2019 functionality and, therefore, did not need to include the grant  monitoring system to meet the requirement. In addition, the officials  stated that, when alpha testing began for the other GMM Phase 1  systems in March 2016, they and system stakeholders still had not  agreed on final requirements and, therefore, were not ready to test the  system.", "However, because they did not complete all phases of testing needed to  ensure early detection and correction of system problems throughout the  development of the first version of the grant monitoring system, the  agency was not prepared to conduct the beta and user acceptance  phases of testing.

The minutes also described plans to hold weekly status  meetings to monitor progress and define actions that would be taken if  the contractor did not meet milestones for correcting system development  deficiencies. Later, following an April 2016 IT management meeting, OIT  officials again noted that the contractor was behind schedule in  developing data migration and training materials required by the fourth  corrective action plan. As another example, in May 2016, when the  contractor was addressing the fifth corrective action plan, OIT and other  agency management officials documented their intention to make a  decision on whether to issue a cure notice.

We assessed whether the agency\u2019s project plans  aligned with needs of grant monitoring officials by comparing their  contents against documentation that described the agency\u2019s grant  monitoring process and requirements for providing IT support of the  current monitoring process. We identified enhancements needed to assist  program and grant officers, by examining planning documentation, such  as CNCS\u2019s Strategic Plan, system requirements definitions, and  presentations and minutes from business stakeholder requirements  gathering sessions. We also reviewed documentation that noted changes  to requirements and interviewed agency officials, such as the Chief  Information Officer, to determine the rationale for the changes.

We then compared the  planned dates and milestones contained in the schedules to actual dates  obtained from project artifacts, to determine whether the project  schedules reflected planned and actual dates for the completion of  activities, delays in meeting project milestones, and interdependencies  and conflicts between activities and resources.", "To assess CNCS\u2019s efforts to test the system, we compared  documentation that described agency practices for conducting system  testing, such as test plans and reports on testing outcomes, to testing  management criteria defined by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI)  and documented in its Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration (CMMI\u00ae)  framework. To determine whether CNCS had taken steps to ensure,  through its testing activities, the successful delivery of the grant  monitoring system, we assessed documentation of activities that were to  occur as part of the alpha, system integration, beta, and user acceptance  testing phases. Specifically, we examined test plans and reports of testing  outcomes and compared them to criteria for effective system testing  identified in SEI\u2019s framework to determine whether CNCS conducted  testing as planned and the impact of any deficiencies on the agency\u2019s  ability to deliver the system as planned.", "Lastly, we determined the level of contractor oversight conducted by  CNCS officials by examining documentation such as program schedules,  documented requirements and deadlines for the contractor to address  system deficiencies identified by the Office of Information Technology  officials, corrective action plans delivered by the contractor, and  correspondence between the agency and the contractor. We compared  the activities to practices for conducting effective project oversight  established by SEI.", "We supplemented the information we obtained from our assessment of  agency documentation by interviewing CNCS officials, including the Chief  Information Officer, Deputy Chief Information Officer, and Chief Risk  Officer, who were knowledgeable of efforts to develop systems and  oversee the work of contractors to support the grant monitoring process.", "To determine the reliability of the data obtained from CNCS\u2019s information  systems used for managing requirements and conducting system testing,  we compared information obtained from documentation of requirements  definitions and test plans against requirements tracking documents and  reports of test results. We also discussed with knowledgeable agency  officials within the Office of Information Technology the status of system  development processes, including actions taken to define and manage  system requirements and to conduct the various phases of testing. Based  on our efforts, we determined that the data we used from these sources  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our audit.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 through August  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Teresa F.
