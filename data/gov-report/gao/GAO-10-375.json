Its paper-based licensing information systems cannot be searched to quickly identify licenses for exports of goods to Iran. For example, Treasury was unable to address a 2009 request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials for complete and timely licensing data to support CBP inspectors at U.S. ports. Treasury's information systems weaken the ability of the government to assess compliance with Iran sanctions. Treasury plans to upgrade its licensing information system for agricultural and medical exports to Iran. However, the upgrade would not address its inability to readily identify licenses for other goods, including civilian items with potential military uses.

Census maintains the AES data on a  mainframe computer operated by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While most filers enter data through  the Census Bureau\u2019s AESDirect or a related Census system, others have  developed their own software for this purpose. The data filed into AES  includes the recipient country. Until recently, filers of export data  designated the recipient country by choosing a two-letter international  standard country code. Data filers also designate the type of good being  exported from a list of more than 8,000 internationally harmonized  commodity codes. According to these statistics, the United States  exported worldwide nearly $1.3 trillion during 2008.", "U.S. exports to Iran are severely restricted by U.S. laws and regulations.  Before 1979, the United States enjoyed good relations with the Iranian  government and exported military equipment to Iran. However, U.S.- Iranian relations deteriorated sharply following the 1979 Iranian revolution  and the consequent seizure of U.S. embassy personnel. Iran\u2019s subsequent  efforts to enrich uranium and support international terrorism prompted  the United States to impose numerous sanctions on Iran, including a 1995  ban on almost all U.S. exports to that country. The current ban is  administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.  Department of the Treasury, which is also responsible for licensing  financial transactions with Iran and imports from Iran. Under the ban, in  general, a U.S. person must obtain a Treasury license before exporting or  selling goods to Iran. Congress had already restricted exports to Iran by  prohibiting the export of dual-use goods (civilian goods with potential  military applications) to Iran. This prohibition can be waived by the  President if the President determines that doing so is essential to the  national interests of the United States.", "According to Treasury officials, Treasury policy is to generally deny  license applications for the export of U.S. goods to Iran, with the  exception of goods covered by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export  Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA). TSRA requires the President to  terminate any unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions against a foreign  country or foreign entity. TSRA also states that the export of agricultural  commodities, medicine, or medical devices to a designated state sponsor  of terrorism, such as Iran, shall only be made pursuant to 1-year  licenses. As a result, Treasury licenses the export of agricultural goods,  medicines, and medical goods to Iran and other sanctioned countries.  Treasury has issued a growing number of licenses for agricultural and  medical exports to Iran following passage of TSRA, as shown in figure 1.  TSRA licenses may not be granted for exports to entities linked to  international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  or narcotics trafficking.", "The trade ban also generally prohibits exports of U.S. goods (including  dual-use items) to countries other than Iran without a Treasury license if  the exporter has reason to know the goods are specifically intended for  transshipment to Iran. Foreign firms are generally prohibited from  knowingly reexporting goods on Commerce\u2019s list of controlled dual use  goods to Iran even if those goods were originally legally exported from the  United States to a third country under a Commerce license. For example,  dual-use U.S. goods exported to countries other than Iran under a  Commerce license may not be subsequently transshipped to Iran without a  Treasury license if the exporter knew or had reason to know that such  goods were intended for Iran. The Departments of Commerce, Defense,  Homeland Security, Justice, and the Treasury investigate allegations of  illegal transshipment of U.S. goods to Iran. Exporters who knowingly ship  U.S. goods to Iran via other countries without a Treasury license are  subject to prosecution by the Department of Justice.

We  therefore have not changed our recommendation that Treasury develop  the ability to provide complete and timely information regarding all export  licenses for Iran.", "Treasury also stated that, contrary to the notion that the administration of  the sanctions program had been weakened, nothing in our draft report  indicated that enforcement actions regarding exports to Iran, or the  implementation of the sanctions, had been impaired by incomplete and  untimely licensing data. Treasury\u2019s assertion is in contrast with a 2009  internal Treasury budget request, in which Treasury officials stated that  (1) Treasury\u2019s information processes were hampering \u201cthe speed, efficacy,  reliability and security\u201d of its enforcement and compliance activities and  (2) Treasury would be able to provide better information to law  enforcement agencies if it upgraded its TSRA information system. Also, as  noted in our report, limitations in Treasury\u2019s information systems  prevented it from responding to a request from U.S. Customs and Border  Protection officials for more complete and timely licensing information to  aid CBP agents at U.S. ports.", "Treasury also stated that it appreciated the report\u2019s finding that Treasury  is licensing the export of goods to Iran in accordance with the laws and  regulations imposing sanctions on Iran. However, it expressed concern  that our draft report title conveyed an impression that Treasury\u2019s  information systems were weakening the implementation of economic  sanctions against Iran.

In reviewing its  records, Census checked the shipping address of the ultimate recipient for  each good. Based on the results of its review, Census provided us with the  actual country of destination and the total dollar value of each type of  good that was sent to a country other than Iran. We used that information  to adjust the data found in the U.S. export statistics. We also reviewed a  Census Web page listing corrections to U.S. export data concerning Iran to  corroborate the posted corrections with those that Census had provided to  us. We also met with Census officials to determine their methods and  policies for assuring the accuracy of the statistics.", "To assess the Treasury Department\u2019s licensing activities, we first reviewed  U.S. laws and regulations that established sanctions on U.S. exports to  Iran, including Treasury\u2019s Iranian Transaction Regulations. We then  reviewed a random sample of 58 licenses that were issued by Treasury to  exporters from October 2006 to August 2009. With this probability sample,  each member of the study population had a nonzero probability of being  included, and that probability could be computed for any member. The  random sample was taken from a list of 1,833 licenses provided to us by  Treasury. On the basis of the sample, we estimate no more than 5 percent  of the population contained errors, at a 95 percent confidence level,  which we judged to be sufficiently reliable for our review. In the digital  PDF copies of licenses we obtained, we verified that all licenses were for  agricultural goods, medicines, and medical devices allowed under TSRA  and the Iranian Transactions Regulations. We also looked at the intended  end users in the license to verify that none were sponsors of international  terrorism. The names of end users in the licenses were compared with a  search of Treasury\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons  list, which is maintained and updated daily on Treasury\u2019s Web site. For  non-TSRA goods, we reviewed all non-TSRA licenses provided by Treasury  for January 2008 to June 2009. For dual-use items, we verified that a  waiver had been obtained for the export of goods to Iran before a license  was granted. We also interviewed officials from the Departments of the  Treasury and State on their collaboration and joint decision-making for  licenses granted for export to Iran that required a presidential waiver. To  assess Treasury\u2019s ability to provide complete and timely licensing data to  other agencies and Congress, we obtained documents concerning  Treasury information systems, including contracting and budget  documents for a planned upgrade. We obtained a Treasury presentation on  the TSRA Database and Foreign Assets Control Database systems used to  store records of its licensing activities. We also obtained and reviewed all  of the mandated biennial and quarterly reports for TSRA on Treasury\u2019s  Web site. We compiled these reports into a comprehensive total of  licenses issued by Treasury and then compared it with the list Treasury  provided to us for the overlapping time periods. We also interviewed  relevant Treasury licensing, information technology, and enforcement  officials. We interviewed officials from the Departments of Commerce and  Homeland Security and other entities who use Treasury licensing  information. In addition, we requested detailed licensing data from  Treasury and monitored its ability to comply with our request.", "To review the extent to which U.S. goods are being illegally transshipped  to Iran, we obtained and analyzed lists of relevant criminal prosecutions  from the Department of Justice.
