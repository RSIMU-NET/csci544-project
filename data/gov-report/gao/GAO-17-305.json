One of the largest programs is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program (Medicare EHR Program), which, among other things, encourages providers to make electronic health information available to patients. Program data for 2015 show that health care providers that participated in the program (3,218 hospitals and 194,200 health care professionals such as physicians) offered most of their patients the ability to electronically access health information. Patients generally described this access as beneficial, but noted limitations such as the inability to aggregate their longitudinal health information from multiple sources into a single record.", "Data from the 2015 Medicare EHR Program show that relatively few patients electronically access their health information when offered the ability to do so. Patients GAO interviewed described primarily accessing health information before or after a health care encounter, such as reviewing the results of a laboratory test or sharing information with another provider.", "While HHS has multiple efforts to enhance patients' ability to access their electronic health information, it lacks information on the effectiveness of these efforts. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within HHS collaborates with CMS to assess CMS's Medicare EHR Program as well as its own efforts to enhance patient access to and use of electronic health information. However, ONC has not developed outcome measures for these efforts consistent with leading principles for measuring performance. Without such measures, HHS lacks critical information necessary to determine whether each of its efforts are contributing to the department's overall goals, or if these efforts need to be modified in any way."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS 1) develop performance measures to assess outcomes of key efforts related to patients' electronic access to longitudinal health information, and 2) use the information from these measures to help achieve program goals.

These efforts are aimed at  encouraging investment in and the use of electronic health records (EHR)  and related technologies that, among other things, enable patients to  access their health information when they need it in a useful electronic  format. This health information can include, for example, summaries of  vital signs, such as blood pressure; laboratory test and other screening  results; and information on present and past prescriptions. One of the  goals of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology (ONC), an office within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), is for patients to have the ability to electronically access  and aggregate their longitudinal  health information in order to provide  comprehensive information on their health over time. According to ONC,  when patients have such access to their health information, they are  better able to monitor chronic conditions, ensure their health information  is accurate, and share their health information with providers when  needed.", "In a 2016 report to Congress, ONC noted that patients\u2019 ability to  electronically access their health information has increased over time,  though there are limitations to this access. ONC reports that in 2012,  only one-quarter of hospitals provided patients with the ability to  electronically view their information; in 2015, 95 percent of hospitals  offered this ability. However, ONC has reported that electronic health  information is often spread across multiple providers using disparate  systems that are not interoperable. ONC has reported that this dispersal  makes it cumbersome for individuals to aggregate their electronic health  information from different providers into a single longitudinal health  record.", "You asked that we review the status of health IT interoperability  from the  perspective of the patient, specifically focusing on patients\u2019 ability to  access, control, and contribute to their electronic health information. In  this report, we  (1) describe the extent and type of electronic access to health information  currently available to patients, and patients\u2019 views about this access;  (2) describe the extent to which patients electronically access their health  information, and actions providers reported taking to encourage such  access; and  (3) evaluate HHS\u2019s efforts to advance patients\u2019 ability to electronically  access their health information.", "To address our first two objectives, we undertook several steps. We  conducted a literature search to identify articles published between 2014  and 2015 that describe how patients electronically access their health  information. We identified and reviewed 51 such articles. In addition, we  analyzed data provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program (Medicare EHR  Program) for program year 2015 showing the extent to which providers\u2014 hospitals and health care professionals (e.g., physicians)\u2014participating in  this program reported offering patients in their hospital or practice the  ability to electronically access health information and the extent to which  patients used these features. We also supplemented these data with  other types of data from CMS, ONC, the Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA), and the U.S. Census Bureau to identify the  characteristics of these providers and patients. We assessed the  reliability of these data by (1) performing electronic testing of required  data elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (3) consulting agency officials who are  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. (See  Appendix I for more details of our analysis.) We also interviewed relevant  experts to learn about patients\u2019 ability to electronically access health  information. Specifically, we interviewed knowledgeable individuals in the  area of health IT and patient electronic access from Mathematica Policy  Research, the American Health Information Management Association,  Healthwise, the National Association for Trusted Exchange, and the Open  Notes Foundation, as well as individuals conducting advocacy work in this  area. We selected these organizations and individuals based on mentions  in previous interviews and references in literature.", "As part of our work for our first two objectives, we also obtained  information on the perspectives of patients, providers, and health IT  developers on patient electronic access to health information, as follows.", "To obtain patients\u2019 perspectives, we interviewed a nongeneralizable  sample of 33 patients to learn about their experiences electronically  accessing their health information. Patients Like Me, a patient  advocacy organization, agreed to let us post a request on its website  seeking to interview patients. The request directed patients to contact  us directly if they were interested in talking about their experiences  electronically accessing their health information. We were able to  successfully schedule and complete interviews with 33 of these  patients. During these interviews, we asked the patients about  instances when they electronically accessed their health information,  challenges they encountered when accessing or attempting to access  such information, benefits they experienced as a result of such  access, and improvements they would like to see.", "To obtain providers\u2019 perspectives, we conducted a nationally  representative survey of 1,867 providers who participated in the  Medicare EHR Program for the 2014 program year. We received valid  survey responses from 175 hospitals and 253 health care  professionals. The weighted response rate, which accounts for the  differential sampling fractions within strata, is 21 percent for the full  sample, 28 percent for eligible hospitals, and 20 percent for eligible  professionals. In the survey, we asked providers about the methods  they use to give their patients electronic access to their health  information, the perceived benefits of giving patients such access, and  the steps providers have taken to encourage electronic access by  their patients, among other things. (See Appendix I for a more  detailed description of our provider survey.) We also interviewed 6  providers who volunteered to speak with us after responding to our  survey to learn about their perspectives on patient access to  electronic health information. The views of these 6 providers are not  generalizable to all providers.", "To obtain health IT developers\u2019 perspectives, we interviewed a  nongeneralizable sample of individuals from 16 companies in the field  of health IT. We identified these companies through interviews and  internet searches as companies that are developing or have  developed products that facilitate patients\u2019 electronic access to health  information. Specifically, we interviewed 10 health IT developers who  are working to develop or who have developed applications intended  to enable consumers of their products to access their electronic health  information and aggregate it into a single location; representatives  from 2 EHR vendors that offer portals that providers can purchase so  that their patients can electronically access their health information;  representatives from 2 companies that are working on health IT  projects related to consumer access to health information; and  representatives from 2 other companies that promote the  development of health IT platforms that enable consumers to  electronically access their health information.", "To evaluate HHS\u2019s efforts to advance patients\u2019 ability to electronically  access their health information, we reviewed relevant documents, such as  strategic plans and agency budget justifications, for both ONC and CMS  for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the most recent years available. We  compared the information and documentation to relevant criteria from  GAO\u2019s body of work on effectively managing performance under the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. We also interviewed  officials from CMS and ONC about each agency\u2019s efforts to further the  ability of patients to electronically access their health information and the  extent to which their agencies are evaluating these efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to March  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Among the measures in the current programs are two that are  specifically designed to capture the extent to which patients are able to  electronically access their health information. Unless providers claimed  an exclusion from reporting these measures, providers were required to  successfully complete them in order to receive incentive payments for  program year 2015. The measures are as follows:  (1) Ability  to electronically access health information. More than 50  percent of a providers\u2019 patients must be provided timely access to  view online, download, and transmit to a third party their health  information, and  (2) Actual electronic access.

These criteria do  not specify a particular technical method for providing patients with  access to their health information, but do specify parameters for  accessing certain types of health information. According to ONC, many  providers use some type of patient portal to provide access to these types  of health information. A patient portal is a secure online website that gives  patients 24-hour access to their personal health information and medical  records from anywhere with an Internet connection.

A patient portal is  a secure website that allows patients to access information contained in  their provider\u2019s EHR system and is managed by the provider. EHR  vendors and providers we interviewed noted that patients generally have  to manage separate login information for each provider-specific portal.  Many patients we interviewed confirmed this; for example, a number of  patients we interviewed said that they had access to more than one  portal, each of which contained their health information from a different  care setting (e.g., hospital stays, general practitioner, and different  specialists).", "The types of health information that providers made available to patients  varied, but our survey of providers indicated that most routinely offer  access to most types of patient information. The Medicare EHR Program  requires that participants make certain types of information available,  such as laboratory test results and current medications. According to  our survey, an estimated 94 percent of hospitals and 77 percent of health  care professionals routinely offered access to laboratory test results,  which are required by the program. (See table 2.) Our survey also  showed that fewer providers routinely offered access to certain  information that is not required by the program and that they find less  helpful for their patients to view. For example, 46 percent of hospitals and  54 percent of health care professionals reported routinely offering access  to clinician notes, which are not required by the program. Additionally,  our  survey showed that fewer providers find it helpful for patients to view  clinician notes and radiological images than for patients to view  information such as laboratory results and current medications.  Representatives from two hospitals we interviewed explained that their  hospitals relied on a committee to decide what information to make  available to patients through the portal and how soon after it is available  to the provider to make it available to the patient. One EHR vendor we  spoke with noted that the vendor automatically makes almost all  information, including clinician notes, available to patients through the  vendor\u2019s patient portal by default, though many vendors allow providers to  limit the types of information they routinely make available to patients.", "Patients we interviewed said that the type of information made available  in their portals was incomplete and inconsistent across providers.

For example, one patient said that sometimes her lab results are  posted, and other times they are never made available to her, and she  does not have a sense of when the results will be made available. Three  patients expressed frustration that their vital signs information such as  weight and blood pressure was not available through their portals,  particularly since they knew that their providers collected this information  during visits. Another patient said that she has observed a lot of variability  in what information providers make available through their portals, with  some doctors providing access to detailed information such as clinical  notes and lab results, and others only making basic information available,  such as appointment reminders and vital signs information collected  during visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patients Described Numerous Benefits and Some Limitations with Their Electronic Access to Health Information", "paragraphs": ["During our interviews with 33 patients who have accessed their health  information electronically, patients described numerous benefits from the  ability to electronically access their health information.

Multiple patients described circumstances in which they used  information in their portal to improve their interactions with their provider  and adhere to provider recommendations. For example, one patient  described how he logged into the portal after a visit to review instructions  from his provider that he had forgotten. Patients also noted that  electronically accessing their health information made them feel  empowered or more proactive to manage their health, particularly over  time. For example, patients described using their electronic access to  view specific test results over time to see whether their condition was  changing, or to access diagnostic information that gave them the ability to  do more research on their medical condition. One patient described using  the information in her portal to notice a trend in her lab results and also  learn of a condition she had of which her provider failed to inform her.  Patients also described using their patient portals to share information  with other providers. Multiple  patients described printing out medical  information from their portals, such as lab results, and bringing that  information to appointments with other providers. Patients noted that  portals make sharing health information very convenient.", "However, patients also described some limitations with their access,  many of which were related to the functionality of the portal. Patients we  interviewed stated that they were able to view their health information  electronically, but many patients said that it was not clear that this  information could be electronically downloaded or transmitted. Patients  also expressed frustration with the amount of time and effort it took to set  up electronic access through their providers, managing multiple  passwords for their many portals, and understanding each portal\u2019s user  interface. Many patients said that the information itself was often incorrect  or not presented in helpful ways, and some patients noted that there was  no simple way to correct or denote incorrect information within the portal.  For example, one patient said that another person\u2019s information was  included in her record, and it took multiple requests to her provider to  remove this information from her record. Another patient was frustrated  that information about his weight that was captured in his yearly physical  was not available in the portal in a way that would allow him to track his  weight over time.", "Multiple  patients said that an overall limitation is that they could not  aggregate all of their health information into a single longitudinal health  record. While there are health IT products available to help patients and  providers aggregate information, they are not in high demand. For  example patient-purchased personal health records (PHR) can enable patients  to aggregate electronic information from disparate sources into a  single record. Health IT developers said that there are PHR products  available for patients who attempt to generate such a record, but our  survey and patient interviews indicate that these products are not  widely used. Health IT developers noted that these products have  limited functionality because they or the users (e.g., patients) cannot  access information stored in EHR systems, and one developer noted  that a lack of standardization limits the ability to present information in  a meaningful way. Patients we interviewed generally stated that they  were not using these products, and health IT developers agreed that  consumer demand is low. Additionally,  relatively few hospitals and  health care professionals we surveyed reported having the capability  to submit information to PHR products.", "Provider-purchased products can also help patients and providers  aggregate longitudinal health information, according to health IT  product developers and EHR vendors we interviewed. For example,  one health IT developer explained that providers can currently  purchase their product to display information from multiple EHR  systems in a single portal; this product would need to be purchased  separately from the EHR system and would require additional  configuration. However, according to our survey, we estimate that  most providers offer patient portals that are packaged with their EHR  system.

Providers we interviewed and who responded to our  survey, as well as health IT developers we interviewed, said that a  patient\u2019s age affected the extent to which she electronically accesses her  health information. Multiple providers who responded to our survey and  that we interviewed conveyed that, in their experience, older patients are  less likely to electronically access their information. Providers and health  IT developers noted that younger patients and those with chronic  conditions are most likely to want electronic access to their health  information.", "Some providers we surveyed and interviewed attributed the lack of  interest in accessing health information electronically among older  patients to a decreased likelihood of having access to a computer or web- enabled device. One provider stated that his hospital serves a large  elderly population and that this was the biggest challenge to meeting the  requirement under the 2014 Medicare EHR Program that over 5 percent  of patients access their health information electronically. A recent data  analysis by ONC found no differences in rates of access to or the viewing  of online medical records by age, but the analysis did find that individuals  between the ages of 50 and 59 had significantly higher rates of  electronically communicating with health care providers, looking up test  results online, and using smartphone health applications compared with  individuals 70 years or older.

Similarly, one of the  studies we reviewed found that consumers expressed preferences to use  online access to their health information primarily for needs that occur  before or after a health care encounter (e.g., to view recently completed  lab work or notes from a recent physician visit) or because they are  accessing convenience features offered in their provider\u2019s portal, such as  online appointment scheduling or to request medication refills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providers Reported Taking a Variety of Actions to Encourage Patient Electronic Access", "paragraphs": ["In our survey of 2014 Medicare EHR Program participants, providers  reported using a variety of outreach strategies and other efforts to  encourage their patients to access the health information made available  to them.

For example, a hospital representative stated that to increase  patient access, staff members tell patients about the portal and take steps  to register patients for the portal at every interaction. Another hospital  representative explained that hospital staff individually  assist patients and  even help patients obtain a private e-mail address to register for the  portal, if necessary. Yet another hospital representative said that the  hospital staff wore buttons instructing patients to ask staff about the  portal, and the hospital also installed billboards to remind patients to ask  staff about the portal. Despite these efforts, this hospital representative  said that they struggled to meet the patient electronic access  requirements under the Medicare EHR program.", "Our interviews with the 33 patients and analysis of Medicare EHR  program data and our survey data indicate that the type of portal that  providers use may influence the extent to which patients access their  available health information. In particular, patients we interviewed noted  that they sometimes experienced technical difficulties when attempting to  access information through the portal or were confused by the portal\u2019s  user interfaces. For example, patients noted that they were sometimes  unable to access information in their portals due to the sites being down  for maintenance or that their portals were not optimized for viewing on a  mobile device, which limited their ability to use the portal. Several patients  also expressed frustration with the user interface of the portal offered by  their providers, noting that it was difficult to navigate and find the  information they wanted. About two-thirds of the providers we surveyed  reported taking steps to improve their patient portal\u2019s usability or design.  Our provider survey data indicate that most providers offer patient portals  that are packaged with their EHR system and therefore provided by the  same vendor. One vendor we interviewed noted that it allows for some  customization for each customer. We viewed demonstrations of three  EHR systems\u2019 patient portals, and observed that the portal design does  vary by vendor.
