This was attained because top management dedicated considerable resources to address accounting and reporting deficiencies. We consider this a positive step; however, sustaining this outcome and achieving financial accountability will require more than obtaining year-end numbers for financial statement purposes. The Forest Service continues to face several major challenges, many of which resulted in unfavorable audit opinions in the past. Specifically, the Forest Service's fiscal year 2002 financial statement audit report disclosed material internal control weaknesses related to its two major asset accounts--fund balance with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and property, plant, and equipment--as well as for certain estimated liabilities, payroll processes, computer security controls, and software application controls related to its procurement and property systems. Further, the Forest Service has not addressed the challenges of replacing or enhancing legacy feeder systems and implementing a financial management field operation that supports efficient and effective day-to-day financial operations and routinely produces reliable and timely financial information. The Forest Service has corrective actions underway or planned that are intended to resolve these problems, including a financial management strategic plan.

Through the National Forest System, the  Forest Service manages about 192 million acres, comprising about 8.5  percent of the total surface area of the United States.  On these lands, the  Forest Service, among other things, supports recreation, sells timber,  provides rangeland for grazing, and maintains and protects watersheds,  wilderness, fish, and wildlife.  In addition, the Forest Service provides  financial and program support for state and private forests and undertakes  research activities.  The Forest Service, headed by a chief, conducts its  activities through 9 regional offices, 6 research offices, 1 state and private  forestry area office, the Forest Products Laboratory, and the International  Institute of Tropical Forestry.   In addition, the National Forest System has  155 national forest offices and more than 600 ranger district offices.", "The Chief of the Forest Service manages from the national office,  headquartered in Washington, D.C., and provides national-level policy and  direction to the field offices.

The  Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA) requires the CFO  Act agencies to prepare and have audits of annual financial statements.   FFMIA builds on the foundation laid by these acts by emphasizing the need  for agencies to have systems that routinely generate timely, accurate, and  useful information.  Specifically, FFMIA requires that the auditor report on  whether the agencies\u2019 financial management systems substantially comply  with (1) federal financial management systems requirements,   (2) applicable federal accounting standards, and (3) the U. S. Government  Standard General Ledger (SGL) at the transaction level requirements. As  authorized by GMRA, the Office of Management and Budget is responsible  for identifying components of the designated CFO Act agencies that are  required to have audited financial statements.  OMB requires that the  Forest Service, a major component of USDA, have audited financial  statements.", "Since its first financial statement audit for the fiscal year ended September  30, 1991, the Forest Service has faced numerous serious accounting and  financial reporting weaknesses that have prevented it from receiving a  positive audit opinion.

In January  1999, due to the longstanding serious accounting and financial reporting  problems, we designated Forest Service financial management as a high- risk area.  We continued to designate financial management at Forest  Service as high-risk in our 2003 report.

Therefore, efforts to improve  controls over certain financial management computer systems and internal  controls over accounting processes must be made in cooperation with  USDA and NFC.  For example, the Forest Service uses the USDA  Foundation Financial Information System as its standard accounting  system.  In addition, NFC maintains and controls entry of many Forest  Service transactions into FFIS.  NFC also reports expenditures and  collections it processes on the Forest Service\u2019s behalf to Treasury.  FFIS  also depends on and receives data from feeder systems used by the Forest  Service to record its transactions.

Further, we examined the Forest Service\u2019s financial management  policies, procedures, and processes, including completed, ongoing and  planned activities and related implementation schedules to determine the  Forest Service\u2019s progress, plans, and milestones for addressing financial  management problems.  We attended a Forest Service Budget and Finance  planning conference and a financial statement training session conducted  by the USDA CFO to gain a further understanding of Forest Service efforts  to improve its financial statement compilation processes and overcome  other financial management challenges.  We analyzed reported financial  management problems against the corrective actions taken to determine  the remaining challenges.  Further, we discussed the remaining challenges  and the status of improvement efforts with officials from USDA and the  Forest Service Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the USDA IG, and  independent contractors working for the Forest Service.", "We also visited and interviewed financial management staff at five Forest  Service field locations.

For the first time since its initial financial  statement audit that covered fiscal year 1991, the Forest Service received  an unqualified or \u201cclean\u201d opinion on its fiscal year 2002 financial  statements.  To achieve this milestone, the Forest Service\u2019s top  management dedicated considerable resources and focused staff efforts to  address accounting and reporting deficiencies that had prevented a  favorable opinion in the past.", "Historically the Forest Service\u2019s financial management systems have not  generated timely and accurate financial statements for its annual audit.  In  addition, the Forest Service has had long-standing material weaknesses  with regard to its two major assets--fund balance with Treasury and  property, plant, and equipment.  In the past, such weaknesses prevented  the IG from validating these two line items on both the Forest Service and  the USDA departmentwide financial statements.  In fiscal year 2002, the  Forest Service reorganized the Budget and Finance Deputy Chief/CFO area  and focused staff efforts to address reporting and accounting deficiencies  identified in the fiscal year 2001 financial statement audit with the goal that  the fiscal year 2002 financial statements would pass audit tests. To assist in  these efforts, the Forest Service hired senior financial management  officials, consultants and contractors and formed a financial reports team  and several reconciliation \u201cstrike\u201d teams to improve (1) the financial  statement compilation process and (2) reconciliations of its major  accounts, including fund balance with Treasury and property, plant, and  equipment.", "During fiscal year 2002, the financial reports team completed a number of  efforts to improve the compilation process.  For example, the team held a  series of financial statement workshops for national office and field staff,  updated the methodology for preparing the fiscal year 2002 financial  statements, and provided the necessary information to complete the audit,  such as account analyses and supporting documentation for sample  transactions selected for testing.", "Six reconciliation strike teams, consisting of contractors with expertise in  reconciliation procedures and experienced Forest Service staff, performed  financial statement account reconciliations and reviews to help ensure the  accuracy and timeliness of recorded accounting data and that subsidiary  ledgers were reconciled to general ledger accounts.  The strike teams  analyzed account data, identifying accounting errors and documenting  adjustments to key asset, liability, and budgetary accounts in order to  achieve accurate account balances.  The fund balance with Treasury team  focused on reconciling material fiscal year 2002 and prior-year cash  transactions.  The property, plant, and equipment reconciliation team  analyzed transaction data to identify inaccurate records and reconciled the  general ledger to its supporting detailed records. In addition, the property,  plant, and equipment strike team, in cooperation with the USDA Office of  the Chief Financial Officer, the USDA IG, and consultants, worked to  ensure that property documentation supported property records,  inventories were complete, and property was valued correctly.", "Further, the property, plant, and equipment reconciliation team, worked  with USDA on modifications and enhancements to certain property feeder  systems.  For example, in September 2002, USDA completed an automated  interface with the Infrastructure Real Property Subsidiary System (INFRA)  and FFIS.  INFRA was revised to improve security by implementing  controls such as user access restriction and password protection.  Also,  access to key data elements in the Personal Property System (PROP) and  the Equipment Management Information System (EMIS) was restricted by  September 2002 in order to address security weaknesses.  At the same time,  certain automated error checks were added to EMIS to help ensure data  integrity.", "While the primary focus of the reports and reconciliations teams was to  help attain a clean fiscal year 2002 audit opinion, the teams have been  institutionalized to work toward sustainable report compilation and  reconciliation processes.  Through these established account  reconciliations and analyses, the teams are able to identify many of the  underlying causes of inaccurate data and out of balance conditions.   Specifically, according to the Forest Service CFO management, many of the  problems are caused by improper recording of transactions, FFIS system  problems, faulty interfaced and integrated feeder systems, lack of  consistent formal policies and procedures, lack of staff training and manual  accounting processes prone to human error.  By understanding the root  causes, the Forest Service has resolved some of the problems identified.   For example, the strike teams coordinated with USDA to correct several   programming errors  in FFIS that were causing inappropriate accounting.   For instance,  the fund balance with Treasury team found that fund  transfers between Forest Service units for equipment usage, which are  noncash transactions, were incorrectly recorded and reported to Treasury  as cash collections.  As result, the Forest Service\u2019s fund balance account at  Treasury was being overstated by these amounts.", "During fiscal year 2002, the Forest Service CFO management also issued  new policies and procedures or revised existing ones to help ensure the  quality and integrity of the financial data in FFIS and the feeder systems.   To communicate these changes, the Forest Service CFO issued over 25  CFO bulletins to accounting staff as the need for accounting and reporting  controls were identified.  For example, the CFO issued several bulletins  that provided guidance on the proper recording of transactions, such as the  types of transaction codes to use when entering data into FFIS. The CFO  also issued bulletins (1) requiring analysis of delinquent bills to determine  their collectability and (2) to clarify documentation requirements for  personal and real property transactions.", "Further, Forest Service management continued to emphasize the  importance of financial accountability to its line managers in the field.  In  April 2002, the Forest Service CFO implemented a set of financial  performance indicators to monitor progress of the field staff in maintaining  its accounts, including progress in clearing suspense account items,  monitoring collection of receivables, and compliance with CFO accounting  guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Progress Made, Accountability Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["Achieving financial accountability involves more than obtaining a clean  audit opinion by producing reliable onetime year-end numbers for financial  statement purposes.

In its December  2002 report on the Forest Service\u2019s fiscal year 2002 financial statements,  the auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (KPMG), continued to identify  serious material internal control weaknesses and FFMIA noncompliance  issues primarily related to weaknesses in controls over financial  management computer systems that could adversely affect the Forest  Service\u2019s ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data in  a timely manner.", "The auditor attributed many of the deficiencies identified to lack of  adequately trained staff; lack of manual internal control procedures, such  as supervisory reviews; and poor automated controls, such as user access,  system edits and system interfaces, within the FFIS and certain feeder  systems that transfer the data to FFIS.  As discussed in table 2, the auditor  made several recommendations to address these conditions.

One example of noncompliance with federal financial  management systems requirements was that the Forest Service did not  have required certification and accreditations of security controls  performed timely on its procurement and property systems.  Further, the  Forest Service did not record revenue for certain collections, such as map  sales and camp site reservation fees, when they were collected, as required  by federal accounting standards. Instead, collections and fees were  recorded in a suspense account and revenue was recognized when the  money was used for other operational needs instead of when the revenue  was actually earned.

In the past, the IG and we have reported long-standing  problems with the feeder systems that process and transfer financial  information into FFIS.  Several of the  feeder systems that generate data  used to support the financial statements predate FFIS and have antiquated  technology. Because significant differences existed between the data in the  FFIS general ledger and its supporting detail in the feeder systems,  financial statements produced by FFIS could not be relied upon. For  example, the Forest Service uses several feeder systems to support its  multibillion dollar property, plant, and equipment line item in its financial  statements, including (1) Infrastructure Real Property Subsidiary System  (INFRA), (2) Personal Property System (PROP), and (3) Equipment  Management Information Systems (EMIS).  These feeder systems also rely,  in some cases, on data transferred from other lower level (subsidiary)  feeder systems.  In prior years, material internal control weaknesses in the  compilation of the property, plant, and equipment balance contributed  to a  disclaimer of an opinion on the Forest Service\u2019s financial statements.", "In preparation for the fiscal year 2002 audit, the Forest Service engaged a  consultant to perform extensive procedures to arrive at an opening  (October 1, 2001) property, plant, and equipment balance using statistical  sampling of property records.  The existing data was examined for  erroneous and duplicate records through a variety of means, including  checks for mathematical accuracy and comparisons with physical records  and inventories.  During this process, the consultant discovered that the  lack of and/or faulty interfaces between these feeder systems and FFIS  resulted in erroneous postings to the property, plant, and equipment  account.  Although the Forest Service has made certain improvements to  its property feeder systems during fiscal year 2002, more needs to be done  to improve the quality and integrity of financial data in FFIS and the feeder  systems.", "In its fiscal year 2002 report on Forest Service\u2019s Information Technology,  the auditor reported certain weaknesses in internal controls related to the  feeder systems.  For example, the auditor found duplicate and dropped  records after data was transferred between PROP, the Purchase Order  Normal Tracking and Inventory System, and the Purchase Order System.   The auditor also reported that system data validation and error detection  controls were ineffective in EMIS.  Further, the auditor reported  weaknesses related to the Automated Timber Sales Accounting System  (ASTA).  Specifically, there were no controls built into ASTA to prevent  duplicate transactions from being recorded. As a result, field unit staff had  to manually review the data to identify any transactions that were  erroneously entered more than once.", "We visited and interviewed financial management staff at five Forest  Service field offices about the accounting processes and systems used to  obtain a \u201cfield\u201d perspective on financial management problems and the  status of improvement efforts.  At the field offices we visited, the financial  management staff told us that system issues affect their operations.  For  example, one field office uses the Timber Information Management (TIM)  system, an upfront system used to record the initial information and  produce bills for timber sales and wood product permits.  Since the system   does not interface with FFIS, users have to manually enter the timber sale  deposits and permit sales into FFIS. Lack of an automated interface  between the systems  increases workload as well as the risk of input errors.", "Problems with the financial management systems continue to hamper the  Forest Service\u2019s ability to move to sustainable processes.  Until the Forest  Service resolves its systems problems, the financial statements produced  by FFIS cannot be relied upon without significant manual intervention to  reconcile differences between FFIS and the feeder-systems.

Under the current organization, financial activities  are performed and recorded at the Forest Service national office, nine  regional forest offices, six research stations and USDA NFC as well as at  hundreds of forest and district ranger offices where many transactions  originate.  The decentralized financial management organization presents a  significant challenge because the Forest Service\u2019s national office financial  management team is tasked with ensuring that staff at hundreds of field  locations are routinely processing accounting transactions accurately and  consistently, in accordance with management directives.", "Since February 1998, we have reported that the Forest Service\u2019s  autonomous and decentralized organizational structure could hinder  management\u2019s ability to achieve financial accountability.  In March 1998, an  independent contractor, hired by the Forest Service to assess the agency\u2019s  financial management and organization, also raised the issue of the  agency\u2019s autonomous organizational structure.  The contractor reported  that the Forest Service lacked a consistent structure for financial  management practices and that each field unit was operating  independently.  In response to these concerns, the Forest Service  conducted a Financial Management Field Operation Assessment (FOA),  which was completed in March 2001.  As part of the assessment, the FOA  project team evaluated the current level of accountability for financial  management and made six recommendations to strengthen lines of  responsibility and accountability.  Specifically, the team recommended that  the Forest Service (1) ensure that appropriate delegation of authority is in  place, (2) finalize performance measures for financial management,   (3) appoint field directors as responsible financial accountability officers  for their respective units, (4) appoint deputy chiefs in the national office as  responsible financial accountability officers for their units, (5) provide  training and develop core competencies, and (6) establish policies and  guidelines addressing the development, implementation, and financing  arrangements for shared services agreements related to financial activities.", "The Forest Service has taken several actions to address the FOA  recommendations related to the autonomous field structure to improve  accountability for financial management in the field and throughout the  organization.  For example, the agency restructured its national office  financial management team to create functional lines of accountability for  Budget and Finance management, under the leadership of the deputy CFO,  who reports directly to the Chief of the Forest Service.  The Forest Service   also appointed field directors (regional foresters, research station  directors, etc.) to serve as the responsible financial accountability officers  for their units.  Further, beginning in 2001, the Forest Service began to  restructure its regional offices to mirror the national office\u2019s financial  management structure.  Currently, six of the nine regional offices have  consolidated budget and finance functions, under the direction of a  financial director who is responsible for financial management activities in  the region. Another regional office is in the process of restructuring its  financial management organization.  The two remaining regional offices  have no definite plans to change their financial management structure.

An effective plan includes long-term and short- term plans with clearly defined goals and objectives and specific corrective  actions, target dates, and resources necessary to implement those actions.   A comprehensive plan also prioritizes projects and assigns accountability  by identifying responsible offices and staff responsible for carrying out the  corrective actions.  Without such a plan, it will be difficult to fix  accountability for its many efforts and effectively monitor progress against  its end goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service has demonstrated strong leadership and commitment to  reach its goal of obtaining an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2002  financial statements.  At the same time, many of the financial management  improvement efforts implemented to date are outside of normal business  processes and focus mainly on obtaining reliable year-end numbers for  financial statement purposes.  The Forest Service still must overcome  several major challenges before it can move to sustainable processes that  can routinely provide accurate, relevant, and timely information to support  program management and accountability.  The Forest Service is at a critical  juncture.  If the Forest Service is to achieve and sustain financial  accountability, it must fundamentally improve its underlying internal  controls, including financial management computer system controls, and  financial management operations.  The Forest Service has various efforts  underway or planned, that if successfully carried through, will be important  steps toward addressing the financial management challenges it faces.    However, to date, several  problems identified by the IG, KPMG, and us  remain.  Some of Forest Service problems are deep-seated and therefore  will require sustained leadership and commitment of significant resources  and time to resolve.
