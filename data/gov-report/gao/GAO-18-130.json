The act further requires for any fiscal year in which funds  are expended for development or sustainment pursuant to a covered  defense business system program, the appropriate approval official to  review the system to determine if the system: has been, or is being, reengineered to be as streamlined and efficient  as practicable, and whether the implementation of the system will  maximize the elimination of unique software requirements and unique  interfaces;  is in compliance with the business enterprise architecture or will be in  compliance as a result of planned modifications; has valid, achievable requirements, and a viable plan for  implementing those requirements (including, as appropriate, market  research, business process reengineering, and prototyping activities); has an acquisition strategy designed to eliminate or reduce the need  to tailor commercial off-the-shelf systems to meet unique  requirements, incorporate unique requirements, or incorporate unique  interfaces to the maximum extent practicable; and  is in compliance with the department\u2019s auditability requirements.", "We compared Office of the Deputy Chief Management Office (DCMO)  certification guidance with the act\u2019s certification requirements. In addition,  we compared the guidance established by the Departments of the Air  Force, the Army, and the Navy for certifying their business systems with  the act\u2019s certification requirements.", "We also interviewed cognizant officials responsible for managing defense  business system investments at DOD, including the military departments.  Specifically, we interviewed officials in the Office of the DCMO, the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), and the Offices  of the CMOs in the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has developed and maintained a  defense business enterprise architecture and IT enterprise architecture, in  accordance with relevant laws and OMB policy and guidance, we  assessed the business enterprise architecture against the relevant laws  and OMB policy and guidance; the IT enterprise architecture against the  relevant laws and OMB policy and guidance; and the department\u2019s efforts  to integrate its business and IT architectures against the act\u2019s  requirement.", "To determine the extent to which the department has developed and  maintained a business enterprise architecture in accordance with relevant  laws and OMB policy and guidance, we reviewed version 10 of its  business enterprise architecture, which was released in February 2013,  and related information relative to the act\u2019s requirements; U.S. Code,  Title 44, Section 3601, which defines an enterprise architecture; and  OMB policy and guidance. We also reviewed version 11 of the  architecture to determine the extent to which it differed from version 10.", "Further, we reviewed the department\u2019s business enterprise architecture  improvement plan, which it developed in response to a recommendation  we made in July 2015. Specifically, we recommended that the  department use the results of our portfolio manager survey to determine  additional actions that could improve the department\u2019s management of its  enterprise architecture activities. In response to our recommendation, the  department developed and approved a plan in January 2017. We  assessed the extent to which the department had delivered the planned  capabilities relative to the plan. We also reviewed the extent to which the  delivery dates of the three planned capabilities and associated tasks  changed over time relative to the plan.", "To assess the extent to which the department developed and maintained  an IT enterprise architecture in accordance with relevant laws and OMB  policy and guidance, we reviewed content from the department\u2019s IT  enterprise architecture and compared it with requirements from the act,  U.S. Code, Title 44, Section 3601, and OMB policy and guidance.", "Specifically, we reviewed version 2.0 of the department\u2019s information  enterprise architecture, which was released in August 2012, relative to  the act\u2019s requirement for the DOD CIO to develop an IT enterprise  architecture that is to describe a plan for improving the IT and computing  infrastructure of the department, including for each of the major business  processes. We reviewed volumes I and II of the information enterprise  architecture and the four enterprise-wide reference architectures to  determine if the architecture described a plan for improving the IT and  computing infrastructure of the department, as called for by the act. We  also reviewed whether the architecture included content that described  the current and the target environments, and a transition plan to get from  the current to the target environment, consistent with OMB policy and  guidance.", "To determine the extent to which the department has integrated its  business and IT architectures, as required by the act, we reviewed DOD  Directive 8000.01, Management of the Department of Defense  Information Enterprise. We also reviewed meeting documentation from  the information enterprise architecture working group responsible for the  development of an updated architecture. In addition, we reviewed  meeting documentation from the Business Enterprise Architecture  Configuration Control Board to identify any discussions among CIO and  DCMO officials regarding integration of the two architectures, as well as  the level of participation by both parties.", "Finally, we interviewed officials in the Office of the DCMO and the Office  of the CIO about efforts to develop and maintain a business enterprise  architecture, develop an IT enterprise architecture, and integrate the  business and IT architectures.", "To determine the extent to which the department has used the Defense  Business Council to provide advice to the Secretary of Defense on  developing the business enterprise architecture, reengineering the  department\u2019s business processes, developing and deploying business  systems, and developing requirements for business systems, in  accordance with the act, we analyzed the department\u2019s December 2014  Defense Business Council Charter and April 2017 defense business  systems investment management guidance. We compared information in  the charter and guidance to the requirement that the Secretary establish  the Defense Business Council to advise the Secretary on the required  defense business system topics.", "In addition, we obtained and analyzed meeting summaries and briefings  for 27 Defense Business Council meetings that took place from January  2016 through August 2017. Specifically, we assessed the frequency  with which the meetings held during this time period addressed the  required topics. We chose this time period because 2016 was the first  calendar year following the enactment of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016.  Further, we chose August 2017 as our end date because it was the last  month\u2019s data that we could reasonably expect to obtain and review within  our reporting time frame. We also interviewed officials in the Offices of the  DCMO and CIO about the Defense Business Council and the Deputy\u2019s  Management Action Group, which is the governance entity to which the  Council reports.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has ensured that covered  business systems are reviewed and certified in accordance with the act,  we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of business systems from DOD\u2019s  two categories of covered defense business systems that require  certification. To select the sample, we considered Category I systems,  which were systems that were expected to have a total amount of budget  authority of more than $250 million over the period of the current future- years defense program, and Category II systems, which were systems  that were expected to have a total amount of budget authority of between  $50 million and $250 million over the period of the future-years defense  program.", "We further categorized the Category II systems into four groups\u2014those  owned by the Air Force, the Army, Navy, and the remaining DOD  components. We selected one system with the highest expected cost  over the course of the department\u2019s future-years defense program from  each group. This resulted in our selection of five systems: one Category I  system, one Category II system from each military department, and one  Category II system from the remaining DOD components.", "We reviewed, respectively, DOD\u2019s Healthcare Management System  Modernization Program; Air Force\u2019s Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul  initiative; Army\u2019s Reserve Component Automation System; Navy\u2019s  Electronic Procurement System; and the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s  Defense Agencies Initiative Increment 2. We determined that the number  of systems we selected was sufficient for our evaluation.", "For each system, we assessed the extent to which it had been certified  on the basis of the five certification requirements in the act. Specifically,  we evaluated investment decision memos and certification assertions to  determine if each system had been certified according to the act\u2019s  requirements, which include ensuring that the system had been, or was  being, reengineered to be as streamlined and efficient as practicable, and  the implementation of the system would maximize the elimination of  unique software requirements and unique interfaces; was in compliance  with the business enterprise architecture or would be in compliance as a  result of planned modifications; had valid, achievable requirements, and a  viable plan for implementing those requirements; had an acquisition  strategy designed to eliminate or reduce the need to tailor commercial off- the-shelf systems to meet unique requirements, incorporate unique  requirements, or incorporate unique interfaces to the maximum extent  practicable; and was in compliance with the department\u2019s auditability  requirements. We did not determine whether the certification assertions  were valid. For example, we did not evaluate business process  reengineering activities to determine if they were sufficient. We also  interviewed DOD DCMO and military department officials about the  certification of these systems.", "To determine the reliability of the business system cost data used to  select the systems, we reviewed system documentation for the three  systems DOD uses to store data, which include the Defense Information  Technology Investment Portal, the DOD Information Technology Portfolio  Repository, and the Select and Native Programming-Information  Technology system. In this regard, we requested and reviewed  department responses to questions about the systems and about how the  department ensures the quality and reliability of the data. In addition, we  requested and reviewed documentation related to the systems (e.g., data  dictionaries, system instructions, and user training manuals) and  reviewed the data for obvious issues, including missing or questionable  values. We also reviewed available reports on the quality of the  inventories (e.g., inspector general reports). We found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for our purpose of selecting systems for evaluation.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to March 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
