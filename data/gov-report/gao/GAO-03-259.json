About 70 percent of the money that has been collected by these 35 charities has been reported distributed to survivors or spent on disaster relief since September 11, 2001. Charities used the money they collected to provide direct cash assistance and a wide range of services to families of those killed, those more indirectly affected through loss of their job or residence, and to disaster relief workers. Some of the charities plan to use funds to provide services over the longer term, such as for scholarships, mental health counseling, and employment assistance. Charities and government oversight agencies have taken a number of steps to prevent fraud by individuals or organizations, and relatively few cases have been uncovered so far. However, the total extent of fraud is not known and will be difficult to assess particularly in situations when organizations solicit funds on behalf of September 11 but use the funds for other purposes. Overall, charitable aid made a major contribution in the nation's response to the September 11 attacks, despite very difficult circumstances. Through the work of charities, millions of people contributed to the recovery effort. At the same time, lessons have been learned that could improve future charitable responses in disasters, including easing access to aid, enhancing coordination among charities and between charities and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), increasing attention to public education, and planning for future events. FEMA and some charitable organizations have taken some steps to address these issues. However, the independence of charitable organizations, while one of their key strengths, will make the implementation of these lessons dependent on close collaboration and agreement among charities involved in aiding in disasters."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On September 11, 2001, America suffered terrorist attacks that resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000 people in New York City (NYC), at the Pentagon in Virginia, and in Pennsylvania.

Federal, state, and local governments responded to this disaster in a variety of ways, and private charities provided aid beyond that of government. Some surveys suggest that as many as two-thirds of American households have donated money to charitable organizations to aid in the response to the disaster.", "To provide you with information on the role of charitable aid in assisting those affected by the attacks, you asked us to determine the following: (1) How much in donations have charities raised to assist September 11 survivors, and what assistance has been made available to them? (2) What accountability measures are in place to ensure that only eligible individuals receive aid, and what is known about fraud committed by organizations and individuals? (3) What coordination efforts have been pursued, if any, in response to the disaster?

We interviewed officials from 12 of the larger September 11-related funds in NYC and Washington, D.C.; representatives from three September 11 victims groups; officials from various philanthropic oversight organizations; and representatives from the major charities providing assistance after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. We also spoke with officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the federal agency charged with responding to disasters; the NYC Office of Emergency Management; and the Office of Family Policy of the Department of Defense. Finally, we interviewed officials from government oversight agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), officials from state charity offices or attorneys general offices in seven states, and the New York County (Manhattan) District Attorney\u2019s Office. We conducted our review from January through November 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We did not independently verify data provided by the charitable organizations or oversight officials, and it was not within the scope of our work to review the charities\u2019 systems of internal control or to trace their use of funds.

At the end of 1999, the assets of Section 501(c)(3) organizations approached $1.2 trillion and their annual revenues approached $720 billion.

Notwithstanding these powers, IRS is not generally responsible for overseeing how well a charity spends its funds or meets its charitable purpose.", "Despite the federal government\u2019s significant indirect subsidy of charities through their tax-exempt status and the allowance of charitable deductions by individuals, the federal government has a fairly limited role in monitoring charities, with states providing the primary oversight of charities through their attorneys general and/or charity offices. These officials maintain registries of charities and professional fundraisers, including financial reports of registrants. They also monitor the solicitation and administration of charitable assets. Attorneys general and state charity officials have extensive power to investigate charities\u2019 compliance with state law and can correct noncompliance through the courts.

Next, depending on the extent and nature of devastation to a community and charities\u2019 typical services and capacities, some charities are best structured to provide longer-term assistance, such as job training or mental health counseling. Finally, new charities may form post-disaster to address the needs of all survivors or specific population groups. For example, after the September 11 attacks, charities were established to serve survivors of restaurant workers and firefighters.", "FEMA is the lead federal agency for responding to disasters and may link with charitable organizations to provide assistance. According to FEMA regulations, in the event of a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, such as September 11, FEMA is required to coordinate relief and assistance activities of federal, state, and local governments; the American Red Cross; the Salvation Army; and the Mennonite Disaster Service; as well as other voluntary relief organizations that agree to operate under FEMA\u2019s direction. Although charities are expected to be among the first agencies to provide assistance to those affected, in the event of some natural disasters, FEMA may anticipate need and be the first to respond. FEMA can provide a range of assistance to individual disaster survivors. In a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or flood, the bulk of FEMA\u2019s individual assistance program money tends to be given to individuals whose residences have been damaged. September 11 presented a different challenge for the agency: few people had damage to their homes, but many needed unemployment assistance and help paying their mortgage or rent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Sources of Disaster Relief Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Though FEMA and charities provide key resources to survivors of disasters, a range of additional aid may be available for those affected by the September 11 attacks.

The IRS took steps to quickly grant tax-exempt status to about half of these 600 charities after September 11. While some of these new charities appear to be smaller, specific fundraising events such as the Hike of Hope, others like the Twin Towers Fund, which raised $205 million, became major charities. While any one charity will have information on its funding and services, the charitable sector as a whole generally does not have reporting mechanisms in place to track funds across entities or for any one event. Some tracking efforts are under way, however. For example, the Metro New York Better Business Bureau Foundation recently surveyed the 470 September 11-related charities they identified and 270 responded to its request for fund information.", "Further complicating a precise tally of funds is the interfund transfers that occurred among charities.

Likewise, the United Jewish Federation of New York distributed $5.4 million in grants it received from the New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund and the United Jewish Communities of North America. The Metro New York Better Business Bureau Foundation estimates that more than $400 million of the charitable aid it is tracking represents duplicate listings of money raised by grant-making organizations and the direct service providers they are funding. Moreover, an unknown number of corporations have sold and are still selling products for which some portions of the proceeds are to be donated to September 11 charities, a practice known as \u201ccause-related marketing.\u201d Some reports cite hundreds of products being sold in the name of September 11 charities; the extent to which these funds have already been forwarded to charities is not known.", "A more complete accounting of the number of September 11 charities and the amounts they raised might be possible when all charitable organizations have filed with IRS the required annual information form, called the IRS 990.

This form is due in the fifth month after the close of the organization\u2019s taxable year. As IRS 990 forms for these charities become available, examination of them may yield more information; however, the way these data are reported may not necessarily allow a precise accounting of dollars raised for September 11.

McKinsey\u2019s survey of nonuniformed World Trade Center families showed that 98 percent of families reported receiving cash assistance averaging $90,000 per family. Because of the charities specifically established to assist the survivors of the firefighters and police killed in the attacks, their survivors will receive more cash assistance than survivors of the nonuniformed people killed.

In November 2001, IRS issued guidance that authorized charities to make payments to September 11 victims and their families without a specific needs test, if made in good faith and using objective standards. Some charities and oversight agencies we spoke with said that this placed some charities under pressure to more quickly distribute their funds.

By the middle of November 2001, contributions to the American Red Cross\u2019s Liberty Fund reached nearly $543 million. The American Red Cross had established the Liberty Fund to help people affected by the September 11 attacks, its aftermath, and other terrorist events that could occur in the near future. While American Red Cross officials said that from early on it used its traditional language in its fund appeals saying that funds raised would be used for \u201cthis and other disasters,\u201d it was widely perceived as a violation of the donors\u2019 intent in this case. In response to concerns about the organization\u2019s use of funds, on November 14, 2001, the American Red Cross pledged that the entire Liberty Fund would be spent to care for those directly and indirectly affected by the September 11 attacks, their families, and the rescue workers. Fulfillment of donor intent is an important issue, and many charities we spoke with said that they were keeping their spending within the framework of what they believed donors wanted: to quickly meet the needs of those for whom aid is intended.", "Representatives from philanthropic oversight organizations said charities in general could have minimized some of the problems they faced by paying more attention to the public relations aspects of their work.

Problems these representatives cited include the following:   Some charities made vague appeals for money, and the public didn\u2019t understand what programs these funds might support.", "Victims and the needs of the survivors were too narrowly defined.", "Some charities communicated a simplistic definition of those needing help as only the survivors of those people who were killed or those who were injured in the terrorist attacks. However, in the September 11 disasters, thousands of others were displaced from their homes, lost their jobs, and needed counseling to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "Some charities implied that all of the funds collected would go to direct assistance without any management and administrative cost.

The foundation recruited volunteers to contact World Trade Center employers and reported having to sign 55 different confidentiality agreements with companies, airlines, and individuals, to ensure that Robin Hood Foundation would not share its list with other agencies. In the case of those killed and injured at the Pentagon, confidentiality was a concern as well. The Pentagon provided the Foundation with a list of beneficiary names for the checks but sent a representative to New York to put the checks in the envelopes and apply the address labels.", "Charities made many efforts to reach out to hard-to-serve clients, non- English speakers, and immigrants. For example, the New York Immigration Coalition received $800,000 from The September 11th Fund and money in other grants to provide legal assistance, establish immigrant help desks at each disaster center, and train charity workers on how to better reach immigrants. The NYC Department of Health reported that 20 percent of those killed in NYC were foreign-born, coming from 167 different countries. Charity officials said the Immigration and Naturalization Service facilitated their efforts to reach immigrants by announcing it would not pursue information on the immigration status of individuals. Also, some charities such as Windows of Hope were created to specifically serve low-income restaurant workers with language barriers.", "In spite of outreach efforts, representatives from the victims groups we spoke with said that survivors were not aware of all charitable services and assistance available.

Workers interviewed for the study said a single source of information and referrals for emergency assistance, job placement assistance, or job training would have been helpful.", "In addition, some people we spoke with in NYC expressed concern that many indirectly affected survivors did not qualify for assistance because they lived outside the geographic area below Canal Street in Manhattan, which was initially targeted for aid by FEMA and many charities. After much public concern about the limited geographic range of FEMA\u2019s eligibility regulations, in August 2002, the Congress mandated FEMA to expand its mortgage and rental assistance to employees working anywhere in Manhattan and to those who could track job loss or loss of income to September 11.

They reported that since September 11, they had found relatively few cases of fraud, either by charities or individuals. These attorneys general and state charity officials from the seven states that suffered high numbers of casualties from September 11 told us they are investigating a combined total of 17 suspected cases of fraudulent solicitation of funds.

This employee told his co-workers about his success in obtaining charitable aid under pretense, and 23 of his colleagues attempted to do the same.", "A man hired 13 homeless people to help him defraud charities. He supplied the homeless people with fraudulent documentation of job loss and financial need, then drove them around to relief sites around the city, where they applied for and received a total of $108,905 from charities.", "In addition, the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office reported investigating approximately 20 additional cases of individual fraud, many of which are related to individuals who allegedly attempted to obtain false death certificates.", "While information is available on identified fraud cases, the total extent of fraud is not known and will be difficult for oversight agencies and charities to assess. First, detection of fraud by individuals could be challenging, despite checks being in place, as charities said they were overwhelmed by the volume of applications for assistance and had to hire new staff or volunteers to help them manage their relief efforts. The potential for fraud by individuals may have increased, as the new personnel may have been unfamiliar with the charities\u2019 eligibility regulations and may have inappropriately distributed or denied funds. Second, fraud detection may be particularly problematic in areas such as cause-related marketing by businesses. For example, the executive director of the Twin Towers Fund told us he was unaware of a record company\u2019s marketing campaign on the fund\u2019s behalf, until he read about it in the newspaper. The charity had to contact the record company, then set up a contract to formalize the terms of the fundraising. Third, it may also be difficult to track fund-raising by groups using September 11 to solicit for other purposes. In one state, oversight officials told us that an organization conducted a telemarketing drive promising that funds would be given to \u201cfirefighters, like those who died September 11,\u201d but no funds went to the survivors of firefighters who died in the attacks.

Some efforts at formal coordination include Family Assistance Centers and Disaster Assistance Service Centers, where some of the larger charities and government agencies set up booths to provide assistance to survivors and those economically affected by the disaster. The United Way of the National Capital Area held information-sharing meetings for Washington and Virginia service providers and the New York Community Trust did so as well.", "Despite these efforts, September 11 survivors generally believed that they had to navigate a maze of service providers in the early months, and both charities and those individuals who were more indirectly affected by the disaster (e.g., by job loss) were confused about what aid might be available.

First, those seeking aid had to fill out a separate application and provide a unique set of documentation for each charity to which they applied.  Second, in the early stages post-disaster, all survivors had to apply in person for charitable assistance, even if they had previously obtained aid from the organization. This became troublesome for the many survivors who did not live in metropolitan New York or Washington. Charities like Pennsylvania September 11th Assistance ended up paying for survivors\u2019 travel to the Liberty Park Family Assistance Center in New Jersey. Third, over the course of the first few weeks after the disaster, many dimensions of coordination were limited by little information sharing between organizations helping survivors. For example, some charities said that they were not familiar with other organization\u2019s rules, especially FEMA\u2019s. Furthermore, because of privacy laws, charities and FEMA did not share information about clients with each other; as a result, in early stages of service delivery, charities might have duplicated services to clients.", "Although ways to address some of these issues have been used in the past, the scope and complexity of the September 11 disasters presented a number of challenges to charities in their attempts to provide seamless social services for survivors of the disaster. In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, charities and service providers worked together to create a database of aid recipients, provide each recipient a case manager, and to participate in a long-term recovery committee to better coordinate aid, fostering a more integrated service delivery approach. The September 11 events differed in key ways that hindered a similar approach:   A much larger and more diverse number of actual and potential aid recipients. The 168 Oklahoma City victims who were killed were a more homogeneous population of federal government workers, while the World Trade Center disaster alone had 2,795 victims from a number of businesses and 167 countries.  In addition, thousands more than in Oklahoma City were indirectly affected through loss of their jobs and homes.", "Numerous governmental jurisdictions. The September 11 attacks occurred in three states, which involved multiple government entities at each site.", "Larger numbers and multiple layers of funders and grantees. In addition to existing charities that were already involved in disaster relief services, the hundreds of new charities that emerged to provide aid to families of those killed were involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A More Integrated Approach Emerged Later", "paragraphs": ["Some months after the disaster, oversight agencies and large funders worked to establish a more coordinated approach at the September 11 attack sites. This approach included the formation of coordinating entities, the implementation of case management systems, and attempts to implement key coordination tools.", "Several coordination efforts emerged at the disaster sites. In NYC, the State Attorney General had encouraged charities to work together to ease access to aid, including use of a common application form and database. The 9/11 United Services Group (USG), a consortium of human service organizations and their affiliated service coordinators, was formed in December 2001 to foster a more coordinated approach to aid delivery. (See appendix V for a list of USG organizations participating in USG service coordination.) Furthermore, in the spring of 2002, FEMA successfully established long-term recovery committees in New York and New Jersey for charities that had smaller September 11 funds than those of USG. In Virginia, the Survivors\u2019 Fund set up a board to assess the unmet needs of survivors and persons who were economically displaced by the disasters. Members of this board include key area agencies, such as the United Way and FEMA, which have historically facilitated coordination in areas affected by disasters.", "As coordination efforts progressed, some charities continued to follow Oklahoma\u2019s model by establishing case managers for individuals who lost family members in the attacks. Although all the charities were familiar with a case management model, cross-agency case management presented challenges, as agencies\u2019 mission statements or regulations specified different qualifications and specializations of their social workers (e.g., Master\u2019s degree required). Despite these challenges, USG\u2019s service coordinator program involves the efforts of a number of charities across the city. If families need help, they can call the Safe Horizon hotline, and an operator there assesses whether the clients have short- or long-term needs, his or her geographic area, and the clients denominational or ethnic preferences for service providers, and then connects them with a 9/11 USG service coordinator. Coordinators are current staff of local charities and have been trained by USG to help survivors identify and access a broad range of services.  They have access to a number of technology tools, including an automated centralized directory of benefits and services available to families and a community website that allows service coordinators to communicate with the entire service coordinator community. Service coordinators, key charity managers, and the New York FEMA Voluntary Agency Liaison also meet weekly to discuss service provision issues. The Survivors\u2019 Fund in Virginia also set up case managers but contracted with another agency to hire new social workers to provide case management services to the injured and families of those killed in the Pentagon attacks.", "Agencies began to develop client databases and a common application form for disaster relief aid. One key advantage of client databases is that the services clients had already received could be tracked by the charities, and as such, would prevent duplication of services. Although many charities expressed concern that their clients would lose their anonymity by signing a confidentiality waiver, the 9/11 USG has established a database of September 11 services for its service coordinators, and a number of their member organizations are creating and using a confidential client information database. The Survivors\u2019 Fund and United Way of the National Capital Area have also created a client database, which is primarily being used by these two agencies. A common application form would improve the aid delivery process by reducing the amount of documentation and forms clients have to provide to each agency. The common application form is in progress in New York. The form has not been established yet, as charities that have trained volunteers nationwide indicated that at this time, they are not interested in retraining all their volunteers to a new application."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned after September 11 Could Improve Future Responses but Pose Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Charities, government agencies, watchdog groups, and survivors\u2019 organizations shared with us lessons that could improve the charitable aid process in disasters in the future.

Access to assistance could be further facilitated if charities adopted a simplified, one-stop application process and a standard waiver of confidentiality that would allow survivors to get access to multiple charities and allow charities to share information on individuals served and avoid duplicative services. While the focus of such an effort would be to facilitate services to those in need, a one-step application process could include a set of basic interview questions or steps designed to prevent fraud. Another way to facilitate eligible survivors receiving assistance is by offering each survivor a case manager, as was done in NYC and in Washington. Case managers can help to identify gaps in service and provide assistance over the long term.", "Enhancing coordination among charities and between charities and FEMA\u2014Private and public agencies could better assist those in need of aid by coordinating, collaborating, sharing information with each other, and understanding each other\u2019s roles and responsibilities. This requires effective working relationships with frequent contacts. Collaborative working relationships are essential building blocks of strategies that ease access to aid, such as a streamlined application process or the establishment of a database of families of those killed and injured to help charities identify service gaps and further collaboration.", "Increasing attention to public education\u2014Charities\u2019 increased attention to public education could better inform the donor public on how their money will be spent and the role of charities in disasters. Controversies over donor intent could be minimized if charities took steps when collecting funds to more clearly specify the purposes of the funds raised, the different categories of people they plan to assist, the services they plan to provide, and how long that assistance will be provided, as that information becomes known.", "Charities can further ensure accountability by more fully informing the public about how their contributions are being used and providing comprehensive information on facets of their operation to the public. The September 11th Fund\u2019s and the Robin Hood Foundation\u2019s Web sites, for example, list updated information on grants, recipients, amounts, and purposes. Moreover, efforts such as those of the Metro New York Better Business Bureau to compile information across multiple organizations can help provide accountability for how funds are used. For future events, the Ford Foundation report on the philanthropic response to September 11 suggested that \u201cthe major philanthropies should consider designating a well-respected public figure who would provide daily media briefings on their responses.\u201d", "Planning for future events\u2014Planning for the role of charities in future disasters could aid the recovery process for individuals and communities. While disasters, victims, and survivors can vary widely, it could be useful for charities to develop an assistance plan to inform the public and guide the charities\u2019 fundraising efforts. In addition, state and local efforts related to emergency preparedness could explicitly address the role of charities and charitable aid in future events.  Future plans could also address accountability issues, including training for charitable aid workers and law enforcement officials about identifying potential fraud and handling referrals for investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Charitable Organizations and FEMA Are Taking Steps to Incorporate Lessons Learned but Face Significant Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While some of the lessons learned can be implemented at the individual charity level, most require a more collaborative response among charities, and some steps are under way to build collaborative responses.

By its inherent nature, the charitable sector is comprised of independent entities responsive to clients and donors; it is not under the direction of a unifying authority. While in situations such as September 11 FEMA is required to coordinate activities of certain charitable organizations, as well as others that agree to such an arrangement, FEMA officials said that in exercising this authority for September 11 and other events, they work closely with charities as a facilitator, not as a leader or director. FEMA officials noted it is important to build and maintain trust with the charitable organizations and to be careful to give local leadership the opportunity to lead in disasters. An externally imposed effort to direct or manage charities, whether by FEMA or another entity, could have deleterious effects; a key strength of charities is their ability to react flexibly and independently in the event of disasters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Overall, charitable aid made a major contribution in the nation\u2019s response to the September 11 attacks. Given the massive scale and unprecedented nature of the attacks, the charities responded under very difficult circumstances.

While much has been accomplished by charities in this disaster, lessons or strategies have also been identified related to improving access to aid, enhancing coordination among charities and between charities and FEMA, increasing attention to public education, and planning for future events that could improve future responses in disasters.", "There are no easy answers as to how to incorporate strategies that may result in a more accessible and transparent service delivery system into any future disasters. Coordination and collaboration among charitable organizations are clearly essential elements of these strategies, and some organizations have taken steps in this direction. At this point in time, an appropriate role for the federal government is to facilitate these efforts through FEMA, the federal agency that already has relationships with many of the key organizations involved in disaster response. This will help to ensure that lessons learned from the September 11 attacks and their aftermath can be incorporated into the nation\u2019s strategies for dealing with large-scale disasters like this in the future. At the same time, it will help to ensure that charities may remain independent and vital in their programs and priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending that the director of FEMA convene a working group of involved parties to take steps to implement strategies for future disasters, building upon the lessons identified in this report and by others to help create sustained efforts to address these issues.

They said the report was fair and balanced and provided technical comments which we included where appropriate. Regarding the recommendation, the American Red Cross expressed some concern over whether FEMA was the right party to convene the working group, stating that the group\u2019s goals would be outside of FEMA\u2019s mission and that it would, therefore, be inappropriate to ask that FEMA be responsible for ensuring the success of the work group. The American Red Cross also said that the goals of the work group would more properly fall under the purview of the nonprofit sector and that work has already started on some of these areas.", "In responding to this concern, we emphasize that our recommendation charges FEMA with convening a working group of involved parties but does not specify that FEMA play the leadership role or be charged with management or oversight of the group\u2019s progress. We agree that the key to the success of a working group in this area will depend on the actions of the charitable and voluntary organizations involved. We also acknowledge that some efforts are under way, including among the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and the United Way, to address some of these issues.  However, we continue to think that it is appropriate for FEMA to play a role in initiating meetings that will bring together involved parties.
