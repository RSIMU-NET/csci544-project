From 1999 through 2009, the Army expended more than $1 billion for LMP. LMP was originally scheduled to be completed by 2005, but after the first deployment in July 2003, the Army delayed fielding because of significant problems. The Army later decided to field the system in two additional deployments: the second in May 2009 and the third in October 2010. GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which the Army will achieve the intended functionality (e.g., supply chain management and materiel maintenance) from LMP for the commands, depots, and arsenals participating in the third deployment. To do this, GAO reviewed Army plans and policies related to LMP and met with Army officials at three Army commands and several third deployment sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army has made improvements to its LMP implementation strategy, but it may not fully achieve the intended LMP functionality in its third deployment, which began in October 2010, because it has not corrected long-standing data inaccuracies and has not fully developed the software and systems needed to support critical functionality. Specifically: (1) GAO previously recommended that the Army improve testing activities to obtain reasonable assurance that the data used by LMP can support the LMP processes. The Army implemented data audits and new testing activities to improve data accuracy, but data issues persist, which could impede LMP functionality. According to Army officials, these new testing activities were designed to assess how well the LMP software functions but not how well the data work in LMP. Third deployment locations were also able to perform individual tests on the data, but these activities were not coordinated or managed by the Army. As a result, the audits and new testing activities did not provide the Army reasonable assurance that the data in LMP are of sufficient quality to achieve the intended LMP functionality once the system has been deployed. Without this assurance, the Army may experience the same data-related problems during the third deployment that were experienced during the second deployment, which prevented Corpus Christi and Letterkenny Army Depots from using LMP functionality as intended. (2) The Army's software development schedule and subsequent testing of capabilities needed by several locations are not expected to be delivered until after September 2010, but costly mitigations may be required if delivery is delayed. Unlike the previous deployments of LMP, the operations at some of the third deployment locations require additional capabilities. For example, the Army Sustainment Command and the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command perform missions that require LMP to interface with existing systems in order to perform day-to-day missions. If the software capabilities are not operating as intended, several sites will not have the necessary LMP functionality to perform their missions. The Army has mitigation plans to address this functionality gap. For example, the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command plans to hire 172 additional personnel, and the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command expects to hire 95 additional personnel to perform manual data entry until the capability is delivered. The Army expects that these mitigation plans will increase costs. Prior to transitioning to LMP, the Army is directed to certify that it is prepared to make the transition, but it is not required to regularly report to Congress specifically on LMP implementation. Congress therefore lacks complete and ongoing information to aid in its oversight of this program characterized by implementation delays and long-standing problems that have precluded LMP functionality at the sites included in the first two LMP deployments. GAO previously recommended that the Army address issues related to its implementation of LMP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends further that the Army periodically report to Congress on the progress of LMP, including its progress in ensuring that the data used in LMP can support the system, timelines for the delivery of software necessary to achieve full benefits, and the costs and time frames of its mitigation strategies.

To  assess what steps the third deployment sites were taking with respect to  preparing for LMP, we met with officials at the Army Sustainment  Command, the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management  Command, and the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command. We also  visited eight sites that are scheduled to deploy LMP during the third  deployment, specifically, two Army depots, three Army arsenals, two  ammunition storage locations, and an Army location that manages the  Army\u2019s pre-positioned stocks. In order to determine the extent to which  the intended functionality of LMP was being achieved at the sites that  deployed LMP in May 2009, we also visited the Aviation and Missile  Command, Corpus Christi Army Depot, and Letterkenny Army Depot.

According to the Army,  the implementation of LMP is intended to help the Army reduce inventory,  improve supply and demand forecast planning, and provide a single source  of data for decision making.

The Army concurred with our recommendation and stated that  the third deployment would involve improved testing as well as additional  efforts to enhance the quality of the data. The Army implemented two new  test activities\u2014the Process and Data Integration Test and the Business  Operations Test\u2014for the third deployment of LMP. According to Army  officials, these test activities incorporated some lessons learned from the  second deployment of LMP. The Process and Data Integration Test, which  was conducted from April 2010 through June 2010, was intended to test an  end-to-end business process using migrated, validated business data from  critical weapons systems. The Business Operations Test, which was  conducted from July 2010 through September 2010, was intended to be an  activity where users would perform transactions in the LMP system using  local data, from their home stations, which would bring data, business  processes, standard operating procedures, and end user training materials  together to ensure success. LMP program management officials told us in  January 2010 that these tests were an improvement over the tests used  during the second deployment of LMP. Specifically, LMP program  management officials stated that the Process and Data Integration Test  was an improvement because the test activity would assess the  compatibility of the migrated data to support LMP processes, such as  verifying that invoices and goods receipts can be processed against  purchase orders. Also, LMP program management officials stated that the  Business Operations Test was an improvement because the sites would  select commodities at their sites and then execute an end-to-end process  to ensure that the LMP processes work. According to LMP program  management officials, the two testing activities were linked because the  test scripts used during the Process and Data Integration Test would be  used to develop the test scripts for the Business Operations Test. LMP  program management officials also told us in June 2010 that both tests  would be used to determine whether the software is meeting the  operational requirements of the third deployment locations, and that the  Business Operations Test, in particular, would evaluate whether the data  used by LMP can support the envisioned LMP processes.", "Based on our observations at the third deployment sites, the Army\u2019s tests  were not effective in evaluating whether the quality of the data used in  LMP could support the LMP processes. Specifically, officials at several of  the sites we visited stated that they had observed shortcomings in the  Process and Data Integration Test. For example, officials at the Army  Sustainment Command told us that at the time the Process and Data  Integration Test activity was conducted, their data had yet to be loaded  into LMP. Accordingly, these officials stated that the Process and Data  Integration Test activity used data from the second deployment of LMP.  Officials at sites from the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle  Management Command also identified other problems with the Process  and Data Integration Test activity, such as test scripts that were incorrect  or not reflective of their business processes because the software  necessary to support their operations was still being developed. Officials  at a Tank-automotive and Armaments Command site expressed similar  sentiments, noting that the test scripts used during the Process and Data  Integration Test activity did not reflect some of their business processes,  such as building items in support of foreign military sales. Similarly,  officials at several other sites told us that the test scripts used were out of  sequence, so the test scripts had to be corrected in order to reflect how  the location conducted its business.", "We also observed challenges related to the Army\u2019s Business Operations  Test activity. Specifically, officials at several sites told us in July and  August 2010 that some of the test scripts they executed during the  Business Operations Test activity were not reflective of their business  processes. For example, during our site visits in August, officials at one  site told us that although manufacturing represented more than 90 percent  of their workload, they spent the first 5 weeks of the Business Operations  Test activity evaluating whether they could perform repair operations.  Additionally, the officials stated that during the course of this testing,  some of the data necessary to conduct the test were missing and other  data did not load correctly into LMP and had to be generated for the test.  For example, officials told us that in order to test whether they were able  to conduct materiel requirements planning, which is the process used to  determine the number of parts needed to support a repair, the test  managers had to create the data that listed the component parts for the  item so that the test scripts could be executed. At another site, officials  told us that the data that were necessary to assign a production order to  their location were not in LMP, and that in order to conduct the tests, the  test managers directed them to use the data from a different command.", "Site officials also told us that they were limited in the number of  commodities that they could test. For example, officials at one site told us  that they manage more than a thousand different items. However, because  of time constraints, they were only able to test one item. Furthermore, the  Business Operations Test activity did not exercise the full range of data.  For example, officials at one site told us that an item they tested contained  multiple levels of data; however, the test script directed them to evaluate  only the first and second levels of data. Accordingly, the Business  Operations Test activity did not assess whether the data could support the  actual functions that the site would need to perform once LMP was  deployed.", "On August 13, 2010, we shared our observations with LMP program  management officials, and on August 18, 2010, LMP program management  officials told us that the Business Operations Test activity was intended to  test the software using the data from the sites and that this test would  identify and document data and training issues.

LMP program management officials stated  that these data accuracy audits were completed on September 30, 2010.  Additionally, LMP program management officials stated that these audits  were not designed to be an automated data test, but rather an inspection  by subject matter experts to ensure that the data were accurate.", "Although an important step, based on our observations at the third  deployment sites, the Army\u2019s data audits do not provide reasonable  assurance that the data are of sufficient quality to support the LMP  processes.

Consequently, when the sites conducted simulations, they  identified data errors that had not been identified by the audits. Officials at  one of the sites we visited told us that they had conducted an extensive  process to build and validate their data, including having subject matter  experts review individual data elements and compare the data elements  against the technical data for that item. However, the officials stated that  they had discovered through simulations that some of the data that had  transferred into LMP from the legacy systems\u2014and had undergone  audits\u2014still contained errors. The officials stated that these errors, which  were related to an incorrect unit of measure, would have prevented them  from using LMP as intended. Officials at another site we visited in June  2010 told us that during a simulation they conducted in between the  planned testing activities, they discovered that an item that takes 5 days to  repair was projected to take 5 years to repair.

While these simulations and the innovative  actions taken at both depots\u2014such as developing mitigation strategies to  correct data errors\u2014reduce the risk that data problems will adversely  affect the depots after LMP is deployed, these simulations also revealed  weaknesses in the Army-wide testing activities. For example, depot  officials told us that the simulations revealed problems with the data  audits being conducted by the Army Logistics Support Activity.  Specifically, depot officials told us that the data reviewed by the Army  Logistics Support Activity were generally considered to be accurate in  over 90 percent of the cases. However, when conducting simulations,  depot officials stated that they found data errors that would have  prevented the LMP processes from being exercised.

In contrast, according to the LMP program management  office, other locations would not be able to begin simulations until  October 4, 2010. Additionally, the strategies used to conduct simulations at  both depots we visited were site specific and different from each other.  Depot officials told us that they had developed their simulation strategy  internally and without direction from the Army or the LMP program  management office, and LMP program management officials told us that  there was not a formal requirement to conduct simulations.

For example, the Army uses the Army Workload  and Performance System to determine, among other things, whether the  workforce at a depot matches the projected workload. Army officials told  us that because the Army Workload and Performance System relies on  data from LMP in order to generate the reports, inaccurate data in LMP  will result in inaccurate reports. For example, Army officials showed us a  report from the Army Workload and Performance System that compared  the projected workload at Corpus Christi Army Depot and Letterkenny  Army Depot against the planned workforce and, according to that report,  the workforce needed to accomplish the projected workload was higher  than previous levels.

During the Business Operations Test activity, LMP program management  officials told us that all but one of the test cases passed, and that this issue  is currently under review.", "The Army Sustainment Command also requires additional software  functionality to conduct a mass upload\u2014which is the automated  movement of thousands of items of inventory between the Army  Sustainment Command and the warfighter. Army officials stated that LMP  provides this capability, but only through the use of manual processes that  Army officials said are time consuming and staffing resource intensive.  The expected delivery date of this functionality was October 11, 2010;  however, Army officials stated on October 14, 2010, that testing on the  functionality was still in process. Army Sustainment Command officials  stated that without this capability, users would have to enter information  manually into LMP, which would require certain locations to hire  additional staff to accommodate the workload and mitigate the effects of  the missing capability. On August 27, 2010, the Commander of the Army  Sustainment Command endorsed the recommendation to deploy LMP on  October 13, 2010, but noted that AWRDS/LMP interface testing would not  be completed until September and that training materials for the new  software had yet to be made available for end users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Functionality for the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command Still Being Developed", "paragraphs": ["The Army is continuing to develop the software functionality that the Joint  Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command needs to  perform its mission using LMP, but Army officials said that full  functionality will not be available until after LMP has been deployed.

Officials at Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle  Management Command sites told us that LMP\u2014unlike the systems that  they currently have in place that will be replaced once LMP is deployed\u2014 did not enable them to ship, receive, inventory, and perform stock  movements for ammunition. LMP program management officials told us  that this missing functionality was identified in 2009, and that development  of this functionality began in January 2010. The Army plans to deliver the  ammunition-specific functionality and interfaces in phases through March  2011.", "Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command officials  stated that they have developed strategies to enable them to conduct  operations in the event that the new software functionality is not delivered  on time or does not provide the intended capability. For example, in the  event that this functionality is not delivered or does not operate as  expected, the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management  Command expects to hire 172 additional personnel to perform manual  data entry until the software can provide the required and agreed-upon  functionality. Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management  Command officials stated that this mitigation plan would enable them to  deliver ammunition to the warfighter. However, they also stated that this  mitigation strategy will remove efficiencies associated with automation of  these activities that are present in the legacy systems being replaced by  LMP and lead to a degradation of data integrity and inventory accuracy.", "During our visits to the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle  Management Command sites, officials provided examples of the effect of  lost visibility and accountability of ammunition on their operations.  Officials at one site told us that the intended benefit from LMP usage was  to provide a common data set and real-time visibility over ammunition.  However, in the event that the software capability is not delivered, the  officials stated that their mitigation strategy would be to track ammunition  using \u201cpencils and index cards.\u201d While this strategy would enable some  accountability over ammunition, the site would not be able to achieve the  intended benefit of real-time visibility over ammunition.", "Officials at another site told us that their mitigation strategy would enable  them to continue to ship ammunition to the warfighter. However,  manually entering data into LMP would also reduce their ability to track  ammunition. For example, officials told us that the existing systems are  capable of tracking the serial numbers assigned to missiles, as well as the  serial numbers of a missile\u2019s component parts\u2014such as the warhead and  the guidance system\u2014and that the software necessary for LMP to be able  to provide this capability was expected to be delivered on October 12,  2010. However, as of October 14, 2010, development of this capability was  only partially completed. The officials stated that without this capability,  their mitigation strategy of manually entering data into LMP would cause  delays in their ability to track the individual serial numbers and, in the  event that a missile component needed to be recalled, would make finding  missiles that have components that are being recalled difficult, especially  if those missiles had been shipped to a customer.", "On August 20, 2010, the Executive Director of the Joint Munitions and  Lethality Life Cycle Management Command signed a memorandum that  stated that the command was prepared for the deployment of LMP. The  memorandum also stated that the tasks that had yet to be completed, upon  which deployment was contingent, were development of, training on, and  testing of the ammunition functionality. The memorandum also stated that  in the event that all ammunition functionality is not in place by the go-live  date, the Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command  is prepared to exercise its documented mitigation strategy until such time  as the functionality is available in LMP, with the understanding that the  use of the mitigation strategy will increase costs and decrease inventory  accuracy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capabilities Missing at Tank- automotive and Armaments Command Arsenals", "paragraphs": ["Certain functionality that the arsenals under the Tank-automotive and  Armaments Command need to perform their missions will not be deployed  until after LMP is deployed. These arsenals currently have systems\u2014 commonly referred to as manufacturing and execution systems\u2014in place  to report manufacturing data and track the status of items being  manufactured. According to Tank-automotive and Armaments Command  officials, the arsenals will lose this capability once LMP is deployed until a  replacement system is fielded. According to LMP program management  officials, LMP was never intended to provide this capability. Instead, the  Army has another project to develop this capability and integrate it with  LMP. According to Army officials, this project is expected to provide the  needed functionality and be deployed to the LMP locations that need it in  phases. The first phase of this system improvement effort is expected to  occur in February 2011 with the final delivery to occur in July 2011. In  order to compensate for this lost capability, officials at the Tank- automotive and Armaments Command developed a mitigation strategy  that includes hiring an estimated 95 additional people in order to manually  perform the actions in LMP that were once handled by the legacy systems.

Implementation of these types of systems is a complex endeavor, and the  ability to gain these efficiencies depends on the quality of the data in the  system. As illustrated by the experiences at the locations that deployed  LMP in May 2009, data quality continues to be a challenge. The Army,  however, has not adopted a testing strategy that provides adequate insight  on whether the data loaded into LMP can support the LMP processes.  Moreover, the functionality that is required to support some of the  locations is still being developed, so the Army does not have reasonable  assurance that the system is meeting its needs before LMP is deployed.  Without software that is working and data of sufficient quality to use in the  system, the Army\u2019s ability to gain the anticipated increase in its  effectiveness and efficiency for its $1 billion investment remains unclear.  Although the Army has mitigation strategies in place that are expected to  address potential shortcomings, the Army expects that these strategies  will increase costs and decrease accuracy of inventory, which are the  opposite effects of what LMP functionality was intended to provide.  Accordingly, given the delays in implementing LMP and the long-standing  problems that have precluded the Army from realizing LMP functionality,  additional oversight and reporting is needed to better inform Congress of  the Army\u2019s progress in addressing these problems and the status and costs  of the mitigation strategies the Army is employing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the long-standing challenges associated with the Army\u2019s  implementation of LMP and the need for mitigation strategies that may  result in increased costs until LMP is fully functional, we are  recommending that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  the Army as the Army\u2019s Chief Management Officer to report to Congress  within 90 days of the beginning of the LMP third deployment on the  progress of LMP implementation at the Army depots, arsenals, and life  cycle commands, and provide periodic updates to Congress until such  time as the mitigation strategies are no longer necessary.
