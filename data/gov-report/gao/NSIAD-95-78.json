S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (SSDC). It began in 1985 in response to concerns that the supply of surplus Minuteman I boosters used to launch targets and other experiments on intercontinental ballistic missile flight trajectories in support of the Strategic Defense Initiative would be depleted by 1988. SSDC tasked Sandia National Laboratories, a Department of Energy laboratory, to develop an alternative launch vehicle using surplus Polaris boosters. Two STARS booster configurations were developed, STARS I and STARS II.", "STARS I consists of refurbished Polaris first and second stages and a commercially procured Orbus I third stage (see fig. 1). It can deploy single or multiple payloads, but the multiple payloads cannot be deployed in a manner that simulates the operation of a post-boost vehicle (PBV). To meet this specific need, Sandia developed an Operations and Deployment Experiments Simulator (ODES), which functions as a PBV. (See app. I,  fig. I.1.) When ODES is added to STARS I, the configuration is designated  STARS II.", "The development phase of the STARS program was completed in fiscal year 1994, and BMDO provided about $192.1 million for this effort. The operational phase began in fiscal year 1995.", "The first STARS I flight, a hardware check-out flight, was launched in February 1993, and the second flight, a STARS I reentry vehicle experiment, was launched in August 1993. The third flight, a STARS II development mission, was launched in July 1994. All three were considered successful by BMDO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plans for Continuing STARS Program", "paragraphs": ["In March 1993, the Secretary of Defense initiated a comprehensive \u201cBottom-Up Review\u201d of the nation\u2019s defense strategy. He believed that a departmentwide review needed to be conducted \u201cfrom the bottom up\u201d because of the dramatic changes that had occurred in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This review provided the direction for shifting America\u2019s focus away from a strategy designed to defend against a global Soviet threat to a strategy oriented toward the dangers of aggression by regional powers, a theater missile threat. Based on the nature of the present and projected threat from ballistic and cruise missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction, the Secretary of Defense decided to proceed with a more robust TMD program to emphasize protection of forward-deployed U.S. forces in the near term. Additionally, he decided to limit the NMD effort to a technology program, which drastically reduced the number of STARS launches to support NMD.", "In May 1994, based on declining launches for STARS and budget reductions resulting from the \u201cBottom-Up Review,\u201d BMDO requested SSDC to develop a long-range plan for the STARS program. The SSDC STARS project office developed a draft long-range plan that included management options for (1) continuing the STARS program; (2) placing it in a dormant status, retaining the capability to reactivate it; and (3) terminating it. BMDO is currently evaluating STARS as a potential long-range system for launching targets for development tests of future TMD systems. The final decision, which may not be made for 6 to 9 months, will be based on factors such as the cost to maintain STARS and ABM Treaty issues associated with testing TMD systems.", "STARS project office officials cite several reasons related to treaty implications for not terminating the program. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START) limits other strategic ballistic missiles\u2019 use of telemetry encryption, but STARS is exempt from this restriction. In addition, the START II Treaty after its ratification and formal entry into force would require the total elimination of land-based multiple warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles by January 2003. This means that the launching of land-based multiple warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles, even as research and development target boosters, would cease. Because STARS is exempt from the START II Treaty, it would be the only land-based multiple warhead booster that the United States can use as a target or for research and development. The STARS II PBV carries multiple warheads and has the maneuvering capability to independently target each warhead on a final trajectory toward a target.", "STARS project office officials also cite other reasons for not terminating the program. STARS can deliver payloads at various reentry speeds and trajectories to the vicinity of Kwajalein Missile Range located about 4,000 kilometers from the Kauai Test Facility. STARS is also the only U.S. target missile system that operates in the 1,500 to 3,500 kilometer range. Additionally, the relatively large diameter of the STARS launch vehicle, the shape of the nose shroud, and the flat payload plate make STARS suitable as a carrier vehicle for a variety of experiments and scientific payloads. Also, STARS has demonstrated a real-time reporting capability to accurately predict target positions for experiments throughout its trajectory. These are important features for evaluating the capabilities of both theater and strategic missile defense sensors and weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Requirements for STARS Launches", "paragraphs": ["In July 1993, BMDO had plans to launch 12 more STARS boosters from Kauai that would deliver experiments into near space and targets to Kwajalein through fiscal year 2003. All of these launches were to support NMD objectives. Two were conducted, but as a result of the \u201cBottom-Up Review,\u201d all but one of the remaining 10 NMD launches were canceled.", "BMDO now has only one firm launch scheduled. Additionally, BMDO has 11 potential launches identified through fiscal year 2000. Ten would support TMD and 1 would support NMD. Table 1 provides the schedule by fiscal year for the STARS launches.", "The firm launch scheduled for 1995 involves launching a STARS II that will deploy numerous objects for the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite to observe. The MSX satellite is scheduled to be launched into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II booster during the second quarter of fiscal year 1995 to conduct a variety of experiments, one of which will involve observing different types of target objects deployed from the STARS PBV. Although this experiment will support work being conducted in a number of areas, the data will primarily support the Space and Missile Tracking System (formerly called Brilliant Eyes) demonstration and validation program.", "The targets for the MSX satellite to observe are scheduled to be launched on a STARS II in the third quarter of fiscal year 1995. The MSX\u2019s sensors are to view the numerous objects deployed from the PBV during sunrise conditions, and the objects are to be representative of various targets and deployment techniques. Other mobile and ground-based sensors will provide trajectory identification, definition, stereo viewing, and dynamic motion verification of the test objects.", "Until the ABM Treaty is clarified, the use of STARS to support TMD testing, including the 10 potential TMD missions shown in table 1, is in question. The 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits mobile, land-based systems that can counter strategic missiles. However, it does not define the characteristics of either a strategic or theater missile. Some theater missiles now approach the capabilities of the older, shorter range strategic missiles in terms of maximum range. Congress has continuously urged the administration to pursue discussions on amending the ABM Treaty to clarify the distinctions between theater and strategic missiles. The United States and Russia and some of the states of the former Soviet Union are currently involved in discussions seeking a demarcation that would clarify the treaty in such a way that would allow TMD systems such as the Theater High Altitude Area Defense and other advanced concepts to be developed in compliance with the ABM Treaty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Future Cost of Operating STARS", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, the STARS operational budget will be about $22.7 million for fiscal year 1995. Of this amount, $15.1 million is the cost to maintain the capability to conduct launches, and the remaining cost of about $7.6 million primarily represents costs to be incurred for the scheduled launch in fiscal year 1995. For future years, it is estimated that the annual STARS operating budget would also be about $15 million (excluding inflation) to maintain the capability to launch. The $15 million does not include the additional costs that would be charged to STARS customers for launches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Annual Infrastructure Cost", "paragraphs": ["The $8.36 million for program infrastructure includes a full-time STARS staff of about 40 to 45 Sandia engineers and technicians, Sandia part-time staff for the STARS program, Sandia overhead costs, and a Department of Energy surcharge of 4.3 percent. According to a Sandia official, in years when there are no launches, the engineers and technicians would be used to provide technical support for the STARS booster system, plan for future STARS launches, upgrade system documentation, correct anomalies noted on past launches, and perform other tasks assigned by the STARS office. The Sandia official also told us that under Sandia\u2019s personnel practices if the 40 to 45 full-time Sandia personnel were to be assigned to other programs because of a termination or extended suspension of the STARS operation, it is highly unlikely that they would later be returned to the STARS program.", "According to a STARS project office official, plans are to spend about $3.47 million in fiscal year 1995 to maintain the industrial base for refurbishing first- and second-stage Polaris motors. A Sandia official provided the following general comments about maintaining the industrial base. Initially, plans are to (1) modify the existing contract with Aerojet General Corporation to start assembling refurbished first-stage motors, (2) consolidate facilities to save money, and (3) send first-stage motors to the Navy\u2019s China Lake facility for screening. Also, Sandia plans to provide Hercules, Inc., Aerospace Division, with funds to recertify the second-stage flight motor for the fiscal year 1995 flight and assemble a second-stage component refurbished motor as a flight spare. Plans are to award new 2-year contracts in April 1995 to Aerojet and Hercules for work in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Aerojet is to refurbish up to three first-stage motors. Hercules is to continue assembling second-stage component refurbished motors. These contracts will contain provisions for paying fixed termination costs to these contractors if the decision is made to cancel the contracts in fiscal year 1996. Plans are to also award new contracts in April 1995 to Lockheed Missile and Space Company, Inc., and the Navy. Lockheed is to provide technical assistance, and the Navy\u2019s facilities at China Lake and Corona, California, are to screen and static fire STARS motors and calibrate and recertify motor nozzles and assembly gauges.", "The Kauai Test Facility range support cost of $2.5 million is primarily for a facility maintenance contractor; Sandia personnel supporting STARS; and maintaining range technical capabilities such as electronic communications equipment, computers, and recording equipment used to gather flight data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Fiscal Year 1995 Costs", "paragraphs": ["The additional cost associated with the launch to support the MSX mission, $7.38 million, is for work to be performed by Sandia, support of the Pacific Missile Range Facility, and logistics\u2019 maintenance and transportation support.

This effort involves (1) mission specific software modifications and validation; (2) assembly and construction of specialized parts and equipment, to include components for the PBV; and (3) final system checkout and testing. The Pacific Missile Range Facility is to provide uprange support of the STARS booster launch activities. It is also to provide miscellaneous range tracking, telemetry, range safety, and other support requirements.

These cost estimates have decreased because the STARS program has already paid for equipment such as electronic components, mechanical equipment, stage 1 and 2 refurbished motors, and Orbus motors. Another reason future STARS users will pay less is because the MSX and other programs have paid for long lead hardware to be used on STARS launches that were canceled. Even though these launches were canceled, the STARS office had already acquired the assets.", "Beginning in fiscal year 1996, the costs to future STARS I and II customers will vary. Specifically, for the next three STARS launches, the cost to STARS I customers is estimated to be about $2.8 million, and the cost to STARS II customers is estimated to range from $6.7 million to $9.1 million. Beyond the next three launches, the cost to STARS I customers is estimated to be about $4.1 million, and the cost to STARS II customers is estimated to range from $8.1 million to $9.1 million.
