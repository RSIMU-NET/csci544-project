The safety and economic security of the United States depend in substantial part upon the secure use of the world's waterways and ports. In an effort to further the progress made through the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act (SAFE Port Act) was passed and became effective in October 2006. This testimony, which is based on past GAO work, synthesizes the results of this work as it pertains to the following: (1) overall port security, (2) facility security at U.S. ports, (3) the international supply chain and cargo container security, and (4) customs revenue collection efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["With the Coast Guard generally implementing earlier port security requirements, the SAFE Port Act called for changes to several ongoing programs. For example, it called for interagency operational centers at high-risk ports within 3 years. Three centers currently operate, but agency coordination will pose a challenge. Also, the act established a port security exercise program, but more exercises could challenge stakeholders' ability to maintain coordination and quickly report results. Additionally, an expansion of foreign port security assessments may be challenged by greater workloads and the need for additional staff. Many port facility security requirements are being implemented, but not always on schedule. While the Coast Guard has approved, and verified through inspection, facility security plans, the SAFE Port Act requires inspections more often and some without notice. The Coast Guard will be challenged by the number of trained inspectors it needs. Worker credentialing programs were also modified by the act. One such program has seen substantial delays in the past, but is receiving more support. Efforts to avoid duplication in these programs will be challenged by the need for extensive coordination within and among federal departments. The SAFE Port Act codified existing major container security programs and also added guidance for these programs. It also required programs to test new technologies or combine existing technologies for scanning containers. While more container security activity is occurring overseas, challenges remain in the continued implementation of these efforts. These challenges include the inability to directly test the security measures used by different companies in their supply chains, particularly overseas. Since its formation, the Department of Homeland Security has faced challenges in maintaining its customs revenue functions. For example, the Department failed to maintain the legislatively mandated staffing levels, lacks a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it has a sufficient number of skilled staff to effectively perform customs revenue functions, and does not publicly report on its performance of customs revenue functions, which would help ensure accountability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss port security and revenue  functions related to provisions of the Security and Accountability for  Every Port Act (SAFE Port Act). The nation\u2019s ports are the doorway for  more than 80 percent of our foreign trade. Worldwide, some 30 large ports,  spread across North America, Asia, and Europe constitute the world\u2019s  primary, interdependent trading web. Much of this trade\u2014particularly  high-value cargo\u2014enters and leaves in cargo containers. In 2004, for  example, $423 billion worth of goods traveling to the United States arrived  in 15.8 billion container loads. Similarly, ports are vital for our energy  supplies. In 2005, 55 percent of the nation\u2019s crude oil supply and all of the  liquefied natural gas supply was imported on seagoing tankers. The trade  that passes through ports also generates substantial revenue for the U.S.  government.", "In our post September 11, 2001, environment, however, the potential  security weaknesses presented by these economic doorways have become  readily apparent. Ports present potential terrorist targets: they are  sprawling, easily accessible by water and land, often close to urban areas,  and contain facilities that represent opportunities for inflicting significant  damage as well as causing economic mayhem. Further, they are conduits  for weapons prepared elsewhere and concealed in cargo designed to move  quickly to many locations beyond the ports themselves. At this time, the  U.S. government does not require that all cargo destined for the United  States be checked until it arrives.", "Since the 9/11 attacks, a new port security framework has taken form.  Much of this framework was set in place by the Maritime Transportation  Security Act (MTSA). Enacted in November 2002, MTSA was designed, in  part, to help protect the nation\u2019s ports and waterways from terrorist  attacks through a wide range of security improvements. Among the major  requirements included in MTSA were (1) conducting vulnerability  assessments for port facilities and vessels; (2) developing security plans to  mitigate identified risks for the national maritime system, ports, port  facilities, and vessels; (3) developing the Transportation Worker  Identification Credential (TWIC), a biometric identification card to help  restrict access to secure areas to only authorized personnel; and   (4) establishment of a process to assess foreign ports, from which vessels  depart on voyages to the United States. Much of this framework is  administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), itself a  creation of the new security environment brought on by the September 11,  2001, attacks. This framework also attempts to balance security priorities  with the need to facilitate legitimate trade.", "One of the latest additions to this port security framework is the SAFE  Port Act, which was passed and took effect in October of 2006. The act  made a number of adjustments to programs within this framework,  creating additional programs or lines of effort and altering others. The  SAFE Port Act created and codified new programs and initiatives, and  amended some of the original provisions of MTSA. The SAFE Port Act  included provisions that (1) codified the Container Security Initiative (CSI)  and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT)\u2014two  programs administered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to help  reduce any threats stemming from cargo containers; (2) established port  security interagency operational centers at all high risk ports; (3) set an  implementation schedule and fee restrictions for TWIC; (4) required that  all containers entering high volume U.S. ports be scanned for radiation  sources by December 31, 2007; and (5) required additional data be made  available to CBP for targeting cargo containers for inspection. The SAFE  Port Act also mandated GAO to report to Congress on some topics related  to maritime security, including (1) the security of ports overseas in the  Caribbean Basin; (2) the background check program for transportation  workers, including those seeking access to ports and other sensitive areas;  and (3) the extent to which DHS continues to collect revenues at ports  given the new emphasis on security. This statement summarizes our work  on these three mandates, though all of them have been, or will be,  addressed in separate reports.", "Over the past several years, we have examined and reported on many of  the programs in this new port security framework. This statement is  designed both to provide an overview of what we have learned about these  programs and to describe, to the extent we have information available,  what DHS is doing as a result of the SAFE Port Act requirements and the  challenges it faces in doing so. This statement discusses more than a  dozen programs and lines of effort, as shown in table 1.", "This statement is organized into four main areas, as follows:    Programs related to overall port security, such as those for developing  security plans, coordinating among stakeholders, and conducting  exercises to test security procedures.", "Programs related more specifically to security at individual facilities,  such as examining security measures and ensuring that only properly  cleared individuals have access to port areas.", "Programs related more specifically to the international supply chain  and to cargo container security, such as screening containers at ports  both here and abroad.", "The extent to which DHS\u2014and more specifically, CBP\u2014has  maintained the customs revenue function formerly managed by the  Department of the Treasury at ports.", "This statement is based primarily on a body of work we have completed in  response to congressional requests and mandates for analysis of maritime,  port, and cargo security efforts of the federal government.

As such, the  timeliness of the data that was the basis for our prior reporting varies  depending on when our products were issued. In several cases, such as  CBP\u2019s maintenance of effort on the customs revenue function, our findings  are based on recent work specifically conducted in response to SAFE Port  Act requirements.

Additionally, management of these programs will need to address  additional requirements directed by the SAFE Port Act. Area committees  and interagency operational centers have improved information sharing,  but the types and ways information is shared varies.

Area committees serve as a forum for  port stakeholders, facilitating the dissemination of information through  regularly scheduled meetings, issuance of electronic bulletins, and sharing  key documents. MTSA provided the Coast Guard with the authority to  create area committees\u2014composed of federal, state, local, and industry  members\u2014that help to develop the area plan for the port. As of June 2006,  the Coast Guard had organized 46 area committees. Each has flexibility to  assemble and operate in a way that reflects the needs of its port area,  resulting in variations in the number of participants, the types of state and  local organizations involved, and the way in which information is shared.  Some examples of information shared includes assessments of  vulnerabilities at specific port locations, information about potential  threats or suspicious activities, and Coast Guard strategies intended for  use in protecting key infrastructure.", "Interagency operational centers are currently located at three ports\u2014 Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; and San Diego, California.  These centers are designed to unite maritime intelligence and operational  efforts of various federal and nonfederal participants. Unlike area  committees, they are operational in nature with a unified or joint  command structure designed to receive information from multiple sources  and act on it. However, the centers fulfill varying missions and operations,  and thus share different types of information. For example, the Charleston  center is led by the Department of Justice and focused solely on port  security, while the San Diego center is led by the Coast Guard with  missions expanding beyond port security to also include search and  rescue activities, drug interdiction, and environmental response.", "In past work, we have reported that these two types of forums have both  been helpful in fostering cooperation and information-sharing. We  reported that area committees provided a structure to improve the  timeliness, completeness, and usefulness of information sharing between  federal and nonfederal stakeholders. These committees were an  improvement over previous information-sharing efforts because they  established a formal structure and new procedures for sharing  information. In contrast to area committees, interagency operational  centers can provide continuous information about maritime activities and  involve various agencies directly in operational decisions using this  information. While we have reported that interagency operational centers  have improved information sharing, our past work has also shown the  types of information and the way information is shared varies at the  operational centers depending on their purpose and mission, leadership  and organization, membership, technology, and resources.", "The SAFE Port Act called for an expansion of interagency operational  centers, directing the Secretary of DHS to establish such centers at all  high-risk priority ports no later than 3 years after the Act\u2019s enactment. In  addition to authorizing the appropriation of funds and requiring DHS to  report on potential cost-sharing at the centers, it directs the new  interagency operational centers to utilize the same compositional and  operational characteristics of existing centers, such as the pilot project  operational centers for port security. Currently two more centers are  expected to be functional within weeks. These will be located in  Jacksonville, Florida, and Seattle, Washington. Like the centers in San  Diego and Norfolk, they will both be operated jointly by the Coast Guard  and the Navy. In addition, the Coast Guard has developed its own  operational centers, called sector command centers, as part of an effort to  reorganize and improve its awareness of the maritime domain. These are  located at 35 ports to monitor information and to support planned future  operations, and some of these sector command centers may include other  agencies on either a regular or an ad hoc basis.", "Information sharing efforts, whether through area committees or  interagency operational centers, face challenges in several areas. These  challenges include:    Obtaining security clearances for port security stakeholders.", "The lack of federal security clearances among port security  stakeholders has been routinely cited as a barrier to information  sharing, one of the primary goals of both the area committees and  interagency operational centers. In previous reviews, we found that the  inability to share classified information may limit the ability to deter,  prevent, and respond to a potential terrorist attack. The Coast Guard  has seen improvements based on its efforts to sponsor security  clearances for members of area committees. In addition, the SAFE Port  Act includes a specific provision requiring DHS to sponsor and  expedite security clearances for participants in interagency operational  centers. However, the extent to which these efforts will ultimately  improve information sharing remains unclear.", "Creating effective working relationships. Another challenge  associated with establishing interagency operational centers at all high  risk ports is the difficulty associated with encouraging various federal,  state and local agencies to collaborate and share information  effectively under new structures and procedures. While some of the  existing operational centers found success with existing interagency  relationships, other high-risk ports might face challenges establishing  new working relationships among port stakeholders and implementing  their own interagency operational centers.", "Addressing potential overlapping responsibilities. Overlapping  leadership roles between the Coast Guard and FBI have been seen  during port security exercises. While the SAFE Port Act designates the  Coast Guard Captain of the Port as the incident commander in the  event of a transportation security incident, the FBI also has leadership  responsibilities in terrorist incidents. It is important that actions  across the various agencies are clear and coordinated.", "Determining relationships among various centers. The  relationship between the interagency operations centers and the  recently developed Coast Guard sector command centers is still to be  determined. We have not studied this issue in depth, but it may bear  watching."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Area Plans Are in Place but Do Not Address Natural Disasters", "paragraphs": ["Area plans are another MTSA requirement, and the specific provisions of  the plans have been specified by regulation and Coast Guard directive.  Implementing regulations for MTSA specified that area plans include,  among other things, operational and physical security measures in place at  the port under different security levels, details of the security incident  command and response structure, procedures for responding to security  threats including provisions for maintaining operations in the port, and  procedures to facilitate the recovery of the marine transportation system  after a security incident. A Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection  Circular (NVIC) provided a common template for area plans and specified  the responsibilities of port stakeholders under the plans. Currently, 46  area plans are in place at ports around the country. The Coast Guard  approved the plans by June 1, 2004, and MTSA requires that they be  updated at least every 5 years.", "The SAFE Port Act added a requirement to area plans. To ensure that the  waterways are cleared and the flow of commerce through United States  ports is reestablished as efficiently and quickly as possible after a security  incident, the act specified that area plans include a salvage response  provision identifying salvage equipment capable of restoring operational  trade capacity. None of our past or current work specifically addresses the  extent to which area plans now include this provision. We have, however,  conducted other work that has a broader bearing on the scope of area  plans, and thus potentially on this provision as well.", "In a recent report examining how ports are dealing with planning for  natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, we noted that area  plans cover security issues but do not include other issues that could have  a major impact on a port\u2019s ability to support maritime commerce. As  currently written, area plans are concerned with deterring and, to a lesser  extent, responding to security incidents. We found, however, that unified  consideration of all risks faced by a port, both natural and man-made, may  be beneficial. Because of the similarities between the consequences of  terrorist attacks and natural or accidental disasters, much of the planning  for protection, response, and recovery capabilities is similar across all  emergency events. Combining terrorism and other threats can enhance the  efficiency of port planning efforts because of the similarity in recovery  plans for both natural and security-related disasters. This approach also  allows port stakeholders to estimate the relative value of different  mitigation alternatives. The exclusion of certain risks from consideration,  or the separate consideration of a particular type of risk, gives rise to the  possibility that risks will not be accurately assessed or compared, and that  too many or too few resources will be allocated toward mitigation of a  particular risk. As ports continue to revise and improve their planning  efforts, available evidence indicates that, if ports take a system-wide  approach, thinking strategically about using resources to mitigate and  recover from all forms of disaster, they will be able to achieve the most  effective results. Area plans provide a useful foundation for establishing an  all-hazards approach. While the SAFE Port Act does not call for expanding  area plans in this manner, it does contain a requirement that natural  disasters and other emergencies be included in the scenarios to be tested  in the Port Security Exercise Program. Based on our work, we found there  are challenges in using area committees and plans as the basis for broader  all-hazards planning. These challenges include:    Determining the extent that security plans can serve all-hazards  purposes. We recommended that DHS encourage port stakeholders to  use area committees and area plans to discuss all-hazards planning.  While MTSA and its implementing regulations are focused on  transportation security incidents rather than natural disasters and  other types of emergencies, we believe that area plans provide a useful  foundation for establishing an all-hazards approach. Some federal  officials indicated that separate existing plans can handle the range of  threats that ports face. However, there would need to be an analysis of  gaps between different types of planning. Finally, DHS noted that most  emergency planning should properly remain with state and local  emergency management planners and were cautious about the federal  government taking on a larger role."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maritime Security Exercises Require a Broader Scope and Participation", "paragraphs": ["MTSA regulations require the Coast Guard Captain of the Port and the  area committee to conduct or participate in exercises to test the  effectiveness of area plans once each calendar year, with no more than 18  months between exercises. These exercises are designed to continuously  improve preparedness by validating information and procedures in the  area plan, identifying weaknesses and strengths, and practicing command  and control within an incident command/unified command framework.  Such exercises have been conducted for the past several years. For  example, in fiscal year 2004, the Coast Guard conducted 85 port-based  terrorism exercises that addressed a variety of possible scenarios. In  August 2005, the Coast Guard and the TSA initiated the Port Security  Training Exercise Program (PortSTEP)\u2013\u2013an exercise program designed to  involve the entire port community, including public governmental agencies  and private industry, and intended to improve connectivity of various  surface transportation modes and enhance area plans. Between August  2005 and October 2007, the Coast Guard expects to conduct PortSTEP  exercises for 40 area committees and other port stakeholders.", "The SAFE Port Act included several new requirements related to security  exercises. It required the establishment of a Port Security Exercise  Program to test and evaluate the capabilities of governments and port  stakeholders to prevent, prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and  recover from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other emergencies at  facilities regulated by the MTSA. It also required the establishment of a  port security exercise improvement plan process that would identify,  disseminate, and monitor the implementation of lessons learned and best  practices from port security exercises. Finally, it added natural disasters,  such as hurricanes or earthquakes, to be included in the list of scenarios to  be tested.", "Our work has not specifically examined compliance with these new  requirements, but our review of these requirements and our work in  examining past exercises suggests that implementing a successful exercise  program faces several challenges. These challenges include:    Setting the scope of the program. It will be necessary to determine  how exercise requirements in the SAFE Port Act differ from area  committee exercises that are currently performed. Exercises currently  conducted by area committees already test the ability of a variety of  port stakeholders to work together in the event of a port incident. The  potential exists for these efforts to be duplicated under the SAFE Port  Act exercise requirements. On the other hand, the SAFE Port Act  exercise requirements clearly move beyond previous requirements by  including natural disasters and other emergencies in the list of  scenarios to be exercised. Ensuring that these scenarios are exercised  as part of a comprehensive security program may require a wider scope  when exercise planning commences.", "Completing after-action reports in a timely and thorough  manner. In past work, we found that after-action reports were  generally submitted late and that many failed to assess each objective  that was being exercised. Inability to provide timely and complete  reports on exercises represents a lost opportunity to share potentially  valuable information across the organization as well as plan and  prepare for future exercises.", "Ensuring that all relevant agencies participate.

To help secure  the overseas supply chain, MTSA required the Coast Guard to develop a  program to assess security measures in foreign ports and, among other  things, recommend steps necessary to improve security measures in their  ports. The Coast Guard established this program, called the International  Port Security Program, in April 2004. Under this program, the Coast Guard  and host nations review the implementation of security measures in the  host nations\u2019 ports against established security standards, such as the  International Maritime Organization\u2019s International Ship and Port Facility  Security (ISPS) Code. Coast Guard teams have been established to  conduct country visits, discuss security measures implemented, and  collect and share best practices to help ensure a comprehensive and  consistent approach to maritime security in ports worldwide. The  conditions of these visits, such as timing and locations, are negotiated  between the Coast Guard and the host nation. Coast Guard officials also  make annual visits to the countries to obtain additional observations on  the implementation of security measures and ensure deficiencies found  during the country visits are addressed.

Although MTSA did not set a timeframe for completion of these visits, the  Coast Guard initially set a goal to visit all countries that conduct maritime  trade with the United States by December 2008. In September 2006, the  conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2007 DHS Appropriations  Act directed the Coast Guard to \u201cdouble the amount\u201d at which it was  conducting its visits. Subsequently, in October 2006, the SAFE Port Act  required the Coast Guard to reassess security measures at the foreign  ports every 3 years.

With the expedited pace, the Coast Guard now expects to assess all  countries by March 2008, after which reassessments will begin.", "We are currently conducting a review of the Coast Guard\u2019s international  enforcement programs, such as the International Port Security Program.

Performance-based plans provide  flexibility to owners and operators, but they also place a premium on  the skills and experience of inspectors to identify deficiencies and  recommend corrective action. This complexity makes it a challenge for  the Coast Guard to ensure that its inspectors are trained appropriately  and have sufficient guidance to make difficult judgments about  whether owners and operators have taken adequate steps to address  vulnerabilities.

For example, the USA PATRIOT Act in October 2001 prohibited  states from issuing hazardous material endorsements for a commercial  driver\u2019s license without an applicant background check. Background  checks are also part of the TWIC program discussed above. Concerns have  been raised, however, that transportation workers may face a variety of  background checks, each with different standards. A truck driver, for  example, is subject to background checks for all of the following:  unescorted access to a secure area at a port, unescorted access to a secure  area at an airport, expedited border crossings, hauling hazardous  materials, or hauling arms or ammunition for the Department of Defense  or cargo for the U.S. Postal Service. In July 2004, the 9/11 Commission  reported that having too many different biometric standards, travel  facilitation systems, credentialing systems, and screening requirements  hampers the development of information crucial for stopping terrorists  from entering the country, is expensive, and is inefficient. The  Commission recommended that a coordinating body raise standards,  facilitate information-sharing, and survey systems for potential problems.
