However, the discussion of outcome-related performance measures to assess progress in achieving these goals and objectives is limited. Moreover, the strategy falls short in at least three areas. First, it only partially identifies the agencies responsible for implementing key aspects of the strategy. Second, it does not fully address how the U.S. will integrate its goals with those of the Iraqis and the international community, and it does not detail Iraq's anticipated contribution to its future needs. Third, it only partially identifies the current and future costs of U.S. involvement in Iraq, including maintaining U.S. military operations, building Iraqi government capacity, and rebuilding critical infrastructure. Furthermore, the June 2006 Camp David fact sheet provides additional detail but does not address these key shortfalls. Security, political, and economic factors will hamper U.S. efforts to stabilize Iraq and achieve key U.S. goals. First, the U.S. and Iraq are trying to stabilize Iraq by training and equipping additional Iraqi security forces and securing Baghdad and other strategic cities. However, increases in attacks against the coalition and its Iraqi partners and the growing influence of militias will adversely affect U.S. and Iraqi efforts. Second, the U.S. and Iraq are trying to improve Iraq's capacity to govern by reconciling sectarian groups and building the capacity of national and provincial governments to provide security and services. However, sectarian conflicts, the lack of capacity in the ministries, and corruption serve to hinder these efforts. Third, the U.S. and Iraqi governments are trying to revitalize Iraq's economy and restore the oil, electricity, and other key sectors. However, these efforts have been impeded by security, corruption, fiscal, and other challenges. The formation of a permanent Iraqi government gives the U.S. an opportunity to re-examine its strategy for Iraq and align its efforts with Iraq and the international community. As a first step, NSC should complete the strategy by defining and disseminating performance metrics, articulating clear roles and responsibilities, specifying future contributions, and identifying current costs and future resources. In addition, the United States, Iraq, and the international community should (1) enhance support capabilities of the Iraqi security forces, (2) improve the capabilities of the national and provincial governments, and (3) develop a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to appear today to discuss the U.S. government\u2019s strategy for  victory in Iraq.

In the oil sector, DOD has completed or is working on a  number of projects to boost Iraq\u2019s oil production, refining, and export  capacity.", "However, key reconstruction goals have yet to be achieved (see table 1).  As of June 25, 2006, oil and electricity sectors were below the planned U.S.  end-state. In June 2006, State reported that oil production was about 2.29  million barrels per day (mbpd), which was below the desired goal of 3  mbpd. In June 2006, electricity generation capacity was about 4,832  megawatts\u2014above its prewar level but below the post-war peak of about  5,400 megawatts and the planned U.S goal of 6,000 megawatts. In addition,  it is unclear whether the current capacity can be sustained.", "A combination of insurgent attacks on crude oil and product pipelines,  dilapidated infrastructure, and poor operations and maintenance have  hindered domestic refining and have required Iraq to import significant  portions of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel.", "Both the oil and electricity sectors face a number of challenges to meeting  Iraq\u2019s needs.", "Improving infrastructure security. The insurgency has destroyed key  infrastructure, severely undermining progress. U.S. officials reported that  major oil pipelines continue to be sabotaged, shutting down oil exports  and resulting in lost revenues. Major electrical transmission lines have  been repeatedly sabotaged, cutting power to other parts of the country.  Current U.S. assistance is focused on strengthening the Strategic  Infrastructure Battalions, which are Ministry of Defense forces that  protect oil fields and pipelines.", "Security conditions in Iraq have, in part, led to project delays and  increased costs for security services. Although it is difficult to quantify the  costs and delays resulting from poor security conditions, both agency and  contractor officials acknowledged that security costs have diverted a  considerable amount of reconstruction resources and have led to  canceling or reducing the scope of some reconstruction projects.", "Deterring corruption. U.S. and international officials reported increased  concerns about pervasive corruption in Iraq. Transparency International  ranked Iraq 137th of 159 countries in 2005 in terms of corruption. To  combat corruption, U.S. and international officials reported that the Iraqi  government established the Commission on Public Integrity, which is  charged with the criminal investigation of corruption cases, and the  independent Inspectors General within individual Iraqi ministries, and  revived the existing Board of Supreme Audit (BSA). The U.S. government,  including GAO, is working directly with these institutions.", "The oil and electricity sectors remain particularly vulnerable to  corruption. Corruption in the oil sector presents a special problem,  particularly because of the sector\u2019s importance to the economy. According  to State officials and reporting, about 10 percent of refined fuels are  diverted to the black market, and about 30 percent of imported fuels are  smuggled out of Iraq and sold for a profit. According to U.S. Embassy  documents, the insurgency has been partly funded by corrupt activities  within Iraq and from skimming profits from black marketers. Moreover,  according to one analysis, corruption diverted much of Iraq\u2019s oil revenue  from reconstruction to government officials and their accomplices in  organized crime.", "Corruption in the electricity sector is also a problem. According to State\u2019s  Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) officials, the Ministry of  Electricity contracts with tribal chiefs, paying them about $60 to $100 per  kilometer, to protect transmission lines running through their areas.  However, IRMO officials reported that the protection system is flawed and  encourages corruption. According to U.S. and UN Development Program  officials, some of these tribes are also selling materials from downed lines  and extracting tariffs for access to repair the lines.", "The lack of metering facilitates opportunities for corruption in the oil and  electricity sectors. Despite a 2004 audit recommendation made by the  International Advisory and Monitoring Board for the Development Fund  for Iraq, and initial steps to install meters in accordance with standard oil  industry practices, the Iraqi government still lacks an effective system of  metering to measure production and export levels. According to U.S.  officials in the electricity section, about 30 percent of the meters in Iraq  are damaged. Most meters are old mechanical meters that need to be  replaced with electronic ones so that the system may be better monitored.", "Addressing fiscal challenges. Iraq\u2019s ability to contribute to its own  rebuilding is dependent on addressing key fiscal challenges, particularly in  the oil and electricity sectors. Current government subsidies constrain  opportunities for growth and investment and have kept prices for oil and  electricity low.", "Domestic fuel prices in Iraq are among the lowest in the world. U.S. and  international officials report that these low prices have led to a rampant  black market and fuel smuggling out of the country; inadequate  maintenance and improvements; and over-consumption. According to U.S.  and international officials, the Iraqi budget is directly affected, since state- owned refineries cover less than half the domestic demand, and the Iraqi  government has to import the rest at world market prices.", "As part of its Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), Iraq must reduce government subsidies of petroleum products. By  the end of 2006, the Iraqi government plans to complete a series of  adjustments to bring fuel prices closer to those of other Gulf countries.  According to State reporting, a new round of price increases for diesel,  kerosene, and propane began to take effect in Baghdad and other areas the  week of June 19, 2006, and is being extended countrywide. The Iraqi  government committed itself to bring fuel prices closer to regional prices  as part of its IMF reform program. Iraqis currently pay about $.44 per  gallon for regular gasoline compared with about $.90 per gallon in  neighboring countries.", "According to U.S. and international officials, the negative effects of the  electricity subsidy are similar to those for fuels. The national grid is  currently unable to satisfy the demand, and Iraqis must buy electricity  from privately-operated small diesel generators which are inefficient  sources of electricity. Moreover, according to World Bank reporting,  increasing tariffs is complicated by the desire to preserve wide access to  the grid and subsidize low-income groups.", "Iraq faces other fiscal challenges, such as generous wage and pension  benefits, increased defense spending, and high external debt. Our April  2006 testimony before this committee provides additional details on these  other challenges.", "Managing and sustaining new and rehabilitated infrastructure. The  U.S. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with Iraq\u2019s ability  to sustain the new and rehabilitated infrastructure and address  maintenance needs. A June 2006 Congressional Research Service report  noted that as more large-scale construction projects have been completed  with U.S. assistance, there has been increasing concern regarding the  financial, organizational, and technical capacity of Iraqis to maintain the  projects in the long run.", "More specifically, our prior reports and testimony note that the Iraqis\u2019  capacity to operate and maintain the power plant infrastructure and  equipment provided by the United States remains a challenge at both the  plant and ministry levels. As a result, the infrastructure and equipment  remain at risk of damage following their transfer to the Iraqis. U.S. officials  have acknowledged that more needs to be done to train plant operators  and ensure that advisory services are provided after the turnover date. In  January 2006, State reported that it has developed a strategy with the  Ministry of Electricity to focus on rehabilitation and sustainment of  electricity assets."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The November 2005 NSVI and supporting documents represent the results  of efforts to improve the strategic planning process for the challenging and  costly U.S. mission in Iraq. Although the strategy is an improvement over  earlier efforts, it is incomplete even when considered in the context of all  supporting documents, both classified and unclassified. Without additional  information on roles and responsibilities, future contributions and costs,  and outcome-based metrics, the strategy does not provide the Congress  with a clear road map for achieving victory in Iraq. The formation of the  new Iraqi government provides an opportunity for the United States  government to re-examine its strategy and more closely align its efforts  and objectives with those of the Iraqi people and other donors.", "Based on our other ongoing and completed work, additional actions could  be taken to achieve U.S. objectives in Iraq. The United States, Iraq, and the  international community should consider the following:    Focusing more attention on the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces  rather than the number of forces. Although the number of the Iraqi  security forces is increasing, these forces lack the logistical, command and  control, and intelligence capabilities to operate independently.", "Improving national and provincial governance. The Iraqis will need  technical assistance, training, and more partnering opportunities with the  United States, other countries, and international organizations to  strengthen their national and provincial governments and provide results  that matter to the Iraqi people, for example, safe streets, good jobs,  reliable electricity, clean water, education, and health care.", "Addressing the root causes of corruption. Strong and immediate measures  must be taken to address Iraq\u2019s pervasive corruption problems. An anti- corruption strategy should establish a sound economic policy framework,  reduce subsidies, strengthen accountability organizations, and enhance  investment opportunities and job creation.", "Ultimately, the stability of Iraq hinges on reducing violence and  establishing a capable, credible, and transparent system of government  that is accountable to the Iraqi people.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my  prepared statement.
