The DOD Office of Inspector General has previously reported deficiencies at DOD related to these acts and GAO's prior work on DOD's reporting of its fiscal year 2006 travel improper payments estimate also identified shortcomings. Because of these and other long-standing weaknesses, the subcommittee asked GAO to examine DOD's fiscal year 2007 improper payment and recovery audit reporting to determine whether adequate processes existed to address both statutory requirements. To complete this work, GAO reviewed DOD's annual reports, conducted site visits, and met with cognizant DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's process for addressing IPIA requirements had significant weaknesses. For example, as shown in the figure below, DOD did not conduct risk assessments for all of its payment activities as $322 billion in agency outlays were excluded from the amounts assessed. For those payment activities reviewed, DOD assessed the risk of improper payments occurring as low despite the department's long-standing financial management weaknesses and could not provide documentation supporting the methodologies used and the final risk level. GAO also found that DOD did not estimate improper payments for commercial pay under IPIA requirements, its largest payment activity. Further, the Office of the Comptroller's oversight and monitoring activities were inadequate because they did not include verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information in the agency's financial report (AFR). In addition to not estimating improper payments for commercial pay, DOD's processes for identifying and recovering commercial overpayments were inadequate, because they were not designed for this purpose as required by the Recovery Auditing Act. For example, GAO found that contract closeout processes were designed to ensure that applicable administrative actions had been completed (e.g., all classified documents were disposed of) and not to specifically identify contract overpayments. DOD also lacked detailed guidance on how to conduct a recovery audit program and did not fully address the recovery auditing reporting requirements in its AFR, such as disclosing the total cost associated with its recovery auditing activities. The Office of the Comptroller also did not verify the accuracy and completeness of the recovery audit information in the AFR, which resulted in $20.5 billion being excluded from its universe of commercial payments. DOD stated that its processes were sufficient to address the requirements of both acts, but since then has taken some actions, such as updating relevant guidance.

Similarly, agencies are also required to report on their efforts  to recover overpayments made to contractors under section 831 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, commonly  known as the Recovery Auditing Act.

DOD\u2019s contract management  weaknesses, such as ineffective oversight, increase the risk that DOD will  pay more than the value of the goods delivered or services performed.  Financial management deficiencies adversely affected the department\u2019s  ability to control costs; ensure basic accountability; prevent and detect  fraud, waste, and abuse; and represent a significant obstacle to achieving  an unqualified opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial  statements.", "Given DOD\u2019s size, complexity, and history of financial management  weaknesses, you asked us to examine DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2007 improper  payment and recovery auditing reporting\u2014the most current data available  at the time of the request\u2014to determine whether DOD had adequate  processes in place to address IPIA and Recovery Auditing Act reporting  requirements.

The DOD OIG reported that the  department had not implemented guidance to address the use of valid  statistical sampling in determining programs and activities susceptible to  significant improper payments. In January 2008, it reported that DFAS had  not conducted adequate research to determine if contractor refunds were  improper and, in some cases, had not reported improper payments  associated with these refunds.

For the first step\u2014perform a risk  assessment\u2014OMB guidance allows agency programs deemed not risk- susceptible to conduct a risk assessment generally every 3 years. Further,  agencies need not conduct formal risk assessments for those programs in  which improper payment baselines are already established, are in the  process of being measured, or will be measured by an established date.  However, OMB guidance does state that if a program experiences a  significant change in legislation, a significant increase in funding level, or  both, agencies are required to reassess the program\u2019s risk susceptibility  during the next annual cycle, even if it is less than 3 years from the last  assessment. As we have previously testified before your Subcommittee  this is inconsistent with the express terms of IPIA, which require that  agencies annually review all of their programs and activities.", "OMB then requires that agencies estimate the gross total of both over- and  underpayments for those programs and activities identified as susceptible.  These estimates shall be based on a statistically random sample of  sufficient size to yield an estimate with a 90 percent confidence interval of  plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. If an agency cannot determine  whether a payment was proper because of insufficient documentation,  Appendix C to OMB Circular No. A-123 requires that the payment be  considered improper. The guidance further requires that agencies develop  corrective action plans that include a discussion of the causes of the  improper payments identified, corrective actions taken for each different  type or cause of error, and the results of actions taken to address those  causes. In addition, OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting  Requirements requires agencies to report, in table format, improper  payment estimates and related outlay amounts for the prior year, current  year, and the following 3 years. As part of this reporting, OMB encourages  agencies to report underpayment and overpayment amounts, if available.", "The Recovery Auditing Act requires each executive branch agency that  annually enters into contracts with a total value of $500 million or more to  use recovery audits and recovery activities as part of a cost-effective  recovery auditing program. The law authorizes federal agencies to retain  recovered funds to cover actual administrative expenses as well as to pay  other contractors, such as collection agencies. OMB guidance requires,  among other things, that agencies include in their annual reporting a  general description and evaluation of the steps taken to carry out a  recovery auditing program, the total amount of contracts subject to  review, the actual amount of contracts reviewed, the amounts identified  for recovery, and the amounts actually recovered in a current year.

DOD lacked detailed guidance on how to conduct a risk assessment,  including identifying the universe of activities, determining if risks exist,  identifying what those risks are, and evaluating the results, as required by  our internal control standards. Recognizing that the internal guidance  and documentation needed to be improved, in December 2008, DOD  issued a new Financial Management Regulation (FMR) chapter\u2014Volume  4, Chapter 14, Improper Payments\u2014to expand existing guidance to  address IPIA requirements, by clarifying the agencies\u2019 and military  services\u2019 responsibilities for reporting improper payment information,  broken down by payment activity. Although we did not determine the  adequacy of these changes as the scope of our audit was fiscal year 2007,  we noted that DOD did not require its agencies and military services to  document their risk methodologies, including risk factors considered, the  potential or actual impact on their program operations, and the rationale  for assessing risk as either low, medium, or high.", "While nine DOD components conducted risk assessments for their six  payment activities totaling about $493 billion in fiscal year 2007, we  found an additional $322 billion in outlays reported in DOD\u2019s Statement of  Budgetary Resources (SBR) that had not been assessed although IPIA  requires that agencies annually review all programs and activities (see fig.  2). According to Office of the Comptroller officials, the six payment  activities it assessed covered all DOD outlays for fiscal year 2007 and the  $322 billion difference in outlays represented IPIA reporting differences  related to payroll payments for three of its six payment activities (net  outlays reported for IPIA purposes versus gross outlays reported for SBR  purposes), intragovernmental payments, and payments resulting from  classified activities. While DOD officials stated that it reconciled the $322  billion difference to the SBR (with the exception of classified activities),  these officials did not provide us with this reconciliation to enable us to  independently substantiate this difference. Further, these officials could  not reconcile the $493 billion in outlays for the six payment activities to an  alternative source, such as the SBR. Based on this comparison, DOD had  not reviewed all of its programs and activities. Office of the Comptroller  officials told us that DOD agencies and the military services were required  to reconcile their payment activities with their budget data for fiscal year  2008 to ensure that all payment activities had been accounted for at the  component level.", "In addition, DOD did not have sufficient documentation to support the  level of assessed risk for the six payment activities it did evaluate as  required by OMB guidance and our internal control standards. For  example, none of the nine components that conducted risk assessments  described their methodology or rationale for the level of risk assigned to  each applicable payment activity. For the six risk assessments conducted,  DOD had determined the risk of having significant improper payments was  low, based on OMB criteria. However, given the lack of supporting  documentation and evidence for the risk assessments and DOD\u2019s history  of long-standing weaknesses, including GAO\u2019s designation of eight  individual DOD areas as high risk, the low risk levels are not based on  sufficient analysis and are likely unrealistic and not reflective of the wide  range of vulnerabilities that exist within DOD. Office of the Comptroller  officials told us that the department calculates improper payment  estimates for the majority of the payment activities under IPIA, regardless  of risk level assessed in determination of susceptibility to significant  improper payments, because of the large volume and high dollar amounts  of the transactions. DOD did not rely on the results of the risk assessments  to determine whether to address the remaining IPIA requirements.  Although DOD did not rely on its risk assessments, the implementation of  IPIA requires agencies to make decisions as to how to proceed based on  the completion of risk assessments, which is the first step. Therefore,  DOD\u2019s failure to conduct adequate risk assessments could negatively  impact its ability to gain the information it needs to make decisions as it  proceeds through the remaining steps to ensure proper implementation of  IPIA requirements.", "As we previously reported, the information developed during a risk  assessment forms the foundation or basis upon which management can  determine the nature and type of corrective actions needed. It also gives  management baseline information for measuring progress in reducing  improper payments.

While DOD, in general, developed statistically valid sampling  methodologies and estimated improper payment amounts for its remaining  five payment activities, collectively the proportion of these five payment  activities to DOD\u2019s reported payment population subject to IPIA was about  one-third of the total. See appendix III for a description of the sampling  plans for DOD\u2019s five payment activities. OMB guidance requires that for  any programs and activities identified as susceptible to significant  improper payments, agencies must develop a statistically valid  methodology to estimate the annual amount of improper payments,  including a gross total of both under- and overpayments. Although DOD  assessed all six payment activities to be at low risk for improper  payments, it chose to develop improper payment estimates for five of the  six payment activities based on the large volume or high dollar amounts of  the transactions. However, DOD did not estimate improper payments for  commercial pay despite the large volume and high dollar amounts of the  transactions.", "According to DOD officials, the department decided not to establish a  statistically valid methodology or calculate an estimate for commercial  improper payments under IPIA because (1) its past attempts to estimate  commercial improper payments had resulted in improper payment  estimates that were lower than the actual amount of overpayments  identified, and (2) it would create duplicate reporting of improper  commercial payments as this type of information was captured as part of  DOD\u2019s efforts to address Recovery Auditing Act requirements, which DOD  officials believed resulted in a better measurement because it represented  actual overpayments. However, in fiscal year 2006, DOD estimated $550  million in improper payments, which was nearly 30 percent higher than  the $426 million of actual under- and overpayment amounts reported to  address Recovery Auditing Act requirements.", "Regarding DOD\u2019s point that reporting commercial improper payments  under IPIA and the Recovery Auditing Act would create duplicate  reporting, we disagree. DOD could leverage the results from its existing  Recovery Auditing Act processes used to identify actual commercial  under- and overpayments to develop its statistical sampling methodology  to enhance the reported estimate. This approach is similar to DOD\u2019s  existing statistical sampling methodologies, which also include actual  amounts for calculating improper payment estimates of civilian and  military pay. As we previously reported, the scope of review under IPIA  differs from that of the Recovery Auditing Act. Specifically, the scope of  review under the Recovery Auditing Act targets agency-identified contract  overpayments, whereas the scope of review under IPIA targets both  under- and overpayments, including agency- and contractor-identified  improper payments. Further, while OMB guidance allows agencies to  exclude certain classes of contracts from their recovery auditing reporting,  no such exclusions exist for IPIA.", "Establishing a well-designed statistical sampling methodology to estimate  DOD\u2019s improper commercial payments would not only facilitate  compliance with IPIA requirements, but also help address a current data  void on the extent of improper payments made to contractors and  vendors. For example, based on our review of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2007 data  of commercial payment errors, we identified $62 million in commercial  improper payments and another $92 million of potential improper  payments, which were not identified by DOD\u2019s current Recovery Auditing  Act processes.", "DCAA and the DOD OIG also identified payment errors not captured by  DOD. For example, in August 2007, DCAA reported that a contractor had  overbilled\u2014and DOD had overpaid\u2014award fees totaling about $267  million. Because DOD had not established a methodology to estimate  improper payments for its commercial payment activity, these and other  types of payment errors that meet the definition of improper payments  were not reported, and thus, lacked the level of transparency and  accountability called for under IPIA. Further, without an across-the-board,  systematic estimate of the extent of improper commercial payments, DOD  management could not determine (1) if improper commercial payments  were significant enough to require corrective actions, (2) how much  investment in new internal controls would be cost-justified, or (3) the  effectiveness of any prior corrective actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrective Actions Not Always Linked to Causes", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD reported the corrective actions taken or planned to reduce  improper payments for its five payment activities that met its reporting  threshold, the corrective actions for three of the five payment activities\u2014 military pay, civilian pay, and travel pay\u2014generally did not address the  root causes of the improper payments. For travel pay, we found that with  the exception of one agency component, root causes had not been  reported in DOD\u2019s AFR, even though a description of the corrective  actions taken had been disclosed. OMB guidance requires that, for all  programs and activities with estimated improper payments exceeding $10  million, agencies must report on the root causes of the improper payments  identified, actions taken to prevent or reduce those root causes, and the  results of actions taken.", "For example, DOD reported that inaccurate or untimely reporting of  entitlement data on such areas as time and attendance, personnel actions,  and pay allowances was the primary cause for the improper payments for  military and civilian pay. As actions to address these causes, DOD  reported that it had developed performance metrics and goals to track the  timeliness and accuracy of payments and that senior leadership had  participated in quarterly meetings to discuss problem areas and find  solutions to mitigate the risk of improper payments. While these actions  measured entitlement performance, focused attention on the effectiveness  of existing processes, and facilitated the sharing of information, it was  unclear how these specific actions would address the root causes that led  to inaccurate or untimely reporting and whether those actions would  reduce improper payments. Conversely, for travel pay, we found that  except for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD agencies and military  services did not report the associated root causes contributing to  improper travel payments, even though corrective actions were disclosed  in the AFR. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported that the primary  causes of improper travel payments included traveler input errors and  inadequate supervisory review of travel vouchers.", "The Office of the Comptroller told us that the root causes and corrective  actions implemented or underway were not fully disclosed in the AFR due  to report formatting constraints, preventing the inclusion of all detailed  information. However, when we reviewed the underlying support, we  found that this documentation also lacked details as to (1) the corrective  actions taken or planned and generally mirrored the corrective actions  reported in the DOD\u2019s AFR, (2) the root causes for improper travel  payments, and (3) the results, if any, of the corrective actions taken.  Accurately characterizing and publicly reporting the root causes and  associated corrective actions to reduce improper payments enables  agencies and others with oversight and monitoring responsibilities to  measure progress over time and determine whether further action is  needed to minimize future improper payments, thus enhancing  accountability over the reduction of improper payments by ensuring that  effective corrective actions are taken."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Monitoring and Oversight of DOD\u2019s Improper Payment Activities", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Comptroller\u2019s monitoring and oversight of DOD\u2019s  improper payment activities were inadequate because they did not include  verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information reported in  DOD\u2019s AFR as required by DOD guidance.

For example, DFAS\u2019s contract reconciliations were  performed upon request to resolve previously identified discrepancies,  including possible overpayments, within DOD\u2019s contract, disbursement,  and accounting records such as to correct funding classification or lines of  accounting errors. Because a contract reconciliation would be performed  only if an error related to a specific contract was found, contracts and the  associated disbursements that did not have identified errors would not be  subject to this review. As a result, this process was not intended to identify  new, undetected contract overpayments as envisioned by the Recovery  Auditing Act. In addition, we noted that DCMA\u2019s and DCAA\u2019s contract  closeout processes were designed to ensure that applicable administrative  actions had been completed during the course of a contract (e.g., all  classified documents were disposed of) and not to specifically identify  contract overpayments. The DOD OIG has reported instances where the  department was unable to reconcile and close out contracts due to missing  documentation and staff turnover. Further, although DOD considered  DCAA contract audits an integral part of its recovery audit program, DCAA  officials pointed out that because recovery auditing is a review of DOD  components\u2019 books and records, DCAA would generally have no role since  its audits primarily focus on contractors\u2019 records.", "Moreover, based on our review, DOD\u2019s internal guidance did not identify  the applicable payment and accounting systems to be reviewed, the  frequency of this review, and the applicable roles and responsibilities at  DFAS and the military services processing commercial payments,  including coordination of these efforts. We found no discussion on how  DOD would leverage existing audits to identify commercial overpayments  performed at military service audit agencies, such as the Army Audit  Agency.

DFAS believes this new process will reduce the need  for internal postpayment reviews of commercial payments by identifying  errors before payment occurs. DFAS anticipates DOD-wide  implementation of BAM during fiscal year 2009.

DOD stated that such direction was not necessary as it had  established IPIA program baselines and measures and reports on all of its  IPIA programs annually in accordance with OMB guidance. As described  in our report, DOD\u2019s risk assessment process was inadequate to ensure  that appropriate consideration was given to the risks associated with its  payment activities as we found an additional $322 billion in DOD outlays  that had not been assessed under IPIA.

As such, none of the nine DOD  components that conducted risk assessments described their methodology  or rationale for the low level of risk assigned to each applicable payment  activity. Given the lack of supporting documentation and evidence for the  risk assessments as well as DOD\u2019s history of long-standing internal control  weaknesses, including GAO\u2019s prior designation of eight functional DOD  areas as high risk, the low risk levels are not based on sufficient analysis,  are likely unrealistic, and are not reflective of the wide range of  vulnerabilities that exist within DOD.", "DOD also disagreed with our recommendation that it develop and  implement a statistically valid methodology to estimate and report  commercial improper payments (contract and vendor over- and  underpayments). DOD stated that it has followed guidance provided by  OMB and that commercial improper payments are to be identified,  recovered and reported in accordance with the Recovery Auditing Act. As  described in our report, DOD stated that reporting improper commercial  payments under IPIA would create duplicate reporting because this  information was captured as part of DOD\u2019s efforts to address Recovery  Auditing Act requirements. However, we disagree because those actions  are not sufficient to address IPIA. Both acts must be addressed with  regard to commercial payment activity. Each act has a different scope of  review and reporting requirements. Based on the improper payment  definition under IPIA and OMB\u2019s guidance that instructs agencies to  develop a statistically valid estimate, the statistical sampling requirement  would apply to commercial payments under IPIA.

We  have two main concerns with DOD\u2019s responses to these recommendations.  First, DOD did not consistently follow OMB reporting requirements to  identify root causes and related corrective actions and the underlying  documentation of the reported corrective actions lacked details as to the  corrective actions taken or planned and the corresponding results, if any.   Second, because of the inherent responsibility to be a good steward for  public resources, it is important that corrective actions and the  effectiveness of such be openly communicated or available not only to the  Congress and agency management but also to the general public.
