AMS establishes an acquisition life-cycle management system, including both a contracting and program management system, whereas the FAR is primarily a contracting system. In addition, AMS takes the form of guidance--it is not regulatory, while the FAR is a set of published regulations--a legal foundation that has the force and effect of law that most federal agencies are required to follow. AMS provides some discipline for acquiring major ATC systems; however, it does not ensure a knowledge-based approach to acquisition found in the best commercial practices for managing commercial and DOD product developments that we have identified in numerous past reports. Best practices call for (1) use of explicit written criteria to attain specific knowledge at key decision points and (2) use of this knowledge by executives at the corporate level to determine whether a product is ready to move forward. Attainment and use of such knowledge by executives helps to avoid cost, schedule, and performance shortfalls that can occur if they commit to a system design prematurely. While AMS has some good features, including calling for key decision points, it falls short of best practices. GAO's review of seven major ATC systems and analysis of FAA's performance in acquiring major systems found that AMS has not resolved longstanding problems it experienced prior to its implementation of AMS--including developing requirements and managing software--and is just beginning to focus on how these acquisitions will improve the efficiency of ATC operations. While FAA has made progress by providing guidance for avoiding past weaknesses, it has not applied these improvements consistently. According to FAA officials, reorganization under and improved oversight by FAA's new performance-based Air Traffic Organization should help ensure greater consistency and an increased focus on results.

Historically, the modernization program has experienced cost overruns,  schedule delays, and performance shortfalls of large proportions and has  been on our list of high-risk programs since 1995. To date, FAA has spent  $41 billion and expects to spend an additional $7.6 billion through fiscal  year 2007 to, among other things, finalize key modernization projects  designed to replace radar, navigation, communications, and information- processing systems.", "According to FAA, the performance shortfalls in its modernization program  were due, in part, to restrictions imposed by federal acquisition and  personnel requirements. In response, Congress passed legislation in 1995  that granted FAA unique acquisition and personnel exemptions, or  flexibilities, and directed FAA to develop a new acquisition management  policy. FAA issued its new acquisition management policy, called the  Acquisition Management System (AMS), in 1996 and began using the new  system instead of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). To further  address long-standing weaknesses in the ATC modernization program, the  President and Congress in 2000 directed FAA to reorganize and establish a  new organization. FAA has just begun to do so.", "Now that FAA has had several years to implement the earlier procurement  flexibilities, as well as some time to reorganize, some results of its  acquisition reform should be discernable. Moreover, FAA\u2019s experiences in  exercising its acquisition flexibilities could provide valuable information to  Congress in overseeing the use of these flexibilities.", "You asked us to review the steps that FAA has taken to reform its  acquisition of major ATC systems and the impact of the reforms on FAA\u2019s  acquisition outcomes. Specifically, you asked us to (1) compare the scope  and flexibility of AMS and the FAR, (2) compare AMS with commercial best  practices for major acquisitions, and (3) examine FAA\u2019s implementation of  AMS and progress in addressing long-standing problems with major  acquisitions. In addition, you asked us to review FAA\u2019s general procurement  of goods and services; we cover this topic in appendix I.", "To address the first objective, we compared the topics addressed by, and  the implementation options afforded to contracting and procurement  officials under AMS and the FAR. To address the second objective, we used  a model of best practices that we derived from our body of work on how  leading private firms manage costly and complex product developments  and how the Department of Defense (DOD) manages major weapon  systems acquisitions. We used this model to assess the extent to which  FAA\u2019s acquisition management policy mirrors the acquisition policies of  high-performing organizations in the public and private sectors. This model  consists of four phases: (1) concept and technology development; (2)  product development, which includes both integration and demonstration  activities; (3) production; and (4) operations and support. In between these  four phases are three key knowledge decision points at which commercial  firms and the government must have sufficient knowledge to make large  investment decisions. To address the third objective, we selected the seven  ATC systems with the largest budgets to explore the results of FAA\u2019s  implementation of its acquisition management policy and procedures and  to determine how FAA has addressed issues found to have contributed to  cost, schedule, or performance problems. In selecting these seven systems,  we ensured that some were initiated before and some after April 1996,  when FAA implemented AMS. While the results of these analyses are not  generalizable to all of FAA\u2019s major ATC acquisitions, they indicate the  extent to which the agency has made progress in addressing long-standing  problems we have identified. To further assess both the implementation  and the impact of FAA\u2019s acquisition reforms, we reviewed our work on  FAA\u2019s major ATC acquisition efforts since 1996 as well as the work of the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General (DOTIG), FAA,  and others. We also reviewed the actions that FAA has taken to refine AMS  in response to internal and external reviews. Finally, to review FAA\u2019s  procurement of goods and services across the agency, we used a  commercial best-practices model for taking a more strategic approach to  procurement, along with interviews with key agency officials, to determine  whether FAA has begun to analyze spending trends to identify  opportunities to leverage its buying power. We conducted our work from  December 2003 through November 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

According to  FAA, exemptions from these requirements would enable it to streamline its  acquisition processes, be more responsive to the airline industry\u2019s needs,  and increase the efficiency of ATC operations while maintaining safety.  Congress enacted legislation in November 1995 that exempted FAA from  key federal procurement statutes and the FAR, and directed FAA to  develop a new acquisition management system. In response to these  legislative initiatives, FAA implemented a new, streamlined acquisition  process\u2014the Acquisition Management System (AMS)\u2014 on April 1, 1996.", "We developed a knowledge-based model of commercial best practices  based on our findings about how leading private firms manage costly and  complex acquisitions effectively\u2014that is, within cost, schedule, and  performance targets. The use of this knowledge-based model has been  found to reduce the risks associated with developing products and increase  the likelihood of successful outcomes. The model divides the product  development cycle into four phases and related activities.

As a result, AMS is broader in scope than the  FAR. See figure 1. In addition, AMS takes the form of guidance. This  guidance is expressed in documentation of FAA policy, handbooks,  templates, flowcharts, forms, and standard contract language. It is not  regulatory. By contrast, the FAR is a set of published regulations\u2014a legal  foundation that has the force and effect of law for the federal agencies that are required to follow it. Furthermore, the FAR is more detailed and  prescriptive in establishing contracting requirements and can require more  administrative involvement. This fundamental difference between AMS and  the FAR may suggest to some that AMS is more flexible. FAA personnel can  choose how to apply AMS\u2019s provisions to a major acquisition. Nonetheless,  procurement officials under the FAR also have flexibility because the FAR  encourages innovation consistent with its direction (and other applicable  legal requirements), provides a wide selection of contracting solutions, and  permits contracting officials to choose the methods that they consider  most suitable for a given situation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "AMS Addresses Both Procurement and Project Management, Whereas the FAR Focuses Primarily and in Far Greater Detail on Procurement", "paragraphs": ["AMS comprises six policy sections and five appendixes.

This policy  section also describes the procurement of commercially available or  nondevelopmental items.", "Other sections of AMS cover project management tools that the FAR does  not address, such as investment analysis, configuration management, and  integrated logistics support. AMS also addresses areas that fall outside  project management and procurement, including real property  management\u2014an area that becomes important when FAA must lease or  purchase real property so that it can install ATC systems such as radars or  antennas on property that it does not currently own. FAA\u2019s policy directs  FAA staff to \u201cconduct this business in a fair and equitable manner following  best practices.\u201d", "Although the FAR includes requirements that address procurement  planning and major systems acquisition, it does so only in the context of  government procurement policy and procedure. Agencies subject to the  FAR find the broader program planning requirements, which appear in  AMS but not in the FAR, in documents such as the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s Circular A-109 and in their own planning guidance. For example, DOD has issued a series of directives and instructions on this  subject.", "The contracting procedures set forth in section 3 of AMS do not prescribe  detailed contracting procedures for various categories of procurements, as  do those detailed under the FAR. Instead, AMS provides two basic  contracting models for obtaining products and services through FAA\u2019s  contracting process. The first model is called \u201cComplex and  Noncommercial Source Selection\u201d and is used for complex, large-dollar,  developmental, noncommercial items and services. This is the model that  typically would be used for investments approved by the Joint Resources  Council. The second model is called the \u201cCommercial and Simplified  Purchase Method\u201d and is typically used for commercial items that are less  complex and less costly. Procurements of such products or services may be  routine in nature and are generally purchased on a fixed-price basis.  Generally, source selection under AMS follows a screening process, with  the awardee being selected on a \u201cbest value\u201d basis from among those who  remain in consideration when the selection is made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AMS Provides Broad Guidance While the FAR Establishes Detailed Requirements, but Managers Have Flexibility under Both", "paragraphs": ["AMS sets out a nonregulatory FAA policy that is binding on FAA personnel  as FAA employees. AMS also sets out other guidelines that FAA states  should be followed unless there is a rational basis for doing otherwise.  AMS is subject to such internal controls and enforcement as the  Administrator decides and to general overarching legal requirements, such  as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA).FAA has  also deemed certain acquisition laws applicable to its procurements  (sometimes with modifications), such as the Service Contract Act. There  is also a legal requirement, created by the 1995 legislation exempting FAA  from the FAR, that small and socially or economically disadvantaged firms  be given all reasonable opportunities to receive contract awards. FAA has  adopted a dispute resolution process with some legal underpinnings.  Otherwise, as the preface to AMS states, \u201cnothing in this document creates  or conveys any substantive  rights.\u201d In short, although FAA is subject  to the general legal requirement that government decisions cannot be  arbitrary or capricious, AMS does not establish regulatory requirements for  the conduct of procurements and does not create or convey substantive  legal rights.", "In contrast to AMS, the FAR is a set of published regulatory requirements. It  has the force and effect of law, and agencies that are subject to it are bound  to follow it. The FAR\u2019s requirements provide for a range of procurement  strategies and approaches. In addition to negotiated procurement methods,  it allows two-step sealed-bid and two-phase design-build methods, among  others. It includes streamlined procedures for soliciting and evaluating  offers to furnish commercial items, as well as permits the use of simplified  acquisition procedures in a broad range of procurements. Furthermore, the  FAR supports a diverse selection of available contract types, product- testing tools, and other tools that an agency\u2019s contracting personnel may  select when conducting an acquisition to meet the agency\u2019s needs.", "Although contracting personnel in agencies subject to the FAR are required  to comply with it, they enjoy broad discretion in their management of  procurements. For example, the FAR allows wide latitude in drafting  requirements statements, from performance-based statements of work to  design specifications as necessary. It allows broad discretion in framing  solicitations and in conducting procurements, including scoring proposals,  determining how negotiations will be conducted, eliminating firms whose  proposals are not competitive, and selecting the awardees whose proposals  afford the government the best value when evaluated against the selection  criteria established in the solicitations.", "Because AMS consists of broad guidance while the FAR comprises detailed  and prescriptive regulatory requirements, FAA managers view AMS as  giving them more flexibility than they would have under the FAR,  particularly in two areas\u2014competition and oversight. Whereas the FAR  generally requires full and open competition, AMS calls for providing  \u201creasonable access to\u201d competition to firms interested in obtaining  contracts\u2014a less rigorous standard than full and open competition. AMS  further states that the \u201cpreferred\u201d method of selecting sources is to  compete requirements among two or more sources. By contrast, full and  open competition requires that all responsible sources be permitted to  compete. Under AMS, there is no policy that firms that want to participate  actually get a chance to do so. Rather, FAA told us that its system is  beneficial because the agency can use screening requests to preselect  competing firms, eliminating those firms that FAA believes are not likely to  receive an award. The following example illustrates the differences  between AMS and the FAR in their respective requirements on exceptions  to competition. FAA may contract with a single source when this approach  is determined to be in the best interest of FAA. The FAR, however, allows  exceptions to full and open competition only for certain specified  conditions (such as unusual and compelling urgency or the availability of  only one source). The FAR describes in detail the circumstances of these  conditions and the requirements for using them as justification for not  providing for full and open competition. The FAR also requires the  contracting officer to prepare a justification document that must generally  be approved by higher-level agency procurement officials (up to the  agency\u2019s senior procurement executive) depending on the estimated dollar  value of the procurement. The content of this justification is prescribed by  the FAR. When not providing for full and open competition, the contracting  officer is required under the FAR to solicit offers from as many potential  sources as is practicable under the circumstances. The FAR prohibits  contracting if the justification for less than full and open competition  results from a lack of advanced planning. For a more detailed comparison  of AMS and the FAR, see appendix III.", "Although some of the FAA personnel we interviewed see AMS as more  efficient and flexible than the FAR, other current and former FAA  procurement officials we interviewed who have experience using both the  FAR and AMS did not agree that AMS is more flexible than the FAR.  According to these officials, the FAR may appear inflexible and  cumbersome to persons who lack experience with it, but those who are  familiar with it are able to navigate its complexities effectively. The FAR  requires full and open competition, but as experienced procurement  personnel know, the system does not break down when emergencies  necessitate quick and decisive action. For example, we recently reported  that agencies generally complied with applicable FAR requirements in  awarding new contracts for work in Iraq using other than full and open  competition.In some circumstances, the government\u2019s legitimate need for  prompt action was sufficient to justify selecting a contractor on an  expedited basis from among the firms that appeared able to meet the  government\u2019s emergency need.

The capture of such knowledge  and its use by executives helps to avoid cost overruns, schedule slips, and  performance shortfalls that can occur if decision-makers commit to a  system design before acquiring critical technology, design, or  manufacturing knowledge.

For example,  at each knowledge point, successful product developers apply specific  indicators, or criteria, to determine whether they have attained the  knowledge they need to move to the next phase or activity in the  acquisition process. Such developers also conduct corporate executive- level reviews to ensure that they obtain the insights and perspectives of  stakeholders throughout their organization. If the knowledge attained does  not meet the criteria for advancement or if the executive reviewers  determine that further development is inconsistent with their priorities, the  acquisition does not move forward. Table 3 summarizes the knowledge  points, criteria, oversight reviews, and timing of oversight reviews included  in our model of best practices for major acquisitions.", "Experience with commercial best practices has shown that to the extent  that the level of knowledge called for at each knowledge point is not  attained, organizations take on risks in the form of unknowns that will  persist into the later stages of development, where they will take more time  and money to resolve if they become problems.

AMS also calls for detailed technical and programmatic  information that decision-makers can use at the first three decision points  to assess whether or not FAA should initiate an acquisition program. This  information includes a final requirements document, a final acquisition  program baseline, a final investment analysis report, an acquisition strategy  paper, and an integrated program plan. Finally, AMS, like our best practices  model, calls for senior executives to review the information and determine  whether the acquisition is ready to move forward. The FAA executives who  make the decisions at these points include associate and assistant  administrators, acquisition executives, the chief financial officer, the chief  information officer, and legal counsel; they form the Joint Resources  Council (JRC), FAA\u2019s senior decision-making body for major ATC  acquisitions. Table 4 summarizes this information.", "AMS departs from the best practices model in two key ways\u2014it does not  call for high levels of knowledge to be attained at three critical junctures  (knowledge points), and does not call for corporate executive-level  oversight at one of five junctures. Specifically, AMS does not establish  explicit, written criteria for (1) the information needed to determine  technology maturity at solution implementation, (2) releasable drawings at  critical design review and production process controls at production. Our  best practices model calls for attaining specific knowledge and setting out  criteria for what information should be available to help organizations  minimize risks in the form of unknowns. Risks associated with such  unknowns can persist into the later stages of development, where they can  take more time and money to resolve if they become problems, potentially  leading to cost increases and schedule delays.", "In addition, AMS does not provide for corporate executive-level oversight  reviews at two of the three key junctures where our best practices model  calls for such reviews. Although AMS calls for three Joint Resources  Council reviews during the initial acquisition phase\u2014while our model calls  for a single corporate executive-level review\u2014AMS allows the council to  delegate its oversight responsibility later in the acquisition process to the  program managers within the service organization responsible for an  acquisition. By contrast, our model calls for two corporate executive-level  reviews later in the acquisition process.", "According to FAA, its approach gives program managers flexibility,  expedites decision-making, and allows the executives with the most  knowledge about a major acquisition to make key decisions about its  continued development. FAA\u2019s reliance on this approach assumes that the  program managers will inform higher-level managers if they are unable to  meet the performance schedules and systems requirements approved by  the Joint Resources Council. However, although program managers may  have the most knowledge about their particular acquisition, they may not  have the agencywide perspective of the Joint Resources Council members.  Having an agencywide perspective, including a broad understanding of an  acquisition\u2019s potential impact on other agency projects and operations, is  especially critical when an acquisition includes the production of multiple  units and requires a substantial commitment of agency resources, as do  FAA\u2019s primarily multimillion-dollar acquisitions, such as controller  workstations and radars.", "Because decisions about moving a major acquisition forward require both a  program manager\u2019s specific knowledge of the acquisition itself and a senior  executive\u2019s understanding of the acquisition\u2019s potential impact on other  agency projects and operations, our best practices model calls for both  measurable criteria at key points in the acquisition process to ensure that  specific knowledge has been captured and corporate executive-level  reviews to ensure that senior decision-makers have the opportunity to  independently consider this knowledge. Without higher-level reviews such  as our best practices model recommends and the Joint Resources Council  could provide later as well as early in the acquisition process, FAA cannot  ensure that it has fully considered the impact of advancing an acquisition  on other agency projects and operations.

This lack of specificity resulted in the inadequate development or  definition of requirements, growth in requirements, unplanned work, or a  reduction in performance for five of these systems. In addition, for three of  these systems, FAA underestimated the difficulty of modifying available  software to fulfill its mission needs.

As a result, FAA recently  cut the fiscal year 2005 funding for LAAS, and the program will revert to  a research and development effort.", "FAA developed a final requirements document for the NEXCOM system,  but the requirements lacked the specificity needed to assess the  development risk. According to a NEXCOM contractor program official,  this led to miscommunication about the program requirement relating to  signal interference. This official stated that they misunderstood this  requirement and had not planned on the additional development work  for the NDI solution to meet such program objectives and delayed the  program 21 months. Another program requirement involved the  NEXCOM radios meeting or exceeding the operational coverage area of  the existing voice system. The existing radios had power output levels of  50 watts but the NEXCOM contractor could only achieve 34 watts of  power to meet the coverage requirement. A program official stated that  the contractor and FAA had not agreed on the testing procedures to  assess the power levels. This posed an \u201cunacceptable consequence\u201d and,  as a result, FAA performed additional testing or flight checks of the  reduced radio performance (50 watts versus 34 watts) and determined  that the performance reduction should not affect NEXCOM\u2019s mission or  its coverage requirement.", "FAA did not follow the AMS guidelines that call for completing a final  requirements document before proceeding to the development phase  for ATOP. The Joint Resources Council approved a delay in developing  the final requirements until after contract award. This decision resulted  in schedule delays and additional unplanned software development. The  ATOP program office asserted that the requirements remained very  stable and that the program is within cost and schedule objectives  established by the Council. However, FAA\u2019s internal documents revealed  that the requirements were not adequately defined. For example, the  ATOP Investment Analysis Study reported to the Joint Resources  Council prior to contract award that the lack of more detailed ATOP  requirements at this stage of acquisition added risk and was of concern  to the investment analysis team. Under AMS, this team is responsible  for, among other things, conducting risk analyses for the various  acquisitions. Furthermore, an ATOP Assessment Team conducted a  study in March 2003 and determined that at the ATOP contract award,  \u201crequirements were written at a high level and not mutually understood  by FAA and the contractor.\u201d However, FAA management allowed the  ATOP program to proceed to solution implementation without the final  requirements document and, according to the contractor, this resulted  in schedule delays and growth in the amount of software needing  development.", "The high-level requirements for ASR-11, jointly generated by FAA and  the Department of Defense, to support a COTS/NDI acquisition, resulted  in a product that did not initially meet the FAA mission or user needs.

In all three cases, FAA officials underestimated the difficulty of  modifying available software. Our work has shown that underestimates are  likely to result in unexpected software development, higher costs, and  schedule delays.", "ITWS experienced delays from the beginning because of the complexity  of its software development. Although the program appeared to be  progressing according to its baseline, immediately after the critical  design review in September 1998, the contractor revealed that it had  exceeded the target cost by $4 million. In addition, the contractor  claimed that the program did not recognize that the computer processor  originally planned for the program was becoming outdated, that the  manufacturer planned to discontinue its production because the market  was demanding a processor with greater processing and storage  capability, and that as a result, the original computer processor would  not be available to the program. Consequently, ITWS experienced cost  increases, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls. According to the  contractor and the original acquisition plan, all systems were scheduled  for delivery by December 2001, but that date has now stretched to after  2009.", "LAAS\u2019s technology maturity was not adequately assessed, and further  development was needed. Specifically, the potential for radio  interference through the atmosphere was not understood and could  limit LAAS\u2019s operations. FAA has now placed all LAAS activities in  research and development. FAA did not adequately assess LAAS\u2019s  software development. At the time of the contract award, the contractor  and FAA estimated that 80 percent of the software that LAAS required  had been developed. FAA later determined that only 20 percent had  been developed. FAA and the contractor attribute this discrepancy to a  lack of communication on the steps necessary to satisfy the program\u2019s  requirements. FAA agrees that it should have conducted a software  audit and a software capabilities assessment, but pressures to keep  LAAS on schedule resulted in an inadequate assessment.", "The ATOP contractor underestimated by about half the extent to which  legacy nondevelopmental item software, which is the core of the ATOP  system, met the program\u2019s 1,036 requirements.

According to these reviews, issued from 1997 through 2004,  the same problems have persisted over many years, despite various  initiatives to address them, and FAA needs to strengthen its management  controls. For example, a key FAA review of eight major ATC acquisitions,  published in 1999, 3 years after AMS was implemented, found that these  acquisitions, though on track to meet their performance goals, were not  meeting their cost and schedule baselines. FAA attributed these cost and  schedule issues to new or poorly understood requirements, underestimates  of the acquisitions\u2019 technical complexity, and funding shortfalls.", "In addition, our reviews of major FAA acquisitions\u2014initiated before and  after AMS was implemented\u2014have found for more than two decades that  FAA\u2019s failure to meet schedule, cost, and performance baselines for major  ATC acquisitions has been due to shortfalls in planning, weak management  controls, and a lack of systematic processes for acquiring new systems,  including inadequate requirements management, cost-accounting data, and  estimates of technical difficulty. As we reported in August 2004, judged  against the criteria of GAO\u2019s framework for information technology (IT)  investment management, which measures the maturity of an organization\u2019s  investment management processes, FAA has established about 80 percent  of the basic selection and control practices that it needs to manage its  mission-critical investments for the National Airspace System.

In addition, the agency has not  yet established the practices that would enable it to effectively manage its  annual IT budget of about $2.5 billion, and agency executives lack  assurance that they are selecting and managing the mix of investments that  best meets the agency\u2019s needs and priorities. DOT has responded to our  recommendations to FAA to strengthen its IT investment management  capability.", "Moreover, other reviews, such as those by Booz-Allen & Hamilton and  MITRE, have identified other shortfalls, which reflect a lack of proper  management controls and planning.

In 1999,  Booz-Allen & Hamilton reported that FAA had not demonstrated  improvement in adhering to planned costs and schedules under AMS and  that the agency needed to better manage its development of requirements  and address persistent funding shortfalls.

To date, fewer than half of FAA\u2019s major ATC  projects have used this model. The recurring weaknesses we identified in  our project-specific evaluations are due in part to the flexibility these  projects were given in deciding whether and how to adopt this process  improvement initiative. Furthermore, after combining its ATC  organizations into a single performance-based organization (the ATO), FAA  is reconsidering prior policies, and it is not yet clear whether process  improvement will remain a priority. Without a strong senior-level  commitment to process improvement and a consistent, institutionalized  approach to implementing and evaluating it, FAA cannot ensure that key  projects will continue to improve systems acquisition and development  capabilities. As a result, FAA will continue to risk the project management  problems\u2014including cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance  shortfalls\u2014that have plagued past acquisitions.

According to AMS policy, estimators  record the procedures, ground rules and assumptions, data, environment,  and events that underlie their development or update of a cost estimate.  This information supports the credibility of the cost estimate, aids in the  analysis of changes in program costs, enables reviewers to assess the cost  estimate effectively, and contributes to the population of FAA databases  that can be used for estimating the cost of future programs. Finally, despite  a delay of many years, FAA officials told us that they are in the final stages  of completing the agency\u2019s cost-accounting system and plan to have it in  place across the agency by the end of this calendar year, which will bring  FAA into compliance with the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of  1982. This measure will help reduce the likelihood of cost overruns or  improper payments for unallowable costs and provide decision-makers  with critical information.

Under this approach, the agency plans to link its decisions to fund major  acquisitions directly with their expected contribution to improving  operational efficiency and controlling escalating operating costs. Whereas,  in the past, FAA measured results in terms of its progress in completing and  deploying a major ATC system, it was now going to focus on how a given  system improved operational efficiency. Such an approach holds promise  for helping FAA more effectively manage its portfolio of major ATC  acquisitions by providing a sound basis for choosing among competing  priorities.

This act required FAA and other civilian  agencies to establish education, training, and experience requirements for  their acquisition workforce. Our work on public and private best practices  has identified six elements of training as critical to acquisition. These  elements include (1) prioritizing the acquisition initiatives most important  to the agency, (2) securing top-level commitment and resources, (3)  identifying those who need training on specific initiatives, (4) tailoring  training to meet the needs of the workforce, (5) tracking training to ensure  it reaches the right people, and (6) measuring the effectiveness of training.   These six elements are crucial for successfully implementing acquisition  initiatives and reforms. Agencies that do not focus their attention on these  critical elements risk having an acquisition workforce that is ill equipped to  implement new processes.  The probability of success is higher if training is  well planned rather than left to chance. In 2003, we found that FAA\u2019s model  for training its acquisition workforce largely mirrored public and private- sector best practices and that the agency had highly developed processes  for four of these six elements.

In addition, members of FAA\u2019s Intellectual Capital Investment Plan  Council have attempted to make qualitative judgments about the impact  of the training on the effectiveness or efficiency of their organizations.  However, FAA is still developing an evaluation program with metrics to  measure the extent to which organizational goals are achieved when  individual training objectives are met. Industry and government experts  believe training and human capital investments are prerequisites for  successfully introducing and implementing effective acquisition best  practices. FAA\u2019s acquisition workforce plays a critical role in addressing  long-standing weaknesses that we and others have identified with FAA\u2019s  acquisition of major ATC systems.

According to FAA officials, the ATO has  recently begun to consider ways to better leverage its buying power by  taking a more strategic approach to procurement. While FAA uses the  Acquisition Management System (AMS) for all FAA acquisitions, including  the procurement of such goods and services as office supplies, computers,  telephone services, and engineering and technical support services, these  procurement activities take place in a decentralized environment of  independent, transaction-oriented buying processes. Each FAA unit  determines its need for goods and services and procures them as necessary,  leaving headquarters with limited oversight of the agency\u2019s total  procurement spending. For example, in 2003, FAA units carried out over  346,000 procurement actions for goods and services and purchase  cardholders made an additional 335,000 transactions. This fragmented  environment does not permit the agency to leverage its buying power  through lower-cost, consolidated contracts, at the local, regional, or  national level and to rationalize the number of suppliers best suited to meet  the agency\u2019s needs. At the same time, as part of a strategic procurement  effort, FAA can use spend analysis to monitor trends in small and  disadvantaged business participation so that it can balance the goals of  lower-cost contract consolidation and promoting small business  contracting opportunities.", "Spend analysis, a tool used in a strategic approach to procurement,  provides knowledge about how much is being spent for what goods and  services, who the buyers are, who the suppliers are, and where the  opportunities are to leverage buying power. Our past work shows that  private companies are using spend analysis as a foundation for employing a  strategic approach to procurement. The analysis identifies where  numerous suppliers are providing similar goods and services\u2014often at  varying prices\u2014and where purchasing costs can be reduced and  performance improved by better leveraging buying power and reducing the  number of suppliers to meet the company\u2019s needs. Our research on  commercial best practices has found that spend analysis is an important  driver of strategic planning and execution. As part of an overall strategic  procurement effort, companies use spend analysis to (1) define the  magnitude and the characteristics of their spending, (2) understand their  internal clients and supply chain, (3) create lower-cost consolidated  contracts, and (4) monitor spending with small and disadvantaged  businesses to achieve socioeconomic procurement goals.", "We previously reported that six agencies, including DOT, did not take  advantage of opportunities to obtain more favorable prices on purchase  card buys with frequently used vendors\u2014vendors where an agency spends  more than $1 million annually. In these six agencies, which accounted for  over 85 percent of federal government purchase card spending, frequently  used vendors accounted for purchases totaling nearly $3 billion in 2002. We  recommended several actions\u2014including conducting spend analysis using  available data and gathering additional information where feasible\u2014that  could ultimately help these agencies achieve $300 million annually in  potential savings.", "In fiscal year 2003, FAA procured nearly $4 billion in goods and services  and spent an additional $132 million using purchase cards. According to  senior FAA officials, the agency has just begun to implement a strategic  approach to general procurements. Other federal agencies are beginning to  use strategic tools such as spend analysis to improve their spending for  goods and services, and some have initiatives under way to obtain more  favorable prices on purchase card buys. According to a senior FAA  acquisition official, FAA has to balance the need of its units to  independently make purchases that pertain solely to unit requirements  with the agency\u2019s need to aggregate purchases of goods and services that  are used by more than one unit. FAA has hired a consultant to help begin  the use of spend analysis. This effort could reduce the agencywide costs for  mobile wireless services by 40 percent\u2014an effort expected to save the  agency $8 to $10 million annually. FAA intends to expand its use of spend  analysis to target other procurement category savings opportunities,  including information technologies, training, facilities, and professional  services, as its accounting systems improve.", "FAA has taken some preliminary steps to set up a spend analysis program;  however, progress has been challenging for FAA because of deficiencies in  its accounting systems. For example, because the agency\u2019s accounting  system did not identify all of the mobile wireless services for which it was  being billed, the contractor implementing the spend analysis had to obtain  this information from the wireless providers. FAA will need to expedite its  efforts in this area to fully realize potential savings. Our prior research has  shown that setting up a spend analysis program can be challenging.  Companies have had problems accumulating sufficient data from internal  financial systems that do not capture information on all of what a company  buys or is using in different, unconnected parts of the company.
