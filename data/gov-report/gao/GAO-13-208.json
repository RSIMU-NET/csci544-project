The SPP allows commercial airports to use private screeners, provided that the level of screening matches or exceeds that of federal screeners. In recent years, TSA's SPP has evolved to incorporate changes in policy and federal law, prompting enhanced interest in measuring screener performance. GAO was asked to examine the (1) status of SPP applications and airport operators', aviation stakeholders', and TSA's reported advantages and disadvantages of participating in the SPP; (2) extent to which TSA has provided airports guidance to govern the SPP application process; and (3) extent to which TSA assesses and monitors the performance of private and federal screeners. GAO surveyed 28 airport operators that had applied to the SPP as of April 2012, and interviewed 5 airport operators who have not applied and 1 airport operator who applied to the SPP after GAO's survey. Although not generalizable, these interviews provided insights. GAO also analyzed screener performance data from fiscal years 2009-2011.

Of the 25 approved, 16 are participating in the program, 6 are currently in the contractor procurement process, and the remainder withdrew from participation because their commercial airline services were discontinued. In 2011, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) denied applications for 6 airports because, according to TSA officials, the airports did not demonstrate that participation in the program would \"provide a clear and substantial advantage to TSA security operations.\" After enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FAA Modernization Act) in February 2012, TSA revised its SPP application, removing the \"clear and substantial advantage\" question. Four of the 6 airports that had been denied in 2011 later reapplied and were approved. In GAO's survey and in interviews with airport operators (of SPP and non-SPP airports) and aviation stakeholders, improved customer service and increased staffing flexibilities were most commonly cited as advantages or potential advantages of the SPP. Individual Federal Security Directors we interviewed cited reduced involvement in human resource management as an advantage; however, TSA generally remains neutral regarding the SPP. Few disadvantages were cited; however, some airport operators cited satisfaction with federal screeners and concerns with potential disruption from the transition to private screening services.", "TSA has developed some resources to assist SPP applicants; however, it has not provided guidance to assist airports applying to the program. Consistent with the FAA Modernization Act, TSA's revised SPP application requested that applicants provide information to assist TSA in determining if their participation in the SPP would compromise security or detrimentally affect the cost-efficiency or screening effectiveness of passengers and property at their airport. TSA also developed responses to frequently asked questions and has expressed a willingness to assist airports that need it. However, TSA has not issued guidance to assist airports with completing applications and information on how the agency will assess them. Three of five airport operators who applied using the current application stated that additional guidance is needed to better understand how to respond to the new application questions. Developing guidance could better position airports to evaluate whether they are good candidates for the SPP.", "TSA recently improved its screener performance measures, but could benefit from monitoring private versus federal screener performance. In April 2012, TSA added measures to ensure that the set of measures it uses to assess screener performance at private and federal airports better addresses its airport screening strategic goals and mission. However, TSA does not monitor private screener performance separately from federal screener performance. Instead, TSA conducts efforts to monitor screener performance at individual SPP airports, but these efforts do not provide information on SPP performance as a whole or across years, which makes it difficult to identify program trends. A mechanism to consistently monitor SPP versus non-SPP performance would better position TSA to ensure that the level of screening services and protection provided at SPP airports continues to match or exceed the level provided at non-SPP airports, thereby ensuring that SPP airports are operating as intended."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the TSA Administrator develop guidance for SPP applicants and a mechanism to monitor private versus federal screener performance.

Sixteen airport operators we surveyed and  interviewed reported customer service as an advantage\u201415 had  applied to the SPP and 1 had not. Specifically, 14 of 26 airport  operators responding to the survey indicated this was a realized or  potential advantage to a great or very great extent. In addition, 2  of the 6 airport operators we interviewed, 1 of which applied to the  SPP, stated that the level of customer service provided by security  screeners is particularly important for smaller community-based  airports. These airports constitute the majority of the airports  participating in the SPP, because passengers who have negative  encounters with the screening process generally associate their  experiences with the specific airport. Thus, airport officials stated  that this might increase the likelihood that the passengers involved  will seek alternative modes of transportation or different airports  for future travel. Representatives from the three airport  associations we interviewed did not identify customer service as  an advantage of the SPP. TSA officials stated that federal  screeners can and do provide similar levels of customer service  and that most commercial airports are content to have a TSA  workforce at their airports. TSA also stated that customer service  is an important aspect of their work, and that the agency is taking  steps to improve customer service in a way that does not  jeopardize the agency\u2019s core mission, which is to ensure the  security of the traveling public. Specifically, TSA officials said that  they have enhanced their performance management processes to  better gauge customer service, such as tracking negative contacts  received at airports.", "Staffing flexibility. Fifteen airport operators we surveyed and  interviewed\u201414 had applied to the SPP and 1 had not\u2014and  representatives from two aviation industry associations reported  that private screening contractors are generally more responsive  and flexible than TSA to increasing staffing needs in response to  fluctuations in passenger volume at the airport. Specifically, 13 of  26 airport operators responding to our survey cited flexibility in  assigning staff as a realized or potential advantage to a great or  very great extent of participating in the SPP. Two of the 6 airport  operators we interviewed, 1 of which had applied to the SPP, also  cited staffing flexibility as an advantage. For example, an airport  operator highlighted challenges the airport has faced in adjusting  the number of screening staff to accommodate the seasonal  changes in passenger volume at his airport. Specifically, the  airport operator, a current SPP participant, commented that unlike  TSA screeners, private screening contractors are able to staff  screeners in split shifts\u2014a work period divided into two or more  periods of time, such as morning and evening, with a break of  several hours between\u2014thereby enabling them to adjust to the  airport\u2019s flight schedule and changes in passenger volume. TSA  officials disagreed with this view and stated that TSA provides  FSDs with discretion to utilize federal screeners in split shifts  during the course of the workday, provided that such discretion is  exercised as the direct result of operational need. Furthermore,  TSA officials stated that all category IV and many category III  airports use split shifts. Four of six FSDs we interviewed cited a  reduced involvement in human resource management as an  advantage to the federal government for participating in the SPP.  For example, one FSD said that because TSA oversees the  screening operations of SPP airports and FSDs are not involved  with deploying and managing screening staff, they are better able  to focus on their security oversight functions, including ensuring  that proper standard operating procedures are being followed.", "Cost savings. During our follow-up interviews with survey  respondents, 4 airport operators said that participating in the SPP  could help alleviate TSA resource constraints and result in cost  savings to the federal government because some airports that are  currently participating in or applied for participation in the SPP are  located in certain rural or high-cost communities where the federal  government has difficulty hiring screeners and must utilize federal  personnel deployed for temporary assignments, which results in  increased costs. An FSD of an SPP airport located in a small,  high-cost community we interviewed agreed that the salary offered  by TSA made it difficult to fill screening positions at the airport,  stating that prior to the airport\u2019s transition to the SPP, TSA had  difficulty hiring screeners from the local area, and as a result had  to use screeners from its National Deployment Force (NDF), a  deployable federal screening workforce, because of the high cost  of living in the area. To maintain the requisite level of screening  services at airports in environments where it is hard to recruit,  TSA often uses screeners from its NDF, which TSA stated can be  more expensive than SPP screeners because the NDF screeners  are compensated on a per diem basis when deployed and incur  other costs such as temporary housing expenses.", "Airport operators generally cited few realized or potential disadvantages  of participating in the SPP. Six airport operators we surveyed and  interviewed cited the discontinuation of federal screening services as a  potential disadvantage of participating in the SPP. Specifically, the 4 of 25  survey respondents who had applied to the SPP program cited the  discontinuation of federal screening services as a potential disadvantage  of participating in the SPP. In addition, 2 airport operators who have not  applied to the SPP expressed concerns about the potential disruption  associated with the transition from TSA screeners to private screeners at  their airports, and the associated risk of doing so if the process does not  proceed as smoothly as intended. One of these airport operators stated  that concerns about the transition process\u2014going from federal screeners  to private screeners\u2014is the primary reason the airport has not submitted  an application. Further, this airport operator also cited concerns about  maintaining screener morale, and hence security, as a major reason for   Officials from the aviation  the airport\u2019s decision to not apply to the SPP.industry associations we interviewed did not cite any realized or potential  disadvantages.

As the application process was  originally implemented, TSA required that an airport operator interested in  applying to the program submit an application stating its intention to opt  out of federal screening as well as its reason(s) for wanting to do so.  However, in 2011, TSA revised its SPP application to reflect the \u201cclear  and substantial advantage\u201d standard announced by the Administrator in  January 2011. Specifically, TSA requested that the applicant explain how  private screening at the airport would provide a clear and substantial  advantage to TSA\u2019s security operations. At the time, TSA did not  provide written guidance to airports to assist them in understanding what  would constitute a \u201cclear and substantial advantage to TSA security  operations\u201d or TSA\u2019s basis for determining whether an airport had  established that opting out would present a clear and substantial  advantage to TSA security operations. TSA officials told us that they did  not issue guidance at the time in conjunction with the new standard  because the agency desired to maintain a neutral position on the SPP  and did not want to influence an airport\u2019s decision to participate in the  program. In the absence of such guidance, SPP officials told us that they  were available to provide assistance, if requested, to airports that sought  assistance or information on completing their application.", "In March 2012, TSA again revised the SPP application in accordance with  provisions of the FAA Modernization Act enacted in February 2012.  Among other things, the revised application no longer includes the \u201cclear  and substantial advantage\u201d question, but instead includes questions that  request applicants to discuss how participating in the SPP would not  compromise security at the airport and to identify potential areas where  cost savings or efficiencies may be realized. Additionally, in accordance  with the FAA Modernization Act, applicants must recommend a contractor  that would best serve the security screening and passenger needs of the  airport. TSA officials told us that the agency offers potential applicants  numerous points of contact and methods with which the applicants can  discuss the program before applying to participate. Specifically,  applicants can discuss the program with their FSD, the SPP program  manager, or their recommended screening contractor. Further, according  to TSA officials, once an airport operator submits an application, TSA  assigns a program official as a point of contact for the application, and  works with the applicant to ensure the application is complete and to keep  the applicant informed. TSA also provides general instructions for filling  out the SPP application as well as responses to frequently asked  questions (FAQ). However, TSA has not issued guidance to assist  airports with completing the new application and has not explained to  airports how it will evaluate applications given the changes brought about  by the new law. Neither the current application instructions nor the FAQs  address TSA\u2019s SPP application evaluation process or its basis for  determining whether an airport\u2019s entry into SPP would compromise  security or affect cost-efficiency and effectiveness.", "We interviewed 4 of the 5 airport operators that applied to the SPP since  TSA revised its application in the wake of the FAA Modernization Act.  Three of the 5 told us that they struggled to answer the application  questions related to the cost-efficiency of converting to the SPP because  they did not have data on federal screening costs, while the fourth airport  operator said that she did not need additional information or guidance to  respond to the question. One of the 4 airport operators stated that he  needed the cost information to help demonstrate that his airport\u2019s  participation in the SPP would not detrimentally affect the cost-efficiency  of the screening of passengers or property at the airport and that he  believes not presenting this information would be detrimental to his  airport\u2019s application. However, TSA officials said that the cost information  required to answer the questions is basic cost information that airports  should already maintain and that airports do not need to provide this  information to TSA because, as part of the application evaluation process,  TSA conducts a more detailed cost analysis using historical cost data  from SPP and non-SPP airports. TSA officials added that the SPP  application and the cost information requested only serve to alert TSA of  things it may not be already aware of about the airport. The absence of  cost and other information in an individual airport\u2019s application, TSA  officials noted, would not materially affect the TSA Administrator\u2019s  decision on an SPP application.", "Three of the 4 airport operators we interviewed, and whose applications  TSA subsequently approved after enactment of the FAA Modernization  Act, said that additional guidance would have been helpful in completing  the application and determining how TSA evaluates the applications. A  representative from 1 of the 3 airports stated that while TSA officials have  been more responsive and accessible since enactment of the FAA  Modernization Act, the agency has not necessarily been helpful with the  application process. Moreover, all 4 airport operators we interviewed told  us that TSA did not specifically assign a point of contact when they  applied to the program. Rather, all 4 airport operators reported consulting  the SPP PMO, their FSD, or their recommended contractor because they  needed information on such issues as screening cost, the list of current  SPP contractors, TSA screener staffing levels, and examples of additional  information they should provide TSA because they could not answer  some of the application questions without this information. Specifically, 1  of the 4 airport operators reported contacting the FSD to request  assistance with completing the application, while 2 of the four said they  did not because FSDs generally are not knowledgeable about the  program or are able to provide only general as opposed to detailed  information about the application process. Instead of contacting their  FSDs, these 2 airport operators told us that they contacted the SPP PMO  and stated that the office were helpful in providing general information,  such as a list of current SPP contractors, but not screening cost or other  specific application information that would help the airports demonstrate  whether the use of private screeners would compromise security or  detrimentally affect the cost-efficiency or effectiveness of the screening of  passengers or property at the airport. Another airport operator who  reported contacting the SPP PMO stated that she learned about TSA\u2019s  SPP selection criteria and processes in the course of her discussions with  one of the SPP managers with whom she had developed a working  relationship over the years, and added that had she not contacted this  particular manager, she would not have obtained this information  because TSA does not publish the information for other airports that may  be interested in obtaining the information. Three of the 4 airport operators  who told us they sought information to complete their application from  their recommended contractor as advised by TSA stated that the  contractors told them they did not have the necessary cost information to  assist the airports with responding to the application questions related to  the cost-efficiency of converting to the SPP.", "Following enactment of the FAA Modernization Act, TSA officials initially  stated that application guidance is not needed because the \u201cclear and  substantial\u201d basis for joining the SPP has been eliminated and responses  to the two new application questions related to cost-efficiency and  effectiveness are optional responses. However, the Assistant  Administrator for the Office of Security Operations now agrees that  providing additional high-level guidance on the kind of information TSA  considers during the application review phase would be helpful to SPP  applicants. TSA SPP officials also stated that they routinely talk about the  SPP at industry briefings and that they have done a good job of  explaining the new application to industry. However, as of September  2012, representatives of all three aviation industry associations we  interviewed told us that TSA has not provided any information on the SPP  to their association since enactment of the FAA Modernization Act in  February 2012. Additionally, representatives of two of the three aviation  industry associations said that providing guidance or information on the  criteria TSA uses to evaluate applications would be helpful to their  members, while a representative from the third aviation association that  represents domestic and international airline carriers said that its  members would appreciate any basic information on the SPP. In  interviews we conducted prior to the enactment of the FAA Modernization  Act, these same aviation industry representatives told us that the absence  of guidance provided by TSA is a barrier to applying to the program. They  added that most airports do not want to invest in preparing an application  when they are unsure as to how it would be evaluated by TSA.", "TSA has approved all applications submitted since enactment of the FAA  Modernization Act; however, it is hard to determine how many more  airports, if any, would have applied to the program had TSA provided  application guidance and information to improve transparency of the SPP  application process. In the absence of such application guidance and  information, it will be difficult for more airport officials to evaluate whether  their airports are good candidates for the SPP or determine what criteria  TSA uses to accept and approve airports\u2019 SPP applications. Further,  airports may be missing opportunities to provide TSA with cost and other  information that TSA would find useful in reviewing airport applications.  According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  internal control and all transactions and other significant events need to  be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily  available for examination. The documentation should appear in  management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals and  may be in paper or electronic form.

Thus, a well-defined and clearly  documented application guideline that states (1) the criteria and process  that TSA is using to assess airport\u2019s participation in the SPP, (2) how TSA  will obtain and analyze cost information regarding screening cost- efficiency and effectiveness and the implications of not responding to  related application questions, and (3) specific examples of additional  information airports should consider providing to TSA to help assess  airports\u2019 suitability for SPP could benefit TSA.

These  data are collected automatically by the screening machines. TSA  officials stated that they review this measure to ensure that  passengers are not being screened too quickly, which may mean that  screeners are not being thorough, or are screened too slowly, which  may mean that screeners could be more efficient. According to TSA  officials, passenger throughput is affected by a number of factors that  are unique to individual airports, including technology, capacity and  configuration of the checkpoint, type of traveler, and various factors  related to the flight schedules. While officials noted that there is a goal  for how many passengers should be screened per hour, a rate below  this goal is not necessarily indicative of a problem, but could be due to  a reduced passenger volume, as is likely during nonpeak travel hours.  For example, at one of the airports we visited, there are few flights  scheduled for the morning and evening, at which point passenger  throughput is very low, and several flights scheduled around lunch- time, at which point the passenger throughput is relatively high.", "Human capital measures: We also considered reviewing human  capital measures such as attrition, absenteeism, and injury rates.  However, TSA\u2019s Office of Human Capital does not collect these data  for SPP airports because, according to these officials, maintaining  information on human capital measures is the sole responsibility of  the contractor. While the contractors collect and report this information  to TSA, TSA does not validate the accuracy of the self-reported data.  Further, TSA does not require that the contractors use the same  human capital measures as TSA, and accordingly, differences may  exist in how the metrics are defined and how the data are collected.  Therefore, TSA cannot guarantee that a comparison of SPP and non- SPP airports on these human capital metrics would be an equal  comparison. TSA officials also stated that they do not use human  capital measures to compare SPP and non-SPP airports because  these measures are affected by variables that are not within the  control of TSA or the contractor. For example, some airports are  located in areas that have a high cost of living, and as a result, it can  be difficult to hire screeners because the screener salary may not be  competitive there. \u201cRed team\u201d covert tests: In addition to ASAP tests, TSA\u2019s Office of  Inspections also conducts covert tests, the results of which are also  classified.

While the Management Objective Report (MOR) addressed  eight of the key attributes, it did not address balance because the set of  performance measures did not address a variety of agency priorities.  Balance among a set of performance measures is important because it  helps to ensure that performance measurement efforts are not  overemphasizing one or two priorities at the expense of others, which  may keep managers from understanding the effectiveness of their  program in supporting the agency\u2019s overall missions and goals.  Specifically, the MOR did not contain measures related to passenger  satisfaction which, according to TSA\u2019s Strategic Plan, is part of the  agency\u2019s mission. However, the Office of Security Operations (OSO)  Executive Scorecard (Scorecard) includes passenger satisfaction  measures, such as the number of negative and positive customer  contacts made to the TSA Contact Center through e-mails or phone calls  per 100,000 passengers screened through the airport, which were not  previously included in the MOR. By adding measures related to  passenger satisfaction to the Scorecard, TSA ensured balance in the set  of performance measures the agency uses to assess screener  performance and thereby ensured that its assessment of screening  operation performance would be representative of a variety of program  and agency goals (see table 5)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff  Acknowledgments Error!
