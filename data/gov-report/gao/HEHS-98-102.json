Medicare part B pays for DME for patients who live at home or in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. Our prior studies and a report by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have documented that Medicare pays higher than market rates for some items. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) agreed that Medicare pays too much for some products but said that the \u201cinherent reasonableness\u201d review process it was required by statute to use hindered HCFA\u2019s efforts to address overpricing. This process was too slow and cumbersome to be of practical use. The process involved, for example, a detailed notice and comment rulemaking procedure that required clearance by the Administrator of HCFA, the Secretary of HHS, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "At your request, we reviewed Medicare payments for commonly purchased, off-the-shelf DME such as walkers, catheters, glucose test strips, and orthotic braces. On June 17, 1997, we provided you with an interim report, and the Congress subsequently included provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) giving HCFA the authority to more quickly adjust Medicare\u2019s fee schedule allowances by up to 15 percent per year. This report focuses on problems HCFA must overcome to effectively use its new authority. More specifically, this report discusses the need to (1) better identify products billed to Medicare and (2) bring Medicare fees more in line with current marketplace prices.", "To address these issues we researched Medicare laws and regulations and met with officials from HCFA and its contractors to determine how they set the Medicare fee schedule allowances. We explored ways to better identify products billed to Medicare by obtaining information on universal product numbering systems for medical products from the Department of Defense; associations representing medical equipment suppliers, distributors, and manufacturers; a private consultant; and two standards-setting organizations. We also evaluated Medicare payments for selected DME by collecting and analyzing information on product pricing, distribution channels, and purchasing practices from manufacturers, suppliers, and industry groups.", "We performed our field work between March 1996 and February 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, except that we did not audit the cost and pricing information obtained from suppliers; however, we noted that the cost and pricing information we obtained was fairly consistent among the suppliers we contacted. Appendix I provides additional details on our scope and methodology and a listing of the types of items included in our review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicare part B pays for most medical equipment and supplies using a fee schedule system. The fee schedules specify a Medicare allowance for each of about 1,900 groups of products, and each product group is identified by a HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code. All the products grouped under a HCPCS code have the same fee schedule allowance and are intended to be similar items. When suppliers bill Medicare, they use the HCPCS code they believe best describes the specific product provided to the patient. Suppliers and manufacturers may also petition HCFA to establish new HCPCS codes for products they believe are not adequately described by existing codes.", "Various types of DME are covered by different fee schedules. For inexpensive, routinely purchased items, such as walkers, canes, glucose test strips, and ostomy and urological products, Medicare has a separate fee schedule for each state. These fee schedules are based on the average charges that Medicare allowed in each state in 1986 and 1987. To reduce variation in Medicare fees among the states, the state fees are subject to national floors and ceilings. The national floor for each HCPCS code is 85 percent of the median of all the state fees, and the ceiling is the median of all state fees. The state fees are usually adjusted annually for inflation using the consumer price index, but the BBA amended Medicare law to freeze the fee schedule allowances for medical equipment and supplies for 5 years, beginning in 1998.", "For orthotic and prosthetic devices, including off-the-shelf items that do not require custom fittings and adjustments, Medicare uses 10 regional fee schedules. Each regional fee schedule is based on a weighted average of the charges Medicare allowed in 1986 and 1987 for each state in the region. Similar to the fee schedule for inexpensive and routinely purchased items, the orthotic and prosthetic fee schedules are subject to national floors and ceilings. The national floor for each HCPCS code is 90 percent of the average of all regional fees, and the ceiling is 120 percent of the average. The orthotic and prosthetic fee schedules are also usually adjusted annually for inflation using the consumer price index, but the BBA amended Medicare law to limit the increases to 1 percent per year for 5 years, beginning in 1998.", "Four HCFA contractors, called durable medical equipment regional carriers (DMERC), process and pay claims for medical equipment and supplies.

For example, more than 200 short-term, medium-term, and long-term catheters are billed under one HCPCS code for latex Foley catheters. According to a major manufacturer of Foley catheters, specialized coatings affect the durability, function, and price of the catheters within this group. The wholesale prices of these catheters range from about $1 for a short-term catheter to almost $18 for a long-term catheter. The 1997 Medicare fee schedule allowance for all the catheters in this group was between $9.95 (the national floor) and $11.70 (the national ceiling).", "Since Medicare pays the same fee for all the products billed under the same HCPCS code, suppliers have a financial incentive to provide patients the least costly product covered by the code\u2014they can bill Medicare the full fee schedule allowance regardless of the product provided. For the latex Foley catheters discussed previously, information we gathered from some suppliers showed that the basic short-term catheter, which wholesales for about $1, was the most commonly provided catheter. Since Medicare claims do not identify specific products, HCFA would have to undertake a special study to discover, as we did, that suppliers are usually providing $1 catheters for products with a Medicare fee schedule allowance of about $10 to $12.", "Without product-specific identifiers on Medicare claims forms, HCFA cannot effectively review the mix of products billed under a HCPCS code to (1) identify the need to regroup similar products under existing or new billing codes, (2) adjust the code descriptions and the guidance to suppliers advising them which HCPCS codes to bill, (3) identify claims billed under inappropriate HCPCS codes, and (4) adjust the fee schedule allowance for a HCPCS code so that it reflects the costs of the products covered by the code."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Product-Specific Codes Are Available to Better Identify Products", "paragraphs": ["Universal product numbers (UPN) and associated bar codes are increasingly available to identify specific medical equipment and supplies, similar to the way universal product codes are used in supermarkets. Manufacturers can use bar codes for each product to identify characteristics such as the manufacturer, product type, model, size, and unit of packaging (for example, 10 per carton). Industry standards organizations have created two UPN formats for medical equipment and supplies: (1) an alphanumeric standard that provides very detailed product information and (2) an all-numeric standard that is more consistent with international coding standards. Both these UPN formats can be used interchangeably in automated claims-processing systems.", "The Department of Defense and some hospital purchasing groups are already setting deadlines for their vendors to use UPNs as the standard product identification on all transactions involving medical equipment and supplies. UPNs will enable these government and private purchasers to develop standard product groups, track market prices, and use prudent purchasing methods\u2014paying for medical equipment and supplies that meet quality standards at competitive market prices. Also, a state Medicaid agency is developing a claims processing system that would require UPNs on claims for medical supplies billed to the state.", "If suppliers were required to include UPNs as well as HCPCS codes on Medicare claims, HCFA could routinely gather the information it needs to group similar products under the same HCPCS code and set an appropriate reimbursement rate for each code. For example, according to a product expert with a manufacturer of urological products, the HCPCS code used for latex Foley catheters is too broad and could be split into three separate codes and reimbursement rates\u2014one each for short-term, medium-term, and long-term catheters. After implementing these adjustments, HCFA contractors could use their automated claims-processing systems to check the UPNs on claims and determine if suppliers are billing for these catheters under the appropriate HCPCS codes.", "Section 262 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) amended the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of HHS to adopt standards for the electronic exchange of health information.", "These standards are expected to incorporate a medical product coding system. Although HCFA officials acknowledge the limitations of coding under HCPCS, HHS plans to designate HCPCS as the national standard to be implemented in the year 2000, based on the belief that this would be less disruptive to the health care industry. However, industry groups and suppliers we contacted said they find the HCPCS difficult to use, and industry surveys show that many manufacturers already label their products with UPNs and bar codes to track their inventories. Industry groups contend that Medicare, the nation\u2019s largest health care insurer, should be leading the effort to require the use of UPNs, especially since this coding system would enable HCFA to exercise better control over Medicare payments for medical equipment and supplies. HCFA officials said they are willing to consider implementing changes to the national coding standards after the year 2000, when the industry has had more time to consider a uniform coding approach for medical equipment and supplies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medicare Fees Do Not Reflect Current Market Prices or Discounts Obtained by Large Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s fee schedule allowances for DME are often out of line with current retail prices paid by individual beneficiaries and with competitive marketplace prices paid by large suppliers.

This new authority can help HCFA bring the historical, charge-based fees into line with marketplace prices, but some obstacles remain: (1) HCFA and its contractors do not have sufficient current product or pricing data on the thousands of items covered by the DME fee schedule and (2) the fee schedule reimburses large suppliers who buy at volume discounts the same fee schedule allowances as individuals who buy single items at retail prices.

Competition has led many suppliers to increase their purchasing power and lower their product costs by consolidating with similar businesses or joining purchasing cooperatives. On the other hand, new products that use more expensive materials to better meet the needs of some patients may be more highly priced than the Medicare fee schedule allowances for those products. For example, a HCFA contractor found that in 1996 the average retail price for an irrigation tray with bulb (HCPCS code A4320) was $2.83, while Medicare\u2019s 1996 floor and ceiling for the item were $4.20 and $4.94, respectively; the average retail price for an intermittent urinary catheter with straight tip (HCPCS code A4351) was $0.87, while Medicare\u2019s 1996 floor and ceiling for each item were $1.43 and $1.68, respectively; and the average retail price for a one-piece ostomy pouch (HCPCS code A5061) was $3.37, while Medicare\u2019s 1996 floor and ceiling for each item were $2.46 and $2.89, respectively.", "Medicare payments for some orthotic devices are excessive because even though improved technology and materials have made some orthotics less costly, some of these less costly products are not listed in the Medicare fee schedule. Moldable plastic, velcro closures, and prefitted sizes have eliminated the need to individually design and fabricate many orthotic devices, but as the HHS OIG recently reported, even though orthotic devices are increasingly available off the shelf, the HCPCS codes still reflect the more costly, custom-fabricated products. For example, a prefabricated, self-adjusting hand/wrist brace can be purchased from a supplier\u2019s catalog for $120, but the only similar item listed in the current Medicare fee schedule is a custom-fabricated brace with an allowance of up to $290.92. HCFA\u2019s contractors said that for items not listed in the fee schedule, suppliers should bill a \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d HCPCS code and submit documentation describing the item. However, such claims must be processed manually, and the HHS OIG reported that the outdated fee schedule leads some suppliers to bill Medicare for these items using codes and allowances for the custom-fabricated orthotics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Fees Do Not Reflect Volume Discounts Obtained by Large Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["Medicare pays the same fees to individuals and to large institutional suppliers, even though large suppliers obtain substantial discounts. For example, information we obtained from one large nursing home supplier showed that over a 12-month period the supplier billed Medicare for over 37,200 latex Foley catheters. The supplier\u2019s weighted average cost for the catheters was less than $1 each, but Medicare\u2019s fee schedule allowance was between $9.95 and $11.70 for each catheter. The same supplier billed Medicare for 78,100 bedside drainage bags in a 12-month period. The supplier\u2019s weighted average cost was about $2.24 per bag, but Medicare\u2019s fee schedule allowance was between $7.65 and $9.00.", "Suppliers who bill Medicare incur administrative costs in addition to product costs, but administrative costs do not account for the disparity between large suppliers\u2019 unit costs and Medicare\u2019s fee schedule allowances. Administrative costs are largely attributable to documenting the medical necessity for the initial claim; subsequent claims to reorder items for the same patient involve less time and cost. Suppliers have estimated that the average administrative cost for filing a Medicare claim for a reordered product is about $10. We did not verify that estimate, but it should be noted that suppliers typically include several related supplies on a single claim, and allocating the estimated $10 administrative cost among the three or four items would reduce the administrative cost to between $2.50 and $3.35 per item.", "For some products a few large suppliers account for a substantial number of the claims paid by Medicare. For example, for one particular type of catheter, 10 suppliers accounted for almost 55 percent of the charges billed to Medicare between July 1, 1996, and September 30, 1996. For five other HCPCS codes in our study, 10 suppliers accounted for 24 percent or more of total allowed charges.

According to HCFA staff, its contractor (1) could not readily identify the specific products billed under each HCPCS code and (2) encountered problems obtaining information on market prices. Requiring UPNs on Medicare claims, as previously discussed, would help solve the first problem. To address the second problem\u2014obtaining information on competitive marketplace prices\u2014the contractors could use commercial pricing databases and prices set through Department of Defense competitive contracts to supplement prices obtained from catalogs and VA competitive contracts. HCFA should then require the contractors to routinely review and adjust fee schedule allowances for those HCPCS codes that account for the largest proportion of Medicare spending for DME.", "On June 18, 1997, HCFA proposed a regulation that offers another strategy for paying more appropriate prices for DME. In part, the proposal would, by defining actual charges, set Medicare part B reimbursements at the lower of the fee schedule allowance or the lowest amount a provider has agreed to accept from other payers. This proposal essentially states that Medicare, as the largest single health care payer, should pay no more than the lowest amount a provider charges other payers. We believe that implementing this proposal for medical equipment and supplies could allow Medicare to pay large suppliers at rates that reflect the discounts they obtain, since those suppliers are also likely to have competitive contracts with hospital chains, nursing homes, and managed care organizations. However, a HCFA official stated that many suppliers oppose HCFA\u2019s efforts and that they would challenge HCFA\u2019s statutory authority to implement such a regulation. HCFA is reconsidering this proposal.", "Subsection 4432(b) of the BBA amended Medicare law to require, in effect, nursing facilities, rather than DME suppliers and other nonphysician providers, to bill Medicare directly for DME and nonphysician services provided to their patients under Medicare part B. This requirement will enable HCFA to identify DME supplied to Medicare beneficiaries in nursing facilities. Institutional suppliers such as those servicing nursing homes obtain DME at substantial discounts; establishing a separate fee schedule for DME provided to nursing home patients would allow Medicare to pay fees that reflect the institutional discounts, rather than paying retail prices. Pursuing this strategy could require new statutory authority for HCFA.", "The use of competitive contracting for high-volume medical equipment and supplies also has merit. Section 4319 of the BBA directs the Secretary of HHS to undertake up to five competitive acquisition demonstration projects, in three competitive acquisition areas, and to complete these projects by the end of 2002. Under this arrangement, medical equipment and supplies billed to Medicare part B would be reimbursed at rates set through competition.

HCFA acknowledged that a wide variety of catheters fit this description and said that this problem could be addressed by an expansion of the single code into multiple codes if medical evidence indicates that the catheters are not functionally equivalent. However, HCFA cannot routinely perform the analysis needed to determine whether the single HCPCS code should be split into multiple codes with different fee schedule allowances.

We also reviewed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) to determine how provisions of that legislation change the process for adjusting Medicare part B fees for DME. We met with officials from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and representatives from HCFA\u2019s statistical analysis contractor to discuss how they apply Medicare\u2019s payment rules to set and adjust fee schedule allowances for the items in our study. In discussions with HCFA\u2019s claims processing contractors, called durable medical equipment regional carriers, we obtained information on their practices for adjusting state base fees and for establishing Medicare fees for new Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes.", "We analyzed Medicare fee schedule payments for some commonly purchased medical equipment and supplies. Before deciding which products to include in our study, we reviewed listings of the top 100 HCPCS codes by total allowed charges and by total units allowed by Medicare for the first quarter of fiscal year 1996. We discussed many of these products with HCFA contractors and then selected the following for our review: blood glucose test or reagent strips for home blood glucose monitor, per 50 strips (A4253); lancets, per box (A4259); irrigation tray with bulb or piston syringe, any purpose (A4320); indwelling catheter, Foley type, two-way latex with coating\u2014Teflon, silicone, silicone elastomer, or hydrophilic, etc. (A4338); indwelling catheter, Foley, two-way, all silicone (A4344) ; intermittent urinary catheter, straight tip (A4351); bedside drainage bag, day or night, with or without anti-reflex device, with or without tube (A4357); stoma cap (A5055); pouch, drainable with barrier attached\u2014one piece (A5061); pouch, drainable for use on barrier with flange\u2014two-piece system skin barrier with flange\u2014solid, flexible, or accordion, any size (A5123); cane, quad or three-prong, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tips (E0105); walker, folding (pickup), adjustable or fixed height (E0135); rigid walker, wheeled, with seat (E0142); commode chair, stationary, with fixed arms (E0163); vacuum erection system (K0163); tracheostomy care kit for established tracheostomy (K0165); and intermittent catheter with tray (code A4353).", "We also reviewed Medicare payments for selected off-the-shelf orthotic devices. We reviewed the laws and regulations pertaining to the fee schedules for orthotic and prosthetic devices and discussed Medicare payment practices for orthotic devices with an official from HCFA, HCFA\u2019s statistical analysis contractor, and a representative from a medical supply distributor. We also reviewed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and GAO reports on billing practices and payment policies for orthotic devices. We selected the following orthotic devices for review: wrist-hand-finger orthosis, long opponens, no attachments (L3805); wrist-hand-finger orthosis, addition to short and long opponens, thumb abduction \u201cC\u201d bar (L3810); and wrist-hand-finger orthosis, addition to short and long opponens, adjustable metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal flexion control (L3860).", "We also reviewed the HCPCS for DME. We discussed the products grouped under the HCPCS codes with officials from HCFA and HCFA\u2019s statistical analysis and claims-processing contractors. To identify products billed under various HCPCS codes, we analyzed product lists obtained from wholesalers, suppliers, and a commercial medical products database. We also discussed with manufacturers and distributors of medical equipment and supplies and their industry groups their perspectives on the use of HCPCS codes.", "We gathered information on the use of universal product numbers (UPN) from a manufacturer, suppliers, their industry groups, hospital groups, two standards-setting organizations, the Department of Defense, and a state Medicaid agency. We met with HCFA officials to discuss the uses of UPNs and the feasibility of adopting UPNs as a national coding standard under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) legislation.", "We obtained Medicare\u2019s national floor and ceiling payment limits for selected products for the years 1995, 1996, and 1997, and we gathered comparative price information from wholesalers and manufacturers. HCFA\u2019s claims processing contractor also provided us with a comparison of retail prices and Medicare\u2019s floor and ceiling payment rates for selected items.", "We also obtained product acquisition costs for selected items from some large suppliers. To identify the suppliers, we reviewed reports from HCFA\u2019s statistical analysis contractor. The reports listed the 30 suppliers who received the highest total Medicare payments for selected products during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1996. From some of these suppliers we were able to gather information on the specific products billed to Medicare, the suppliers\u2019 product acquisition costs, administrative costs, purchasing and distribution arrangements, and Medicare billing arrangements. Our discussions with suppliers also covered administrative costs, industry trends regarding cooperative buying groups, and other efforts to lower product acquisition costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of Inherent Reasonableness Review Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Medicare: Home Oxygen Program Warrants Continued HCFA Attention (GAO/HEHS-98-17, Nov. 7, 1997).", "Medicare: Problems Affecting HCFA\u2019s Ability to Set Appropriate Reimbursement Rates for Medical Equipment and Supplies (GAO/HEHS-97-157R, June 17, 1997).", "Medicare: Comparison of Medicare and VA Payment Rates for Home Oxygen (GAO/HEHS-97-120R, May 15, 1997).", "Nursing Homes: Too Early to Assess New Efforts to Control Fraud and Abuse (GAO/T-HEHS-97-114, Apr. 16, 1997).", "Medicare Post-Acute Care: Home Health and Skilled Nursing Facility Cost Growth and Proposals for Prospective Payment (GAO/T-HEHS-97-90, Mar. 4, 1997).", "Fraud and Abuse: Providers Target Medicare Patients in Nursing Facilities (GAO/HEHS-96-18, Jan. 24, 1996).", "Medicare Spending: Modern Management Strategies Needed to Curb Billions in Unnecessary Payments (GAO/HEHS-95-210, Sept. 19, 1995).", "Durable Medical Equipment: Regional Carriers\u2019 Coverage Criteria Are Consistent With Medicare Law (GAO/HEHS-95-185, Sept. 19, 1995).", "Medicare: Excessive Payments for Medical Supplies Continue Despite Improvements (GAO/HEHS-95-171, Aug. 8, 1995).", "Medicare: Adapting Private Sector Techniques Could Curb Losses to Fraud and Abuse (GAO/T-HEHS-95-211, July 25, 1995).", "Medicare: Separate Payment for Fitting Braces and Artificial Limbs Is Not Needed (GAO/HRD-93-98, July 21, 1993).", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
