However, communication between these agencies was sometimes ineffective, most critically about grantees' on-island activities. About 95 percent ($62 million) of USAID's total awards were made in response to unsolicited proposals; however, after 2004, both USAID and State used formal competition to select grantees. Dissidents in Havana said that U.S. assistance provided moral support and enhanced their ability to work for democracy. In 2005, the 10 grantees we reviewed delivered humanitarian and other aid, training, and information to human rights and political activists, independent librarians and journalists, and political prisoners and their families. Assistance shipped to Cuba included food, medicine, clothing, office equipment and supplies, shortwave radios, books, and newsletters. Grantees also conducted international advocacy for human and workers' rights in Cuba and planned for a future democratic transition. Given the Cuban government's repressive policies and opposition to U.S. democracy assistance, grantees employed a range of discreet delivery methods that varied in terms of security, flexibility, and cost. The U.S. Interests Section in Havana, Cuba, a State post, has played an important role in distributing the aid provided by some grantees. Internal controls--both over the awarding of Cuba program grants and oversight of grantees--do not provide adequate assurance that the grant funds are being used properly and that grantees are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Preaward reviews of grantees were not always completed before awards, and USAID did not follow up adequately after awards to correct weaknesses in grantee policies, procedures, and accounting systems identified by these reviews. In addition, standardized grant agreements did not provide sufficient details to support program accountability or the correction of the weaknesses identified by preaward reviews. The Cuba program office also did not adequately manage at-risk grantees and lacked formal review or oversight procedures for monitoring grantee activities. We performed limited testing for 10 grantees and identified questionable expenditures and significant internal control weaknesses with 3 grantees that USAID had not detected. The Cuban government's active opposition to U.S. democracy assistance presents a challenging operating environment for State and USAID. Although USAID and its grantees have some evaluation and anecdotal information about program results, they have focused on measuring and reporting program activities, such as the volume of food, medicine, or books sent to Cuba. USAID recently took several steps to collect better information about program results, such as increasing staff expertise and meeting more regularly with grantees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Cuban government systematically restricts nearly all political dissent,  denying its citizens basic rights to free expression, association, and  assembly.

In response to our recommendation, State said that, consistent with the  Secretary of State\u2019s recent foreign assistance reforms, it was taking steps  to improve interagency communication and coordination for Cuba  democracy assistance. These steps included providing USAID officials  regular access to classified communications with USINT in Havana and  State, and implementing regular meetings between DRL, the Bureau of  Western Hemisphere Affairs\u2019 Office of Cuban Affairs, the Office of the  Cuba Transition Coordinator, and USAID. State also commented that\u2014 within the constraints imposed by implementing a democracy-building  program in Cuba\u2014DRL and the Office of Cuban Affairs would work  closely with all grantees to identify creative ways to document the impact  of Cuba programs. These new methods of documentation would attempt  to measure impact beyond direct outputs (e.g., items delivered or persons  trained).", "USAID said it was taking actions to improve its performance in managing,  monitoring, and evaluating democracy assistance for Cuba. These actions  would include better documentation of USAID grantee monitoring,  improved interagency communications, and a review of all aspects of the  USAID procurement system as it relates to the Cuba program. Subsequent  to submitting its written comments, USAID offered additional comments  regarding our recommendations. USAID concurred with our first, second,  third, and fifth recommendations, as well as with the part of our fourth  recommendation that USAID should ensure that its staff monitors grantee  expenditures. USAID concurred, in part, with our recommendation to  provide grantees specific guidance on permitted types of humanitarian  assistance and cost-sharing. To avoid potentially making grant documents  unwieldy and difficult to use, USAID plans to continue to reference  additional regulatory material regarding allowable costs and other matters  in its grants. However, USAID will review its standard grant provisions to  ensure that grantees are provided clear guidance regarding how to access  referenced regulatory materials. USAID also is considering providing  technical assistance for grants management and grant and regulatory  documents to Cuba program grantees in Spanish.", "State and USAID provided technical comments on a draft of this report,  which we have incorporated where appropriate. In its technical  comments, USAID raised some issues regarding some of our findings.

At these locations, we  analyzed key records and interviewed agency officials and grantees to  obtain an understanding of the processes used to select grantees, monitor  their performance, assess the disbursement of funds, and evaluate project  results. We also discussed Cuba democracy assistance with officials at the  National Endowment for Democracy and the Council on Foreign Relations  in Washington, D.C.", "We conducted fieldwork at the U.S. Interests Section (USINT) in Havana,  Cuba, from late June\u2013early July 2006, where we interviewed relevant U.S.  government officials and observed their activities, such as sorting,  delivering, and monitoring assistance. We interviewed several leading  dissidents and human rights activists\u2014including independent librarians  and journalists\u2014and family members of political prisoners.

We also interviewed  USAID, Treasury, Commerce, and State officials (including State\u2019s Cuba  Transition Coordinator) about the objectives and roles of their agencies in  providing assistance to Cuba.", "To examine the characteristics and selection of the grantees that received  State or USAID awards in 1996\u20132005, we reviewed key grantee and agency  records including annual reports, proposals, and Web sites for the 34  organizations that received State or USAID awards during that period; and  the grants and cooperative agreements, agreement modifications, and  related agency records for the 44 awards State and USAID made during  that period. We analyzed this information to determine (1) the types and  location of organizations that received awards; (2) whether these  organizations had previously worked on democracy promotion activities;  (3) the methods State and USAID used to identify and evaluate assistance  proposals; and (4) selected characteristics of the awards, such as their  initial amount and length, cost-sharing requirements, and any postaward  modifications.", "To identify the types and amounts of assistance provided by grantees,  beneficiaries of this assistance, and grantees\u2019 delivery methods, we  selected a judgmental sample of 10 grantees with active awards in 2005  (see table 9). These 10 grantees were implementing 14 grants or  cooperative agreements in 2005 with a total estimated budget of nearly  $52 million. In selecting the grantees, we considered a range of factors to  ensure our sample included a mix of large, medium, and small awards;  included a mix of types of nongovernmental organizations (NGO); and  covered the range of U.S. democracy assistance targeted at Cuba. We  focused our detailed analysis on USAID\u2019s grantees and agreements  because State\u2019s grants were not awarded until mid-2005. We also  considered the length of time grantees had been providing U.S. democracy  assistance for Cuba to ensure grantees had several years experience  working with USAID. The resulting sample accounts for over 76 percent  of the State and USAID awards active in 2005 for U.S. democracy  assistance targeted at Cuba.", "To identify these organizations\u2019 program objectives, we analyzed grantee  proposals, grants or cooperative agreements, internal authorization  memorandums, and modification of assistance forms. We obtained  grantees\u2019 quarterly narrative and financial reports to USAID to identify  grantees\u2019 reported activities and to quantify the types and amounts of  assistance these grantees reported sending to Cuba. To corroborate these  data and to develop an understanding of grantees\u2019 delivery methods, we  interviewed representatives of these organizations in Washington, D.C.,  and Miami and, when possible, observed their activities. We also reviewed  internal documents provided by these grantees, including procedures  manuals, tracking databases and reports, and other records.", "We developed an electronic database to track and analyze selected terms  of the agreements in our sample, including objectives, award amounts and  dates, cost-sharing amounts, modifications, sub-grant agreements, and  reported activities. To test the general reliability of quantities of assistance  recorded for our sample, we compared these data with other documents  provided by grantees (e.g., shipment logs, tracking databases, and internal  reports), documents submitted by USAID, and data provided by USINT.  We also used interviews with grantee representatives to corroborate these  data. Based on these general comparisons, we determined grantees\u2019  records were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To identify the types and amounts of assistance provided by grantees in  our sample, we used our electronic database to track and summarize  grantees\u2019 individual activities, which we then used to categorize assistance  types and amounts. In addition, we interviewed representatives of the  grantees in our sample and select beneficiaries in Havana about their  experiences.", "To assess USAID\u2019s management and internal control for monitoring  grantees, we reviewed grants and cooperative agreements, interviewed  agency officials and select grantees, reviewed USAID and grantee policies  and procedure manuals, performed walk-throughs of grantee  disbursement processes, and reviewed grantee invoices and supporting  documentation. For 10 grantees, we reviewed the internal controls and  related residual fiscal accountability risk. Based on our initial reviews, we  performed additional expenditure testing for 3 grantees that appeared to  have poor control environments. To assess grantees\u2019 potential fiscal  accountability residual risk, we reviewed the adequacy of their internal  controls according to the criteria contained in our Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. Our procedures did not specifically  address whether grantees were complying with federal laws and  regulations. However, grantees expending more than $500,000 in federal  funds annually are subject to the Single Audit Act. Under this act, these  grantees must receive an annual audit, which includes determining  whether the grantee has complied with laws, regulations, and the  provisions of contracts or grant agreements that may have a direct and  material effect on each of its major programs. We focused our detailed  analysis on USAID\u2019s grant oversight and did not perform similar detailed  analysis of State\u2019s grant oversight because State\u2019s grants were not awarded  until mid-2005.", "We performed a detailed review of 5 of 14 grant agreements in our sample.  We selected these agreements because they represented the range of Cuba  program objectives outlined and were signed over an 8-year period  between 1997 and 2005.

To better understand the  challenges of evaluating democracy assistance, we reviewed relevant  literature. We also analyzed USAID Cuba program documents, grantee  agreements, and modifications to identify guidance provided on reporting  performance data. We also analyzed grantee quarterly reports to identify  how they reported program achievements.
