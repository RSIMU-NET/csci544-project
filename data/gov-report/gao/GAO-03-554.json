Granting an exception to the 30-day hardship duty pay threshold for 109th Airlift Wing personnel deployed to the polar regions would result in minimal costs, but this exception could set a precedent for DOD personnel performing other short-term missions and could further increase costs. Had this exception been in effect in 2001-2002, the 109th Airlift Wing estimated the costs would have totaled about $127,000. The National Science Foundation would incur most of these costs because it reimburses DOD for logistic support in the polar regions. The costs of granting an exception for short-term missions conducted by DOD personnel at other hardship locations are unknown. Based on its review of the intent of hardship duty pay and the implications of granting an exception, GAO believes that an exception to the 30-day threshold is not justified under current DOD policy. The 109th Airlift Wing justified its proposal for hazardous pay on the basis of extreme working conditions and exposure to medical hazards. For example, maintenance personnel work in temperatures as cold as minus 59 degrees Fahrenheit without the protection of hangars and are exposed to potential medical hazards such as frostbite, hypothermia, and carbon monoxide poisoning.

According to  DOD, personnel assigned to an area for a short period do not endure the  same range of physical hardships as those in the area on a long-term basis.  According to an OSD official, the working group linked the 30-day  hardship duty threshold to family separation allowance, which  compensates members who are away from their families for more than   30 consecutive days. We found no basis to disagree with the criteria DOD  has established for hardship duty pay.", "OSD, in its appeal submitted in response to the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, opposed the legislation creating an  exception to the 30-day hardship duty threshold for missions to the polar  regions on the grounds that it \u201cunnecessarily circumvents a process that  has proven to be a fair and equitable means of setting hardship duty pay  location rates worldwide.\u201d The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force  Management Policy) regularly reviews and determines hardship duty  locations and rates. In certain instances, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Force Management Policy) automatically designates hardship  duty locations. All installations located on land areas or an ice shelf above  66 degrees 33 minutes north latitude (Arctic region) or below 60 degrees  south latitude (Antarctica) are designated as hardship duty locations. For  all other locations, unified commanders with regional responsibilities  submit a completed Hardship Duty Location Assessment Questionnaire to  the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management Policy), who  reviews these requests twice a year. Monthly pay rates for hardship duty  are $50, $100, and $150 and are based on the severity of living conditions.  Living conditions are placed into three categories: (1) physical  environment, which includes factors such as climate and physical and  social isolation; (2) living conditions, including sanitation, disease, medical  facilities, housing, food, and recreational and community facilities; and   (3) personal security, including political violence, harassment, and crime.
