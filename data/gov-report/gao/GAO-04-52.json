This density increase combined with severe drought over much of the United States has created a significant threat of catastrophic wildfires. In response to this threat, the Forest Service performs activities to reduce the buildup of brush, small trees, and other vegetation on national forest land. With the increased threat of catastrophic wildland fires, there have been concerns about delays in implementing activities to reduce these \"forest fuels.\" Essentially, these concerns focus on the extent to which public appeals and litigation of Forest Service decisions to implement forest fuels reduction activities unnecessarily delay efforts to reduce fuels. The Forest Service does not keep a national database on the number of forest fuels reduction activities that are appealed or litigated. Accordingly, GAO was asked to develop this information for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Among other things, GAO was asked to determine (1) the number of decisions involving fuels reduction activities and the number of acres affected, (2) the number of decisions that were appealed and/or litigated and the number of acres affected, (3) the outcomes of appealed and/or litigated decisions, and (4) the number of appeals that were processed within prescribed time frames."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In a GAO survey of all national forests, forest managers reported that in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, 818 decisions involved fuels reduction activities covering 4.8 million acres. Of the 818 decisions involving fuels reduction activities, about 24 percent were appealed--affecting 954,000 acres. However, of the 818 decisions, more than half, 486 decisions, could not be appealed because they involved activities with little or no environmental impact. Of the 332 appealable decisions, 194 (about 58 percent) were appealed. There can be multiple appeals per decision. In addition, 25 decisions (3 percent) affecting about 111,000 acres were litigated. For 73 percent of the appealed decisions, the Forest Service allowed the fuels reduction activities to be implemented without changes; 8 percent required some changes before being implemented; and about 19 percent could not be implemented. Of the 25 litigated decisions, 19 have been resolved. About 79 percent of appeals were processed within the prescribed 90-day time frame. Of the remaining 21 percent, the processing times ranged from 91 days to 240 days. The Forest Service, in commenting on a draft of this report, generally agreed with the report's contents. Their specific comments and our evaluation of them are provided in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Human activities\u2014especially the federal government\u2019s decades-old policy  of suppressing all wildland fires\u2014have resulted in dangerous  accumulations of brush, small trees, and other vegetation on federal lands.  This vegetation has increasingly provided fuel for large, intense wildland  fires, particularly in the dry, interior western United States.", "The scale and intensity of the fires in the 2000 wildland fire season made it  one of the worst in 50 years.  That season capped a decade characterized by  dramatic increases in the number of wildland fires and the costs of  suppressing them.  These fires have also posed special risks to  communities in the wildland-urban interface\u2014where human development  meets or intermingles with undeveloped wildland\u2014as well as to  watersheds and other resources, such as threatened and endangered  species, clean water, and clean air.", "The centerpiece of the federal response to the growing threat of wildland  fires has been the development of the National Fire Plan.  This plan, jointly  developed by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the  Interior, advocates a new approach to wildland fires by shifting emphasis  from the reactive to the proactive\u2014from attempting to suppress wildland  fires to reducing the buildup of hazardous vegetation that fuels fires.  The  plan recognizes that unless these fuels are reduced, the number of severe  wildland fires and the costs associated with suppressing them will continue  to increase.  Implementation of the National Fire Plan began in fiscal year  2001; full implementation of the plan is expected to be a long-term,  multibillion-dollar effort.", "Reducing the buildup of hazardous forest fuels is typically accomplished  through a number of treatment methods.  Most often, federal land  managers use controlled fires (prescribed burns) or mechanical treatments  such as chainsaws, chippers, mulchers, and bulldozers.  Other means of  reducing fuels buildup include using livestock grazing and herbicides.  On  federal lands, these activities are managed by five agencies\u2014the National  Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land  Management, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2014all within Interior, and the  Forest Service within Agriculture.", "The first year that the National Fire Plan was in effect, the Congress  substantially increased funding for hazardous forest fuels reduction for  both the Forest Service and Interior agencies\u2014from $117 million in fiscal  year 2000 to $400 million in fiscal year 2001.  The Congress continued this  increased funding level for 2002 and 2003.  Since the National Fire Plan  began emphasizing the need to reduce forest fuels buildup and the  Congress began to support this initiative with substantially increased  funding, questions have been raised about whether the agencies\u2019 ability to  implement forest fuels reduction activities is being unnecessarily delayed  by administrative appeals and litigation of its land management decisions.  Concerns have focused on the Forest Service, which, among the federal  agencies involved in implementing the National Fire Plan, receives, by far,  the largest portion of the funding\u2014over 50 percent in fiscal years 2001 and  2002.  Further, the scope of the Forest Service fuels reduction needs is  much broader than those of the other federal agencies.  Under current  rules, members of the public are permitted to appeal and/or litigate the  implementation of Forest Service decisions within certain prescribed time  frames and under certain circumstances.", "In this context, you asked us to develop national data on Forest Service  fuels reduction activities.  Specifically, for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, you  asked us to determine (1) the number of decisions involving fuels reduction  activities and the number of acres affected; (2) the number of decisions  that were appealed and/or litigated and the number of acres affected; (3)  the outcomes of the appealed and/or litigated decisions and the identities  of the appellants and plaintiffs; (4) the number of appeals that were  processed within the prescribed time frames; (5) the types of fuels  reduction treatment methods identified in the decisions, the acreage  affected, and how frequently these decisions were appealed; (6) the types  of contracts used for implementing fuels reduction activities and how  frequently decisions, including each type of contract, were appealed; and  (7) the number of decisions involving fuels reduction activities in the  wildland-urban interface and inventoried roadless areas and how  frequently these decisions were appealed.  In addition to providing the  national data in response to each objective, you also asked us to provide  regional data.  This letter provides the national data.  The regional  breakdown for the seven objectives is shown in appendixes II through X.", "In conducting our review, we used a Web-based survey of all 155 national  forests.  The survey focused on all Forest Service decisions with fuels  reduction activities that were issued in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  We  obtained a 100 percent response rate from the national forests.  We also  tested the accuracy and reliability of the information provided in the  responses and found that the information was generally reliable.  Appendix  I provides details on the scope and methodology of our review.", "When we provided you with preliminary information on the results of our  survey on May 14, 2003, we had not yet completed our data reliability  checks. Accordingly, we noted in that interim report that some of the  information could change in our final report.  In fact, now that our  reliability checks have been completed, some of the information provided  in our interim report has changed slightly.  However, the relationships  among the numbers have not materially changed.  In our interim report, we  also noted certain other limitations that still apply.  Specifically, the survey  information is self-reported.  Accordingly, we were not able to  independently ensure that all decisions were reported.  In addition, the  Forest Service does not have a common definition of \u201cfuels reduction  activities.\u201d  As a result, if the Forest Service documentation explicitly  stated that the purpose of an activity was fuels reduction, we included it; if  the documentation did not include an explicit discussion of fuels reduction  activities, we did not include the decision in our analysis.  Finally, the  Forest Service does not have a uniformly applied definition of the  \u201cwildland-urban interface.\u201d  Consequently, individual forests may have their  own definition or no definition at all, which could result in inconsistent  data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The 2000 and 2002 wildland fire seasons proved to be two of the worst in  over 50 years.  During the 2000 fire season, almost 123,000 fires burned  more than 8.4 million acres and cost the federal government over $1.3  billion.  In 2002, almost 89,000 fires burned about 7 million acres, an area  larger than the states of Maryland and Rhode Island combined.  For  decades, the federal wildland fire community pursued a policy of  suppressing all fires as soon as possible.  Over the years, suppressing fire in  areas where it naturally occurred has caused an increase in the volume of  brush, small trees, and other vegetation.  The increase in such \u201cforest  fuels,\u201d combined with a severe drought in much of the nation over the past  few years, has increased the severity of wildland fires.  The result in some  instances has been catastrophic.  In 2002, the Rodeo-Chediski fire in  Arizona, the Hayman fire in Colorado, and the Biscuit fire in Oregon and  California became the largest fires in those states in more than a century.", "To deal with this threat, the administration asked the Forest Service and  Interior to recommend how best to respond and how to reduce the impacts  of such fires in the future.  The resulting report and the associated  implementation documents became known as the National Fire Plan.  This  blueprint recommended that the Congress substantially increase funding  for several key activities, such as suppressing wildland fires and reducing  the buildup of unwanted hazardous forest fuels.  Of the federal agencies  involved with helping to reduce the threat posed by wildland fires, the  Forest Service is by far the most significant in terms of the broad range of  forest activities that it is responsible for and the public attention it receives.  Compared with the other federal land management agencies in fiscal years  2001 and 2002, the Forest Service received more than half of all funding  provided for forest fuels reduction activities.  For these fiscal years, the  Congress provided the Forest Service with $414 million for reducing  hazardous fuels\u2014the other land management agencies received $381  million combined.", "The Forest Service is responsible for managing over 192 million acres of  public lands\u2014nearly 9 percent of the nation\u2019s total surface area and about  30 percent of all federal lands in the United States.  In carrying out its  responsibilities, the Forest Service traditionally has administered its  programs through nine regional offices, 155 national forests, 20 grasslands,  and over 600 ranger districts (each forest has several districts).  Figure 1  shows a map of the national forests and Forest Service regions.", "The National Environmental Policy Act requires the Forest Service, and all  other federal agencies, to assess and report on the likely environmental  impacts of any land management activities they propose that significantly  impact environmental quality.  For example, certain proposed Forest  Service activities, such as fuels reduction projects, timber sales, and  grazing allotments, may require such environmental analysis and reporting.  More specifically, if a proposed activity is expected to significantly impact  the environment, the Forest Service is required to prepare an  environmental impact statement.  If, however, a proposed activity is  unlikely to have a significant effect on the environment, the Forest Service  is not required to prepare an environmental impact statement\u2014such  activities are classified as categorical exclusions.  When the Forest Service  is not sure whether an activity will have a significant impact on the  environment, the agency prepares an intermediate-level analysis called an  environmental assessment.  If an environmental assessment determines  that the activity will significantly affect the environment, the Forest Service  prepares an environmental impact statement.  (See fig. 2).", "Under certain circumstances, the public has a right to administratively  appeal Forest Service decisions.These appeals must be evaluated by the  Forest Service within prescribed time frames and could result in decisions  being reversed and the associated land management activities being  substantially revised or even cancelled.  Generally, the public can appeal  decisions associated with environmental impact statements or  environmental assessments.  Decisions associated with categorical  exclusions are generally not appealable.  Further, as a general rule, once  the administrative appeals process is complete, the public can litigate any  decision, including categorical exclusions, in federal court.", "Controversy has surrounded this issue for some time.  On the one hand,  critics have asserted that administrative appeals and litigation are stopping  or unnecessarily slowing the decision-making processes of the Forest  Service and their efforts to reduce forest fuels on federal lands.  They  expressed the view that many appeals are \u201cfrivolous\u201d and brought for the  purpose of frustrating, rather than improving, land management actions,  and that they greatly increase the costs of managing the national forests.  Supporters of the current process, on the other hand, have responded that  appeals have not been excessive or unwarranted, that few appeals are  frivolous, and that the current process for handling appeals is adequate.  Supporters further assert that the Congress intended the federal land  management process to include administrative reviews of agency decisions  to (1) ensure public participation in the decision-making process and (2)  ensure that agency managers adequately consider the various factors and  policies impacting the environmental health of the nation\u2019s lands.", "Recent administrative rule changes and legislative proposals modify or  would modify the current appeals process and exempt certain projects  from the process.  In August 2002, the administration announced the  Healthy Forest Initiative, which has been controversial as well; some  regarding it as an effort to reduce unnecessary red tape and needless delays  and others considering it a tool to increase logging activity.  The initiative is  intended to help reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires and improve  the health of the national forests by, among other things, streamlining the  planning and appeals processes.  In particular, recent administrative rule  changes modify the appeal procedures and establish new categorical  exclusions for certain fuels reduction projects.  The Congress is also  considering legislation to, among other things, exempt certain fuels  reduction activities from the existing appeal requirements.  The bill would  require the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations establishing a  separate administrative process to address disputes concerning these  projects.", "The debate surrounding the Healthy Forest Initiative centers on the extent  and frequency of appeals and litigation of fuels reduction activities.  However, because the Forest Service does not have a national database to  track both its decisions involving forest fuels reduction activities and the  extent to which they were appealed or litigated, we were asked to develop  this information.  The information in this report provides these data for  fiscal years 2001 and 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Number of Decisions Involving Forest Fuels Reduction Activities and the Number of Acres Affected", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the national forest managers reported that  there were 818 decisions involving forest fuels reduction activities.

About 280 of the  decisions (about 34 percent) initially had the potential for some  environmental impact and required the preparation of environmental  assessments.  All of the remaining decisions (486 or about 59 percent)  involved activities that had no or only minor environmental impacts and, as  such, were categorically excluded from documentation in an  environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.", "In reporting these data, it is important to emphasize that the Forest Service  does not have a uniform definition of a fuels reduction activity.  The lack of  a uniform definition is an important limitation because it could affect the  consistency of the data reported to us by the national forests in terms of  which activities are identified as fuels reduction projects.  Accordingly, if  the supporting Forest Service decision documents explicitly stated that the  purpose of the activities was fuels reduction, we accepted the decision.  However, if the decision documents did not include an explicit discussion  of fuels reduction, we did not accept the decision.  Many activities have the  practical effect of reducing forest fuels, but the purpose may be for  something other than fuels reduction.  For example, a tree thinning activity  may reduce fuels, but the stated purpose of the project may be to treat an  insect infestation.  If so, fuels reduction would not be a designated purpose  of the activity, and the decision was not included in our analysis.  In  addition, a commercial timber harvest will reduce fuels by removing trees,  but the stated purpose may be commodity production.  If so, the decision  was not included in our analysis.  If the commercial timber sale or thinning  activities included a stated purpose of reducing fuels, the decision was  included in our analysis.", "Amount of Acreage Affected\t The forest fuels reduction decisions for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 covered  almost 4.8 million acres of national forest land.  Of the 4.8 million acres, the  forest managers reported that 0.3 million acres (about 7 percent) involved  activities that were expected to have significant environmental impacts,  thus requiring the preparation of environmental impact statements.  About  1.5 million acres (about 31 percent) involved activities that initially had the  potential for some environmental impact and required the preparation of  environmental assessments.  All of the remaining acreage (3.0 million or  about 62 percent) involved activities that had no or only minor  environmental impacts and, as such, were categorically excluded from  preparation of a detailed environmental impact analysis.", "There are a few limitations to the acreage data.  The 4.8 million acres does  not correspond to the number of acres actually treated in fiscal years 2001  and 2002.  Once a decision is made and documented, there are many  reasons that activities covered by decision may be delayed or not  implemented, including funding availability, personnel availability, weather  conditions, and administrative appeals or litigation.  In addition, the  national forests may have submitted more than one decision with activities  on the same area of land.  Therefore, the 4.8 million acres may include  overlapping acreage.  Further, the national forest managers reported  decisions involving personal firewood activities, including one large  project from the Tonto National Forest in Arizona that could potentially  skew the acreage data.  Under the personal firewood program, forest  managers designate areas where the public can obtain a wood cutting  permit and gather firewood for personal use.  Forest managers can identify  all of the acreage available for firewood removal under this program as  fuels reduction activities.  However, it is possible that the public may  collect only firewood that is easily accessible, such as near roads and trails,  rather than covering the entire designated area.  One decision from the  Tonto National Forest in Arizona designates 1 million acres as eligible for  firewood removal.  These 1 million acres are 21 percent of the total acreage  reported as treated or planned to be treated for fuels reduction activities  for all national forests.  According to Forest Service officials, it is unlikely  that the public will remove fuels from all 1 million acres.", "Table 1 shows the number of decisions with forest fuels reduction  activities, the amount of acreage affected, and their environmental impact  significance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Number of Decisions Involving Forest Fuels Reduction Activities Appealed and Litigated and the Amount of Acreage Affected", "paragraphs": ["Of the 818 decisions involving forest fuels reduction activities, 24 percent  were appealed.

A single decision may include activities such as  timber sales, road construction, grazing permits, and habitat improvement  in addition to fuels reduction activities.  As a result, when an appeal is  pursued, it may or may not be based on concerns about fuels reduction  activities.  Under the Forest Service appeal regulations, the entire decision  is appealed, not the individual activities.  Therefore, the public may object  to only one activity in a decision but all land management activities covered  by the decision will be affected by an appeal.  For example, a single  decision may contain activities involving commercial thinning, prescribed  burning, stream improvements, road construction, and a trail closure.  An  appellant may object to the road construction activity but not the forest  thinning activities.  However, all of the activities covered by a decision will  be affected until the appeal is resolved.", "There is no limit to the number of appeals that can be filed on an individual  decision.

In addition, thinning stands of trees  to reduce competition for light, moisture, and nutrients may improve forest  health.  Mechanical thinning is typically done using power equipment, such  as bulldozers, chain saws, chippers, and mulchers.  Figures 7 and 8 show  examples of mechanical thinning projects.", "Mechanical thinning is the second most utilized method for reducing forest  fuels.  Of the 818 decisions with fuels reduction activities, 491 (about 60  percent) included mechanical treatment methods.  These treatments  involved 0.8 million acres\u2014about 17 percent of all the acreage treated or  planned for treatment in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.", "Chemical treatments are herbicides used to control and remove the  hazardous buildup of forest vegetation.  Herbicides are usually applied as  liquids mixed with water or oil and then sprayed on the soil surface to be  absorbed by the plant roots.  Generally, there are four methods of applying  herbicides: (1) aerial application, using helicopters or other aircraft; (2)  mechanical equipment, using truck-mounted or truck-towed wand or  broom sprayers; (3) backpack equipment, generally a pressurized container  with an agitation device; and (4) hand application by injection, daubing cut  surfaces, or application of granular formulations to the soil.", "Grazing animals, such as cattle and goats, can also be used to reduce the  buildup of hazardous forest fuels.  However, grazing is less utilized because  it is increasingly competing with other uses of public lands, such as  recreation, wildlife habitat, riparian management, endangered species  management, mining, hunting, cultural resource protection, wilderness,  and a wide variety of other uses.", "Chemical treatments and grazing are the least utilized treatment methods.  Of the 818 fuels reduction decisions reported, 3 (less than 1 percent)  included chemical/herbicide treatments, and 2 (less than 1 percent)  included grazing.  These two types of treatment methods affected about  700 acres\u2014less than 1 percent of the total acres treated or planned for  treatment in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.", "In addition to the four basic hazardous fuels treatment methods, there are  other methods that are sometimes used.  These other methods include  activities such as cutting underbrush by hand or the public\u2019s removal of  firewood by hand.  One hundred and twelve (14 percent) of all fuels  reduction decisions in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 included these other kinds  of treatments.  However, while the use of the other methods was relatively  infrequent, the amount of acreage affected was considerable\u2014mostly due  to the 1 million acre personal fire wood removal program from the Tonto  National Forest in Arizona.  There are two important points that need to be  highlighted regarding this fire wood removal program.  First, while the  project covers 1 million acres, it does not necessarily mean that firewood  will be removed from all of these acres.  It simply means that these acres  are available for the removal of firewood.  Accordingly, the extent of fuels  reduction on these acres is not clear.  It is possible that the number of acres  actually reported for the project can be significantly overstated.  Second,  even though officials at the Tonto National Forest reported this as part of  the forest fuels reduction program, Forest Service headquarters officials  questioned the merit of including it in our report because they believed it  skewed the data by increasing the amount of acreage having fuels  reduction activities.  In the final analysis, we reported this project as a fuels  reduction activity because the Tonto forest officials identified it as such in  their decision documents.  Table 5 summarizes the fuels reduction methods  used by the Forest Service in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.", "The columns in the table 5 do not add to the total number of decisions  (818) or the total amount of acreage affected (4.8 million).  This occurs for  two reasons.  First, a decision can include prescribed burning on some  acreage and another treatment method on other acreage.  Second, the same  acreage can be treated by more than one method.  For example, an area can  be thinned using prescribed burning and then be further thinned using  mechanical means.

The cut materials affect the fuel loads and can be left as is, piled  and burned, lopped and scattered to accelerate rotting, or removed from  the site.  Of the 818 total fuels reduction projects, 356 (44 percent) of the  decisions involved service contracts.", "Stewardship contracts use a combination of service contracts and timber  sale contracts to care for national forest system land.  In 1998, the Forest  Service was given stewardship contracting authority so that the agency  could work with private and public entities to achieve federal management  goals. For example, this authority provided the Forest Service with the  ability to trade goods for services (such as timber in exchange for road  maintenance). A stewardship contract might include prescribed burning to  improve wildlife habitat or reduce forest fuels in conjunction with the sale  of forest products off the same piece of land.  Of the 818 total fuels  reduction decisions, 41 (5 percent) of the decisions involved stewardship  contracts.", "Figure 9 shows the frequency of service, timber sale, and stewardship  contracts used in decisions with fuels reduction activities.", "The total number of decisions in figure 9 does not total 818 because there  are also other means used to implement fuels reduction activities.

Of the 818 decisions, 673 (82 percent) involved some work  by Forest Service personnel.  Further, other means, such as contracts that  utilize prison labor and contracts that collaborate with other federal  agencies like the Bureau of Land Management, are also used to help reduce  forest fuels.

Other managers reported  that they either did not have a definition or did not know if they had a  definition.  The inconsistent application of these definitions by forest  managers should be considered when using the information reported about  whether fuels reduction activities were in the wildland-urban interface.  An  August 2003 GAO report highlighted the fact that agencies need to define  which lands are part of the wildland-urban interface. Without doing so,  the Forest Service will be constrained in its ability to prioritize locations for  fuels reduction treatments and to allocate funding accordingly.  We  recommended in the August report that the Forest Service develop a  consistent, specific definition of the wildland-urban interface so that  detailed, comparable nationwide data could be collected to identify the  amount and location of lands in the wildland-urban interface.

The survey  focused on all Forest Service decisions in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 with a  forest fuels reduction component, including those that were categorically  excluded from preparation of an environmental impact statement, that  were issued in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The specific information we  needed to satisfy our objectives was located at several organizational  levels\u2014headquarters, regional offices, individual forests, and district  offices within each forest.  For instance, information on the individual  decisions, particularly the environmental impact statements and  environmental assessments, was located at the forest-level.  Information on  categorical exclusions was primarily located only at the district offices.  Our survey was addressed to forest supervisors.  We asked forest  supervisors to gather the necessary information from the other  organizational units within the Forest Service, as needed, to complete the  survey.  We also asked each forest supervisor for a contact person at the  forest who was familiar with the National Environmental Policy Act  process requirements, since it guides land management decision-making  and planning activities.

Once we developed the questions,  we pretested the instrument at the Kootenai National Forest in Montana,  the Payette and Boise National Forests in Idaho, and the Monongahela  National Forest in West Virginia.", "We gave the forests 3 weeks to respond to the survey and granted  extensions as needed.  We obtained a 100 percent response rate from the  forest managers.  We verified the accuracy of about 10 percent of the  survey responses submitted.  We used a random number to identify the first  decision to be verified and then selected every 10th decision submitted by  the forests.  After selecting a decision, we obtained the supporting decision  documents, National Environmental Policy Act documents, and appeals  information from the forests and verified the information submitted for the  randomly selected decisions. Using this approach, we verified 85 total  decisions.  Any discrepancies between the survey responses and our data  verification were discussed and resolved with the responsible forest  official.
