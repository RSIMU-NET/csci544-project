For example, DOD has not determined whether the charter  will identify the NDERG\u2019s responsibilities for issues that are not directly  related to the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews or what the NDERG\u2019s long- term role will be once most or all of the recommendations from the 2014  nuclear enterprise reviews are implemented. The July memorandum does  indicate that the charter will include a plan to confirm that NDERG- approved actions have the expected effects and do not result in  unintended consequences or recurrence of the initial issue. However, the  memorandum does not specify how or when the NDERG should address  new issues and does not indicate that the charter or DOD directive will do  so either.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should establish an organizational structure, assign  responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives.  Specifically, the standards call for management to develop an  organizational structure with an understanding of the organization\u2019s  overall responsibilities and assign these responsibilities to enable the  organization to operate in an efficient and effective manner, comply with  applicable laws and regulations, and reliably report quality information.  In the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews, DOD identified a lack of  comprehensive oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise. To ensure  greater awareness among senior DOD leaders, the internal review  recommended that DOD create a single, senior-level position to oversee  the nuclear enterprise, provide the Secretary of Defense with additional  routine visibility into the nuclear enterprise, and marshal the authority of  the Secretary to resolve identified issues. DOD did not implement the  internal review team\u2019s recommendation to establish a senior oversight  position for the nuclear enterprise because, according to CAPE officials,  the Secretary of Defense considered the NDERG to be sufficient to  address the recommendation. However, four years after it was  established, the roles and responsibilities of the NDERG have not been  clearly articulated. DOD now plans to develop a charter and subsequent  DOD directive for the NDERG, but it remains unclear whether these  documents will provide clear roles and responsibilities for the NDERG to  effectively function as the comprehensive oversight body for the  enterprise\u2014in part because, according to officials, they are in the early  stages of development.", "In addition, DOD has not clearly defined how the NDERG will  communicate and collaborate with the other oversight groups. DOD uses  other groups, such as the Nuclear Weapons Council and the NLC3S  Council, to oversee portions of the nuclear enterprise and coordinate  among various DOD entities and with the Department of Energy. Many of  the same individuals and organizations are represented in two or all three  of the oversight organizations. For example, four DOD senior leaders\u2014 the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy; and the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command\u2014participate in  both the Nuclear Weapons Council and the NLC3S Council, which are  statutorily responsible for oversight of aspects of the defense nuclear  enterprise. Figure 4 shows the roles and responsibilities of some of the  nuclear enterprise oversight groups and DOD components.", "The NDERG, the Nuclear Weapons Council, and the NLC3S Council  have lower-level management and working groups that include  participants from many of the same organizations. For example, the Air  Force\u2019s Office of Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration is  represented in the NDERG\u2019s Nuclear Deterrent Senior Oversight Group  and on the Nuclear Weapons Council\u2019s Standing and Safety Committee.  The Army, Navy, and Air Force also participate in all three oversight  groups\u2019 working groups. Unlike the NDERG\u2014which will have no formally  defined roles and responsibilities until its charter and the eventual  directive are finalized\u2014the Nuclear Weapons Council and the NLC3S  Council are statutorily responsible for overseeing specific aspects of the  nuclear enterprise.", "According to officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Nuclear Matters, in response to updated presidential  guidance, a charter is being drafted for a new nuclear enterprise oversight  group\u2014the Security Incident Response Council. According to these  officials, the council will be an interagency group that will have oversight  of plans for responding to potential security incidents involving nuclear  weapons and will bring together officials from across all relevant  departments and agencies.", "The Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s July 2018 memorandum, previously  discussed, does not address how the NDERG should collaborate with  other nuclear enterprise oversight groups with overlapping  responsibilities. According to the memorandum, issues falling under the  purview of other existing nuclear enterprise oversight groups will be  addressed by those groups, but the memorandum acknowledges that the  groups may interact. Specifically, the memorandum states that the  Nuclear Weapons Council, the NLC3S Council, the Nuclear Posture  Review Implementation group, and the Security Incident Response  Council may recommend issues for the NDERG. However, the  memorandum does not describe how the NDERG should communicate  the necessary quality information with other oversight groups, including  criteria for determining which issues should be recommended or  otherwise communicated to the NDERG or when those groups should go  about recommending issues for consideration to the NDERG. Further, the  other oversight groups will not fall under the authority of the NDERG  charter, so stating that the groups may recommend issues for the  NDERG does not ensure that they will do so. As previously stated, it is  not clear whether these issues will be addressed in either the NDERG\u2019s  charter or the subsequent DOD directive.", "As we have previously reported, leading practices for enhancing  interagency collaboration include agreeing on roles and responsibilities  and having written guidance and agreements. Specifically, collaborating  agencies should work together to define and agree on their respective  roles and responsibilities. In doing so, agencies can clarify who will do  what, organize their joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision  making. Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that management should use quality information to  achieve an entity\u2019s objectives and internally and externally communicate  the necessary quality information to achieve the objectives. These  standards call for management to communicate quality information with  appropriate methods of communication and consider a variety of factors  in selecting an appropriate method of communication, such as the  audience and the nature of the information.", "The 2014 independent nuclear enterprise review found that the difficulty  of defining the defense nuclear enterprise complicates senior DOD  leaders\u2019 ability to take ownership of the enterprise. Specifically, the  independent review noted that senior leaders within the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and the military services referred to the \u201cnuclear  enterprise\u201d as if there were a coherent, integrated structure and set of  activities supporting the nuclear forces. However, the review team did not  find a coherent, integrated structure and synchronized set of activities that  could be characterized as a DOD \u201cnuclear enterprise.\u201d Further, the  independent review team found that there was a loose federation of  separate nuclear activities scattered across multiple organizations with no  clearly defined responsibility or accountability.", "In response to the challenges the independent review identified in 2014,  the review recommended that the loosely federated nuclear activities  within OSD and the Air Force be brought together into a coherent and  synchronized structure that focuses on direction and support for the  nuclear forces. In addition, the internal review noted as one of its most  important findings that the problems of the nuclear enterprise did not exist  in isolation and would require a coordinated, holistic approach to resolve.  In particular, the internal review team concluded that, because the issues  they identified in each of the military services were interdependent, the  ultimate solutions in many instances would have to be cultural, structural,  and sustained over the long term. Identifying oversight groups\u2019 roles and  responsibilities and identifying and establishing methods for  communicating and collaborating among groups could help mitigate the  problems identified in the 2014 reviews.", "In the absence of defined roles and responsibilities or methods for how  the NDERG is to communicate and collaborate with other existing  oversight organizations, the NDERG may be unable to effectively oversee  the defense nuclear enterprise in a coordinated, holistic manner that  would address problems identified by the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews  or other issues it may need to address in the future. Additionally, clear  roles and responsibilities and methods for communication and  collaboration could better position senior leaders to effectively manage  resourcing and risk across the department. Officials from CAPE; the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and  Biological Defense Programs; and the military services agreed that  clarifying roles and responsibilities and identifying methods for  communication would be helpful in addressing long-standing issues and  guiding the NDERG in the future.", "Additionally, with increased funding and prioritization of the nuclear  enterprise, as called for in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, there is an  increased need for the kind of coordinated, holistic oversight of the  nuclear enterprise that was recommended in the 2014 Internal  Assessment of the Department of Defense Nuclear Enterprise. For  example, the Nuclear Posture Review\u2019s goal of replacing legacy nuclear  systems beginning in the mid-2020s will require senior leaders from  across the defense nuclear enterprise to make decisions regarding  resource allocation and prioritization\u2014for both the new systems and the  existing systems that are not being replaced.

DOD issuances also establish policy and assign responsibilities  for matters related to the NC3 system to organizations throughout DOD,  including U.S. Strategic Command. The changes proposed in the  Commander\u2019s Estimate, if implemented, would result in DOD having to  update its own guidance and determine whether there is a need to  request a change in the statutory language or presidential guidance.

The NC3 enterprise is a  large and complex system, and without clearly identified roles and  responsibilities for an effective oversight structure, problems similar to  those identified in 2014 as negatively affecting the management of the  entirety of the defense nuclear enterprise may continue to limit effective  management of the NC3 enterprise."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has continued to take steps to improve the defense nuclear  enterprise in response to the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the  2015 NC3 report. By including risk identification, assessment, and  documentation, CAPE has strengthened its framework for monitoring the  department\u2019s efforts to address the many issues identified in 2014\u2014 including those enduring issues that must be watched for years to come.  The DOD CIO\u2019s adoption of a similar framework to monitor the  implementation of recommendations from the 2015 NC3 report has also  set up a structure to track and evaluate progress. The responsible military  services and DOD components\u2019 use of these structures should aid them  in assessing their efforts, including providing means to reassess and re- evaluate individual efforts and their relationship to the health of the  defense nuclear enterprise as a whole. The efforts the department has  taken and has under way should improve senior leaders\u2019 visibility into  these issues and better position them to ensure that progress continues  to be made, underlying problems are addressed, and risks mitigated or  accepted after considering the predictable and desirable results.  However, for these changes to be effective, the department must clearly  articulate the roles and responsibilities for a comprehensive oversight  structure. Unless DOD is able to align the roles and responsibilities of the  many entities now charged with oversight functions, the department\u2019s  leadership may not be in a position to be informed of issues affecting the  nuclear enterprise or the NC3 enterprise and may be unable to make  effective resourcing decisions.
