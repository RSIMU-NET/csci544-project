Over a major portion of the nation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation operate hydroelectric power plants at federal water projects to produce energy, and the Department of Energy\u2019s five power marketing administrations market the electricity generated.Concerned about the maintenance and repair of the power plants operated by the Corps in the Southeast, you asked us to examine the extent to which (1) these power plants are experiencing outages and (2) the current planning and budgeting processes allow the Corps to perform timely and effective repairs and rehabilitations of these plants. Separately, we will also report in the next several months on the accounting and ratemaking practices of the power marketing administrations.", "In our review, we focused on 11 of the Corps\u2019 23 hydroelectric power plants that generate the power marketed by the Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern). These 11 plants provided about 71 percent of Southeastern\u2019s revenues in fiscal year 1995. We also performed more detailed case-study analyses of 2 of the 11 plants that had experienced lengthy outages stemming from design and technical problems; the results of these case studies are presented in appendixes III and IV.", "In summary, Mr. Chairman, our principal points are the following:", "Federal hydroelectric power plants in the Southeast have experienced significant outages, ranging from a few days to several years in duration and degrading the reliability of the Corps\u2019 hydroelectric system. The availability of these plants to generate electricity declined from about 95 percent in 1987 to 87 percent in 1995\u2014a trend that is paralleled in the Corps\u2019 hydroelectric power plants nationwide. According to Corps officials, these outages occur because of the way the power plants are operated and because the plants are aging. Also, these officials said, a few of the plants suffer problems with the way the equipment is designed and installed. As a result of these outages, Southeastern has lost revenues and raised the wholesale electric rates it charges its customers.", "Although the Corps recognizes that long-term, comprehensive planning and budgeting systems are needed to identify and fund key repairs and rehabilitations at its hydroelectric power plants, especially in the current environment of static or declining budgets, its funding decisions are not based on such systems. The Corps gives priority to routine, ongoing maintenance. When the power plants experience unplanned outages, the Corps frequently performs repairs that are reactive and short-term. For the extensive repairs and rehabilitations that eventually become essential, the Corps\u2019 budgeting process requires extensive justifications that can take a year or longer to complete. The Corps has taken some actions to address its planning and budgeting needs, but these measures are still ongoing. Finally, although Southeastern markets all of the power generated by the Corps projects we examined, the Corps does not consult with Southeastern for planning and budgeting purposes at the corporate level. At the divisional level in Atlanta, the Corps meets with Southeastern and power customers to discuss planned capital improvements and scheduled maintenance. Because the Corps is in the process of addressing its planning and budgeting requirements, we are not making recommendations at this time for the Corps to improve its planning and budgeting systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As the nation\u2019s largest supplier of hydroelectric power, the Corps generates about 25 percent of all the hydroelectric power in the United States.

The total capital investment in these facilities over the years has exceeded $7.9 billion.", "Southeastern markets power for 23 hydroelectric power plants owned and operated by the Corps to 294 wholesale customers in all or parts of 10 southeastern states and Illinois. Southeastern also coordinates with the Corps on the availability of the power to be generated by the Corps\u2019 plants. Unlike other power marketing administrations, Southeastern owns no transmission assets. Regional public and investor-owned utilities transmit the power to Southeastern\u2019s wholesale customers.", "The Corps and Southeastern receive congressional appropriations through the Department of Defense - Civil account and the Department of Energy, respectively, to finance their operations. In fiscal year 1996, the Corps received appropriations for its civil works activities totaling about $3.2 billion. Southeastern is responsible for repaying, with interest, its appropriations as well as the portion of the Corps\u2019 construction and operation and maintenance appropriations that are allocated to power.", "Repairs to and maintenance of the power plants are funded from the Corps\u2019 \u201cconstruction, general\u201d account or \u201coperations and maintenance, general\u201d account, depending on their scope.

The Department of the Army\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Civil Works and the Office of Management and Budget then examine and approve or disapprove the requests for funding for the individual projects. Funds from the \u201coperation and maintenance, general\u201d account are used for routine repairs and maintenance and for emergency repairs of hydroelectric and other facilities.", "The 11 power plants that we examined account for about 63 percent of Southeastern\u2019s generating capacity. These hydroelectric power plants, located on six river systems, range in generating capacity from 30 to 500 MW."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outages at Plants in the Southeast Have Reduced System\u2019s Reliability", "paragraphs": ["The Corps\u2019 hydroelectric power plants in the Southeast have experienced lengthy outages, resulting in declines in reliability and availability. For example, from 1987 to 1995 the availability of the plants in the Corps\u2019 South Atlantic Division dropped from 95.4 percent to 87.2 percent. Nationwide, during this same period, the availability of the Corps\u2019 hydroelectric power plants dropped from 92.9 percent to 87.9 percent (see app. V). According to Corps officials, the outages have occurred because of the ways in which the units are operated and because they are aging. In a few cases, Corps officials said, the units were also poorly designed and installed. According to Southeastern officials, the outages contributed to revenue losses for Southeastern and led to increases in its wholesale electric rates.", "From 1986 through 1995, all 11 of the power plants we examined experienced forced and/or scheduled outages, ranging from 30 days to over 3 years. Thirty-seven of the 43 units at these 11 power plants experienced at least one outage (see app. VI), and several units experienced outages simultaneously (see app. VII). For example, from January through March 1993, eight units at the Allatoona, Carters, Hartwell, Robert F. Henry, Millers Ferry, J. Strom Thurmond, and Walter F. George power plants, representing about 395 MW of capacity (or 13 percent of the capacity available to Southeastern from the Corps\u2019 facilities), were out of service at the same time.", "Many of the Corps\u2019 hydroelectric power plants in the Southeast are aging. The average age is about 30 years, and four have been in service for over 35 years. According to Southeastern officials and studies by the Corps, key components of the hydroelectric units are designed to last about 35 years and can be expected to need repair or replacement. However, according to the Corps, the need to repair or replace a component is based not solely on age, but also on test results and operational performance. For example, in 1984 the responsible Corps district office requested approval to perform a scheduled repair of a generator component at Allatoona\u2014the oldest of the power plants that we examined, which has been in service since 1949. The generator component had reached 35 years\u2014the anticipated end of its useful life\u2014and the unit\u2019s performance had declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s, after a failure in 1967. Corps headquarters did not approve the request because it did not believe that the district had submitted adequate justification. After the unit failed again in 1990, the Corps continued to operate the unit by bypassing the damaged component. In 1991, the Corps\u2019 district office again requested approval to repair the affected generator as well as another unit of similar age. Both units were repaired in 1993 and 1994, at a cost of about $8 million.", "Also, according to Corps officials, some units are poorly designed by the manufacturer and not properly installed by the contractor, and other units are adversely affected by the way in which they are operated. For instance, the Jim Woodruff power plant has experienced operational problems because its turbines are poorly designed. Specifically, the turbines, intended to function under conditions of changing water flow, experienced severe vibrations and had to be welded in place, leading to decreased efficiency in the power plant when water conditions changed (see app. IV). In addition, according to Corps officials, the conventional hydroelectric generating units at Carters, which are used to start the pumpback units, were not designed to consistently handle startups. Operating the conventional units for startups over the years damaged the insulation in the generators, causing the units to fail. According to a Corps report on the rehabilitation of the Hartwell power plant, Hartwell\u2019s turbines are significantly oversized in comparison with the generators. According to the Corps\u2019 analysis, with the larger turbines and thus greater horsepower available, the generators failed because they were consistently operated at 125 percent of their rated capacity. Southeastern officials added that, in their view, the units failed because they were 30 years old and thus approaching the end of their useful lives. Also, according to Corps officials, four units at the Robert F. Henry power plant required major repairs within 6 years of beginning operation because major components of the generators were not properly manufactured and installed. The components became loose during operations, causing severe vibrations and deterioration of the generators\u2019 insulation.", "When hydroelectric power plants experience unexpected outages at the same time and/or these outages are extended, utilities generally have to purchase replacement power at higher prices. For example, from 1990 through early 1992, two or more of the four units at the Carters power plant were out of service at the same time for periods ranging from about 3 months to almost 1 year. An official of Southeastern estimated that Southeastern\u2019s utility customers purchased replacement electricity costing about $15 million more than they would have paid for electricity marketed by Southeastern.", "Extended outages, Southeastern officials estimate, have resulted in lost revenues of about $13 million to Southeastern since fiscal year 1986. The impact was most acute when units at the Carters power plant were out of service. Moreover, according to Southeastern officials, because of the unplanned outages, a severe drought in the late 1980s, and increases in operation and maintenance costs, Southeastern increased its wholesale power rates. For example, customers on the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina system paid 22 percent more in 1990 than they had in the previous year. According to Southeastern, reductions in the amount of hydroelectric power available because of the drought, combined with the inefficient operation of the Jim Woodruff project, contributed to an increase in the wholesale rates charged to customers of the Jim Woodruff system of nearly 100 percent, phased in from January 1991 to September 1993."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps\u2019 Capital Planning and Budgeting Processes Do Not Facilitate Timely and Effective Repairs", "paragraphs": ["Although the Corps recognizes that long-term, comprehensive planning and budgeting systems are needed to identify and fund key repair and rehabilitation projects, especially in the current environment of static or declining budgets, its funding decisions for the power plants are not based on such systems.

According to a report prepared by the Corps\u2019 Institute for Water Resources, because of the need to address the federal budget deficit, this funding trend is expected to continue. In such a budget environment, finding adequate funding to properly maintain, rehabilitate, and repair the aging hydroelectric power plants will be increasingly difficult.", "Furthermore, the capital investment to maintain and repair the Corps\u2019 power plants is expected to increase by about $1 billion. For example, the Corps stated that from 1993 through 2004, it would spend about $410.3 million to rehabilitate hydroelectric units at eight power plants nationwide. Moreover, the Corps projected that it would need to spend $558 million through the year 2004 to repair and rehabilitate other hydroelectric power plants.", "The need to spend more to maintain and repair the Corps\u2019 aging hydroelectric power plants will compete with the need to maintain and repair other Corps facilities, such as those related to commercial navigation, flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and the restoration and protection of environmental resources (including fish and wildlife habitat). For example, with its budget submissions to the Congress, the Corps includes a \u201ccapabilities list\u201d that identifies additional funds for necessary repairs and rehabilitations for the power plants, as well as for other purposes\u2014such as dredging, recreation, and navigation\u2014not included in the initial target budget request. For the fiscal year 1996 budget proposal, the list contained repair and rehabilitation projects totaling $72 million\u2014including $8 million for hydroelectric power plants. However, the list does not rank the proposed repair and rehabilitation projects by importance or need.", "Moreover, according to Southeastern\u2019s Administrator, although Southeastern markets the power generated at the Corps\u2019 power plants, the Corps does not consult Southeastern at the corporate level for budgeting and planning purposes. However, according to Corps and Southeastern officials, the Corps\u2019 South Atlantic Division consults with Southeastern in preparing major rehabilitation proposals and in long- and medium-range planning for maintenance. Moreover, according to Corps and Southeastern officials, the Corps meets with a group of Southeastern\u2019s wholesale customers and with Southeastern at least twice a year to discuss scheduled maintenance and capital projects planned for the next 10 years. According to Southeastern officials, this group is not an advisory group on capital planning and budgetary matters; it only meets to share information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Priority Is Given to Routine, Ongoing Maintenance Work, and Gaining Approvals for Extensive Repairs Is Often a Lengthy Process", "paragraphs": ["The Corps gives priority to routine, ongoing work, such as the operation of power plants and recreation facilities, or maintenance work that is needed to keep the projects operating through the fiscal year. Nonroutine work or work that can be deferred to the next year has been given lower funding priority. After the Office of Management and Budget informs Corps headquarters of the Corps\u2019 budget ceiling, headquarters sets budget targets for the Corps\u2019 divisions, which in turn set budget targets for the Corps\u2019 districts. The districts decide how to allocate the amounts to various projects within the funding levels established annually by Corps headquarters. The baseline level of funding represents the annual fixed, nondiscretionary costs required to operate and maintain the projects. When major repairs are needed, the Corps must follow a system of approvals and justifications to comply with budgeting procedures and to explain the repairs to such parties as the Department of the Army\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Civil Works and the Office of Management and Budget. Satisfying these requirements delays funding the expensive repairs and rehabilitations needed to keep the hydroelectric system operating effectively. Because of these approvals and justifications, after the need to repair or rehabilitate a plant is identified at the project or district level, it has taken from about 10 months to almost 5 years to begin the needed repairs.", "Given the emphasis on routine and ongoing maintenance and repair work and the lengthy justification processes that must be followed for extensive repairs when units break down unexpectedly, the Corps frequently performs repairs that are short-term and reactive. However, such actions only postpone the need to make more extensive repairs. For example, after a failure of the Hartwell power plant\u2019s unit 1 in November 1989, the Corps bypassed the damaged part and brought the unit back into service at a reduced operating capacity. Three months later, the unit was taken out of service for 59 days while a contractor replaced the damaged part. Then, in May 1990, the same kind of problem put unit 2 out of service for 54 days. The Corps repaired the unit, but it failed again in January 1992. The Corps bypassed the damaged part and returned the unit to service. The unit continues to operate at a reduced capacity, along with the other three units. As a result of these reductions, Southeastern has lost about 40 MW of capacity. The Corps estimates that it will need about $17.7 million to repair the four units.", "Before extensive and costly repairs or rehabilitation can begin, in order to justify capital investments, the relevant field location must perform a lengthy study to document the problem. The study can take 18 months to complete, and then another year or longer may be needed for the proposal to clear the review levels within the Corps and receive funding. According to a Corps official, the process is lengthy because (1) the documentation and analysis submitted by field staff do not always satisfy the requirements of Corps headquarters and (2) lengthy examinations and reexaminations of a proposal are required within the field structure, headquarters, the Department of the Army\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, and the Office of Management and Budget. A Corps headquarters official explained that this lengthy analysis and documentation process is applied even if a hydroelectric unit is out of service and needs immediate repair because the Corps needs to show the need for costly capital investments in hydroelectric power plants to the Department of the Army\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Civil Works and the Office of Management and Budget.", "For example, at the three-unit Millers Ferry power plant, one unit failed in 1987 because the insulation in the unit\u2019s generator had deteriorated. The unit was repaired and returned to service within 30 days. After a second unit failed in 1992 for the same reason, the responsible district office requested approval from the division in 1993 to repair all three units. The district office believed that all three units suffered from the same problems and would need repairs in the future. However, Corps headquarters interceded and requested additional analysis and justification to support repairing all three units. During 1993 to 1995, while the district office complied with certain requests from Corps headquarters and completed design specifications and the request for proposal, the remaining two units also failed. These units were temporarily repaired and returned to service but operated at a reduced capacity. As a result, Southeastern lost about 31 MW of capacity. More extensive repairs, according to Corps officials, will not be completed until 1998, at an estimated cost of $7 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps Has Taken Some Actions to Address Planning and Budgeting Needs", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has recognized that when budgetary resources are relatively scarce, it cannot continue to fund all of the activities it performed in the past, such as operating some recreation sites. Corps officials have also said that in times of budget shortfalls, it becomes increasingly important to implement long-term, systematic, and comprehensive capital planning and budgeting systems. Such systems allow agencies to anticipate projects that need to be funded in the future and to consider the tradeoffs that are inherent in assigning funding to different purposes. Given that obtaining additional funds for hydroelectric investments will be difficult, the Corps began, in the early and mid-1990s, to take steps to improve its corporate planning and budgeting processes. However, these measures are still ongoing.", "The Corps commissioned a study by its Institute for Water Resources on its capital planning process for hydroelectric power plants. In its 1994 working draft report, the Institute concluded that in light of the power plants\u2019 aging and the continued prospects for budget constraints, the Corps should develop a 10-year plan for future capital investments for its hydroelectric program and develop, in coordination with the power marketing administrations and their customers, procedures for ranking hydroelectric investment needs on the basis of such criteria as economic, environmental, and engineering factors. According to a Corps headquarters official, in response to these recommendations, Corps headquarters directed all of its field locations, including those in the Southeast, to compile lists of proposed, nonroutine hydroelectric capital improvement projects that had to be accomplished within 10 years. Although these lists were compiled on a national level during fiscal years 1993 and 1994, no lists were compiled in fiscal year 1995. The fiscal year 1994 list shows a projected need through 2004 of over $900 million to repair and rehabilitate the Corps\u2019 75 hydroelectric power plants nationwide. However, the criteria for ranking the proposed repair and rehabilitation projects have not been established. The responsible Corps headquarters official explained that in fiscal year 1995, the effort was suspended because of higher priorities. He said he intends to direct the field locations to undertake the effort again during the summer of 1996, in time to be considered for the fiscal year 1998 budget. Currently, Corps headquarters does not use this list for the agency\u2019s annual budget process but rather encourages its use at the district level for long-range planning. Corps officials said they recognize the need to pursue formal use of the list for planning and budgeting nationwide.", "In addition, according to a Corps official, the Corps recognized in the early 1990s that the outages at its power plants were reducing the reliability of its hydroelectric power system. Consequently, from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1997, the Corps requested appropriations for major rehabilitations of eight hydroelectric plants, four of which are in the Southeast. In March 1996, the Corps estimated that from 1993 through 2004, it would spend about $410 million to rehabilitate these eight power plants. According to the Corps, as of the end of fiscal year 1996, the Corps had obtained appropriations of about $22 million for this purpose.", "We provided a draft of this statement to and discussed its contents with Corps officials, including the Chief, Operations, Construction and Readiness (headquarters); Hydropower Coordinator (headquarters); Chief, Construction and Operations Division (South Atlantic Division); and the Chief, Hydropower Operations (South Atlantic Division). We also discussed the statement and its contents with Southeastern officials, including the Administrator; Assistant Administrator for Finance and Marketing; and the Chief, Operations. These officials generally agreed with the facts presented in our statement and said that we had fairly represented the condition of the federal hydroelectric power plants in the Southeast. Corps officials agreed that historically the agency\u2019s planning and budgeting systems did not expedite planning and budgeting for multiple-year capital improvement projects for the Corps\u2019 hydroelectric power plants. Corps officials said, however, that they have taken steps to improve their planning and budgeting systems for these plants. Corps and Southeastern officials also discussed efforts under way within the Corps\u2019 South Atlantic Division to consult with Southeastern and with power customers about the maintenance of the hydroelectric power plants in the region. These officials also suggested several technical revisions to our statement, which we have incorporated as appropriate. We conducted our review from January through June 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "This concludes our prepared statement.

In unit 2, cracks in the turbine blades were repaired in 1974; the Corps made additional repairs to the unit from July 1986 through February 1987, for a 207-day outage, and again in December 1988, for a 5-day outage. In unit 3, the Corps discovered and repaired cracks in the turbine blades in 1974 and 1975; additional repairs were made in April 1987, for a 59-day outage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plant\u2019s Performance and Costs Have Been Affected, Prompting Complaints From Southeastern", "paragraphs": ["Because of continuing operational problems, the Corps welded the plant\u2019s turbine blades into a fixed position in 1988. This action improved the availability of the plant, but reduced the plant\u2019s efficiency, because fixed turbine blades cannot be adjusted to take advantage of the varying release rates necessary to maintain adequate water depths for navigation. Loss of efficiency reduces the amount of energy that can be produced at the power plant, affecting its ability to fulfill contracts for power generation. The Corps estimated that the plant\u2019s average annual output has been reduced by about 17 percent, or over 36 million kilowatt-hours per year, because of the welding of the blades into a fixed position.", "In addition, the costs of operating and maintaining the plant have increased over the years. According to the Corps, these increases are attributable to major maintenance work, the design and specifications for the major rehabilitation, and the addition of on-site operators. Five maintenance personnel are directly assigned to the plant, and additional personnel are brought in from other projects if the maintenance is extensive.", "The operational problems at Woodruff prompted Southeastern to complain to the Corps about a loss of revenue. In a letter to the Corps dated September 19, 1990, Southeastern expressed concerns about the plant\u2019s operations, stating that the plant has not been able to operate at its fullest, resulting in reduced output and a loss in revenue. According to Southeastern, the Corps had to spill water because of the need to decrease the vibrations that occurred as the units operated. Southeastern added that the loss to its customers was even greater because the customers must replace the missing power by purchasing power from another utility at a higher rate. The letter further stated that the plant\u2019s inefficient operation and the resulting loss in revenue had a significantly negative impact on the repayment schedule for the project and had caused Southeastern to seek a substantial increase in the power rates charged to its customers. According to Southeastern, the combined effects of the plant\u2019s inefficient operation and the droughts of the late 1980s caused it to raise its wholesale customer rates on the Jim Woodruff system by nearly 100 percent from 1991 to 1993."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Corps Is Planning to Rehabilitate the Plant", "paragraphs": ["Because of the plant\u2019s increasing operations and maintenance costs and declining efficiency, the Corps in 1991 started a study for a major rehabilitation of Woodruff. The study, completed in 1993, recommended replacing the three turbines, rehabilitating the three generators, and replacing several peripheral electrical components, most notably the transformers, to restore the plant\u2019s lost reliability and efficiency.", "According to the Corps, the field office submitted the major rehabilitation report to Corps headquarters in March 1992 for fiscal year 1994 funding. Corps headquarters rejected the report in May 1992. In March 1993, the field resubmitted the report to headquarters for fiscal year 1995 funding, and headquarters approved it in November 1993. However, the major rehabilitation plan, included in the Corps\u2019 fiscal year 1995 budget request, was rejected by the Office of Management and Budget because the President\u2019s fiscal year 1995 budget did not include any money for \u201cnew starts.\u201d In 1994, the Corps included the plan as part of its fiscal year 1996 budget, and it was approved by the Office of Management and Budget in December 1994. In November 1995, the Congress made funds available to the Corps to rehabilitate the plant. Thus, it took the Corps about 2 years to prepare and approve the rehabilitation study and another 2 years to get congressional approval for the funding. It is estimated that the rehabilitation will be completed in 2001\u2014about 10 years after the beginning of the study.

From the Corps\u2019 headquarters and South Atlantic Division, we obtained operating statistics (i.e., nameplate capacity) and information on the plants\u2019 reliability and availability. We also obtained data on plant outages from 1986 through 1995. We focused on outages of 30 days or longer in order to avoid less important outages and discussed maintenance procedures with Corps and Southeastern officials.

These 11 plants on the combined Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina and Jim Woodruff systemshave a total generator nameplate capacity of 1,960 MW (about 63 percent of the generating capacity from which Southeastern markets power) and account for 71 percent of Southeastern\u2019s power revenues.", "Corps and Southeastern officials agreed that these plants were generally representative in age and operating condition of the plants from which Southeastern markets power. For example, we selected power plants ranging in age from relatively new (11 years) to relatively old (47 years) and ranging in capacity from relatively small (30 MW) to relatively large (500 MW).", "From the 11 plants, we selected Millers Ferry and Jim Woodruff for more detailed case-study analysis. Although all 11 power plants we reviewed experienced outages from 1986 through 1995, these two plants had experienced lengthy outages stemming from problems in their design and the installation of their equipment.", "To determine whether the current planning and budgeting processes allow the Corps to perform timely and effective repairs and rehabilitations of its hydroelectric power plants, we obtained and reviewed Corps budget data from the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and South Atlantic Division. We analyzed trends in the availability of appropriated funds from fiscal years 1986 through 1996, and we adjusted the funds for inflation by applying the gross domestic product deflators for the appropriate years. We attempted to determine the exact amounts of funds requested, appropriated, and spent for the operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair of the 11 Corps hydroelectric power plants in our study from fiscal years 1986 through 1996.
