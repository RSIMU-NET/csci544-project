Capabilities for the new system include secure transport of voice and data, data storage, and e-mail, at a cost of about $38 billion through fiscal year 2024. In March 2011, GAO reported that the approach for acquiring NGEN was not grounded in a reliable analysis of alternatives, the execution of NGEN was not based on a reliable schedule, and acquisition decisions were not always performance- and risk-based. GAO recommended that Defense, among other things, reconsider its approach. The department has not yet fully implemented GAO\u0092s recommendations but revised its approach to include acquiring certain NGEN services simultaneously instead of staggering their implementation.", "GAO was asked to review the revised approach to determine (1) the extent to which DON\u0092s selected approach to acquire NGEN is the most cost effective and (2) the current status of and plans for acquiring NGEN. To do this, GAO reviewed analyses supporting the cost effectiveness of the acquisition approach, the program\u0092s revised acquisition strategy, integrated master schedule, key milestone decisions, and other relevant documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the Department of the Navy (DON) has revised its acquisition approach for its new network system, the Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), it still has not shown that it has selected the most cost-effective approach for acquiring NGEN capabilities. Cost effectiveness is shown by comparing life-cycle costs and quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits among alternatives, which can be accomplished by conducting a thorough analysis of alternatives. GAO previously identified weaknesses with the NGEN analysis of alternatives related to cost estimates and analysis of operational effectiveness and made associated recommendations. However, DON did not revisit the analysis of alternatives to address the weaknesses previously identified, nor did it conduct any other analysis that would show whether its revised approach is the most cost effective. For example, while DON developed a draft economic analysis in February 2012, the analysis assessed only the status quo and revised approach, and not other alternatives. As a result, GAO remains concerned with the analysis measuring NGEN cost effectiveness and DON does not know whether its revised approach for acquiring NGEN is the most cost effective.", "Even though DON lacks assurance that it is pursuing the most cost-effective approach to acquiring NGEN capabilities, it has moved forward with implementing its revised approach. For example, the agency has completed activities to support the acquisition and transition to NGEN, prepared plans and analyses required for program initiation, and conducted oversight reviews to support the release of the request for proposals for transport and enterprise services (secure data and e-mail services, among other things). However, the program\u0092s schedule for acquiring NGEN capabilities has been delayed, thus making it more likely that DON will not be able to fully transition by the end of the continuity of services contract in April 2014. For example, the release of the request for proposals was delayed, and upcoming milestones, such as contract award and program initiation, have slipped (see table for major delays). Program officials attributed the delays to the need for additional planning and to revisions to the request for proposals. Compounding this situation is that identified risks are not being adequately mitigated. For example, not all mitigation plans are comprehensive because they do not always include all the elements of an effective plan (e.g., identification of resources needed) nor do they always contain the current status of the mitigation actions. According to program officials, weaknesses in these mitigation plans were due, in part, to the lack of a priority in establishing and maintaining comprehensive and current mitigation plans. As a result, the program faces an increased probability that transition from its existing system to NGEN will face further delays and cost overruns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that Defense develop comprehensive risk mitigation plans for program-wide risks.

The defense  acquisition system consists of five key program life-cycle phases and  three related milestone decision points: (1) materiel solution analysis, (2)  technology development (milestone A held prior to entering this phase),  (3) engineering and manufacturing development (milestone B held prior to  entering this phase), (4) production and deployment (milestone C held  prior to entering this phase), and (5) operations and support.

All of the alternatives were  assumed to deliver the same NMCI capabilities and the technology  considered for each alternative was assumed to be substantially the  same. As a result, DON officials stated that the AOA was not intended to  be a traditional analysis to determine a system solution, but rather was an  analysis of alternative acquisition approaches. The primary differences  among the alternatives related to how NGEN was to be acquired,  managed, and operated. Specifically, the alternatives varied in terms of  the number of contracts to be awarded and in the scope of government  versus contractor responsibilities. Table 2 provides a description and  comparison of each alternative that was examined in the AOA.", "However, we reported that the approach pursued by DON did not match  any of the alternatives assessed in the AOA, and it was riskier and  potentially costlier than the alternatives assessed because it included a  higher number of contractual relationships. In particular, the chosen  approach was one that included more contracts, a different segmentation  scheme, and a different transition timeline than any of the alternatives  that had been assessed. We also reported that DON\u2019s November 2009  risk-adjusted preliminary program life-cycle cost estimate for the  approach for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 showed that this approach  would cost at least an estimated $4.7 billion more than the alternatives  assessed in the AOA. Moreover, DON had not analyzed the impact of  these differences in terms of how they compared to the original  alternatives. Further, we identified key weaknesses in the cost estimates  and operational effectiveness analysis included in the NGEN AOA.  Specifically, we reported that, while the AOA cost estimates were  substantially well documented, they were not substantially accurate, and  they were neither comprehensive nor credible. Additionally, we reported  that, while the AOA identified program capabilities and goals, it did not  sufficiently assess the alternatives\u2019 ability to satisfy the capabilities and  goals.", "Given our findings, we recommended that Defense reconsider the  acquisition approach based on a meaningful analysis of all viable  alternative acquisition approaches. The department did not fully concur  with our recommendation and stated that it had concluded that DON\u2019s  AOA was sufficient and that the analysis had been approved by the Office  of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation.  The department added that it would complete an economic analysis for  milestone C, which would include a follow-on independent cost estimate  and an updated determination of the most cost-effective solution.  However, in response, we pointed out that DON planned to assess only  the status quo and the current approach in the economic analysis, not  other alternatives such as those that had been included in the AOA, and  we maintained that without a meaningful analysis of alternatives, the  department would be unable to determine the most cost-effective  solution.", "We also reported that DON\u2019s schedule for NGEN did not adequately  satisfy key schedule estimating best practices by, for example,  establishing the critical path (the sequence of activities that, if delayed,  impacts the planned completion date of the project) and assigning  resources to all work activities. Because it did not satisfy these practices,  the schedule did not provide a reliable basis for program execution.  According to program officials, schedule estimating had been constrained  by staffing limitations. However, these weaknesses contributed to delays  in the completion of NGEN events and milestones, including multiple  major acquisition reviews and program plans. Accordingly, we  recommended that Defense ensure that the NGEN schedule substantially  reflect key schedule estimating practices.

In particular, senior executives had  approved the program\u2019s continuing progress in the face of known  performance shortfalls and risks. For example, in November 2009, the  program was approved at a key acquisition review despite the lack of  defined requirements, which officials recognized as a risk that would  impact the completion of other key documents, such as the test plan.  According to DON officials, the decision to proceed was based on their  view that they had sufficiently mitigated known risks and issues.

Specifically, in April 2012, the Office of the Secretary of  Defense approved NGEN acquisition approach changes that were  intended to support program executability and reduce program risk for  USN. Like the original approach, the revised approach emphasized  segmentation of the network, with the same five segments that had been  defined in the previous acquisition approach: the two primary segments  are enterprise services and transport services and the remaining three  segments are end user hardware; enterprise software licenses; and  verification, validation, and reporting (see table 3 for details on these  segments). Further, each segment is expected to be delivered by either a  contractor or government provider, with multiple competitive awards.  However, DON made changes to how certain NGEN segments are to be  acquired and transitioned. For example, it plans to solicit transport and  enterprise services using a single request for proposals and has said it  may award a combined contract for both segments; in addition, it plans to  transition both segments to the new provider(s) simultaneously instead of  staggering their implementation. According to DON officials, these  changes were made primarily because the transport and enterprise  services segments were integrally related under NMCI, so acquiring them  simultaneously would potentially reduce labor costs and administrative  burden, and reduce risk. Another change is that USN is expected to  acquire end user hardware as a service from the enterprise services  contractor rather than purchase the equipment and provide it as  government-furnished property to the contractor. According to program  officials, this change was made to mitigate a critical NGEN risk that the  program may not be fully funded if end user hardware must be purchased  in fiscal year 2014 and, in the long term, procuring the end user hardware  as a service is not more expensive than government-purchased  equipment. As an additional change to the acquisition approach, USN is  no longer expected to award a contract for the verification, validation, and  reporting segment because it now has an internal entity\u2014the Tenth Fleet  Cyber Command\u2014that is to perform this function.

For example, DON examined whether it  should release one request for proposals instead of two for the transport  and enterprise services segments. Additionally, USN examined whether it  should acquire existing end user hardware owned by the incumbent and  provide it to the enterprise services contractor as government-furnished  property or acquire the end user hardware from the enterprise services  contractor as a service. However, because these analyses focus on  specific changes, they do not provide an understanding of whether DON\u2019s  overall acquisition approach is the most cost effective.

Additionally, the Marine Corps assumed control of  the NMCI infrastructure currently supporting its operations and  awarded the Marine Corps Common Hardware Suite contract to  procure NGEN end user hardware in May 2012. Also in May 2012,  DON reached agreement on the first of 12 planned enterprise  software license agreements. Further, the department released NGEN  documents and technical data to industry to ensure all competitors  have full access to NMCI technical data and to reduce the potential for  a protest. DON also released multiple requests for information and  solicited input from industry on a draft request for proposals in order to  better understand the capabilities of the current IT marketplace with  respect to NGEN requirements.

Additionally, the  Naval Center for Cost Analysis developed the service cost position,  which was based on the reconciliation of a completed program life- cycle cost estimate and an independent cost estimate. DON also  approved the systems engineering plan and the test and evaluation  master plan, which describes the overall test and evaluation strategy  for how the network\u2019s capabilities will be assessed.

Since our prior report, DON has  conducted two gate reviews and an Office of the Secretary of  Defense-level decision review to support the release of the request for  proposals for transport and enterprise services. In particular, in  October 2011, it completed an acquisition gate review to endorse the  NGEN increment 1 capability production document. Subsequently,  DON conducted a second NGEN acquisition gate review in January  2012 to approve the transport and enterprise services request for  proposals, during which it reviewed the current status and health of  the program including the key activities remaining to release the  request for proposals. Subsequently, in April 2012, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, Milestone Decision Authority, reviewed the  NGEN program to approve the updated acquisition strategy and  authorize the release of the transport and enterprise services request  for proposals.", "While DON has made progress on these efforts to acquire and transition  to NGEN, key program activities remain to be completed. For example,  DON will need to demonstrate that it is prepared to execute control and  governance of the network through four government readiness reviews;  baseline the program by establishing cost, schedule, and performance  thresholds and objectives; award the primary NGEN contract(s); and  transition to the new NGEN provider(s). Table 4 lists planned completion  dates for these remaining key activities.", "However, a number of acquisition activities are facing schedule delays,  even though the incumbent is scheduled to end service delivery in April  2014. Specifically, while the request for proposals for transport and  enterprise services was issued, as we previously stated, it was delayed  by 17 months and 9 months, respectively, resulting in current delays in  NGEN program milestones, including the dates for conducting the  milestone C review and awarding the contract(s) for transport and  enterprise services. Additionally, the schedule for assessing USN\u2019s  readiness to transition (i.e., government readiness reviews) is tied to  milestone C review and contract award, meaning that they are expected  to occur a certain number of days before or after their associated event;  thus, the government readiness reviews would also be impacted by  delays in milestone C and contract award. Moreover, these delays have  compressed the timeline for and increased the risks associated with  transitioning to the new network before the end of the continuity of  services contract. For example, the date for USN\u2019s initial transition from  the current service provider to the new service provider(s) has slipped by  5 months and final transition is scheduled for March 2014, thus  compressing the period for shutting down network services with the  incumbent and transitioning them to the new NGEN contractor(s) by  about 5 months. Further, USN has identified a number of factors that  could impact transition and increase the risk that NGEN may not be  completed on time and may experience cost overruns, such as proposals  not meeting NGEN requirements and lack of coordination among  contractors and the government in operating the network.", "Program officials attributed these schedule delays to the department\u2019s  need to conduct more detailed planning before issuing the transport and  enterprise services request for proposals and for addressing industry  comments on the draft request for proposals to reduce the potential of a  bid protest.

In  particular, effective plans for risk mitigation should be developed for the  most important risks to the project, which includes a period of  performance, identification of resources needed, and responsible parties.

Specifically, the reported mitigation strategies did  not fully identify the resources needed, such as the staff and funds, nor  fully identify organizations that are responsible and accountable for  accomplishing risk mitigation activities. Additionally, while five of the  seven mitigation plans had activities with planned completion dates, most  did not include an estimated start date; thus, the plans did not fully define  the period of performance to ensure that the mitigation activities are being  implemented appropriately. Moreover, three of the seven plans did not  identify the status of activities for which completion dates had already  occurred.

However, the plan does not reflect whether this activity has been  completed or, otherwise discuss its status.", "Additionally, two of the seven plans did not fully reflect the current status  of the program. For example, to mitigate transition risks, DON officials  identified that the enterprise and transport services contract(s) must be  awarded no later than December 2012 in order to ensure continuous  network availability during the transition from the continuity of services  contract to the NGEN contract(s). However, the current mitigation plan  does not document this milestone or reflect the current status of the  program, which now plans to award the contract(s) in February 2013.", "Further, according to program documentation, a mitigation plan was  required and was being updated for the service offering descriptions risk;  however, according to other program documentation, the plan to mitigate  service offering descriptions is still under development, even though it has  been identified as a program risk since August 2011. According to  program officials, weaknesses in these mitigation plans were due, in part,  to the lack of a priority in establishing and maintaining comprehensive  and current plans.", "Several of the risks identified are significant to ensure that NGEN  transition occurs as planned and within the estimated costs. Therefore it  is essential to ensure that for a given risk, techniques and methods will be  invoked to avoid, reduce, and control the probability of occurrence."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Even though DON does not know whether it is pursuing the most cost- effective approach to acquiring NGEN capabilities, it has proceeded to  implement its revised acquisition approach, completed various plans and  analyses including the first official program life-cycle cost estimate, and  held oversight reviews to support the issuance of the request for  proposals for the two primary NGEN segments. While these steps have  been taken, DON faces delays in upcoming milestones, which have  resulted in a compressed transition timeline and increased risks  associated with transitioning to the new network before the end of the  continuity of services contract. Compounding this are weaknesses in  DON\u2019s risk mitigation efforts that could further impact schedule delays  and result in cost increases. Without a well-defined schedule, as we  previously reported, and adequate risk mitigation, DON cannot ensure  that needed NGEN capabilities will be in place in time to ensure that  services will continue to operate when the incumbent is scheduled to shut  down its services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen risk mitigation activities for the NGEN program, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Navy to develop comprehensive mitigation plans and strategies for  program-wide critical risks that identify the mitigation period of  performance, resources needed, and responsible parties, and that fully  reflect the current status of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense provided written comments on a draft of this  report, signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3 and  Cyber), and reprinted in appendix II.

These included the draft economic analysis and  analyses to support specific acquisition approach changes. We assessed  DON\u2019s supporting analyses against relevant Department of Defense  guidance and our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. In this regard,  we evaluated the purpose and use of these analyses in examining viable  alternatives to inform acquisition decision making on the most cost- effective solution. We also interviewed cognizant DON program officials  and Office of the Secretary of Defense Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation officials about the use of these analyses in acquisition decision  making.", "To determine the current status of and plans for acquiring NGEN, we  analyzed the revised NGEN acquisition strategy, integrated master  schedule, program performance assessments, risk reports, transport and  enterprise services request for proposals, planned system requirements,  cost estimates, draft operational readiness plan, and executive acquisition  decision briefings and meeting minutes, among other things. We also  reviewed these documents to determine how the program had changed  since our prior review of NGEN. To assess the status of risk management for the NGEN program initiative, we compared the risk  management plans and supporting documentation against leading  practices, such as Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute\u2019s  Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration for Services,whether such practices had been specified in the plans. Further, we  interviewed relevant DON program officials and Office of the Secretary of  Defense Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation officials to clarify  information in documents we reviewed and to more fully understand the  program\u2019s progress to acquire NGEN. To assess the reliability of the data  that we used to support the findings in this report, we reviewed relevant  program documentation to substantiate evidence obtained through  interviews with agency officials.
