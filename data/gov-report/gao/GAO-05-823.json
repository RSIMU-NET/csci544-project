Although emissions generated from the Sempra and Intergen plants may contribute to various adverse health impacts in Imperial County, the extent of such impacts is unknown. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that emissions from these plants may increase asthma hospitalizations by less than one per year. However, DOE did not quantify any other asthma-related impacts, such as emergency room visits or increased use of medications, which, although less severe, are likely to occur more often. In addition, DOE did not determine whether increased emissions would cause other respiratory or cardiovascular problems and the impact of particulate matter on particularly susceptible populations. Finally, the potential health impacts associated with ozone could be greater than DOE estimated because some important data needed for modeling were not available. Existing laws and international agreements may not provide adequate mechanisms to address adverse health impacts resulting from power plant emissions. Policymakers could take some actions, such as requiring plants that seek to export electricity to the United States to use specified emission controls. While this action would have benefits, it would also have costs, such as possibly reducing energy supplies available to Southern California. Long-term policy options include the development of a binational pollution reduction program or a trust fund to provide grants and loans to support air quality improvement projects.

To address how emissions from  the Sempra and Intergen power plants compare to emissions from recently  permitted plants in California, we used data from emissions tests  conducted at the plants by third-party contractors. We did this because  Mexico does not require the plants to report actual emissions of pollutants  other than nitrogen oxides. We assessed the reliability of the data by (1)  reviewing documentation of test objectives and quality control procedures  provided by the third-party contractors who conducted the tests, (2)  talking with Sempra and Intergen officials to determine the scope and  generalizability of the tests, and (3) reviewing reports of actual NOX  emissions submitted to the Mexican government to verify consistency with  the test results. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. We also obtained the permissible emission  limits for comparable plants in California. Comparable plants were  selected by identifying all natural gas power plants of similar size and  specifications to the Sempra and Intergen plants that were permitted in  California between 2000 and 2004. Because all California power plants are  permitted on a case-by-case basis, emissions limits may vary with each  project. Therefore, we used the entire range of emission limits for the 23  plants that were identified during our selection process. To determine how  the emissions from the Sempra and Intergen power plants compared to  emissions from sources in Imperial County, we utilized the 2004 estimated  annual average emissions inventory for the county developed by the  California Air Resources Board, among other things. To address what  emissions standards the plants would be subject to if they were located in  Imperial County, we reviewed federal and California regulations for new  power plants, interviewed EPA, state, and Imperial County air quality  officials, and reviewed the emission limits and selected permitting  conditions for power plants located in California. To identify the potential  health impacts from plant emissions, we reviewed the health assessment  methodology DOE used in its environmental impact statement, reviewed  relevant studies, and met with health experts. To determine available  policy options, we reviewed the Clean Air Act; environmental and trade  agreements among the United States, Mexico, and Canada; and academic  research.

Fuel for the plants is provided by a 145-mile cross-border  natural gas pipeline built by Sempra Energy, which began operating in  September 2002.", "The Sempra plant, known as Termoel\u00e8ctrica de Mexicali, consists of one  natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power-generating unit with a total  capacity of 650 megawatts. In this type of plant, electricity is produced by  a combination of gas turbines and steam turbines. Heat from the gas  turbine exhaust, which would otherwise be released to the atmosphere  with exhaust gases, is captured and used by a heat recovery steam  generator to produce steam, which in turn is used by the steam turbine to  generate additional electricity. The Sempra plant operates with an export  permit from the Mexican government and produces electricity exclusively  for export to the United States. The facility is equipped with the latest  pollution control technologies, including selective catalytic reduction  systems to reduce NOX emissions and an oxidizing catalyst system to  reduce carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.", "The Intergen plant, which consists of two natural gas-fired combined-cycle  units (collectively known as the La Rosita Power Complex), has a total  capacity of 1,060 megawatts. The first unit provides two-thirds of its 750  megawatt capacity to Mexico, with the remaining one-third available for  export to the United States. The second unit has a generating capacity of  310 megawatts, all of which is designated for export to the U.S. market.  (See fig. 2.) Originally, only the second unit was designed to include a  selective catalytic reduction system, but as of April 7, 2005, all four of the  combustion turbines within the two units have been equipped with these  systems to control NOX emissions. ) to produce ordinary nitrogen and water  vapor. An oxidizing catalyst is similar in concept to catalytic converters used in  automobiles. The catalyst, normally coated with a metal, such as platinum, is used to  promote a chemical reaction with the oxygen present to convert carbon monoxide into  carbon dioxide and water vapor.", "Although no U.S. emissions requirements apply to these plants, Sempra  and Intergen required a presidential permit to construct and connect the  new transmission lines needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to export  electricity into the United States. Because of the similarities of the  proposals submitted by the companies, DOE decided to consider them  together in a single environmental assessment, required as part of the  permitting process. In December 2001, DOE completed the environmental  assessment and issued a finding of no significant impact and presidential  permits for both of the proposed projects. Following these decisions,  Sempra and Intergen constructed the transmission lines and began  commercial operations. However, as a result of subsequent litigation, on  July 8, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California  instructed DOE to prepare a more comprehensive environmental review,  which included an assessment of the health impacts from the power plants  as part of its analysis. DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement was issued  in final form in December 2004. DOE found that the proposed power  plants presented a low potential for environmental impacts and published  a record of decision in the Federal Register on April 25, 2005, authorizing  presidential permits to be granted for both transmission lines to the  respective power plants as presently designed. use of natural gas at the Sempra and Intergen facilities greatly reduces  sulfur dioxide emissions compared with other fuels such as coal or oil.

With the exception of one turbine, which will continue to operate  at a maximum NOX limit of 3.5 ppm, all other turbines are expected to emit  NOX at a level below 2.5 ppm. According to Intergen plant officials, the last  two turbines to be equipped with selective catalytic reduction systems  have been meeting these levels since the systems became operational in  March and April 2005, respectively. Data provided by plant officials, based  on continuous monitoring of all emissions from these turbines over a 1  week period, also indicate that both turbines are achieving the expected  NOX reductions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Annual Emissions from the Sempra and Intergen Plants Are Low Relative to Emissions from Sources in Imperial County", "paragraphs": ["One way to assess the environmental impact of emissions from power  plants is to examine the tons of pollutants they emit on an annual basis.  The third-party performance tests discussed above provide the best  available data to estimate annual emissions likely to occur during actual  operations at the Sempra and Intergen plants because the data are based  on observations of the actual equipment in operation. Other options for  estimating annual emissions from these plants include using (1) the  maximum allowable emissions levels for similar plants in California and  (2) the emissions estimates that DOE developed during its environmental  impact assessment of the Sempra and Intergen plants. Table 4 presents  annual emissions estimates based on each of these three alternative  operating assumptions.", "Under the first scenario, annual emissions levels were estimated using the  values determined by third-party contractors during turbine performance  tests at the Sempra and Intergen plants. For the two Intergen turbines that  did not have selective catalytic reduction systems installed when the  testing was conducted, we estimated annual NOX emissions using the  testing values recorded for the similar turbine that was operating with  such equipment. We did so because these two turbines are now equipped  with selective catalytic reduction systems and their future emissions are  likely to be similar to those from the turbine that was using this  technology during the tests. These estimates do not take into account  start-up and shutdown operations of the plant, which may contribute to  increased plant emissions for approximately 1 to 2 hours. However, the  total annual estimate is based on the conservative assumption that the  plants are operating at maximum emission levels, 24 hours a day, 365 days  a year. The actual operation of the plants, and the resulting emissions,  would be less than this because of scheduled maintenance, forced  outages, and varying electrical demand in California.", "The second estimates of annual emissions were based on maximum  allowable emissions determined during the permitting process for similar  California plants. These maximum allowable emissions are higher than the  estimates based on third-party testing data. California grants permits to  construct power plants on a case-by-case basis. As a condition of receiving  a permit, the state places limits on emissions of individual pollutants.  These limits are based on the use of best available control technology and  take into consideration energy, environmental, and economic impacts.  Under this estimating scenario, the annual estimates also account for short  term variations in emissions levels that may occur during start-up and  shutdown operations and are based on the conservative assumption that  the plants are operating at maximum emissions levels, 24 hours a day, and  365 days a year.", "Another way to examine the environmental impact of a power plant is to  evaluate the amount of pollution emitted per unit of electricity produced.  This calculation has been used within the energy industry to measure how  efficiently power plants produce electricity. As illustrated in table 6, the  Sempra and Intergen plants produce much lower emissions of NOX for  each megawatt of energy generated than do other power plants operating  in Imperial County and the border region of Baja California, Mexico. For  example, Sempra\u2019s estimated emission rate for NOX of .04 pounds per  megawatt of electricity is over 35 times lower than that rate at El Centro,  the only major fuel-fired plant operating in Imperial County in 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "If the Plants Were Located in Imperial County, California, among Other Things, Standards Would Require Them to Offset Their Emissions", "paragraphs": ["If the Sempra and Intergen plants were located in Imperial County, to help  improve air quality, California regulations would require, among other  things, offsets for all emissions from the plants that contribute to  nonattainment of the PM and ozone standards in the county. Under the  specific offsetting rules established by the Imperial County Air Pollution  Control District, the operators of each plant would be required to reduce  emissions from other pollution sources in Imperial County by at least 1.2  tons for every ton of emissions the plants released. In addition to  offsetting emissions of PMIntergen would also be required to offset all emissions of VOC, which, in  combination with NOX, contribute to the formation of ozone.", "As shown in table 7, potential offsets identified by the Imperial County Air  Pollution Control District in DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement  include (1) paving roads, (2) retrofitting emission controls on existing  power plants in Imperial County, (3) funding projects designed to increase  the use of natural gas in motor vehicles, (4) controlling Imperial County  airport dust, and (5) retrofitting diesel engines for off-road heavy duty  vehicles. According to the Air Pollution Control District, repaving  approximately 23 miles of roads could reduce PM emissions in Imperial  County by about 650 tons per year\u2014more than the estimated annual PMIn addition to the potential offsets identified above for Imperial County,  according to DOE, mitigation measures may be even more abundant and  cost-effective if applied on the Mexican side of the border. Some potential  projects include paving roads in Mexicali, Mexico; replacing older  automobiles and buses with newer, less polluting ones; and converting  brick kilns to run on natural gas. However, according to DOE, it does not  have the authority to impose or enforce offsets in Mexico.", "Finally, if the power plants were located in California, the Intergen plant  would likely be required to make additional equipment modifications to be  consistent with other plants recently constructed in California. These  modifications would include installing additional carbon monoxide control  equipment and achieving a small reduction in NOX emissions in one of the  plant\u2019s four combustion turbines. Although emissions testing data indicate  that Intergen\u2019s carbon monoxide levels are generally comparable to those  of California plants without this equipment, nearly all of the plants  recently permitted in California have installed oxidizing catalyst systems  to control carbon monoxide emissions. In addition, the Intergen plant  would likely be required to lower the maximum NOX emissions in one  turbine by 1.0 ppm\u2014from 3.5 ppm to 2.5 ppm.

Each chamber  referred the bill to committee; neither the Senate nor the House committee  reported the bill to the full chamber for consideration.", "Similarly, DOE could modify its regulations that apply to applicants for  presidential permit seeking to build new international transmission lines  to import electricity into the United States from Mexico. The modified  regulations could require that the lines connect to plants that employ  specified emissions controls and obtain offsets in the United States.  However, limiting the import of electricity from Mexico into California  could jeopardize some electricity supplies for parts of southern California,  which could be problematic especially during peak consumption periods.  According to the California Independent System Operator, the demand for  energy in California is growing at nearly 4 percent annually. During the  summer of 2004, the peak demand record set in 1999 was broken seven  times, and the California Independent System Operator believes that the  record will likely fall again during the summer of 2005.", "Moreover, both of the above options would need to be assessed to  determine if they are compliant with the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA). The agreement allows either the U.S. or Mexico to  restrict energy imports for a range of reasons, including protection of  human life or health. However, such import restrictions must meet a  variety of conditions. For example, though NAFTA recognizes a country\u2019s  right to license imports and exports of energy, any such licensing system  must be consistent with NAFTA and not frustrate its overall objectives of  eliminating trade barriers, promoting fair competition, and increasing  investment opportunities. NAFTA also requires energy regulatory agencies  to minimize disruptions to contractual relationships in applying their  regulations.", "A third option would be for the United States and Mexico to expand  cooperation under the existing binational initiative to address  transboundary air pollution in the U.S.-Mexico border region by providing  economic incentives, such as emissions trading, to reduce pollution. Such  programs have proven successful in the United States in reducing  emissions that contribute to acid rain. At the international level, the United  States and Canada have developed an air pollution agreement that could  possibly serve as a model for a similar agreement between the United  States and Mexico. However, based on the Canadian example, developing  the legal and regulatory framework needed to create a binational  emissions trading program with Mexico is likely to take a significant  amount of time. The United States and Canada initiated cooperative  efforts in 1980 through a memorandum of understanding, and 11 years  later the 1991 U.S.-Canada Air Quality Agreement identified market-based  mechanisms, including emissions trading, as areas for further discussion.  In April 1997, the United States and Canada agreed on a joint plan of  action for addressing transboundary air pollution, expanding the initial  focus on acid rain to also examine ground-level ozone and particulate  matter. In 2000, the Air Quality Agreement was formally expanded to  address transboundary ground-level ozone issues. In 2004, the United  States and Canada initiated a joint study to examine the feasibility of  establishing a binational emissions trading program. Issues being  addressed include the legal authority and the air pollution monitoring,  assessment, and reporting system that would be needed to implement  such a program.", "At the state level, Texas passed legislation in 2001 that authorized the  state\u2019s environmental agency to accept reductions in emissions from brick  kilns in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to satisfy new state emission control  requirements passed by the Texas Legislature in 1999. In return for air  emission allowances under Texas law, the local utility, El Paso Electric,  arranged the destruction of older, high-polluting, open-top kilns and  replaced them with less polluting closed-top kilns. This emission control  project serves the Paso Del Norte air basin, which is officially recognized  in the La Paz Agreement, and includes El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez,  Mexico.", "Finally, another potential option is the development of a binational clean  air trust fund that could provide grants and loans to support projects that  would improve the air quality of U.S. and Mexican cities that share air  basins in the border region. Implementing such a program could help  offset emissions generated by a variety of sources, including power plants  in Mexico that are not required to offset their emissions. Funds from a  variety of sources, such as appropriations from both nations\u2019 legislatures,  fast-lane fees for cars and trucks at ports of entry, and fees from airports  and railroads operating along the border, could be held in a joint  U.S.-Mexican trust fund for distribution to states, counties, cities, or local  air pollution control districts along the shared border. The binational  clean air trust fund could also potentially obtain funds from power plants  located in the U.S.-Mexico border region that are looking for opportunities  to offset their emissions, although they are not required to do so by law.  Both Intergen and Sempra have shown an interest in supporting projects  aimed at improving the air quality in the border region. For example,  Intergen supports an applied research grant program to improve air quality  in the California\u2013Mexico border region, and Sempra is developing a fund  to support the implementation of environmental projects, such as road  paving, in the border city of Mexicali, Mexico, that it expects to implement  before the end of 2005."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Sempra and Intergen plants near Mexicali, Mexico, are modern power  plants that use advanced air pollution control technologies. As a result, the  pollution they emit is comparable to that emitted by similar plants that  have recently received permits to operate in California and is low relative  to dust and emissions from vehicles, the primary sources of pollution in  Imperial County. Nevertheless, the plants emit some pollutants into an air  basin that already does not meet some air quality standards and is home to  many asthmatic children and a low-income population that may be  particularly susceptible to adverse health consequences from any level of  pollution increase. DOE concluded in its environmental impact statement  that pollution from the plants would not result in significant health  impacts in Imperial County and therefore did not require the plants to  offset their emissions. However, the DOE analysis did not fully examine  several issues that could have led to an assessment of a larger adverse  health impact in Imperial County. In addition, if the plants were located 3  miles north in Imperial County, California, they would be required to fund  projects to reduce pollution from other sources to offset their emissions  regardless of whether there was a documented adverse health impact.  However, now that DOE has determined that no offsets are required,  options available to U.S. policymakers in the short term to directly address  the existing health concerns are limited. In the long term, the United States  and Mexico could implement an emissions trading program or a clean air  trust fund to address pollution in the border area, but such programs are  likely to take years, and require significant binational effort to develop."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to the Department of Energy  (DOE) and to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for their review  and comment.

Specifically, DOE stated that the  environmental impact statement for the two plants (1) notes the full range  of respiratory effects associated with exposure to airborne particulate  matter (PM. While DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement  acknowledges that increases in PMimpact. Moreover, DOE\u2019s analysis does not differentiate among different  population subgroups in terms of their susceptibility to the effects of air  pollution but instead characterizes potential adverse health effects for the  population as a whole. Consequently, we continue to believe that DOE\u2019s  environmental impact statement did not address the full range of potential  health impacts on susceptible populations in Imperial County.", "Finally, DOE does not agree that the health impacts from ozone formation  may be larger than it estimated in the environmental impact statement.  DOE said that it addressed EPA\u2019s concerns regarding the uncertainty in  the ozone modeling in the final environmental impact statement.

To  address all three of these objectives we visited the Sempra and Intergen  plants in Mexicali, Mexico; interviewed plant representatives, various U.S.  federal, state, and local air quality officials, and other stakeholders; and  reviewed relevant documents and studies.", "To determine emissions from the Sempra and Intergen plants we obtained  data from emissions performance tests conducted at the plants by third  party contractors (GE Mostardi Platt and Air Hygiene). These tests were  designed to document the average emissions of selected pollutants  (nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, volatile organic  compounds, and ammonia) from the combustion turbines at each of these  plants. The results of these tests were reported in standard units of  measurement, namely parts per million or pounds per hour. According to  the contractors, they completed the tests according to Environmental  Protection Agency and California-approved methods and conducted  quality assurance activities related to their test results. We assessed the  reliability of the data by (1) reviewing documentation of test objectives  and quality control procedures provided by the third party contractors, (2)  conducting interviews with plant officials to determine the scope and  generalizability of the tests, and (3) reviewing reports of actual NOX  emissions submitted to the Mexican government to ensure consistency  with the test results. Based on this assessment, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine annual emissions estimates from these plants, we used the  results from the emissions tests to calculate the annual tonnage that these  plants would be likely to emit. We computed these values based on the  conservative assumption that these plants would be operating 24 hours a  day, 365 days a year. In addition to the estimates obtained from the testing  results, we also used the maximum allowable emission limits of  comparable plants in California to develop a more conservative estimate  of annual emissions from these plants. For Sempra, we utilized the Elk  Hills power plant as the primary basis for developing comparative  estimates. This natural gas-fired power plant is partially owned by Sempra  Energy and utilizes very similar equipment and pollution control  technology as the Mexicali plant. For the Intergen plant, we used a  combination of comparable estimates because no similar, Intergen owned  facilities were recently constructed in California. To estimate nitrogen  oxide (NOX) and ammonia (NH) was estimated using the  average allowable emissions limit from all comparable plants in California  permitted between 2000 and 2004. Because the Intergen plant is not  equipped with an oxidation catalyst, carbon monoxide (CO) was estimated  using a specific plant in California, permitted in 2000, that was the only  one licensed without such control equipment. Finally, because some  California permits establish volatile organic compounds (VOC) limits in  parts per million and others do so in pounds per hour, we were not able to  develop an average for all recently permitted plants in California. For this  reason, we used emissions limits from the Elk Hills power plant to  estimate annual emission levels of VOC at the Intergen plant.", "To determine how estimated emissions from the Sempra and Intergen  plants compare to recently permitted plants in California, we developed a  range of maximum allowable emission limits for all natural gas-fired  power plants in California with similar specifications, licensed between  2000 and 2004. This time frame was chosen because it corresponded to the  dates that the Sempra and Intergen plants in Mexicali were designed,  permitted, and began commercial operations. Because all California power  plants are permitted on a case-by-case basis, emissions limits may vary  with each project. Therefore, we used the entire range of emission limits  for the 23 plants that were identified during our selection process. We then  compared the range of emission limits from the 23 plants that we  identified with the third party testing results we obtained from the Sempra  and Intergen plants.", "To determine how the emissions from these plants compare to emissions  from sources in Imperial County we utilized the 2004 estimated annual  average emissions inventory for Imperial County developed by the  California Air Resources Board. We also met with officials from the  California Air Resources Board and reviewed emissions reports for  stationary sources obtained from the Imperial County Air Pollution  Control District. To determine the levels of nitrogen oxide emissions from  the Sempra and Intergen plants in relation to existing plants in Imperial  County and Baja California, Mexico, we obtained reports developed for  the Mexican government that included annual emissions of nitrogen  oxides based on data from the continuous emissions monitoring system on  each turbine. Comparable data for the El Centro plant in Imperial County  and the two Baja California plants were obtained from a report produced  by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation of North America. To  assess the reliability of these data sources we (1) spoke with officials at  the California Air Resources Board and reviewed documentation related to  data collection and quality control procedures used to develop the annual  emissions inventory, and (2) corroborated the emissions data related to  the El Centro plant with the EPA Clean Air Markets database. Based on  these assessments, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report.", "To determine what emissions standards the plants would be subject to if  located in Imperial County we reviewed the principal federal regulations  applicable to new power plants located in the United States and the  emission limits of similar plants recently permitted in California. The  primary federal regulations we reviewed were those established under  EPA\u2019s New Source Review program for new or modified major pollution  sources. We reviewed selected state and local air pollution regulations  because state and local agencies have responsibility for implementing  specific permitting activities as part of the federal program. The state and  local regulations we reviewed included the permitting conditions of  several power plants licensed by the California Energy Commission to  determine the standard permitting criteria and the air quality rules  established by the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District for  sources located in Imperial County.", "To identify the potential health impacts from emissions generated by the  Sempra and Intergen power plants, we reviewed the health assessment in  DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement.

We reviewed EPA\u2019s comments on the  environmental impact statement, and interviewed EPA officials and health  experts regarding DOE\u2019s health assessment methodology. In addition, we  reviewed relevant EPA reports, and other health studies regarding the  impacts of particulate matter and ozone on human health. Finally, we  reviewed a recent California health survey to obtain current information  on asthmatic populations in Imperial County and other California  counties.", "To determine the policy options available to ensure that emissions from  the Sempra and Intergen plants do not adversely affect the health of  Imperial County residents, we reviewed the federal Clean Air Act, the  California Clean Air Act, key provisions of the North American Free Trade  Agreement, as well as environmental agreements between the United  States and Mexico, such as the La Paz agreement, and a trilateral  agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada\u2014the North  American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation; and academic  research.

While DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement acknowledges that  increases in PM and ozone because it does not meet air quality standards for these  two pollutants.  2.  Asthma hospitalizations are just one measure of potential adverse  health impacts from increased emissions of particulate matter. While  asthma hospitalizations are more severe and likely to occur less often  than doctor visits or increased medication use for asthma, they cannot  be considered representative of the \u201cfull range\u201d of potential adverse  health impacts associated with asthma in Imperial County. In addition  to asthma-related adverse health effects, numerous studies have linked  increased exposure to particulate matter to other non-asthma-related  adverse health effects, such as chronic bronchitis, chronic lung  disease, pneumonia, and cardiovascular disease.  3.  We disagree with DOE that hospitalizations are the best parameter for  representing impacts on asthma. While asthma hospitalizations in  Imperial County may be well documented, the 2003 California Health  Survey provides information on other asthma-related health impacts in  Imperial County. For example, the survey contains information on the  number of Imperial County residents who take medication to control  asthma. In addition, the survey presents information on the number of  Imperial County residents who had asthma symptoms within a  specified time frame and who visited an emergency room or urgent  care facility for asthma-related health problems during that time frame.  Such information could have been used, along with information on  hospitalizations, to create a more complete estimate of the potential  asthma-related health effects from increases in pollution from the  power plants.  4.  The report does not use the health effects pyramid, or suggest it should  be used, to compute instances of potential health effects from air  pollution. However, we believe that the health effects pyramid is useful  for understanding the variety of ways in which increased pollution can  aggravate asthma suffering in Imperial County. In so doing, it also  highlights the full range of potentially quantifiable effects related to  asthma.  5.  During our review of the health effects literature, we identified a  number of studies that support a linear relationship between increases  in particulate matter pollution and increased incidence of  cardiovascular diseases.  6.  Asthmatic children are not the only susceptible population mentioned  in our report, and asthma hospitalization is not the only potential  health impact. Consequently, we continue to believe that DOE\u2019s  environmental impact statement did not address the full range of  potential health impacts on susceptible populations in Imperial  County. DOE\u2019s quantification of just one adverse health impact for the  entire population of Imperial County masks the differential effects that  can beset more susceptible subpopulations in the County.  7.  In commenting on the final environmental impact statement, EPA  acknowledged that DOE had clarified the limitations and uncertainties  of the ozone modeling analysis. However, in its comments EPA said it  continues to support and encourage off-site mitigation efforts to  address the limitations in the ozone modeling to ensure that there is no  net increase of air pollution in Imperial County.  8.  We believe that EPA\u2019s comment regarding peak ozone concentrations  is relevant because it is presented in the context of EPA\u2019s comments  on the draft environmental impact statement. We also note in the  report that DOE took action in response to EPA\u2019s comment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Leo G.
