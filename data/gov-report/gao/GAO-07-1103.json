The Department of State (State) controls such exports through its International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which provides for some exemptions from export licensing requirements. For a limited number of these exemptions, DOD may confirm--or certify--that the export activity qualifies for the use of an ITAR exemption. As part of an initiative, DOD is to make more effective use of ITAR exemptions, but little is known about the extent to which this is done. This report (1) describes DOD's approach for certifying exporters' exemption use in support of defense activities, (2) summarizes the use of selected DOD-certified exemptions, and (3) examines State and DOD's oversight of exemption use. GAO's findings are based on its review of export control law, regulation, and DOD guidelines; interviews with State, DOD, and defense industry officials; and a GAO-developed database of DOD certification letters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In support of defense activities, DOD prepares letters certifying that a proposed export qualifies for the use of certain ITAR exemptions by exporters. To guide this approach, DOD issued exemption certification guidelines in March 2004 to the military services because they are the DOD components primarily responsible for managing and implementing defense international cooperative programs. However, GAO found other DOD components that also certify the use of exemptions in support of international activities but are not subject to the DOD guidelines. Officials from State, which regulates and controls defense exports, have raised several concerns to DOD about its guidelines, including the use of one ITAR exemption by contractors and the comprehensiveness of the guidelines. While State and DOD officials have met and exchanged correspondence on these issues, to date, they have not resolved fundamental disagreements. A lack of common understanding of regulatory exemption use could result in inconsistent application of the regulations. The exemption certification letters from DOD components that we reviewed showed that over 1,900 exemptions were certified for about 270 exporters in calendar years 2004 through 2006. The majority of the certifications related to missile defense and Air Force programs and included the export of technical data. While most of the exporters identified in the DOD-certified exemption letters were defense contractors, other exporters included university laboratories and federally funded research and development centers. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were the most frequently cited recipients for exports under exemptions certified by DOD components. State and DOD lack comprehensive data to oversee the use of DOD-certified exemptions, limiting their knowledge of defense activities under this process. While DOD's guidelines provide for annual reporting to State on certified exemptions, this report captures data from the military services, but not from other DOD components. GAO identified 271 letters from nonservice components that were not included in DOD's 2006 report to State. In addition, DOD's report to State may not capture the magnitude of transfers certified for exemption use. For example, one letter that GAO reviewed certified the use of an exemption for more than 50 companies, but only the certification letter--not the actual transfers, which totaled 600 over a 3-year period--was captured in the cognizant military service's record keeping on exemption certifications. Furthermore, the details on these transfers were not included in DOD's report to State, limiting insight into the number of transfers under this certification."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As part of its efforts to promote cost sharing and increase interoperability  of defense assets, the Department of Defense (DOD) enters into defense  cooperative agreements with allies and friendly nations.

To summarize the use of DOD- certified exemptions, we created a database of DOD certification letters  issued between 2004 and 2006 that we were able to identify and collect  from DOD components. From these data, we extracted information such  as the most frequent type of export and top foreign recipients and  summarized the results. We coordinated with State and DOD officials to  identify a list of DOD components certifying the use of exemptions.  However, the universe of all DOD-certified exemptions is unknown, and  additional exemption letters might exist.

According to State officials,  language in this section indicates that the exemption is only designed  for use by U.S. government personnel for U.S. government end-use and  is not designed to be used by contractors. DTSA disagreed on this point  and stated that the section\u2019s phrase \u201cby or for any agency of the U.S.  government\u201d indicates that the exemption can be used by contractors  when their work is directed by DOD for its own benefit.

This information was not included in  the DOD component\u2019s reporting on exemption certification use. In  addition, we found that some of the certification letters that we reviewed  lacked key information that could be helpful in overseeing exemptions  certified by DOD components.", "The DOD exemption guidelines state that the military services must record  the exemption in a centralized DOD database. However, nonservice  components, such as the Missile Defense Agency\u2014which had the largest  number of certifications from 2004 through 2006\u2014do not record their  exemption certification data in the centralized DOD database, known as  USXPORTS. Instead, the nonservice components retain their own  records on certified exemptions. In addition, DOD guidelines provide that  DOD submit a report to State on exemptions certified for use on an annual  basis. In July 2007, DOD submitted its 2006 report to State based on the  data contained in USXPORTS. However, the utility of DOD\u2019s report to  State on exemption use is limited in several areas. First, since DOD  collects data for only the military services, its exemption report to State  does not provide total exemption data for all DOD components.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s report to State contained data on 161 certification  letters issued by the military services in 2006; for the same year, we  collected an additional 271 letters from nonservice components. Second,  for each certification letter, the report contains (1) a certification tracking  number, (2) certification date, (3) certifying organization, (4) destination  country or countries, (5) description of export, and (6) exporter name.  However, it does not contain other information that the DOD guidelines  specify for inclusion in the certification letters and maintenance in the  military services\u2019 records on exemption certifications, such as which ITAR  exemption is being certified and the expiration date for each exemption.", "Therefore, State does not have a complete report for the exemptions  certified for use by all of DOD\u2019s components.", "While the certification letters we reviewed frequently contained the  information as called for in the DOD exemption guidelines, some  differences existed that resulted in DOD not having insight into the  magnitude of transfers certified for exemption use. For example, for its  Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force issues an annual certification  letter\u2014to more than 50 companies\u2014that certifies their use of one ITAR  exemption for the purposes of responding to written requests from DOD  for a quote or bid proposal. These letters are broad in scope and do not  specify what technical data would be released for the program. When  these companies listed on the certification letter cite a specific need for  using this exemption throughout the year for an export, they submit their  request directly to the program office. However, because the Air Force  does not require the program office to report these specific data on these  program office approvals for transfers, it is likely that the Air Force lacks  comprehensive knowledge on exports transferred under the use of this  ITAR exemption. From 2004 through 2006, we found that the Joint Strike  Fighter program had authorized the release of more than 600 transfers of  technical data under the quote or bid proposal exemption containing  specific information\u2014such as the types of technical data and related  drawings exported and the frequency of these exports\u2014which the Air  Force lacks in its central record keeping on exemptions. Further, DOD\u2019s  2006 report to State includes only the certification letter that was broad in  scope, but it does not include the magnitude of transfers under this  certification.", "We found some variations in the type of information contained in the  certification letters provided by the military services and non-service  components, which can lessen DOD\u2019s insight into the specific export  activities that DOD is certifying. For example, 163 did not specify  whether the foreign export destination entity was a foreign government,  foreign industry, or U.S. entity. Over 70 certifications\u2014about 4 percent of  the total certifications we reviewed\u2014did not contain an expiration date  for the exemption; for the remainder, the length of coverage from  certification date to expiration date ranged from less than 1 day to more  than 4.5 years. The scope of the letters ranged from covering one exporter  to covering multiple exporters, and about 30 percent of the certifications  that we reviewed included subcontractors. While covering more than one  exporter under one certification letter may create some workforce  efficiencies, it could limit DOD\u2019s insight into exporters receiving  exemption certifications. In addition, this practice, while not specifically  addressed in the DOD guidelines, has raised concern among some  contractors that doing so could blur transparency and create some liability  issues. Export control officials from each of the four companies we spoke  with said they would prefer that each subcontractor have a separate  certification letter from DOD to provide a clearer record of, and decrease  their liability for, subcontractors\u2019 exports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While the exemption certification process is one way to facilitate defense  cooperation with friendly nations and allies, the U.S. government needs a  consistent approach to and knowledge of defense export activities  certified through this process.

We created a database to  summarize information provided in these certification letters, such as the  exemptions certified, types of exports, and foreign recipients. In some  cases, DOD components provided separate letters for each exporter  receiving an exemption certification for an activity, while other  components combined all exporters onto one exemption certification  letter for an activity. Therefore, to get an equitable count, we separated  individual companies from exemption certifications granted for multiple  companies on one letter. The total number of exemption certification  letters provided by the DOD components to us was 1,142.
