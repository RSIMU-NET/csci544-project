CMS awarded $117 million over a 3-year period to the QIOs to assist all homes and to work intensively with a subset of homes in each state. Homes' participation was voluntary. To evaluate QIO performance, CMS relied largely on changes in homes' quality measures (QM), data based on resident assessments routinely conducted by homes. GAO assessed QIO activities during the 3-year contract starting in 2002, focusing on (1) characteristics of homes assisted intensively, (2) types of assistance provided, and (3) effect of assistance on the quality of nursing home care. GAO conducted a Web-based survey of all 51 QIOs, visited QIOs and homes in five states, and interviewed experts on using QMs to evaluate QIOs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although more homes volunteered to work with the QIOs than CMS expected them to assist intensively, QIOs typically did not target their assistance to the low-performing homes that volunteered. Most QIOs' primary consideration in selecting homes was their commitment to working with the QIO. CMS did not specify selection criteria for intensive participants but contracted with a QIO that developed guidelines encouraging QIOs to select committed homes and exclude those with many survey deficiencies or QM scores that were too good to improve significantly. Consistent with the guidelines, few QIOs targeted homes with a high level of survey deficiencies, and eight QIOs explicitly excluded these homes. GAO's analysis of state survey data confirmed that selected homes were less likely than other homes to be low-performing in terms of identified deficiencies. Most state survey and nursing home trade association officials interviewed by GAO believed QIO resources should be targeted to low-performing homes. QIOs were provided flexibility both in the QMs on which they focused their work with nursing homes and in the interventions they used. Most QIOs chose to work on chronic pain and pressure ulcers, and most used the same interventions\u23afconferences and distribution of educational materials\u23afto assist homes statewide. The interventions used to assist individual homes intensively varied and included on-site visits, conferences, and small group meetings. Just over half the QIOs reported that they relied most on on-site visits to assist intensive participants. Sixty-three percent said such visits were their most effective intervention. Of the 15 QIOs that would have changed the interventions used, most would make on-site visits their primary intervention. Homes indicated that they were less satisfied with the program when their QIO experienced high staff turnover or when their QIO contact possessed insufficient expertise. Shortcomings in the QMs as measures of nursing home quality and other factors make it difficult to measure the overall impact of the QIOs on nursing home quality, although staff at most of the nursing homes GAO contacted attributed some improvements in the quality of resident care to their work with the QIOs. The extent to which changes in homes' QM scores reflect improvements in the quality of care is questionable, given the concerns raised by GAO and others about the validity of the QMs and the reliability of the resident assessment data used to calculate them. In addition, quality improvements cannot be attributed solely to the QIOs, in part because the homes that volunteered and were selected for intensive assistance may have differed from other homes in ways that would affect their scores; these homes may also have participated in other quality improvement initiatives. Ongoing CMS evaluation of QIO activities for the contract that began in August 2005 is being hampered by a 2005 Department of Health and Human Services decision that QIO program regulations prohibit QIOs from providing to CMS the identities of homes being assisted intensively."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government plays a major role in the financing and oversight  of nursing home care for individuals who are aged or disabled. Medicare  and Medicaid payments for nursing home services totaled $67 billion in  2004, including a $46 billion federal share. The Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) defines quality standards that the nation\u2019s  approximately 16,400 nursing homes must meet to participate in the  Medicare and Medicaid programs and contracts with state survey agencies  to assess homes\u2019 compliance through routine inspections, known as  standard surveys, and through complaint investigations. Under 3-year  contracts beginning in August 2002 and referred to as the 7th statement of  work (SOW), CMS directed Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations  (QIO) to work with nursing homes to improve the quality of care provided  to residents in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories.", "As a condition of their contracts, QIOs were required to provide   (1) information to all Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing homes in  each state about systems-based approaches to improving resident care and  clinical outcomes and (2) intensive assistance to a subset of each state\u2019s  homes, typically 10 to 15 percent, that were selected by the QIOs from  among those homes that volunteered for assistance.", "In a series of congressionally requested studies undertaken since 1998, we  have reported on the unacceptably high proportion of nursing homes  providing poor care to residents. Based in part on our recommendations,  CMS has undertaken a number of enforcement initiatives to encourage  nursing home compliance with federal quality standards, including  improved oversight by both state survey agencies and CMS, and tougher  enforcement measures to ensure that homes correct deficiencies and  maintain compliance with federal standards. For example, CMS expanded  its Special Focus Facility program in which state agencies survey selected  homes more frequently and terminate those that fail to improve  significantly within 18 months.", "CMS\u2019s decision to offer direct assistance to nursing homes that volunteer  to work with QIOs represents a new strategy in the effort to help address  long-standing quality problems in nursing homes. To evaluate QIO  performance in improving nursing home care, CMS relied primarily on  changes in nursing homes\u2019 quality measures (QM) during the contract  period. QMs are numeric measures derived from resident assessments\u2014 known as the minimum data set (MDS)\u2014that nursing homes routinely  conduct and submit to CMS. The QMs were developed to permit  comparisons across nursing homes of the quality of care provided to  residents and have been publicly reported on CMS\u2019s Nursing Home  Compare Web site since 2002.", "In 2005, CMS renewed the QIO contracts, including the nursing home  component, for another 3-year period, with a budget of $96 million to  assist nursing homes. Given the decision to continue the program, you  asked us to assess QIOs\u2019 work with nursing homes for the 7th SOW,  covering the period August 2002 through January 2006. For this report, we  assessed (1) characteristics of nursing homes the QIOs assisted  intensively, (2) the assistance the QIOs provided to nursing homes, and   (3) the effect of QIOs\u2019 assistance on the quality of nursing home care.", "To assess the characteristics of nursing homes that the QIOs selected to  assist intensively from among the homes that volunteered, we analyzed  CMS data on deficiencies cited in standard surveys of nursing homes and  compared the results for homes assisted intensively by the QIOs with  homes that were not assisted intensively. To gather information about the  QIOs\u2019 criteria for selecting homes for intensive assistance, we fielded a  Web-based survey to the 37 organizations that held the 51 QIO contracts in  the states and the District of Columbia, achieving a 100 percent response  rate. To determine the type of quality improvement assistance QIOs  provided to nursing homes, our Web-based survey collected data on the  types, frequency, and perceived effectiveness of specific interventions  used to assist homes both statewide and in the group assisted intensively;  interventions included activities such as on-site visits, mailings, and  conferences. To gather more detailed information about QIOs\u2019 work with  nursing homes, we conducted site visits to five states\u2014Colorado, Florida,  Iowa, Maine, and New York\u2014where we interviewed QIO personnel, staff  from nursing homes that had received intensive assistance, and key  stakeholders. The five states accounted for 15 percent of nursing home  beds nationwide in 2002 and represented a range in terms of such  characteristics as number of nursing home beds, region of the country,  and QIOs\u2019 performance on the nursing home component in the 7th SOW. In  the five states, we interviewed staff from 28 nursing homes\u23af4 to 8 per  state; in addition, we interviewed staff from 4 homes in four other states  for a total of 32 homes. We sought to select a group of homes that  represented a range in terms of state survey deficiencies, improvement in  QM scores during the 7th SOW, distance from the QIO, and urban versus  rural location. However, the experiences of the 32 homes in our sample  cannot be generalized to all homes that received intensive assistance from  the QIOs nationwide. To assess the effect of QIOs\u2019 assistance on nursing  home quality, we reviewed performance requirements in the QIO contracts  for both the 7th and the 8th SOWs; reports on QIOs\u2019 work with nursing  homes, including the 2006 report on the QIO program by the Institute of  Medicine (IOM); and other documents. We also conducted interviews  with nursing homes, CMS officials, officials from state quality assurance  programs and state MDS accuracy review programs, and experts on the  nursing home QMs and the MDS data on which they are based. We  conducted our review from October 2005 through May 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To augment the periodic assessment of homes\u2019 compliance with  federal quality requirements, CMS contracted for the development of QMs  and tasked QIOs with providing assistance to homes to improve quality.  CMS used QMs both to provide the public with information on nursing  home quality of care and to help evaluate QIO efforts to address quality-of- care issues, such as pressure ulcers. During the 7th SOW, organizations  other than QIOs were also working with nursing homes to improve quality."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Indicators of Nursing Home Quality", "paragraphs": ["Two indicators used by CMS to assess the quality of care that nursing  homes provide to residents are (1) deficiencies identified during standard  surveys and complaint investigations and (2) QMs. Both indicators are  publicly reported on CMS\u2019s Nursing Home Compare Web site."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Survey Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Under contract with CMS, state agencies conduct standard surveys to  determine whether the care and services provided by nursing homes meet  the assessed needs of residents and whether nursing homes are in  compliance with federal quality standards. These standards include  preventing avoidable pressure ulcers; avoiding unnecessary restraints,  either physical or chemical; and averting a decline in a resident\u2019s ability to  perform activities of daily living, such as toileting or walking. During a  standard survey, a team that includes registered nurses spends several  days at a home reviewing the quality of care provided to a sample of  residents. States are also required to investigate complaints filed against  nursing homes by residents, families, and others. Complaint investigations  are less comprehensive than standard surveys because they generally  target specific allegations raised by the complainants.", "Any deficiencies identified during standard surveys or complaint  investigations are classified according to the number of residents  potentially or actually affected (isolated, pattern, or widespread) and their  severity (potential for minimal harm, potential for more than minimal  harm, actual harm, or immediate jeopardy). Deficiencies cited at the actual  harm and immediate jeopardy level are considered serious and could  trigger enforcement actions such as civil money penalties. We have  previously reported on the considerable interstate variation in the  proportion of homes cited for serious care problems, which ranged during  fiscal year 2005 from 4 percent of Florida\u2019s 691 homes to 44 percent of  Connecticut\u2019s 247 homes. We reported that such variability suggests  inconsistency in states\u2019 interpretation and application of federal  regulations; in addition, both we and CMS have found that state surveyors  do not identify all serious deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality Measures", "paragraphs": ["QMs are relatively new indicators of nursing home quality. Although  survey deficiencies have been publicly reported since 1998, CMS did not  begin posting QMs on its Nursing Home Compare Web site until November  2002. QMs are derived from resident assessments known as the MDS that  nursing homes routinely collect on all residents at specified intervals.  Conducted by nursing home staff, MDS assessments cover 17 areas, such  as skin conditions, pain, and physical functioning.", "In developing QMs, CMS recognized that any publicly reported indicators  must pass a rigorous standard for validity and reliability. In October 2002,  we reported that national implementation of QMs was premature because  of validity and reliability concerns. Valid QMs would distinguish between  good and poor care provided by nursing homes; reliable QMs would do so  consistently. One of our main concerns about publicly reporting QMs was  that the QM scores might be influenced by other factors, such as residents\u2019  health status. As a result, the specification of appropriate risk adjustment  was a key requirement for the validity of any QMs. Risk adjustment is  important because it provides consumers with an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d  comparison of nursing homes by taking into consideration the  characteristics of individual residents and adjusting the QM scores  accordingly. For example, a home with a disproportionate number of  residents who are bedfast or who present a challenge for maintaining an  adequate level of nutrition\u2014factors that contribute to the development of  pressure ulcers\u2014may have a higher pressure ulcer score. Adjusting a  home\u2019s QM score to fairly represent to what extent a home does or does  not admit such residents is important for consumers who wish to compare  one home to another. Appendix II lists the 10 QMs initially adopted and  publicly reported by CMS\u20146 applicable to residents with chronic care  problems (long-stay residents) and 4 applicable to residents with post- acute-care needs (short-stay residents).", "MDS data are self-reported by nursing homes, and ensuring their accuracy  is critical for establishing resident care plans, setting nursing home  payments, and publicly reporting QM scores. In February 2002, we  concluded that CMS efforts to ensure the accuracy of MDS data, which are  used to calculate the QMs, were inadequate because the agency relied too  much on off-site review activities by its contractor and planned to conduct  on-site reviews in only 10 percent of its data accuracy assessments,  representing fewer than 200 of the nation\u2019s then approximately 17,000  nursing homes.

Established by the Peer Review Improvement Act of  1982 and originally known as Peer Review Organizations (PRO), QIOs  initially focused on ensuring minimum standards by conducting  retrospective hospital-based utilization reviews that looked for  inappropriate or unnecessary Medicare services. According to the 2006  IOM report, as it became apparent that standards of care themselves  required attention, QIOs gradually shifted from retrospective case reviews  to collaboration with providers to improve the overall delivery of care\u2014a  shift consistent with transformational goals set by CMS\u2019s Office of Clinical  Standards and Quality, which oversees the QIO program.", "In contrast to enforcing standards, quality improvement tries to ensure  that organizations have effective processes for continually measuring and  improving quality. The goal of quality improvement is to close the gap  between an organization\u2019s current performance and its ideal performance,  which is defined by either evidence-based research or best practices  demonstrated in high-performing organizations.  According to the quality  improvement literature, successful quality improvement requires a  commitment on the part of an organization\u2019s leadership and active  involvement of the staff. The 2006 IOM report notes that QIOs rely on  various mechanisms to promote quality improvement, including one-on- one consulting and collaboratives. While the former provides direct and  specialized attention, the latter relies on workshops or meetings that offer  opportunities for providers to share experiences and best practices.  Quality improvement often relies on the involvement of early adopters of  best practices\u2014providers who are highly regarded as leaders and can help  convince others to change\u2014for the diffusion of best practices. Key tools  for quality improvement include (1) root cause analysis, a technique used  to identify the conditions that lead to an undesired outcome;   (2) instruction on how to collect, aggregate, and interpret data; and   (3) guidance on bringing about, sustaining, and diffusing internal system  redesign and process changes, particularly those related to use of  information technology for quality improvement. Quality improvement  experts also emphasize the importance of protecting the confidentiality of  provider information, not only to protect the privacy of personal health  information but also to encourage providers to evaluate their peers  honestly and to prevent the damage to providers\u2019 reputations that might  occur through the release of erroneous information.", "Section 1160 of the Social Security Act provides that information collected  by QIOs during the performance of their contract with CMS must be kept  confidential and may not be disclosed except in specific instances; it  provides the Secretary of HHS with some discretion to determine  instances under which QIO information may be disclosed.

For contracting purposes, the QIOs were divided into three  groups with staggered contract cycles. The four contract deliverables,  however, were all due on the same dates, irrespective of the different  contract cycles. The contracts also required QIOs to work with a QIO  support contractor tasked to provide guidelines for recruiting and  selecting nursing homes as intensive participants, train QIOs in standard  models of quality improvement assistance, and provide tools and  educational materials, as well as individualized consultation if needed, to  help QIOs meet contractual requirements. QIOs and nursing homes were  also involved in other quality improvement special studies with budgets  separate from the QIO contracts for the 7th SOW. These studies varied  greatly in terms of length, the clinical issue(s) covered, the number of  QIOs involved, and the characteristics of the nursing homes that  participated.

CMS allocated a specific amount for each component of the  contracts, but allowed QIOs to move funds among certain components.

The contracts  directed QIOs working in states with 100 or more nursing homes to target  10 to 15 percent of the homes for intensive assistance. Figure 2 illustrates  that QIOs provided two levels of assistance\u2014statewide and intensive\u2014 and that homes\u2019 participation was either nonintensive or intensive.  Intensive participants received both statewide and intensive assistance.  Selection of intensive participants from among the nursing homes that  volunteered was at the discretion of each QIO, but the SOW required the  QIO support contractor (the Rhode Island QIO) to provide guidelines and  criteria for QIOs to use in determining which homes to select.  Participation in the program was voluntary, and QIOs were prohibited  from releasing the names of participating nursing homes except as  permitted by statute and regulation.", "Under the contracts, the quality improvement assistance provided by QIOs  focused on areas related to eight chronic care and post-acute-care QMs  publicly reported on the CMS Nursing Home Compare Web site. QIOs  were required to consult with relevant stakeholders and select from three  to five of the eight QMs on which QIOs\u2019 quality improvement efforts would  be evaluated (see table 1). Intensive participant homes were also required  to select one or more QMs on which to work with the QIO. Although they  could select one QM, they were encouraged to select more than one.", "To improve QM scores, QIOs were expected to develop and implement  quality improvement projects focused on care processes known to  improve patient outcomes in a manner that utilized resources efficiently  and reduced burdens on providers. The QIO support contractor developed  a model for QIOs to facilitate systems change in nursing homes. This  model emphasized the importance of QIOs\u2019 statewide activities to form  and maintain partnerships, conduct workshops and seminars, and  disseminate information on interventions to improve quality. For intensive  participants, the model emphasized conducting one-on-one quality  improvement assistance as well as conferences and small group meetings.  According to contract language, QIOs were expected to coordinate their  projects with other stakeholders that were working on similar  improvement efforts or were interested in teaming with the QIO. But  ultimately, each QIO determined for itself the type, level, duration, and  intensity of support it would offer to nursing homes.", "Evaluation of QIO contract performance. CMS evaluated QIOs\u2019  performance on the nursing home component of the contract using  nursing home provider satisfaction with the QIO, QM improvement among  intensive participants, and QM improvement statewide (see fig. 3).

QIOs had wide latitude in choosing among homes because CMS did not  specify the characteristics of the homes they should recruit or select,  leaving it to the QIO support contractor to provide voluntary guidelines.  The QIO support contractor developed guidelines based on input from a  variety of sources, including QIOs that worked with nursing homes during  the 6th SOW. Issued at the beginning of the 7th SOW, the guidelines  emphasized the important role the selected homes would play in the QIOs\u2019  contract performance and encouraged QIOs to select homes that  demonstrated a willingness and ability to commit time and resources to  quality improvement. The QIO support contractor also encouraged QIOs to  exclude homes with a high number of survey deficiencies, high  management turnover, and QM scores that were too good to improve  significantly. With respect to homes\u2019 survey histories, the QIO support  contractor reasoned that homes with a high number of deficiencies might  be more focused on improving their survey results than on committing  time and resources to quality improvement projects. For example, the care  areas in which a home was cited for deficiencies might not correspond  with any of the eight QMs to which CMS limited the QIOs\u2019 quality  improvement activities (see table 1). In fact, the quality of care area in  which homes were most frequently cited for serious deficiencies in  surveys in 2006 was the provision of supervision and devices to prevent  accidents, which does not have a corresponding QM.", "Consistent with the guidelines, 76 percent of the 41 QIOs that reported in  our Web-based survey their considerations in selecting homes for the  intensive participant group ranked homes\u2019 commitment as their primary  consideration.

Similarly, personnel at most QIOs we contacted gave  serious consideration to homes\u2019 QM scores, looking for homes that  appeared to need help and could demonstrate improvement. For example,  personnel at one QIO said that they tended to select homes whose QM  scores were worse than the statewide average; personnel at another QIO  said that this QIO selected homes with scores it thought could be  improved, eliminating homes with either very high or very low scores.

Personnel at another QIO stated that their concern was  to avoid homes with competing priorities.

Personnel  we interviewed at two QIOs said that they worked with some extremely  poor-performing homes but did not include them on the official list of  intensive participants submitted to CMS; personnel at one of these QIOs  explained that they did not want to be held responsible if these homes  were unable to improve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "QIOs Did Not Target Intensive Assistance to Low-Performing Homes", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of homes\u2019 state survey histories from 1999 through 2002  indicates that QIOs did not target intensive assistance to homes that had  performed poorly in state surveys.

Other stakeholder  suggestions regarding the homes QIOs should target are listed in table 2.

Although the validation  study commissioned by CMS found that most of the publicly reported QMs  were valid and reflected the quality of care delivered by facilities, long- term care experts have criticized the study on several grounds. For  example, a 2005 report concluded that (1) the statistical criteria for the  validity assessments were not stringent and (2) the researchers did not  attempt to determine whether QMs were associated with quality of care at  the resident level. As a result, it is not clear whether a resident who  triggers a QM (e.g., is assessed as having his or her pain managed  inadequately) is actually receiving poor care. The lack of correlation  among the QMs\u23afa home may score well on some QMs and poorly on  others\u23afalso calls into question their validity as measures of overall  quality. Since 2002, CMS has removed or replaced 5 of the original 10  QMs\u23afincluding some of those on which the QIOs were evaluated during  the 7th SOW\u2014to address limitations in the QMs, such as reliability and  measurement problems.

For example, one expert we interviewed suggested that in  many cases pressure ulcers start in hospitals; the pressure ulcer QM does  not account for the origin of ulcers. Another expert highlighted the  difficulty of making an appropriate adjustment\u2014noting, for example, that  improperly risk-adjusting the pressure ulcer QM could mask poor care that  contributed to the development of ulcers.", "MDS. We have also previously reported concerns about MDS  reliability\u23afthat is, the consistency with which homes conduct and code  the assessments used to calculate the QMs. CMS awarded a contract for  an MDS accuracy review program in 2001 but revamped the program in  2005, near the end of the QIOs\u2019 7th SOW, acknowledging weaknesses\u2014 mainly its reliance on off-site, rather than on-site, accuracy and  verification reviews\u2014that we had previously identified. Some states that  sponsor on-site MDS accuracy reviews continue to report troubling rates  of errors in the data. For example, officials of Iowa\u2019s program reported an  average MDS error rate of approximately 24 percent in 2005.", "Our interviews with long-term care experts and nursing home staff  suggested that the chronic pain QM\u23afwhich was selected as a focus of  quality improvement work by many QIOs and intensive participant nursing  homes\u23afmay be particularly vulnerable to error in the underlying MDS  data. Possible sources of error are systematic differences in the extent to  which facilities identify and assess residents in pain and  misunderstandings about how to accurately code MDS questions specific  to pain. For example, staff from two nursing homes told us that their pain  management QM scores improved after staff realized that they had been  mistakenly coding residents as having pain even though their pain was  successfully managed. Moreover, experts we interviewed noted that  higher-quality homes may have worse pain QM scores because they do a  better job of identifying and reporting pain in residents.", "The use of MDS data to measure the quality of care in nursing homes is  also problematic because the MDS was not designed as a quality  measurement tool and does not reflect advances in clinical practice. CMS  is updating the MDS now to address these limitations. For example,  instead of asking homes to classify the severity of a pressure ulcer on the  basis of a four-stage system, the draft MDS now under review includes a  measurement tool intended to more accurately classify the severity of a  pressure ulcer.

In an assessment of the QIO program during  the 7th SOW, CMS and QIO officials acknowledged this difficulty. The  assessment found that intensive participants improved more than  nonintensive participants on all five QMs studied, and for each QM,  intensive participants that worked on the QM improved more than  intensive participants that did not. However, the authors noted that these  results could not be definitively attributed to the efforts of the QIOs  because improvements may have been influenced by a variety of factors,  including preexisting differences between intensive participants and  nonintensive participants; public reporting of the QMs, which may have  focused homes\u2019 attention on improving these measures; and other quality  improvement efforts to which homes may have been exposed. As noted  earlier in this report, these other efforts included, but were not necessarily  limited to, initiatives sponsored by state governments, nursing home trade  associations, and CMS. While these other efforts varied considerably in the  intensity of technical assistance offered\u23afranging from a trade association- sponsored program that homes characterized as essentially signing a  quality improvement pledge, to state-sponsored programs that involved  on-site visits by experienced long-term care nurses who provided best- practice guidelines, educational materials, and clinical tools\u23afthe fact that  the efforts were present made it impossible to attribute quality  improvements solely to the QIOs.", "In its 2006 report on all aspects of the QIO program, IOM highlighted  similar shortcomings in previous studies of the QIO program and called for  more systematic and rigorous evaluations. IOM concluded that although  the QIOs may have contributed to improvements in the quality of care, the  existing evidence was inadequate to determine the extent of their  contribution. In its response to the IOM study, CMS acknowledged the  need to strengthen its methods of evaluating the program and outlined  plans to convene an evaluation expert advisory panel to make  recommendations on the framework for the next contracts (the 9th SOW,  which will begin in 2008). CMS also stated that it will collect information  during the 8th SOW that will allow it to control for differences in motivation  between intensive and nonintensive participants but did not specify the  nature of this information. Subsequently, HHS\u2019s Office of General  Counsel determined that QIO program regulations prohibited QIOs from  providing to CMS the identities of intensive participants.

For example, the  same code would be used for a full-day visit as for an hour visit. Moreover,  because QIOs were not expected to enter any code more than once per  month for a home, a code for on-site support could indicate a single visit  or multiple visits. The system also captured no information about the  content of visits or other interventions. From the perspective of the QIOs,  the system was of limited use: More than half of the 52 QIOs surveyed by  IOM rated PARTner fair or poor in terms of both value and ease of use.  Staff at one QIO we interviewed reported using tracking systems they  developed themselves, rather than PARTner, to monitor their work.", "CMS regional offices and the nursing home satisfaction survey gathered  some additional information about the interventions used by QIOs. The  CMS regional offices gathered information through telephone calls and  visits to the QIOs and by participating in quarterly conference calls during  which QIOs and CMS regional and central offices discussed issues related  to the nursing home component of the contract. The regional office staff  also reviewed information entered into the PARTner data system by QIOs,  but they focused their evaluations on QIO contract compliance and not on  the effectiveness of specific interventions because\u2014as some regional staff  emphasized\u2014the contracts were performance-based, and therefore it was  not their place to \u201cmicromanage\u201d the QIOs or to advocate for or against  specific interventions. Feedback from nursing homes was gathered  through the nursing home satisfaction survey, conducted after the  midpoint of the contract cycle by a contractor for CMS.

In addition, the agency cancelled its plans to conduct an initial  survey of nursing homes early in the contract period and now plans to  conduct only one, later in the contract period.

CMS program improvements for the 8th SOW, such as the  agency\u2019s decision to focus resources on intensive rather than statewide  assistance and its plans to improve evaluation, are positive steps that  could result in more effective use of available funds and provide more  insight into the program\u2019s impact. Our evaluation of assistance provided  during the 7th SOW, however, raised two major questions about the future  focus, oversight, and evaluation of the QIO program, which we address  below.", "Given the available resources, which homes and quality-of-care  areas should CMS direct QIOs to target for intensive assistance?  We found that QIOs generally did not target intensive assistance to homes  that performed poorly in state surveys, partly because of concerns about  the willingness and ability of such homes to simultaneously focus on  quality improvement and cooperate with the QIOs. However, the  Collaborative Focus Facility project during the 7th SOW demonstrated that  low-performing homes could improve their survey results and QM scores;  subsequently, CMS required that during the 8th SOW each QIO work with  up to three such homes\u2014about 10 percent of the total number that QIOs  are expected to assist intensively. Stakeholders we interviewed believed  that even more emphasis should be placed on assisting low-performing  homes. We found that there was little overlap between homes that  participated in the QIO Collaborative Focus Facility project and in CMS\u2019s  Special Focus Facility program, which is a program involving about 130  nursing homes nationwide that, on the basis of their survey results, receive  increased scrutiny and enforcement by state survey agencies. The limited  overlap suggests that each state has more than three low-performing  facilities that could benefit from QIO assistance.", "Targeting assistance to low-performing homes could pose challenges given  the voluntary nature of the program\u2014homes must agree to work with a  QIO. QIOs maintain that voluntary participation is critical to ensuring  homes\u2019 commitment to the program. However, the risk in this approach is  that some of the homes that need help most will not get it. Indeed, in the  Collaborative Focus Facility project, some of the low-performing homes  that were asked to participate refused QIO assistance. In addition, QIOs  expended more resources working to improve these low-performing  homes than were required to assist better-performing homes. Thus,  increasing the number of low-performing homes QIOs are required to  assist above the small number mandated for the 8th SOW might necessitate  decreasing the total number of homes assisted. However, existing  resources might be maximized if QIOs worked with each home only on the  quality-of-care areas that pose particular challenges for that home.", "Could interim steps be taken to improve oversight and evaluation  of QIOs\u2019 work with nursing homes before the contracting cycle that  begins in August 2008? Currently, CMS collects data primarily on QIO  outcomes\u2014specifically, changes in QM scores\u2014and costs. CMS needs  more detailed data, particularly about the type and intensity of  interventions used to assist nursing homes, to improve its oversight and  evaluation of the QIO program. Without such data, CMS cannot hold QIOs  fully accountable for their performance under their contract with CMS.  Some evaluation activities are now scaled back or on hold because HHS  determined early in the 8th SOW that program regulations prohibited the  QIOs from providing to CMS the identities of the intensive participants.  Such a firewall presents a major impediment to improved oversight and  evaluation of the QIO program and prevented CMS from implementing  interim changes it planned to make. For example, for the 7th SOW, CMS  contracted for one nursing home satisfaction survey to be conducted near  the end of the contract period\u2014too late to be of use in interim monitoring  of the QIOs\u2019 performance. For the 8th SOW, CMS had planned to contract  for two surveys but was forced to cancel the one planned for early in the  contract period because it was unable to provide the names of intensive  participants to its survey contractor. Moreover, the lack of these data  would preclude CMS from independently verifying QIO compliance with  such contract requirements as the geographic dispersion of intensive  participants in each state.", "CMS evaluated QIOs\u2019 work with nursing homes primarily on the basis of  changes in QM scores; given the weaknesses of QM data, the current  reliance on these data appears unwarranted. While CMS actions to  improve the MDS instrument as a quality measurement tool are important,  the agency has not yet established an implementation date. Although  multiple long-term care professionals believe that multiple indicators of  quality, including deficiencies on homes\u2019 standard and complaint surveys  and residents\u2019 and family members\u2019 satisfaction with care, should be used  to measure quality improvement, CMS is not currently drawing on these  data sources to evaluate QIOs\u2019 efforts.

However, we pointed out that the number of these homes the  QIOs were required to serve was small, accounting for less than 10 percent  of the homes they were expected to assist intensively. CMS commented  that preliminary estimates from a special study conducted during the 7th  SOW indicated that assisting chronically poor-performing homes cost the  QIOs 5 to 10 times as much as assisting the \u201cusual\u201d home. Our report  acknowledged that additional resources were required for QIOs to assist  low-performing homes but suggested that CMS could decrease the total  number of homes assisted in order to increase the number of low-  performing homes beyond the small number mandated for the 8th SOW.", "Direct QIOs to focus intensive assistance on those quality-of-care  areas on which homes most need improvement. CMS did not directly  respond to this recommendation, but did point out that about one-third of  QIOs were working primarily with homes on QMs on which the homes  scored worse than the national average during the 8th SOW. Our  recommendation was to direct all QIOs to focus intensive assistance on  QMs that reflect homes\u2019 greatest quality-of-care challenges. We had  reported that some nursing homes assisted intensively by QIOs did not  have a choice of QMs on which to work. We concluded that having QIOs  work intensively with homes only on the quality-of-care issues that posed  particular challenges to them would maximize program resources.", "Revise QIO program regulations to require QIOs to provide CMS  with the identities of the homes assisted in order to facilitate  evaluation. CMS did not specifically indicate whether it agreed with this  recommendation, but did indicate that it continues to explore options  which would allow access to data on the homes assisted intensively in  order to facilitate evaluation. However, CMS expressed concern that  providing this access could potentially subject the information to laws that  could afford third parties similar access. We believe that CMS should  continue to evaluate how best to maintain an appropriate balance between  disclosure and confidentiality. If CMS\u2019s evaluation indicates that it is  unable to incorporate adequate confidentiality safeguards to promote  voluntary participation in QIOs\u2019 quality improvement initiatives, the  agency could seek legislation that would provide such safeguards.", "Collect more complete and detailed data on the interventions QIOs  use to assist homes. CMS responded to this recommendation, although it  labeled it \u201cimprove the monitoring of QIO activities,\u201d and agreed with our  recommendation. CMS noted that, in concert with HHS, it is reviewing  recommendations from the IOM\u2019s 2006 report on QIOs, which may result  in redesigning the program, including systems for evaluating QIO activities  in different care settings, such as nursing homes. CMS did not discuss how  it planned to collect additional data on QIO nursing home interventions.  Further, it stated that it may incorporate data-handling and -reporting  features of the nursing home subtask into overall program improvements.  We have reservations about this plan because we found that CMS  collected little information about specific QIO interventions with nursing  homes during the 7th SOW, the information collected was not sufficiently  comprehensive or consistent to be used to evaluate the interventions\u2019  effectiveness, and QIOs themselves reported that the data collection  system was of limited use to them.", "Identify a broader spectrum of measures than QMs to evaluate  changes in nursing home quality. CMS did not directly address this  recommendation. However, the agency took issue with our judgment that  the use of QMs to evaluate nursing home quality\u2014and by extension, QIOs\u2019  performance\u2014is problematic. CMS commented that the QMs have passed  through rigorous development, testing, deployment, and national  consensus processes. We reported that the study commissioned by CMS to  validate the QMs has been criticized by experts on several grounds,  including a lack of statistical rigor. We also noted that CMS has revised or  is currently revising both the QMs and the MDS data used to calculate  them to address limitations, such as reliability and measurement  problems. For example, CMS has removed or replaced 5 of the original 10  QMs since 2002, including some of those on which the QIOs were  evaluated during the 7th SOW. In addition, CMS is currently updating the  MDS to reflect advances in clinical practice and to improve its utility as a  quality measure tool. While we expect that these efforts will improve the  QMs as measures of nursing home quality, we believe that the QMs\u2019  current limitations argue for the use of a broader spectrum of measures to  evaluate changes in nursing home quality. Multiple long-term care  professionals we interviewed recommended that the QMs not be used in  isolation to assess the quality of care in nursing homes; these professionals  suggested a range of measures that could be used to supplement the QMs,  including perceptions of care by family members, residents, and staff;  state survey data; and nursing home staffing levels.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.

The first part of the survey  gathered information about the primary personnel who worked with  nursing homes during the 7th SOW, including information about their  employment with the QIO, and their relevant credentials and experience.  The second part of the survey gathered information on a range of other  topics, including information about stakeholder involvement with the QIO,  recruitment and selection of nursing homes for intensive assistance,  interventions used with intensive participants, interventions used with  homes statewide, and QIOs\u2019 communication with CMS. We specifically  inquired about QIOs\u2019 use of six interventions: (1) mailings, faxes, and e- mails; (2) conferences; (3) small group meetings; (4) conference calls and  video or Web conferences with multiple homes; (5) telephone  conversations with individual homes; and (6) on-site visits. We asked  QIOs to rank and provide information on the two interventions they relied  on most to assist homes statewide and on the three interventions they  relied on most to assist homes in the intensive participant group. We also  asked QIOs to rank the effectiveness of the interventions they used and to  identify the interventions they would use if they could do the 7th SOW over  again."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Publicly Reported Quality Measures", "paragraphs": ["In November 2002, CMS began a national Nursing Home Quality Initiative  that included the development of QMs that would be publicly reported on  the CMS Web site called Nursing Home Compare.
