In addition, NASA will try to improve shuttle safety by implementing the recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB). NASA's estimate of the total cost to upgrade the shuttle--$300 million-$500 million a year, or a total of $5 billion-$8 billion through 2020--is reasonably based but could be significantly higher, as it does not include potential projects such as a crew escape system.

The space shuttle is NASA\u2019s largest individual program  accounting for about 25 percent of the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget  request. Since it is the nation\u2019s only launch system capable of transporting  people, the shuttle\u2019s viability is critical to the space station.", "We have reported in the past that extensive delays in the development and  assembly of the ISS and difficulties defining requirements and maturing  technologies for the next generation space transportation systems have  hindered the development and funding of a long-term space transportation  program. We have also testified that NASA faced a number of  programmatic and technical challenges in making shuttle upgrades,  including revitalizing its workforce and defining shuttle technical  requirements. In another report, we reported that NASA continued to rely  on qualitative risk assessments to supplement engineering judgments and  had made only limited progress in the use of quantitative assessment  methods. Recognizing such needs, NASA has taken steps to bring a more  formal approach to identifying, prioritizing, and funding improvements.", "In February 1997, NASA established the Space Shuttle Program  Development Office at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center to sustain, improve,  and add capability to the space shuttle through an upgrade program.

The SLEP  provided a formal process to select, prioritize, and fund upgrades needed  to keep the shuttle flying safely and efficiently and allow upgrades to be  evaluated and approved on a priority basis. Shuttle upgrades are items that  contribute toward the Space Shuttle Program goals to (1) fly safely,  (2) meet the manifest, (3) improve mission supportability, and (4) improve  the system in order to meet NASA\u2019s commitments and goals for human  operations in space. According to NASA, upgrades achieve major  reductions in the operational risks inherent in the current systems by  making changes that eliminate, reduce, or mitigate significant hazards and  critical failure modes and that increase the overall reliability of the current  system with respect to the likelihood of catastrophic failure. Examples of  upgrade projects currently funded to improve safety include Cockpit  Avionics, Vehicle Main Landing Gear Tire and Wheel, External Tank  Friction Stir Weld, and Shuttle Main Engine Advanced Health Management  System."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shuttle Requirements Process Lacks Systematic Approach", "paragraphs": ["To keep the shuttle flying safely, NASA needs to fully implement an  upgrade program to modernize various shuttle components.

During this time, NASA was reluctant to  make long-term investments due to the shuttle\u2019s perceived short life  expectancy. With the advent of the ISS, the agency\u2019s transportation plan  indicated that the shuttle would be used to operate and support the ISS  until 2012, when a new space launch vehicle was to take over that mission.  Recently, use of the new launch vehicle was de-emphasized by a new  ISTP, which in its place proposed development of an OSP (to transfer the  crew to the ISS) and continued use of the shuttle (to transfer cargo). The  new plan proposes upgrading the shuttle\u2019s software and hardware to  extend its operational life to 2020.", "NASA recognizes the need for a systematic approach for defining  requirements to upgrade the shuttle, and it recently institutionalized a new  process to select and prioritize shuttle upgrades.

The  new process, which was first used in March 2003 at the first SLEP Summit,  uses panels of experts from NASA, which are mostly chaired by the  Deputy Center Directors, who meet periodically to develop and assess  project recommendations. The SLEP is structured around eight panels of  senior managers that make greater use of quantitative tools in areas such  as safety and sustainability, including an outside panel of industry experts  and an Integration Panel. The Integration Panel refines the prioritized  recommendations of each panel into final recommendations to a group of  top-level managers known as the Space Flight Leadership Council (the  Council). As a result of the last Summit in March 2003, the Council  approved all project recommendations of the Integration Panel with a  total estimated cost of about $1.7 billion from fiscal years 2004-08.  (See app. II.) In making its recommendations, the Council was not  restricted by fiscal constraints. The Council endorsed 60 SLEP upgrade  projects for fiscal year 2004 costing $416 million.

Early next year, they plan to begin using a revised PRA more  oriented toward the shuttle.

However, in June 2003, the agency estimated the shuttle  upgrade cost through that year by using a rough order of magnitude  estimate of $300 million-$500 million a year, or a total of $5 billion- $8 billion. The $300 million-$500 million per year estimate projected for  out-year funding was modeled using a simulation tool and developed by  an independent consulting firm.

According to a NASA official, NASA\u2019s cost estimates are focused on the  annual budget process, rather than long term through 2020, because any  individual project takes a while to mature and near-year estimates, such as  those from the current year and through 2008, would be more accurate  than those from 2009 and beyond, which are more likely to change.
