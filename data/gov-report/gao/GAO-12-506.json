However, several area and district officials expressed concern that this consolidation could lessen their ability to carry out ongoing and future cost-savings and revenue-generation initiatives, and to recruit and retain future managers. In December 2011, USPS issued a plan on how it would evaluate additional field offices for possible consolidation and address concerns that the USPS Office of Inspector General identified in past field office consolidations. These concerns included the need to develop a plan to guide future field office consolidations and to consider factors such as workload and proximity to other offices. According to USPS officials, the plan also addressed past concerns about inadequate documentation and transparency and will lead to post-consolidation reviews to assess lessons learned and measure actual savings.

USPS officials  acknowledge that closing retail postal facilities is highly contentious. As a  result, according to USPS officials, USPS is exploring additional options  to reduce its retail facility costs by, for example, reducing employee work  hours and shortening operating hours at selected facilities.", "Since 2006, USPS has taken several actions to reduce its costs by  improving the operational efficiency of its mail-processing network. As  discussed in our April 2012 report, these actions included consolidating  operations at various types of mail-processing facilities and closing  unneeded facilities, which, according to USPS, resulted in about $2.4  billion in cost savings. completed Area Mail Processing reviews of 264 of its mail-processing  facilities to examine the feasibility of consolidating mail-processing  operations from one or more postal facilities to other facilities to improve  USPS\u2019s operational efficiency.

Generally, city carriers are paid by the hour with overtime, as  applicable, while rural carriers are salaried employees. in routes that city carriers can complete in less than 8 hours.  Recognizing that these factors cause inefficiencies in USPS\u2019s city delivery  network, in 2008, USPS and the National Association of Letter  Carriers\u2014the union that represents city carriers\u2014entered into an  agreement that permits USPS to conduct city route inspections and to  realign routes that no longer reflect 8 hours of work into more efficient  routes. In fiscal year 2011, USPS eliminated 6,821 of its 224,485 city and  rural delivery routes (about 3 percent). In addition, USPS recently  announced plans to eliminate another 20,000 city routes (about 9 percent  of current routes) for an estimated $2 billion in annual savings.  According to USPS officials, realigning delivery routes likely will continue  well into the future given expected mail volume declines and annual  increases in addresses receiving mail which, until recently, have  historically increased by about 1 million addresses per year.", "Area and district employees have key roles in realigning city delivery  routes. Specifically, area employees oversee the city route realignment  process to ensure consistency across districts in their area, while district  employees directly carry out the realignments. To do so, district  employees (1) gather and analyze information on the factors that affect  delivery time; (2) observe the time a mail carrier spends servicing his or  her route and, if the route is determined to represent less than a full 8- hour work day; (3) reconfigure the route so that it is more efficient. To  evaluate the factors that affect delivery time, district managers consider a  variety of factors, including the number of addresses and mail volume on  a particular route, the distance between addresses, the geographic  location of the route (e.g., the downtown of a major metropolitan area  versus a small town), and the mode of delivery (e.g., mail delivered to a  curbside mailbox, a mail slot in a door, or a cluster box). In addition,  district employees physically observe a mail carrier\u2019s daily activities, both  in the office preparing mail for delivery and transporting and delivering the  mail, to determine whether the route represents a full 8-hour day. If after  conducting these activities, district employees determine that the  workload does not fill an 8-hour day, specially trained district employees  use a computerized management tool\u2014called the Carrier Optimal  Routing system\u2014to redesign routes. This system uses digital mapping,  algorithms, and route inspection data to create efficient city carrier routes  that are more compact and contiguous. As a result, USPS could, for  example, consolidate portions of other city routes, such as routes that  necessitate carrier overtime, to complete or augment the prior  reconfigured route, thereby eliminating the need for overtime. Because  route realignments reorder mail deliveries along city routes, the  realignments result in major changes to USPS\u2019s database for managing  addresses that, according to district managers, requires district Address  Management Systems Specialists to update the database on an ongoing  basis. According to USPS field officials, if updates to the database are not  made in a timely manner, delivery efficiency and customer service would  be degraded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue-Generating Efforts", "paragraphs": ["As with USPS\u2019s cost reduction efforts, area and district employees have a  significant role in several aspects of USPS\u2019s efforts to generate additional  revenue through three of the Postmaster General\u2019s four core business  strategies: (1) strengthening the value of mail to businesses, (2)  improving its retail customers\u2019 experience, and (3) competing for the  package business.", "Area and district employees promote and oversee a variety of efforts  intended to strengthen the value of mail to businesses. Collectively, these  efforts are intended to enhance how U.S. businesses contact their  customers to deliver billing statements and notifications (using First-Class  Mail) and advertisements and offers (using Standard Mail). For example,  area and district Business Service Network employees (marketing  employees) provide direct and ongoing customer service to business  mailers to, among other things, help the mailers conveniently process  their mail and to correct any mailing problems, such as shipment delays,  that may arise. In 2011, USPS generated about $50 billion (76 percent of  its total operating revenue) from business mailers. Of this amount, $40  billion (60 percent of its total operating revenue) came from business  mailers that area and district Business Service Network employees  directly serviced.", "Area and district employees also have a role in promoting the value of  mail with new business mailers.

Thus, he said  encouraging these businesses to do so represents an opportunity to  increase USPS\u2019s revenue. In January 2011, USPS introduced a new  initiative called Every Door Direct Mail to (1) make it easier for small and  medium-sized businesses to advertise through the mail, and (2) enable  local businesses to target potential customers by street, as opposed to  specific mailing addresses. Area employees oversee the implementation  of this initiative in districts within their area, and monitor performance  metrics and revenue earned. Similarly, district employees promote the  initiative in their districts to attract new customers in their locations.  According to USPS, this initiative generated over $92 million in revenue in  the 9 months following its introduction in January 2011.", "Improving the retail customer experience means maintaining and growing  the customer base through improved customer service. Area employees  have a key role in monitoring the quality of customer interactions and  resolving any performance problems identified. For example, area  employees told us that they regularly monitor the results of, among other  things, customer surveys in specific post offices as well as in districts as a  whole. When these data identify specific performance problems, area  employees share the results with district employees who are then  expected to work with particular facilities and individuals to correct the  identified service-related problems. District employees also track the  performance and revenue generated by third parties who provide  alternative access to postal products through contract postal units and  work with local postmasters, who most directly oversee these facilities, to  improve service and maximize revenue.", "USPS\u2019s field employees also have key roles in helping the USPS  successfully compete for and grow its package business. Overall,  according to USPS, its package deliveries have increased from 12.7  percent of its revenue in fiscal year 2006 to 16.1 percent in fiscal year  2011. District employees work directly with employees at post offices and  mail-processing facilities to train employees on how to properly scan  packages for delivery\u2014a key factor in growing USPS\u2019s package  business. Proper scanning helps ensure that packages travel through its  delivery network efficiently and that customers and USPS can track the  packages to determine their current location.

In  addition, field employees we interviewed in one of the four areas we  selected for our review developed a program to generate additional  revenue by targeting small businesses that are not currently using  USPS\u2019s services. Specifically, in the Southwest Area, area employees  worked with employees of their Dallas district office to collaborate on  ways to identify and contact small businesses that generate less than  $10,000 annually in postage sales and that currently use USPS  competitors, such as the United Parcel Service, to persuade these  companies to use USPS for their package mailing needs. According to  USPS from August 1, 2011, through February 10, 2012, this initiative  generated about $11.9 million in revenue from new small business  customers.

A  district marketing manager reiterated this point, indicating that most  business mailers expect personal service to resolve any mailing  issues and that consequently, USPS should ensure that these  business mailers receive consistent and reliable service to reduce the  possibility of losing their business to competitors. As we have  reported, businesses that publish mail Periodicals, such as daily or  weekly news magazines, have expressed concern about USPS\u2019s  ability to provide reliable service. According to these business  mailers, they will likely (1) accelerate their efforts to shift subscribers  from hard copy mail to electronic communication or (2) otherwise stop  using USPS if it is unable to provide reliable service.", "In addition, 12 of the 30 district managers we interviewed expressed  concern that when USPS allocated resources for the 2011  consolidation, it did not fully consider that some offices would be  picking up additional work from the field office closures. For example,  several district managers told us that during this consolidation, several  field position reductions were made that, in their view, did not reflect  office workload variations. The managers said that their departments  are now understaffed. For example, the District Manager at the  Connecticut Valley District told us that following the 2011  consolidation, her district is now one of the largest districts in the  country, both with respect to the number of USPS employees and  geographic size. Specifically, she said her district grew from 11,939  employees to 15,421\u2014an increase of 29 percent and added over 100  facilities, while losing 20 district positions. She expressed concern that  despite overseeing one of the largest districts, she experienced the  same number of staffing reductions as other districts with smaller  workloads.", "Eight field officials told us that long work hours resulting from the 2011  consolidation combined with other factors, such as employee uncertainty  about their future employment, have made it difficult to recruit and retain  area and district employees for management positions. For example, one  district office manager told us that employees in her department have  been seeking management opportunities outside USPS because of these  concerns. Another district manager commented that he has seen a  decrease in the number of employees willing to move into managerial  positions because of uncertainty about future promotional opportunities  and the stress associated with these positions. In addition, 17 field  officials we talked to expressed concern that the loss of a significant  number of senior, experienced area and district employees during the  2011 consolidation might negatively affect USPS\u2019s ability to manage field  operations.", "USPS headquarters officials stated that while they understand the  concerns expressed by area and district employees, the changes  undertaken as part of the 2011 consolidation were intended to align with  other actions that USPS has taken to standardize and streamline support  services. For example, according to these officials, USPS has developed  several Web-based systems to automate and standardize administrative  tasks that were previously conducted by district staff. As these tasks are  streamlined, fewer district resources are needed. In addition, as  discussed, USPS headquarters officials told us that USPS considered a  variety of factors in deciding its 2011 consolidation, including mail volume,  number of customers, population density, number of delivery routes, and  revenue generated. In addition, according to USPS headquarters officials,  USPS also intends to consider workload impacts in its future field-office  consolidations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issuance of Plan and Decision to Hold Off on Future Field-Office Consolidations", "paragraphs": ["In December 2011, USPS issued a plan for evaluating area and district  offices for possible consolidation and for carrying out future  consolidations. According to the OIG, this plan addresses its  recommendations related to USPS\u2019s 2009 consolidation. In particular,  OIG officials told us that the document addresses recommendations to  USPS to develop a plan which (1) periodically evaluates area and district  offices for possible consolidation, (2) guides decisions on future field- office consolidations, and (3) considers factors such as an office\u2019s mail  volume, workload, and proximity to other offices. In addition, OIG officials  told us that the plan addresses the agency\u2019s recommendation that USPS  develop procedures for maintaining adequate documentation of its field  office evaluations and consolidation decisions.", "USPS\u2019s December 2011 plan specifies that it will take numerous steps to  evaluate field offices for possible consolidation, including:  conducting periodic evaluations of area and district offices to assess  the need for consolidations; developing a business case, which includes expected cost savings  and benefits, for proposed field-office consolidations: using reliable data sources to evaluate area and district offices for adequately documenting all analyses and data used to make  conducting post-consolidation reviews to identify key achievements  and actual cost savings, and document lessons learned.", "USPS\u2019s past area and district consolidations have lacked documentation  and transparency. For example, despite numerous requests, USPS did  not provide us with any documentation of the analyses it used or the  approval process for its decision to consolidate field operations in 2011.  Similarly, in 2010, the OIG reported that USPS could not always provide  documentation supporting its 2009 and earlier field-office consolidations.  In addition, USPS has not completed postconsolidation reviews to assess  either its lessons learned or its actual cost savings. Headquarters officials  told us that the plan it issued in December 2011 should address these  past concerns. These officials also said that USPS intends to ensure that  its future evaluations consider the operational impacts of potential field- office consolidations on ongoing and planned initiatives, such as those  related to downsizing its retail, mail-processing, and delivery networks.", "While USPS\u2019s recent plan indicates that it intends to periodically evaluate  its field office structure for possible consolidation, it does not specify when  it will initiate these evaluations. According to headquarters officials, USPS  does not plan to initiate these evaluations until after the completion of  cost-reduction efforts in its retail, mail-processing, and delivery networks,  efforts that USPS intends to complete in 2016. These officials also told us  that further consolidation of field offices would be counterproductive at  this time because field employees are key to the successful  accomplishment of these cost-reduction efforts. In addition, the  headquarters officials noted that cost savings from future field  consolidations would be minimal compared to the roughly $9 billion USPS  estimates can be saved by streamlining its retail, mail-processing, and  delivery networks. Thus, according to these officials, for the time being,  USPS needs its current field-office structure to focus on other efforts that  will result in the largest potential cost savings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["USPS\u2019s dire financial outlook necessitates urgent action to align its total  network and reduce its costs as mail volume continues to decline. To  reduce costs, USPS reduced the number of employees in its area and  district offices by almost 56 percent from 2002 to 2011. And, in 2011, it  announced additional USPS-wide initiatives to save an estimated $9.1  billion annually by 2016. USPS also recently issued a plan for evaluating  area and district offices for future consolidations; however, USPS has  chosen to hold off on future field-office consolidations until after the  USPS-wide initiatives are complete, which should allow USPS to make  additional field- office changes, if needed, based on a network that is  aligned with the reduced mail volume. This decision seems appropriate in  view of the importance of area and district offices in implementing and  managing these initiatives. If USPS decides to move forward with future  field-office evaluations, its plan for doing so should address past concerns  about inadequate documentation and transparency and lead to  postconsolidation reviews to assess lessons learned and to measure  actual savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USPS for review and comment.
