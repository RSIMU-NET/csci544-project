Furthermore, the estimate does not include costs to incrementally design, develop, and produce future 105- and 130-metric ton SLS variants which NASA expects to use for decades. NASA is now funding concept development and analysis related to these capabilities.", "The Orion estimate does not include costs for production, operations, or sustainment of additional crew capsules, despite plans to use and possibly enhance this capsule after 2021. It also does not include $4.7 billion in prior costs incurred during the approximately 4 years when Orion was being developed as part of NASA's now-defunct Constellation program.", "The ground systems estimate excludes costs to develop or operate the ground systems infrastructure beyond 2017, although NASA intends to modify ground architecture to accommodate all SLS variants.", "NASA expects to use this same limited scope of work to establish the programs' baseline cost estimates in 2014.

Agency officials stated that NASA chose its approach in part due to uncertainties about the programs' end dates and missions beyond 2021.", "GAO recognizes that defining life cycle costs can be difficult when uncertainties exist, and that best practices for cost estimating look favorably on evolutionary development. Even so, best practices expect that a high-quality cost estimate will account for program uncertainties, forecast a minimum and maximum range for all life cycle costs, and clearly define the characteristics of each increment of capability so that a rigorous life cycle cost estimate can be developed. According to these practices as well as NASA's requirements and guidance, life cycle cost estimates should encompass all past, present, and future costs for a program, including costs for operations, support, and disposal. The limited scope that the agency has chosen for constructing preliminary and baseline cost estimates, however, means that the estimates are unlikely to serve as a way to measure progress and track cost growth over the life of the programs. For example, cost growth on the current SLS variant could be masked as the addition of scope associated with work for future variants, and the baseline estimate would no longer be applicable.

NASA  is already incurring costs for EM-2 because it is funding some EM-2  development in concert with EM-1 efforts, such as work on the solid  rocket boosters and core stage that are expected to help power the  70-metric ton SLS. NASA officials indicated at one point in our review  that they did not expect to begin formally tracking EM-2 costs until  after the SLS design\u2019s maturity was assessed at a critical design  review scheduled for 2015; however, the agency stated in technical  comments to this report that it is tracking those costs for budget  purposes and plans to begin formally reporting them once SLS  reaches the project confirmation phase. Additionally, the SLS estimate  does not address the potential for costs NASA would incur to produce,  operate, and sustain flights of the 70-MT Block I capability beyond  2021.

NASA  indicated that these variants will require new systems development  efforts\u2014including advanced boosters and a new upper stage to meet  the greater performance requirements associated with larger payloads  as well as travel to Mars or other deep-space locations. NASA has  started funding concept development, trades, and analyses related to  these new designs, such as assessing the use of lightweight materials  to construct the upper stage and selective laser melting to produce  system components. In addition, NASA anticipates a re-start of the  production line for the RS-25 engine that it plans to use to power the  Block IA/B and Block II vehicles. Currently, the agency has enough  residual RS-25 liquid-fuel engines from the Space Shuttle program to  launch the SLS for up to 4 flights. NASA expects to need more of the  engines beyond that, but it has not yet finalized acquisition plans to  manufacture them.

NASA initiated the crew  capsule\u2019s development in 2006 as part of the Constellation program.  During approximately 4 years that the capsule\u2019s development  occurred under Constellation, the agency spent about $4.7 billion for  the capsule\u2019s design and development. When Constellation was  cancelled in 2010 and the work transitioned to the current Orion  program, however, NASA excluded the Constellation-related costs  from Orion\u2019s current preliminary cost estimate of $8.5 to $10.3 billion  through 2021.", "The GSDO estimate does not address the costs to develop or operate  SLS ground systems infrastructure beyond EM-1 in 2017, although  NASA intends to modify ground architecture to accommodate all SLS  variants.", "NASA officials have indicated that the road ahead involves many  decisions about the programs beyond 2021, including how development  will proceed, what missions will be performed, when the programs will  end, and how each effort will be managed. They noted that the agency is  using a capability-based approach to SLS, Orion, and the associated  GSDO development, in which system capability grows over time. They  indicated that the programs\u2019 preliminary cost estimates are for attainment  of capabilities rather than the full cost of the programs, and that it is  difficult to define life cycle costs because the programs\u2019 intended long- term uses and life spans have not been fully determined. According to  NASA, the agency is developing a tailored definition for life cycle cost  estimating that is allowed by NASA requirements. Because the missions  drive the number and types of vehicles, crew capsules, and ground  systems that would be required, as missions are defined, NASA officials  said they would be in a better position to estimate the programs\u2019 life cycle  costs. The officials stated that NASA is looking ahead to future costs as  much as possible, and NASA indicated in technical comments to this  report that the SLS program plans to begin formally reporting costs for the  launch vehicle\u2019s EM-2 after the program\u2019s anticipated confirmation in  spring 2014.", "We recognize that defining life cycle costs can be difficult when  uncertainties exist. However, in contrast to NASA\u2019s tailored approach,  both widely-accepted best practices for cost estimation and the agency\u2019s  own requirements support the need for full life cycle cost estimates. Even  when uncertainties exist, best practices maintain that a high-quality cost  estimate takes into account those uncertainties while forecasting the  minimum and maximum range of all life cycle costs. The best practices,  developed by the GAO in concert with the public and private sector cost  estimating communities, call for \u201ccradle to grave\u201d life cycle cost estimates  and maintain that life cycle cost estimates should provide an exhaustive,  structured accounting of all resources and associated cost elements  required to develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a particular program.  This entails identification of all pertinent cost elements, from initial  concept through operations, support, and disposal. Likewise, NASA\u2019s  program management requirements direct that programs develop a  preliminary full life cycle cost estimate. In accordance with the agency\u2019s  guidance regarding life cycle costs, such an estimate would encompass  total costs from the formulation through the implementation phase,  including design, development, mission operations, support, and disposal  activities.", "According to best practices, because life cycle estimates encompass all  possible costs, they provide a wealth of information about how much  programs are expected to cost over time. Life cycle cost estimates,  including a range for preliminary costs as directed by NASA requirements  for programs in the formulation phase, enhance decision making,  especially in early planning and concept formulation of acquisition. High- quality cost estimates, as noted by best practices, can support budgetary  decisions, key decision points, milestone reviews, and investment  decisions. For example, a preliminary life cycle cost estimate provides the  basis of the financial investment that the agency is committing the  government to, while a baseline life cycle cost estimate forms the basis  for measuring cost growth over time. Because NASA expects to continue  with a limited scope for the SLS, Orion, and baseline estimates, however,  cost growth over time within the programs will be difficult to identify and  could be masked as growth in the SLS capability if the most current cost  estimate did not contain the same content as the baseline estimate.", "As noted in best practices for cost estimating, the quality of a program\u2019s  cost estimate is also key to determining its affordability, that is, the degree  to which a program\u2019s funding requirements fit within an agency\u2019s overall  portfolio plan. However, NASA\u2019s preliminary cost estimates do not  address the affordability of increased capabilities because they exclude  the life cycle costs associated with the SLS Block IA/B and Block II launch  vehicles that the agency intends to use well into the future. According to  agency officials at the time of our review, NASA has not yet decided  whether it will manage the Block IA/B and Block II development efforts as  individual programs and, if so, what the programs\u2019 scope would be. Best  practices for cost estimating look favorably on the incremental  development approach NASA has chosen for SLS, and they also state  that programs following such an approach should clearly define the  characteristics of each increment of capability so that a rigorous life cycle  cost estimate can be developed. In addition, we have previously  concluded that it is prudent for an agency to manage increasing  capabilities of an existing program on par with the investments yet to  come and in a way that is beneficial for oversight. For example, we have  recommended that agencies developing weapon systems in increments  consider establishing each increment of increased capability with its own  cost and schedule baseline. According to cost estimating best practices,  dividing programs into smaller pieces makes management and testing  easier and helps avoid unrealistic cost estimates, resulting in more  realistic long-range investment funding and more effective resource  allocation. These are important considerations given that NASA is likely to  spend billions of dollars beyond its initial investment of up to $22 billion to  develop the increased capabilities. Development of human-rated liquid- fueled engines, for example, has been among the most difficult, time- intensive, and costly parts of launch vehicle development. As a case in  point, NASA spent about 8 years and $1.5 billion to develop a human- rated engine known as J-2X for use on Ares launch vehicles within the  agency\u2019s now-defunct Constellation program.", "NASA has faced issues with affordability of its manned space flight  investments and other major projects in the past, and those affordability  issues have sometimes contributed to a program\u2019s cancellation. For  example, NASA originally envisioned that the Space Shuttle would fly up  to 100 times per vehicle at a cost of $7.7 million per launch. In reality,  the Shuttle flew 135 times in total over a period of 30 years at a cost that  was about $3.5 billion per year around the 2008 timeframe. Amid  concerns that included the Shuttle\u2019s costs and safety, the program ended.  NASA then focused on building human spaceflight alternatives that  included Constellation. In 2010, Constellation was canceled because, as  noted by NASA\u2019s Administrator, the program could not return astronauts  to the moon at an affordable cost and would require far more funding to  make the agency\u2019s approach viable. In a recent example noted in the  agency\u2019s 2015 presidential budget request, NASA may place in storage  the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, an airborne  observatory for studying astronomical objects and phenomena, after  spending some 23 years and more than $1 billion to develop the project.  The agency cited high operating costs, estimated at some $1.8 billion  over the project\u2019s planned life, as a factor in its considerations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The SLS, Orion, and GSDO programs NASA has established to fulfill its  mandate of providing the capability for transporting humans to space are  well underway. These programs represent a significant investment for the  country\u2014as much as $22 billion for initial capabilities and potentially  billions more to field increased capabilities over time as envisioned in the  2010 NASA Authorization Act. Given the goals that have been outlined for  NASA as part of the National Space Transportation Policy, the success of  these programs is to be measured not only by the capability that is  achieved but also by NASA\u2019s ability to achieve them within a reasonable  timeframe and cost to the U.S. taxpayer. As such, establishing these  programs with both near-term and long-term affordability in mind is key.  The limited scope that NASA has chosen to use as the basis for  formulating the programs\u2019 cost baselines, however, does not provide the  transparency necessary to assess long-term affordability and will hamper  oversight by those tasked with assessing whether the agency is  progressing in a cost-effective and affordable manner. If the SLS, Orion,  and GSDO baseline cost estimates cannot be compared to current costs,  the baseline estimates lose their usefulness because they no longer  serve as a means to hold NASA accountable for cost growth and program  progress. Furthermore, if NASA does not clearly delineate costs for  operations and sustainment of the initial capabilities or separate cost and  schedule baselines for upcoming capabilities, then it will be difficult to  assess program affordability and for the Congress to make informed,  long-term budgetary decisions.

When NASA cannot fully specify costs due to lack of  well-defined missions or flight manifests, forecast a cost estimate  range \u2014 including life cycle costs \u2014 having minimum and maximum  boundaries.

In most cases, the actions that NASA plans to take do  not fully address the issues we raised in this report. We continue to  believe that our recommendations are valid and should be fully addressed  as discussed below. NASA also provided technical comments which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "NASA partially concurred with our first recommendation to establish a  separate cost and schedule baseline for work required to support the SLS  Block I EM-2, report this information to the Congress through NASA's  annual budget submission, and establish separate life cycle cost and  schedule baseline estimates for EM-2 if NASA decides to fly Block I  beyond EM-2. NASA also partially concurred with our second  recommendation to establish separate cost and schedule baselines that  encompass life cycle costs, including operations and sustainment, for  each additional SLS, Orion, and GSDO capability and to report cost  estimates for the capabilities annually via the agency budget submission  until key requirements are defined and baselines can be established.  In  its response, NASA stated that it had established separate programs for  SLS, Orion, and GSDO and adopted a block upgrade approach for SLS.  This approach, NASA stated, is in concert with best practices and NASA  policy. In addition, NASA indicated that it will establish cost and schedule  estimates for initial demonstration of the three programs as they enter  respective implementation phases and will begin reporting development,  operations, and sustainment costs for SLS Block I and subsequent  variants starting in fiscal year 2016 via its annual budget submission to  Congress. Finally, the agency stated that it intends to conduct design  reviews for upgraded SLS elements, including the upper stage and  booster, and set up cost commitments similar to what it has done for  Block I capability as part of that design review process, but that it does  not intend to establish life cycle estimates for SLS through the end of the  program because flight rates, mission destinations and other strategic  parameters are yet unknown.", "As discussed in the report, best practices for cost estimating recognize  that NASA\u2019s evolutionary development approach for SLS, Orion, and  GSDO helps reduce risk and provide capabilities more quickly. Given  NASA\u2019s planned long-term use of the SLS, Orion, and GSDO, its block  upgrade approach and intention to conduct design reviews for each of the  planned upgrades will provide some understanding of the development  work and resources required. For example, such reviews are typically  expected to yield information about technical progress against  requirements. While NASA's prior establishment of SLS, Orion, and  GSDO as separate programs lends some insight into expected costs and  schedule at the broader program level, it does not meet the intent of our  first two recommendations because cost and schedule identified at that  level is unlikely to provide the detail necessary to monitor the progress of  each block against a baseline. Furthermore, it is unclear from NASA's  response whether the cost commitments the agency plans within the  design review process will serve the same purpose as establishing a cost  baseline for each respective upgrade.", "Additionally, NASA's planned approach for reporting costs associated  with EM-2 and subsequent variants of SLS via its annual budget  submission only partially meets the intent of our first two  recommendations. Providing cost information at an early phase when  baseline estimates have yet to be established is helpful to ensure costs  associated with EM-1 and EM-2 are not conflated and funding  requirements for future flights of the Block I SLS and future variants are  somewhat understood. Reporting the costs via the budget process alone,  however, will not provide information about potential costs over the long- term because budget requests neither offer all the same information as  life cycle cost estimates nor serve the same purpose. Plainly, progress  cannot be assessed without a baseline that serves as a means to  compare current costs against expected costs. An agency\u2019s budget  submission reflects its current annual fiscal needs and anticipated short- term needs up through an additional 4-year period for a particular  program, is subject to change based on fiscal negotiation, and is not  necessarily linked to an established baseline that indicates how much the  agency expects to invest to develop, operate, and sustain a capability  over the long-term. Conversely, life cycle cost estimates establish a full  accounting of all program costs for planning, procurement, operations and  maintenance, and disposal and provide a long-term means to measure  progress over a program\u2019s life span. As NASA establishes parameters for  the additional flights of the first SLS capability and upgraded capabilities,  including flight rates, mission destinations, and other requirements, it will  be well-poised to move from reporting costs in budget submissions to  establishing baseline cost and schedule estimates for each capability and  reporting progress against these respective baselines. Therefore, we  continue to believe that NASA should baseline costs for EM-2 and each  future variant of SLS and report progress against those established  baselines.", "NASA makes no specific mention of how it plans to account for future  work associated with Orion and GSDO.  We believe it is important to treat  Orion and GSDO with the same significance as SLS because this trio of  programs is expected to work in concert now and in the future to achieve  NASA\u2019s goals for human space exploration. Reporting Orion and GSDO  development, operations, and sustainment costs in the annual budget  request, as NASA plans for SLS, would be a logical first step. Just as with  SLS, however, it will be important for NASA to establish and report  progress against baseline costs and schedules for each block of Orion  and GSDO efforts as flight rates, missions, and other strategic  parameters are defined because doing so will help the agency more  effectively manage not only each program but its human exploration  portfolio as a whole.", "NASA partially concurred with our third recommendation to include the  costs of Orion development work under the Constellation program as part  of the baseline cost estimate for the Orion program. Agency officials  stated that they agree those costs should be tracked and disclosed, but  that the current Orion program has a new concept of operations,  requirements, and budget plan than that under the Constellation effort.", "The past costs incurred for Orion\u2019s development are important because  they provide visibility into the total cost of developing a crew capsule for  human space exploration.  Exclusion of these costs from Orion\u2019s current  estimate understates how much NASA will invest to put humans into  space.  Although NASA notes that it has changed Orion\u2019s concept of  operations and requirements, the agency nonetheless migrated Orion  critical technology development efforts from Constellation to the SLS  program. For example, NASA began efforts to develop the coating for  Orion\u2019s heat shield as part of Constellation, and the agency continues that  development today in preparation for the capsule\u2019s launch atop SLS.  Therefore, we continue to believe our recommendation to include Orion  development costs under Constellation in the baseline cost estimate for  the current Orion program is valid and should be fully implemented.", "We are sending this report to NASA\u2019s Administrator and to interested  congressional committees.
