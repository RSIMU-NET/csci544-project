Based on its ongoing work, GAO found that the decision to delay the launch was due to poor schedule performance over the last few years (losing more than 10 days a month on average), recent technical issues with key components, and little schedule margin as the program entered integration testing. The October 2016 launch date may also be delayed if additional technical challenges arise or if schedule performance remains poor.", "NOAA recently changed assumptions about the expected lifespan of existing GOES satellites from 7 to 10 years based on the longevity of prior satellites. However, the analysis supporting this change is over 10 years old. Even with this extension, NOAA may fall short of its policy of having 2 operational satellites and 1 backup satellite in orbit. The agency faces an 11 month gap in backup coverage until GOES-R is operational, during which time there would be only 2 operational satellites (see figure). Any further delays in the GOES-R launch date could exacerbate that gap. NOAA is now facing important decisions on when to launch the remaining satellites in the GOES-R series to maximize satellite coverage while minimizing development and storage costs.", "Based on its ongoing work, GAO found that NOAA's $11.3 billion Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program is making progress toward the planned launch of the JPSS-1 satellite in March 2017. However, the program has experienced technical issues that have affected internal schedule deadlines, such as an issue with debris in an instrument's subsystem that delayed its delivery by approximately 8 months, and faces key risks in the remainder of development. NOAA is also facing the risk of a potential near-term gap in polar data prior to the launch of the JPSS-1 satellite. Similar to the decision on the GOES satellites, in April 2015, NOAA revised its assumptions about the expected life of the satellite that is currently in-orbit by adding up to 4 years, which would reduce the chance of a near-term gap. However, risks to the performance and health of the on-orbit satellite, and to development of the JPSS2 satellite could increase the risk of a gap. Also, NOAA faces key decisions on timing the development and launch of the remaining JPSS satellites to ensure satellite continuity while balancing the possibility that satellites could last much longer than anticipated."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement, but\u2014since 2012\u2014has made 23 recommendations to NOAA to strengthen its satellite acquisition programs and contingency plans.

We also reported that the program\u2019s actions to  mitigate its schedule delays introduced further risks, which could increase  the extent of the delays. For example, the program attempted to mitigate  delays in developing detailed plans for ground-based data operations by  performing system development while concurrently working on the  detailed plans. In addition, the program compressed its testing schedule  by performing spacecraft integration testing 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a- week.

These reasons included finding  debris in the solar array drive assembly that required them to replace  the component, needing additional spacecraft repair and rework after  testing was completed, and resolving disconnects in the expected  duration of tasks at the launch site. NOAA also considered the likelihood  of future delays in thermal vacuum testing, which is considered to be one  of the more difficult environmental tests.

On October 21, 2015, the  Deputy Assistant Administrator for Systems in NOAA\u2019s National  Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service informed us that  the decision to change the lifespan was based on an analysis performed  in 2005 that showed a 3-year extension was reasonable. At that time,  NOAA chose to continue to depict the shorter lifespan due to its judgment  of overall risk. The Deputy Assistant Administrator stated that in spring  2015, NOAA determined that it had sufficient history and performance on  the GOES-13 and 15 satellites to begin reflecting the 10-year lifespan in  its planning documents. This change had the effect of increasing the  expected life of GOES-13 and GOES-15 from the previous estimate, and  slightly decreasing the expected life of GOES-14.

The GOES-13 satellite, which has experienced  issues with 4 of 11 subsystems and had previously been taken offline  twice, is still expected to reach the end of its useful life in mid-2016.

NOAA officials stated that they would consider a later launch date for  GOES-U depending on the health of the satellite system when it is  due to launch.

For example, a  mechanical component that facilitates the collection of sounding data  on the S-NPP Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder instrument  experienced electrical currents that were higher than expected in early  2015. While program officials believe that the issue has been  addressed, the JPSS program is carrying it as a risk because it could  affect the satellite\u2019s useful life. There is also a risk that space debris  could collide with S-NPP, which will not factor into NOAA availability  calculations until its 2015 analysis is complete.", "Risks to satellites in development: As discussed above, the JPSS  program is currently dealing with technical issues on both the flight  and ground components of the JPSS-1 satellite which have caused  schedule delays and decreased the remaining margin to launch. In  addition, NOAA switched to a new spacecraft contractor beginning  with the JPSS-2 satellite. With a new contractor, it may be more  difficult to apply lessons learned from issues in JPSS-1 development if  similar issues arise on JPSS-2.", "Moving forward, NOAA also faces decisions on timing the development  and launch of the remaining satellites in the JPSS program. The design  life of the JPSS satellites is 7 years and NOAA plans, beginning with  JPSS-2, to launch a new satellite every 5 years in order to achieve a  robust constellation of satellites. However, NOAA officials stated that they  expect the satellites to last 10 years or more. If the satellites last that  long, then there could be unnecessary redundancy. If they do not, then  there is an increased potential for future gaps in polar satellite coverage,  as there will be several periods in which only one satellite is on orbit.  Similar to its geostationary program, evaluating the costs and benefits of  different launch scenarios to ensure robust coverage while decreasing  unnecessary costs will be important.", "In summary, we have made multiple recommendations to NOAA to  improve management of the GOES-R and JPSS satellite programs and to  address weaknesses in contingency plans in case of a gap in satellite  coverage. NOAA has addressed about a quarter of our recommendations  to date; it is important that the agency expedite its efforts to address the  remaining ones in order to reduce existing risks and strengthen its  programs.", "NOAA recently decided to delay the GOES-R satellite launch until  October 2016 and to change its assumption for how long the currently  operational satellites will last. Even with the new assumption that existing  satellites will last longer, the risk remains that there will be a gap in  backup satellite coverage that lasts for almost a year. The agency is now  facing important decisions on how to achieve the new launch schedule  and how to space out future satellites to ensure satellite coverage while  minimizing costs.", "Regarding the JPSS program, NOAA continues to make progress  developing and testing the JPSS-1 satellite as it moves toward a March  2017 launch date. Moreover, NOAA decided to extend its expectation for  how long the current satellite will last. However, there is the potential for a  coverage gap should the currently on-orbit satellite not last until the  launch and calibration of the JPSS-1 satellite is completed. According to  NOAA officials, it is also possible that JPSS-1 and -2 will last longer than  anticipated. Moving forward, reconsidering development and launch  calendars to ensure robust satellite coverage while decreasing  unnecessary costs will be important.", "Chairmen Bridenstine and Loudermilk, Ranking Members Bonamici and  Beyer, and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
