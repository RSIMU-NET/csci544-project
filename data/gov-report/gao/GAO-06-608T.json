First, Commerce could determine that China is no longer a nonmarket economy and apply CVDs against China as a market economy. Commerce has criteria for such determinations but stated that China is unlikely to satisfy them in the near term. Second, it could reverse its 1984 position, which was confirmed by a federal appeals court, and apply CVDs without changing China's NME status. However, absent a clear congressional grant of authority, such a decision could be challenged in court, with uncertain results. The House of Representatives passed legislation that would grant this authority in July 2005, and companion legislation was introduced in the Senate. World Trade Organization (WTO) rules do not explicitly preclude either alternative. Commerce would face challenges, regardless of the alternative adopted. Chinese subsidies remain difficult to identify and measure. Employing third-country information or \"facts available\" may help but would not eliminate these difficulties. Commerce lacks clear authority to fully implement China's WTO commitment on the use of third-country information in CVD cases. Making CVDs available against China would give U.S. producers an explicit import relief measure that targets unfair government subsidies. However, on a net basis, applying CVDs might not provide greater protection than U.S. producers already obtain from antidumping duties. CVDs alone tend to be lower than antidumping duties. If Commerce grants China market economy status, required methodological changes would reduce antidumping duties for some companies. It is not clear whether CVDs would compensate for these reductions. Regardless of China's status, some duties might need to be reduced to avoid double counting of subsidies.

Unfortunately, the Secretary disagreed with  our recommendations, saying that this would be too speculative. He  commented that it would not, therefore, be meaningful or appropriate to  prepare such a report before an actual case was filed and that such a  report could prejudge the outcome of future actions.", "In the event that (1) Commerce changes China\u2019s NME status or (2)  Congress decides to adopt proposed legislation that would authorize  Commerce to apply U.S. CVD laws to NME countries, including China, we  suggested that Congress provide Commerce clear authority to:  fully implement China\u2019s WTO commitment regarding use of third-country  information in CVD cases, and    make corrections to avoid double counting domestic subsidy benefits  when applying both CVDs and antidumping duties to the same products  from NME countries, in situations where Commerce finds that double  counting has in fact occurred, taking into account Commerce\u2019s analyses of  this issue prepared in response to our recommendation above.", "In response, Commerce took the position that there is no explicit statutory  bar to its application of CVD law to NME countries and stated that the  department would carefully consider any CVD petition. We modified our  report to clarify the point that Commerce could decide, in response to a  petition, that circumstances warrant and permit a change in its policy.  However, given that Commerce determined in 1984 that it did not have  explicit legal authority to take such an action, and that this was  subsequently upheld and affirmed by a federal appeals court and later  confirmed by a 1994 statement of administrative action, we continue to  believe that there would be legal obstacles to a change in Commerce  policy.", "Commerce cited some legal authority for using external benchmarks in  CVD cases. We evaluated this information and added a discussion in our  report. We were not convinced that the cited authority would clearly  provide for full implementation of the special methodology in China\u2019s  WTO accession agreement. An explicit grant of authority by Congress  would remove doubt and lesson the chances for legal disputes; therefore,  we continue to believe our suggestion is prudent. Commerce also said our  suggestion that Congress provide Commerce with authority to correct any  double counting of domestic subsidies in companion CVD and  antidumping actions was not warranted or appropriate because  Commerce had not yet encountered this situation, such corrections might  be too difficult, and China would be placed in a special category distinct  from all other countries. We maintain that our analysis shows that there is  substantial potential for double counting of domestic subsidies if  Commerce applies CVDs to China while continuing to use its current NME  methodology to determine antidumping duties. We believe that, in such a  situation, Commerce should be provided authority to proactively address  potential double counting, rather than waiting for it to occur and create  methodological and legal problems.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of this Commission, this concludes my  prepared statement. I would like to acknowledge Adam Cowles, Assistant  Director, who helped prepare this statement and led our work on China  trade remedies. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may  have."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["U.S.-China Trade: Eliminating Nonmarket Economy Methodology Would  Lower Antidumping Duties for Some Chinese Companies.
