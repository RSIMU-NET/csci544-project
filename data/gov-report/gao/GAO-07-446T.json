GAO's prior work raised concerns about Coast Guard's efforts to upgrade or acquire assets on schedule, and manage and effectively monitor the system integrator. This testimony provides GAO's preliminary observations on (1) events and issues surrounding the Coast Guard's bridging strategy to convert the legacy 110-foot patrol boats to 123-foot patrol boats; (2) the status of the Coast Guard's efforts to acquire new or upgraded Deepwater assets; and (3) the Coast Guard's ability to effectively manage the Deepwater program, hold contractors accountable, and control costs through competition.

These converted boats were removed from service on November 30, 2006 because of operational and safety concerns. According to the Coast Guard Commandant, actions are being taken to mitigate the impact of the removal of these patrol boats on mission activities. For example, patrol hours of some 110-foot patrol boats have been increased through the addition of crews from the 123-foot patrol boats, and other Coast Guard vessels have been deployed to assist in carrying out missions. The delivery record for the 10 classes of upgraded or new Deepwater aircraft and vessels is mixed. Specifically, 7 of the 10 asset classes are on or ahead of schedule. Among these, 5 first-in-class assets have been delivered on or ahead of schedule; 2 others remain on time but their planned delivery dates are in 2009 or beyond; therefore, delays could still potentially occur. Three Deepwater asset classes are currently behind schedule due to various problems related to designs, technology, or funding. For example, the Fast Response Cutter (a new vessel), which had been scheduled for first-in-class delivery in 2007, has been delayed by at least 2 years in part because work on its design was suspended until technical problems can be addressed. From the program's outset, GAO has raised concerns about the risks involved with the Coast Guard's acquisition strategy. In 2004, GAO reported that program management, contractor accountability, and cost control were all challenges, and made recommendations in these areas. Insufficient staffing, ineffective performance measures, and the Coast Guard's lack of knowledge about the extent to which the contractor was using competition have contributed to program risk. The Coast Guard has taken some actions to address these issues. GAO plans to continue to assess the Coast Guard's Deepwater program, including its efforts to address GAO recommendations, and will report the findings later this year."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss our  preliminary observations on the status of the United States Coast Guard\u2019s  Integrated Deepwater System program.

One of the key legacy assets to be improved was the 110-foot patrol boat,  which was to be converted to a 123-foot patrol boat by lengthening the hull  and modernizing various components. While the Coast Guard originally  planned to convert all 49 of its 110-foot patrol boats to 123-foot patrol  boats, it halted the patrol boat conversion program after 8 boats because  of hull buckling and the inability of these converted patrol boats to meet  post-September 11, 2001 mission requirements.", "The Deepwater program is eventually to include 10 major classes of new  or upgraded assets\u20145 major classes each of aircraft and vessels.

After the terrorist attacks on  September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard was also assigned homeland security  missions related to protection of ports, waterways, and coastal areas.  Based on its revised mission responsibilities, the Coast Guard updated its  Deepwater Acquisition Program Baseline in November 2005.  The new  baseline contained changes in the balance between new assets to be  acquired and legacy assets to be upgraded and adjusted the delivery  schedule and costs for many of these assets.

We  recommended the Coast Guard take actions to address IPT effectiveness.   We subsequently reported that IPT decision-making was to a large extent  stove-piped, and some teams lacked adequate authority to make decisions  within their realm of responsibility. Coast Guard officials believed  collaboration among the subcontractors was problematic and that the  system integrator wielded little influence to compel decisions among  them.  For example, proposed design changes to assets under construction  were submitted as two separate proposals from both subcontractors  rather than one coherent plan.  According to Coast Guard performance  monitors, this approach complicated the government review of design  changes because the two proposals often carried overlapping work items,  thereby forcing the Coast Guard to act as the system integrator in those  situations.

The Coast Guard subsequently revised its Deepwater human  capital plan in February 2005 to emphasize workforce planning, including  determining needed knowledge, skills, and abilities and developing ways  to leverage institutional knowledge as staff rotate out of the program.  We  reported in 2005 that the Coast Guard also took some short-term steps to  improve Deepwater program staffing, such as hiring contractors to assist  with program support functions, shifting some positions from military to  civilian to mitigate turnover risk, and identifying hard-to-fill positions and  developing recruitment plans specifically for them.", "However, in February 2007, Coast Guard officials told us that key human  capital management objectives outlined in the revised plan have not been  accomplished and that the staffing levels needed to accomplish the known  workload have not been achieved.

While the Coast  Guard\u2019s more active role may help its ability to ensure adequate support  for Deepwater assets that are coming on-line in the near term, our on- going work will continue to focus on this issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concerns Remain with Holding System Integrator Accountable", "paragraphs": ["Our 2004 review revealed that the Coast Guard had not developed  quantifiable metrics to hold the system integrator accountable for its  ongoing performance.  For example, the process by which the Coast  Guard assessed performance to make the award fee determination after  the first year of the contract lacked rigor.  At that time, we also found that  the Coast Guard had not yet begun to measure contractor performance  against Deepwater program goals\u2014the information it would need by June  2006 to decide whether to extend the system integrator\u2019s contract award  term by up to another 5 years.  Additionally, we noted that the Coast  Guard needed to establish a solid baseline against which to measure  progress in lowering total ownership cost\u2014one of the three overarching  goals of the Deepwater program. Furthermore, the Coast Guard had not  developed criteria for potential adjustments to the baseline.  Preliminary  observations from our ongoing work on the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to  improve system integrator accountability follow."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Award Fee Criteria", "paragraphs": ["In 2004 we found the first annual award fee determination was based  largely on unsupported calculations.  Despite documented problems in  schedule, performance, cost control, and contract administration  throughout the first year, the program executive officer awarded the  contractor an overall rating of 87 percent, which fell in the \u201cvery good\u201d  range as reported by the Coast Guard award fee determining official.  This  rating resulted in an award fee of $4 million of the maximum $4.6 million.   The Coast Guard continued to report design, cost, schedule, and delivery  problems, and evaluation of the system integrator\u2019s performance  continued to result in award fees that ranged from 87 percent to 92  percent of the total possible award fee (with 92 percent falling into the  \u201cexcellent\u201d range), or $3.5 to $4.8 million annually, for a total of over $16  million the first 4 years on the contract.  The Coast Guard continues to  revise the award fee criteria under which it assesses the system  integrator\u2019s performance.", "The current award fee criteria demonstrate the Coast Guard\u2019s effort to use  both objective and subjective measures and to move toward clarity and  specificity with the criteria being used.  For example, the criteria include  24 specific milestone activities and dates to which the system integrator  will be held accountable for schedule management.  However, we recently  observed two changes to the criteria that could affect the Coast Guard\u2019s  ability to hold the contractor accountable.  First, the current award fee  criteria no longer contain measures that specifically address IPTs, despite  a recommendation we made in 2004 that the Coast Guard hold the system  integrator accountable for IPT effectiveness.  The Coast Guard had agreed  with this recommendation and, as we reported in 2005, it had incorporated  award fee metrics tied to the system integrator\u2019s management of  Deepwater, including administration, management commitment,  collaboration, training, and empowerment of the IPTs.  Second, a new  criterion to assess both schedule and cost management states that the  Coast Guard will not take into account milestone or cost impacts  determined by the government to be factors beyond the system  integrator\u2019s control.  However, a Coast Guard official stated that there are  no formal written guidelines that define what factors are to be considered  as being beyond the system integrator\u2019s control, what process the Coast  Guard is going to use to make this determination, or who is ultimately  responsible for making those determinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Award Term Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Deepwater program management plan included three overarching  goals of the Deepwater program:  increased operational effectiveness,  lower total ownership cost, and customer satisfaction to be used for  determining whether to extend the contract period of performance, known  as the award term decision.  We reported in 2004 that the Coast Guard had  not begun to measure the system integrator\u2019s performance in these three  areas, even though the information was essential to determining whether  to extend the contract after the first 5 years.  We also reported that the  models the Coast Guard was using to measure operational performance  lacked the fidelity to capture whether improvements may be due to Coast  Guard or contractor actions, and program officials noted the difficulty of  holding the contractor accountable for operational effectiveness before  Deepwater assets are delivered.  We made a recommendation to Coast  Guard to address these issues.", "According to a Coast Guard official, the Coast Guard evaluated the  contractor subjectively for the first award term period in May 2006, using  operational effectiveness, total ownership costs, and customer satisfaction  as the criteria.  The result was a new award term period of 43 of a possible  60 months.  To measure the system\u2019s operational effectiveness, the Coast  Guard has developed models to simulate the effect of the Deepwater  assets\u2019 capabilities on its ability to meet its missions and to measure the  \u201cpresence\u201d of those assets.  However, in its assessment of the contractor,  the Coast Guard assumed full operational capability of assets and  communications and did not account for actual asset operating data.   Furthermore, the models still lacked the fidelity to capture whether  operational improvements are attributable to Coast Guard or contractor  actions.  As a result the contractor received credit for factors beyond its  control\u2014although no formal process existed for approving such factors.   Total ownership cost was difficult to measure, thus the contractor was  given a neutral score, according to Coast Guard officials.  Finally, the  contractor was rated \u201cmarginal\u201d in customer satisfaction.", "The Coast Guard has modified the award term evaluation criteria to be  used to determine whether to grant a further contract extension after the  43-month period ends in January 2011. The new criteria incorporate more  objective measures.", "While the three overall Deepwater program objectives (operational  effectiveness, total ownership costs, and customer satisfaction)  carried a weight of 100 percent under the first award term decision,  they will represent only about a third of the total weight for the second  award term decision.  The criteria include items such as new  operational effectiveness measures that will include an evaluation of  asset-level key performance parameters, such as endurance, operating  range, and detection range.", "The new award term criteria have de-emphasized measurement of total  ownership cost, concentrating instead on cost control.  Program  officials noted the difficulty of estimating ownership costs far into the  future, while cost control can be measured objectively using actual  costs and earned value data. In 2004, we recommended that the Coast  Guard establish a total ownership cost baseline that could be used to  periodically measure whether the Deepwater system-of-systems  acquisition approach is providing the government with increased  efficiencies compared to what it would have cost without this  approach.  Our recommendation was consistent with the cost baseline  criteria set forth in the Deepwater program management plan.  The  Coast Guard agreed with the recommendation at the time, but  subsequently told us it does not plan to implement it.", "In our current work, we will explore the implication of the revised award  term evaluation criteria and the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to measure the  overarching goals of the acquisition strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishing Criteria and Documenting Changes to the Baseline", "paragraphs": ["Establishing a solid baseline against which to measure progress in  lowering total ownership cost is critical to holding the contractor  accountable.  The Coast Guard\u2019s original plan, set forth in the Deepwater  program management plan, was to establish as its baseline the dollar value  of replacing assets under a traditional, asset-by-asset approach as the  \u201cupper limit for total ownership cost.\u201d  In practice, the Coast Guard  decided to use the system integrator\u2019s estimated cost of $70.97 billion plus  10 percent (in fiscal year 2002 dollars) for the system-of-systems approach  as the baseline.   In 2004, we recommended that the Coast Guard establish  criteria to determine when the total ownership cost baseline should be  adjusted and ensure that the reasons for any changes are documented.", "Since then, the Coast Guard established a process that would require DHS  approval for adjustments to the total ownership cost baseline. The  Deepwater Program Executive Officer maintains authority to approve  baseline revisions at the asset or domain level.  However, depending on  the severity of the change, these changes are also subject to review and  approval by DHS.  In November 2005, the Coast Guard increased the total  ownership cost baseline against which the contractor will be evaluated to  $304 billion.  Deepwater officials stated that the adjustment was the result  of incorporating the new homeland security mission requirements and  revising dollar estimates to a current year basis.  Although the Coast  Guard is required to provide information to DHS on causal factors and  propose corrective action for a baseline breach of 8 percent or more, the   8 percent threshold has not been breached because the threshold is  measured against total program costs and not on an asset basis.  For  example, the decision to stop the conversion of the 49 110-foot patrol  boats after 8 hulls did not exceed the threshold; nor did the damages and  schedule delay to the NSC attributed to Hurricane Katrina.  During our  ongoing work, Coast Guard officials acknowledged that only a  catastrophic event would ever trigger a threshold breach.  According to a  Coast Guard official, DHS approval is pending on shifting the baseline  against which the system integrator is measured to an asset basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Knowledge of Cost Control Achieved Through Competition", "paragraphs": ["Further, our 2004 report also had recommendations related to cost control  through the use of competition.  We reported that, although competition  among subcontractors was a key mechanism for controlling costs, the  Coast Guard had neither measured the extent of competition among the  suppliers of Deepwater assets nor held the system integrator accountable  for taking steps to achieve competition.  As the two first-tier  subcontractors to the system integrator, Lockheed Martin and Northrop  Grumman have sole responsibility for determining whether to provide the  Deepwater assets themselves or hold competitions\u2014decisions commonly  referred to as \u201cmake or buy.\u201d  We noted that the Coast Guard\u2019s hands-off  approach to make-or-buy decisions and its failure to assess the extent of  competition raised questions about whether the government would be able  to control Deepwater program costs.", "The Coast Guard has taken steps to establish a reporting requirement for  the system integrator to provide information on competition on a semi- annual basis.  The system integrator is to provide detailed plans, policies,  and procedures necessary to ensure proper monitoring, reporting, and  control of its subcontractors.  Further, reports are to include total  procurement activity, the value of competitive procurements, and the  subcontractors\u2019 name and addresses.  The system integrator provided the  first competition report in October 2006.  However, because the report did  not include the level of detail required by Coast Guard guidelines, a Coast  Guard official deemed that the extent of competition could not be  validated by the information provided and a request was made to the  system integrator for more information.  We will continue to assess the  Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to hold the system integrator accountable for  ensuring an adequate degree of competition. -     -     -     -     -  Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony.
