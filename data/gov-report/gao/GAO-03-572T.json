Timely, accurate, and useful financial information is essential for making informed operating decisions day to day, managing the federal government's operations more efficiently and effectively, meeting the goals of federal financial management reform legislation, supporting results-oriented management approaches, and ensuring accountability on an ongoing basis. The importance of such information is heightened by the unprecedented demographic challenge of an aging population. Federal spending on the elderly, health care, and new homeland security and defense commitments increases the need to look at competing claims on the budget and at new priorities. Over the past year, the Principals of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program continued efforts to accelerate progress in financial management reform. Also, President Bush has implemented the President's Management Agenda to provide direction to, and closely monitor, management reform across government, which encompasses improved financial management performance. To effectively implement federal financial management reform, sustained leadership and oversight are essential."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As in the 5 previous fiscal years, the federal government continues to have a significant number of material weaknesses related to financial systems, fundamental recordkeeping and financial reporting, and incomplete documentation. Several of these material weaknesses resulted in conditions that continued to prevent us from expressing an opinion on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2002 and 2001. Three major impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements are (1) serious financial management problems at DOD, (2) the federal government's inability to fully account for and reconcile billions of dollars of transactions between federal entities, and (3) the federal government's inability to properly prepare the consolidated financial statements. Federal agencies have continued to make progress in obtaining unqualified audit opinions--21 of 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies for fiscal year 2002, up from 6 for fiscal year 1996. Irrespective of the unqualified opinions, many federal agencies do not have timely, accurate, and useful financial information and sound controls with which to make informed decisions and to ensure accountability on an ongoing basis. Building on the success achieved in obtaining unqualified audit opinions, federal agency management must continue to work toward fully resolving the pervasive and generally long-standing material weaknesses that have been reported for the past 6 fiscal years. The President's Management Agenda stated that without sound internal control and accurate and timely financial information, it is not possible to accomplish the President's agenda to secure the best performance and highest measure of accountability for the American people."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and  2001.

At the outset, I would like to thank the  subcommittee for continuing an annual tradition of oversight hearings on  this important subject.  The work of the former Subcommittee on  Government Efficiency, Financial Management, and Intergovernmental  Relations, along with its leader, former Congressman Stephen Horn, has  been a catalyst to facilitate government management reform over the past 6  years.  The continued involvement of this subcommittee will be critical to  ultimately restoring public confidence in the federal government as a  financial steward that is accountable for its finances.", "As in the 5 previous fiscal years, certain material weaknesses in internal  control and in accounting and reporting prevented us from being able to  provide the Congress and American citizens an opinion as to whether the  consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in conformity with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles.  Until the problems discussed in  our report are adequately addressed, they will continue to (1) hamper the  federal government\u2019s ability to accurately report a significant portion of its  assets, liabilities, and costs, (2) affect the federal government\u2019s ability to  accurately measure the full cost and financial performance of certain  programs and effectively manage related operations, and (3) significantly  impair the federal government\u2019s ability to adequately safeguard certain  significant assets and properly record various transactions.", "Across government, financial management improvement initiatives are  under way that, if effectively implemented, have the potential to  appreciably improve the quality of the federal government\u2019s financial  management and reporting. A number of federal agencies have started to  make progress in their efforts to modernize their financial management  systems and improve financial management performance as called for in  the President\u2019s Management Agenda. For example, the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made significant progress in  addressing its financial management weaknesses, including addressing  controls over budgetary activity and its accountability over property and  equipment. Resolving many of IRS\u2019s most serious financial management  weaknesses\u2014identified by GAO as a high-risk area since 1995\u2014will require  a sustained, long-term commitment of resources, continued strong  involvement of senior IRS management, and sustained progress in systems  modernization.", "This year marks the earliest that federal agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements have ever been available.  For the first time, Chief Financial  Officers Act (CFO) Act agencies were required to combine their audited  financial statements with performance reports and deliver both to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) by February 1, a month earlier  than last year.  Furthermore, the Principals of the Joint Financial  Management Improvement Program (JFMIP)\u2014the Secretary of the  Treasury, the Directors of OMB and the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), and I, as Comptroller General of the United States\u2014have agreed to  accelerate the agency financial statement reporting date to November 15  for fiscal year 2004.  The Social Security Administration (SSA), which has a  long-standing record of delivering its audited financial statements well  before the mandated deadline, issued its fiscal year 2002 audited financial  statements on November 19, 2002. Treasury also accelerated its time frame  and issued its fiscal year 2002 audited financial statements on November  15, 2002, which was more than 3 months earlier than for fiscal year 2001.", "For fiscal year 2002, 21 of the 24 CFO Act agencies were able to attain  unqualified audit opinions on their financial statements (the appendix lists  the 24 CFO Act agencies, their audit results, and auditors), up from 6  agencies for fiscal year 1996. Also, 4 CFO Act agencies showed  improvement by receiving unqualified opinions from their auditors this  year\u2014the Department of Education, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and  the Department of Agriculture (USDA), which received an unqualified audit  opinion for the first time.  On the other hand, after receiving unqualified  opinions on its financial statements since fiscal year 1996, the Small  Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) independent auditor withdrew its  unqualified audit opinions on the agency\u2019s fiscal years 2001 and 2000  financial statements and issued disclaimers of opinion on the agency\u2019s  fiscal years 2002 and 2001 financial statements.", "Although obtaining unqualified audit opinions is important, according to  the President\u2019s Management Agenda, \u201cmost federal agencies that obtain  clean audits only do so after making extraordinary, labor-intensive assaults  on financial records.\u201d  Further, the President\u2019s Management Agenda stated  that without sound internal control and accurate and timely financial  information, it is not possible to accomplish the President\u2019s agenda to  secure the best performance and highest measure of accountability for the  American people.  It will be increasingly difficult for federal agencies to  continue to rely on significant costly and time-intensive manual efforts to  achieve or maintain unqualified opinions until automated, integrated  processes and systems are implemented that readily produce the necessary  information.  As a result, many federal agencies must accelerate their  efforts to improve underlying financial management systems and controls,  which is consistent with reaching the financial management success  measures envisioned by the JFMIP Principals and called for by the  President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "Before discussing the results of the audit of the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements in more detail, I would like to discuss  why sound financial management is especially necessary for the future, as  well as for today, to meet tomorrow\u2019s fiscal needs.  I then will highlight the  major issues relating to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal  years 2002 and 2001.  I will then discuss the urgency of providing sustained  leadership and oversight for effective implementation of financial  management reform, provide my perspectives on the importance of federal  agencies\u2019 building on the success of their unqualified audit opinions by  significantly improving underlying financial management systems, and  underscore the need to address major impediments to an opinion on the  consolidated financial statements.

The long-term fiscal  pressures created by the retirement of the baby boom generation and new  homeland security and defense commitments, including the ongoing  Operation Iraqi Freedom, sharpen the need to look at competing claims on  federal budgetary resources and new priorities.  In previous testimony, I  noted that it should be the norm to reconsider the relevance or \u201cfit \u201d of any  federal program or activity in today\u2019s world and for the future.  Such a  fundamental review is necessary both to increase fiscal flexibility and to  make government fit the modern world.  Stated differently, there is a need  to consider what the proper role of the federal government will be in the  21st century and how the government should do business in the future.   The budget and performance integration initiative undertaken as part of the  President\u2019s Management Agenda should help provide information for use in  conducting such reviews.  OMB\u2019s Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART)  represents a step toward more structured involvement of program and  performance analysis in the budget.  PART includes general questions on  (1) program purpose and design, (2) strategic planning, (3) program  management, and (4) program results.  It also includes a set of more  specific questions that vary according to the type of delivery mechanism or  approach the program uses.", "As we look ahead, the federal government faces an unprecedented  demographic challenge.  A nation that has prided itself on its youth will  become older.  Between now and 2035, the number of people who are 65  years old or over will double.  As the share of the population over 65  climbs, federal spending on the elderly will absorb larger and ultimately  unsustainable shares of the federal budget.  Federal spending on health and  entitlement programs for the elderly is expected to surge as people live  longer and spend more time in retirement.  In addition, advances in medical  technology are likely to keep pushing up the cost of providing health care.   Moreover, the baby boomers will have left behind fewer workers to support  them in retirement, prompting a slower rate of economic growth from  which to finance these higher costs.  Absent substantive reform of related  entitlement programs and/or dramatic changes in tax or discretionary  spending policies, we will face large, escalating, and persistent deficits.", "These trends have widespread implications for our society, our economy,  and the federal budget.", "On March 17, 2003, the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust  funds reported on the current and projected status of these programs over  the next 75 years.  The Trustees report that the fundamentals of the  financial status of both Social Security and Medicare remain highly  problematic.  However, they stated that Medicare faces financial difficulties  that are more severe than those confronting Social Security because costs  of the Medicare program are projected to rise faster than costs of the Social  Security program.  The projections show a 20 percent increase to about  $6.2 trillion over the prior year in the Present Value of Resources Needed  Over the 75-Year Projection Period for Federal Hospital Insurance  (Medicare Part A), while the Social Security projection showed an 8  percent increase to about $4.9 trillion.  Once again, the Trustees state that  action to address the financial difficulties facing Social Security and  Medicare must be taken in a timely manner and that the sooner these  financial challenges are addressed, the more varied and less disruptive the  solutions can be.", "Early action to change these programs would yield the highest fiscal  dividends for the federal budget and would provide a longer period for  prospective beneficiaries to make adjustments in their own planning.   Waiting to take action entails risks.  First, we lose an important window  where today\u2019s relatively large workforce can increase saving and enhance  productivity, two elements critical to growing the future economy.  Second,  we lose the opportunity to reduce the burden of interest in the federal  budget, thereby creating a legacy of higher debt as well as elderly  entitlement spending for the relatively smaller workforce of the future.   Third, and most critically, we risk losing the opportunity to phase in  changes gradually so that all can make the adjustments needed in private  and public plans to accommodate this historic shift.", "We prepare long-term budget simulations that seek to illustrate the likely  fiscal consequences of the coming demographic tidal wave and rising  health care costs.  Our latest long-term budget simulations reinforce the  need for change in the major cost drivers\u2014Social Security and health care  programs.  As shown in figure 1, by midcentury, absent reform of these  entitlement programs, projected federal revenues may be adequate to pay  little beyond interest on the debt and Social Security benefits.  Further, the  shift from surplus to deficit means that the nation will move into the future  in a weaker fiscal position than was previously the case.", "Although the need for structural change in Social Security is widely  recognized, this change would not be sufficient to overcome the long-term  fiscal challenges confronting the nation.  For example, the long-term fiscal  imbalance would not come close to being eliminated even if Social Security  benefits were to be limited to currently projected trust fund revenues,  because Medicare and Medicaid\u2014spending for which is driven by both  demographics and rising health care costs\u2014present an even greater  problem.", "While addressing the challenges of Social Security and Medicare is key to  ensuring future fiscal flexibility, a fundamental review of major programs,  policies, and operations can create much-needed fiscal flexibility to  address emerging needs.  As I have stated previously, it is healthy for the  nation periodically to review and update its programs, activities, and  priorities.  Many federal programs and policies were designed years ago to  respond to earlier challenges.  Ultimately, the federal government should  strive to hand to the next generation the legacy of a government that is  effective and relevant to a changing society\u2014a government that is as free  as possible of outmoded commitments and operations that can  inappropriately encumber the future.", "A reexamination of existing programs and policies could help weed out  items that have proven to be outdated or persistently ineffective or  alternatively could prompt us to update and modernize activities through  such actions as improving program targeting and efficiency, consolidation,  or reengineering of processes and operations.  Such a review should not be  limited to only spending programs but should include the full range of tools  of governance that the federal government uses to address national  objectives.  These tools include loans and loan guarantees, tax  expenditures, and regulations.", "In the last decade the Congress put in place a series of laws designed to  improve information about cost and performance.  This framework and the  information it provides can help structure and inform the debate about  what the federal government should do.  In addition, GAO has identified a  number of areas warranting reconsideration based on program  performance, targeting, and costs.", "The events of the past few years have served to highlight the benefits of  fiscal flexibility.  Addressing the long-term drivers in the budget is essential  to preserving any flexibility in the long term.  In the nearer term, a  fundamental review of existing programs and policies can also create  much-needed fiscal flexibility.  In this regard, the federal government must  determine how best to address the necessary structural challenges in a  reasonably timely manner in order to identify specific actions that need to  be taken.

Accordingly, today\u2019s  budget decisions involve tradeoffs between meeting current needs and  fulfilling stewardship responsibilities.

Figure 2 illustrates  some of these claims on future federal resources.", "A better understanding and more transparency about these \u201cfiscal  exposures\u201d is needed.  The budget needs to employ new metrics and  measures and processes\u2014relying more on long-term estimates and present  value concepts in making resource allocation decisions.  Neither current  budget reporting nor financial statements are designed to promote the  recognition and explicit consideration of all of these exposures. Our  nation\u2019s fiscal exposures cover a wide range:  from explicit liabilities to  implicit promises embedded in current policy or public expectations.   Some, like accounts payable and loan guarantees, are included in both the  budget and financial statements and some are not.  Others, such as liability  for environmental cleanup, are reported in the financial statements, but  only a single year\u2019s figures are in the budget.  Some implicit exposures,  such as future Social Security and Medicare benefits, are not included in  the budget or reported as liabilities in the financial statements but are  captured in long-range budget projections.  Other implicit exposures, such  as the risk assumed by insurance programs, may not be captured in either  budget or financial reporting.", "The failure to understand and address these fiscal exposures can have  significant consequences, encumbering future budgets and reducing fiscal  flexibility.  Further, the failure to capture the long-term costs of a proposal  or decision limits the Congress\u2019s ability to control fiscal exposures at the  time it is being asked to make the decision.", "As the figure makes clear, there is wide diversity in the nature of these  fiscal exposures.  This diversity suggests that it would be most useful to  look at different types of fiscal exposures and tailor metrics and changes to  address each type.   We recently recommended that OMB report annually  on fiscal exposures, including a concise list and description and cost  estimates where possible.   We also recommended that, where possible,  OMB report the estimated costs associated with certain exposures as a new  budget concept\u2014\u201cexposure level\u201d\u2014as a notational item in the President\u2019s  budget.   These two steps would help alert both the public and policy  makers about the long-term implications of programs, policies and  activities.", "It is important to recognize that for trust funds, greater transparency and  fuller disclosure means going beyond trust fund balances or solvency  measures. For federal trust funds the balances do not provide meaningful  information about program sustainability.  These balances do not increase  the government\u2019s ability to meet long-term commitments.  Nor do they  necessarily represent the full future cost of existing promises. For example,  the projected exhaustion date of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is  a commonly used indicator of HI\u2019s financial condition.  Under the Trustees\u2019  2003 intermediate estimates, the HI Trust Fund is projected to exhaust its  assets in 2026.  Long before that, however, HI\u2019s program outlays will exceed  program tax revenues.  Under the Trustees\u2019 2003 intermediate estimates,  this will begin in 2013.  To finance program cash deficits, HI will need to  draw on the special-issue Treasury securities acquired during the years of  cash surpluses.  For HI to \u201credeem\u201d its securities, the government will need  to obtain cash through some combination of increased taxes, spending  cuts, and/or increased borrowing from the public (or, if the unified budget  is in surplus, less debt reduction than would otherwise have been the case).    HI\u2019s negative cash flow will place increased pressure on the federal budget  to raise the resources necessary to meet the program\u2019s ongoing costs.", "Ultimately, the critical question is not how much a trust fund has in assets,  but whether the government as a whole and the economy can afford the  promised benefits now and in the future and at what cost to other claims on  available resources.  Extending a trust fund\u2019s solvency without reforms to  make the underlying program more sustainable can create a false sense of  security and delay needed reform.  Because the balances can be  misleading, we need to reconsider how trust funds, and the nonmarketable  federal government securities contained therein, are treated in both the  budget and the federal government\u2019s financial statements.", "Today the Congress and President Bush face the challenge of sorting out  these many claims on the federal budget without the budget enforcement  mechanisms or fiscal benchmarks that guided the federal government  through the years of deficit reduction.  However, it is still the case that the  federal government needs a decision-making framework that permits it to  evaluate choices against both today\u2019s needs and the longer-term fiscal  future that will be handed to future generations.

HHS\u2019s  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has initiated projects to  improve the precision of Medicare fee-for-service improper payment  estimates and aid in the development of corrective actions to reduce  improper payment losses.

In February 2002, IRS estimated  that taxpayers filed returns for tax year 1999 claiming at least $8.5 billion in  invalid EITCs, of which only $1.2 billion (14 percent) either was recovered  or was expected to be recovered through compliance efforts.  Although the  full extent of refunds resulting from invalid EITCs is unknown, IRS has not  routinely estimated the potential magnitude of invalid refunds and has not  disclosed an annual estimate of improper payments in its financial reports.

For example, in accordance with one of the business  rules, beginning in fiscal year 2003 for intragovernmental investments with  Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), BPD and trading partner  agencies are required to use the same method for recording amortization  on market-based notes, bonds, and zero coupon securities.

An additional net $12.5 billion and $3.9 billion of  unreconciled transactions were improperly recorded in net cost for fiscal  years 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Our hope is that all CFO Act agencies and the new  DHS will follow suit in future years.  In this regard, last year, in response to  major breakdowns in corporate accountability, auditing, and corporate  governance in the private sector, the Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 to, among other things, improve quality and transparency in  financial reporting and independent audits of publicly traded companies  (\u201cissuers\u201d).

In addition, an issuer\u2019s  auditor is required to attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the  management of the issuer on the effectiveness of internal control over  financial reporting.
