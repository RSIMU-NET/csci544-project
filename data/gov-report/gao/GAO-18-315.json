The fifth state, Texas, had not conducted any such investigations at the time of GAO's review. Fraudulent activities identified by state investigators included schemes in which recovery housing operators recruited individuals with SUD to specific recovery homes and treatment providers, who then billed patients' insurance for extensive and unnecessary drug testing for the purposes of profit. For example, officials from the Florida state attorney's office told GAO that SUD treatment providers were paying $300 to $500 or more per week to recovery housing operators for every patient they referred for treatment and were billing patients' insurance for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary drug testing over the course of several months. Some of these investigations have resulted in arrests and other actions, such as changes to insurance payment policies. Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah established state certification or licensure programs for recovery housing in 2014 and 2015 to formally increase oversight.

First, under its Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant, SAMHSA makes at least $100,000 available annually to each state to provide loans to organizations seeking to establish recovery homes. Second, states have discretion to use SAMHSA funding available under a 2-year grant for 2017 and 2018 primarily for opioid use disorder treatment services, to establish recovery homes or for recovery housing-related activities.

Alcohol- and drug-free housing for individuals recovering  from SUD may be referred to as \u201crecovery residences,\u201d \u201csober homes,\u201d or  other terms. NARR has defined four levels of recovery housing (I through  IV) based on the type and intensity of recovery support and staffing they  offer, up to and including residential, or clinical, treatment centers. For  the purposes of this report, we use the term \u201crecovery housing\u201d to refer to  peer-run, nonclinical living environments for individuals recovering from  SUD in general, and \u201crecovery homes\u201d to refer to specific homes. These  homes generally are not considered to be residential treatment centers,  not eligible to be licensed providers for the purposes of billing private  insurance or public programs\u2014such as Medicaid and Medicare\u2014and  residents typically have to pay rent and other housing expenses  themselves. Recovery home residents may separately undergo outpatient  clinical SUD treatment, which is typically covered by health insurance. In  addition, recovery homes may encourage residents to participate in  mutual aid or self-help groups (e.g., 12-step programs such as Alcoholics  Anonymous) and may require residents to submit to drug screenings to  verify their sobriety. Residents may be referred to recovery homes by  treatment providers, the criminal justice system, or may voluntarily seek  out such living environments.", "In addition to SAMHSA, two national nonprofit organizations that have  missions dedicated to recovery housing include NARR and Oxford  House, Inc.

As of January 2018, NARR\u2019s  membership comprised 27 state affiliates that work to promote and  support NARR\u2019s quality standards for recovery housing and other  activities in their states. Of the 27 NARR affiliates, 15 were actively  certifying recovery homes. Oxford House, Inc. connects individual Oxford  Houses across the United States and in other countries. Individual Oxford  Houses, which operate under charters granted by Oxford House, Inc., are  democratically run, self-supporting homes. According to the Oxford  House manual and related documents, all Oxford Houses are rentals, and  residents are responsible for sharing expenses, paying house bills on  time, and immediately evicting residents who drink or use illicit drugs  while living in the house. Oxford House, Inc. maintains a directory of  houses on its website, and individuals can search this directory for  vacancies by state. Oxford Houses align with NARR\u2019s definition of level I  residences; that is, peer-run, self-funded, typically single family homes  where residents have an open-ended length of stay.", "SAMHSA and other organizations recognize recovery housing as an  important step in SUD treatment and recovery. Research has shown  positive outcomes of recovery housing on long-term sobriety, such as at  6-, 12-, and 18-month follow up.

An official from the fifth  state, Texas, told us that the state had not conducted any recent law  enforcement investigations related to recovery housing. This official, from  the Texas Department of Insurance, told us that the department received  two fraud reports in 2014 and 2016 related to recovery homes and that  the state was unable to sufficiently corroborate the reports to begin  investigations.", "Across the four states, officials told us that potential insurance fraud may  have relied on unscrupulous relationships between SUD treatment  providers, including laboratories, and recovery housing operators,  because recovery homes are not considered eligible providers for the  purposes of billing health insurance. For example, treatment providers  may form unscrupulous relationships with recovery housing operators  who then recruit individuals with SUD in order to refer or require residents  to see the specific SUD treatment providers. This practice is known as  patient brokering, for which recovery housing operators receive kickbacks  such as cash or other remuneration from the treatment provider in  exchange for patient referrals. The extent of potential fraud differed  across the four states, as discussed below.", "Officials from several state agencies and related entities described  investigations into fraud related to recovery housing in southeastern  Florida as extensive, although the scope of the fraud within the industry is  unknown. In 2016, the state attorney for the 15th judicial circuit (Palm  Beach County) convened a task force composed of law enforcement  officials tasked with investigating and prosecuting individuals engaged in  fraud and abuse in the SUD treatment and recovery housing industries.  The task force found that unscrupulous recovery housing operators or  associated SUD treatment providers were luring individuals into recovery  homes using deceptive marketing tactics. Deceptive marketing practices  included online or other materials that willfully misdirected individuals or  their family members to recruiters with the goal of sending these  individuals to specific treatment providers, in order to receive payments  from those treatment providers for patient referrals. According to officials  from the Florida state attorney\u2019s office, these individuals, often from out of  state, were lured with promises of free airfare, rent, and other amenities  to recover in southern Florida\u2019s beach climate. Recruiters brokered these  individuals to SUD treatment providers, who then billed their private  insurance plans for extensive and medically unnecessary urine drug  testing and other services. Officials from the Florida state attorney\u2019s  office told us that SUD treatment providers were paying $300 to $500 or  more per week to recovery housing operators or their staff members for  every patient they referred for treatment. In addition, these officials cited  one case in which a SUD treatment provider billed a patient\u2019s insurance  for close to $700,000 for urine drug testing in a 7-month period. Officials  from the state attorney\u2019s office noted that the recovery homes that the  task force was investigating were not shared housing in the traditional,  supportive sense, such as Oxford Houses, where residents equally share  in the rent and division of chores, but rather existed as \u201cwarehouses\u201d  intended to exploit vulnerable individuals.", "As a result of these investigations, as of December 2017, law  enforcement agencies had charged more than 40 individuals primarily  with patient brokering, with at least 13 of those charged being convicted  and fined or sentenced to jail time, according to the state attorney\u2019s  office. In addition, the state enacted a law that strengthened penalties  under Florida\u2019s patient brokering statute and gave the Florida Office of  Statewide Prosecution, within the Florida Attorney General\u2019s Office,  authority to investigate and prosecute patient brokering.", "An official from the Massachusetts Medicaid Fraud Control Unit told us  that the unit began investigating cases of Medicaid fraud in the state on  the part of independent clinical laboratories associated with recovery  homes in 2007. The unit found that, in some cases, the laboratories  owned recovery homes and were self-referring residents for urine drug  testing. In other cases, the laboratories were paying kickbacks to  recovery homes for patient referrals for urine drug testing that was not  medically necessary. According to the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit  official, as a result of these investigations the state settled with nine  laboratories between 2007 and 2015 for more than $40 million in  restitution. In addition, the state enacted a law in 2014 prohibiting clinical  laboratory self-referrals and revised its Medicaid regulations in 2013 to  prohibit coverage of urine drug testing for the purposes of residential  monitoring.", "Ohio has also begun to investigate an instance of potential insurance  fraud related to recovery housing, including patient brokering and  excessive billing for urine drug testing. Officials from the Ohio Medicaid  Fraud Control Unit told us that the unit began investigating a Medicaid  SUD treatment provider for paying kickbacks to recovery homes in  exchange for patient referrals, excessive billing for urine drug testing, and  billing for services not rendered, based on an allegation the unit received  in September 2016. As of January 2018, the investigation was ongoing,  and the Ohio Medicaid Fraud Control Unit had not yet taken legal or other  action against any providers. Officials from other state agencies and  related state entities, such as the state substance abuse agency and the  state NARR affiliate, were not aware of any investigations of potential  fraud on the part of recovery housing operators or associated treatment  providers when we spoke with them and stated that this type of fraud was  not widespread across the state.", "In August 2017, officials from the Utah Insurance Department told us that  the department is conducting ongoing investigations of private insurance  fraud similar to the activities occurring in Florida, as a result of a large  influx of complaints and referrals it received in 2015. These officials told  us that the department has received complaints and allegations that SUD  treatment providers are paying recruiters to bring individuals with SUD  who are being released from jail to treatment facilities or recovery homes;  billing private insurance for therapeutic services, such as group or equine  therapy, that are not being provided, in addition to billing frequently for  urine drug testing; and encouraging patients to use drugs prior to  admission to qualify patients and bill their insurance for more intensive  treatment. In addition, insurance department officials told us that they  believed providers are enrolling individuals in private insurance plans  without telling them and paying their premiums and copays. According to  these officials, when doing so, providers may lie about patients\u2019 income  status in order to qualify them for more generous plans. Officials found  that providers were billing individual patients\u2019 insurance $15,000 to  $20,000 a month for urine drug testing and other services. Officials noted  that they suspect that the alleged fraud was primarily being carried out by  SUD treatment providers and treatment facilities that also own recovery  homes. Officials told us that the department has not been able to file  charges against any treatment providers because it has been unable to  collect the necessary evidence to do so. However, according to insurance  department officials, the state legislature enacted legislation in 2016 that  gives insurers and state regulatory agencies, such as the state insurance  department and state licensing office, the authority to review patient  records and investigate providers that bill insurers.

Florida enacted  legislation in 2015 and Massachusetts enacted legislation in 2014 that  established voluntary certification programs for recovery housing. Florida  established a two-part program for both recovery homes and recovery  housing administrators (i.e., individuals acting as recovery housing  managers or operators). According to officials from the Florida state  attorney\u2019s office and Massachusetts Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, their  states established these programs in part as a result of state law  enforcement investigations. In 2014, Utah enacted legislation to establish  a mandatory licensure program for recovery housing. According to  officials from the Utah substance abuse agency and the state licensing  office, the state established its licensure program to, in part, protect  residents\u2019 safety and prevent their exploitation and abuse.", "Although state recovery housing programs in Florida and Massachusetts  are voluntary and recovery homes and their administrators can operate  without being certified, there are incentives for homes to become certified  under these states\u2019 programs, as well as incentives to become licensed  under Utah\u2019s program. Specifically, all three states require that certain  providers refer patients only to recovery homes certified or licensed by  their state program. Thus, uncertified and unlicensed homes in Florida,  Massachusetts, and Utah would be ineligible to receive patient referrals  from certain treatment providers. Further, state officials told us that state  agencies are taking steps to ensure providers are making appropriate  referrals. For example, according to officials from the Florida substance  abuse agency, treatment providers may refer patients to certified recovery  homes managed by certified recovery home administrators only and must  keep referral records. These officials also told us that the state substance  abuse agency can investigate providers to ensure they are referring  patients to certified homes and issue fines or revoke providers\u2019 licenses if  the program finds providers are referring patients to uncertified homes.  Recovery homes may also view certification as a way to demonstrate that  they meet quality standards. For example, the official from the  Massachusetts NARR affiliate told us that some residential treatment  centers that are required to be licensed by the state are also seeking  certification to demonstrate that they meet the NARR affiliate\u2019s quality  standards.", "To become state-certified or licensed, recovery homes in Florida,  Massachusetts, and Utah must meet certain program requirements\u2014 including staff training, documentation submissions (such as housing  policies and code of ethics), and onsite inspections to demonstrate  compliance with program standards\u2014though specific requirements differ  across the three states. For example, while all three state programs  require recovery housing operators or staff to complete training, the  number of hours and training topics differ. In addition, for recovery homes  to be considered certified in Florida, they must have a certified recovery  housing administrator. Similar to Florida\u2019s certification program for the  homes, individuals seeking administrator certification must also meet  certain program requirements, such as training in recovery residence  operations and administration and legal, professional, and ethical  responsibilities. Features of the state-established oversight programs may  also differ across the three states, including program type, type of home  eligible for certification or licensure, how states administer their programs,  and initial fees. See table 1 for additional information on features of state- established oversight programs for recovery housing.", "State-established oversight programs in Florida, Massachusetts, and  Utah also include processes to monitor certified or licensed recovery  homes and take action when homes do not comply with program  standards. For example, an official from the Florida Association of  Recovery Residences\u2014the state NARR affiliate and organization that  certifies recovery homes in Florida\u2014told us that the entity conducts  random inspections to ensure that recovery homes maintain compliance  with program standards. State-established oversight programs in the  three states also have processes for investigating grievances filed against  certified or licensed recovery homes. Further, officials from certifying or  licensing bodies in all three states\u2014the Florida Association of Recovery  Residences, Massachusetts Alliance for Sober Housing, and the Utah  Office of Licensing\u2014told us their organizations may take a range of  actions when they receive complaints or identify homes that do not  comply with program standards, from issuing recommendations for  bringing homes into compliance to revoking certificates or licenses.  According to officials from the certifying body in Florida, the entity has  revoked certificates of recovery homes that have acted egregiously or  have been nonresponsive to corrective action plans. Officials from the  certifying and licensing bodies in Massachusetts and Utah told us that  these entities had not revoked certificates or licenses when we spoke to  them for this review, but may have assisted homes with coming into  compliance with certification standards or licensure requirements.", "Officials from Ohio and Texas told us that their states had not established  state oversight programs like those that exist in Florida, Massachusetts,  and Utah, but their states had provided technical assistance and other  resources to recovery homes that were intended to increase consistency,  accountability, and quality:", "Officials from the Ohio substance abuse agency told us that since  2013 the state has revised its regulatory code to define recovery  housing and minimum requirements for such housing. Officials also  told us that the agency does not have authority to establish a state  certification or licensure program for recovery housing. According to  these officials, the state legislature wanted to ensure that Ohio\u2019s  recovery housing community maintained its grassroots efforts and did  not want a certification or licensure program to serve as a roadblock  to establishing additional homes. However, officials from the Ohio  substance abuse agency told us that the agency encourages recovery  homes to seek certification by the state NARR affiliate\u2014Ohio  Recovery Housing\u2014to demonstrate quality. In addition, these officials  told us that the state substance abuse agency also provided start-up  funds for Ohio Recovery Housing and has continued to fund the  affiliate for it to provide training and technical assistance, as well as to  continue certifying recovery homes.

Texas and Ohio also used a portion of  their SAMHSA opioid grant funding for recovery housing. For example, in  fiscal year 2017, officials from Ohio\u2019s substance abuse agency told us  that the state used $25,000 of its approximately $26 million in opioid grant  funding to support and train recovery housing operators, with the goal of  increasing the number of recovery homes that accept individuals who  receive medication-assisted treatment. The other states we reviewed\u2014 Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah\u2014did not opt to use the loan funding  available under the SAMHSA block grant and did not use their SAMHSA  opioid grant funding for recovery housing services, according to state  officials.", "Four of the five states in our review\u2014Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, and  Texas\u2014have used state funding to establish and support recovery  housing and recovery housing-related activities. For example, officials  from the Texas substance abuse agency told us that, since 2013, the  state legislature has authorized at least $520,000 annually for recovery  housing. In fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the state used this funding for  personnel costs and related expenditures, such as hiring seven Oxford  House outreach workers and establishing a state loan fund of $200,000 to  supplement the SAMHSA loan funding to support the establishment of an  additional 25 new Oxford Houses. Officials from the Massachusetts  substance abuse agency told us that the agency has received annual  state appropriations in the amount of $500,000 since fiscal year 2015 to  contract with the entities that inspect and certify recovery homes for the  state certification program and to contract with the state NARR affiliate for  technical assistance with developing recovery housing certification  standards and supporting the certification process. State substance  abuse agency officials from the fifth state, Utah, told us that the state did  not use state funding to establish recovery homes during fiscal years  2013 through 2017.
