This report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat, and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO conducted a literature review; reviewed documentation from FDA, USDA, and stakeholder groups; analyzed public comments submitted to the agencies; compared agency efforts with leading practices for interagency collaboration; and conducted site visits to selected cell-cultured meat firms."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat\u2014food products grown from the cells of livestock, poultry, and seafood\u2014is available. However, no company is commercially producing cell-cultured meat. Specific information about the technology being used, eventual commercial production methods, and composition of the final products is not yet known. The general process contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing (see figure). The technology and methods to be used for commercial production are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not have clarity about many specifics about the process and final product. For example, it is unclear whether production methods and products will use or contain genetically-engineered cells or medications such as antibiotics.", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have begun collaborating on regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For example, in 2019, the agencies signed an interagency agreement and created three working groups to carry out the terms of the agreement. However, the agreement and working groups could more fully incorporate practices to enhance and sustain collaboration, such as defining outcomes. For example, the agreement identifies the development of labeling principles as an outcome, but does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward this outcome, and the working groups identify a lead agency but not members' roles. Also, agency officials said they decided FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, but they have not formally announced or documented this decision. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is also a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By fully incorporating leading practices into their efforts to collaborate, the agencies could minimize potential overlap and fragmentation, use resources in a more efficient manner, and better ensure the public and other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies' oversight responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies' interagency agreement.

Although the companies are not yet selling cell- cultured meat, some firms report that their products are likely to become  available to consumers in coming years. Furthermore, in 2017, the  National Academy of Sciences identified cell-cultured meat as a  biotechnology product that has high growth potential. Cell-cultured meat  forms a part of the emerging field of cellular agriculture, which seeks to  produce conventional agricultural products from cell cultures. Livestock  and poultry account for over half of U.S. agricultural cash sales, often  exceeding $100 billion per year. However, the potential introduction of  cell-cultured meat into the nation\u2019s food supply has raised questions  about its safety. Likewise, claims that it can be produced with less impact  on the environment than conventional meat and that it may offer health  and animal welfare benefits have also been questioned.", "The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are  the federal agencies with primary responsibility for the oversight of food  safety.

FDA and USDA jointly  hosted a public meeting in October 2018 to discuss the potential hazards,  oversight considerations, and labeling of cell-cultured food products  derived from livestock and poultry tissue. In November 2018, FDA and  USDA announced that they planned to jointly oversee the production of  cell-cultured meat derived from livestock and poultry, with FDA  overseeing cell collection and growth and USDA overseeing the later  stages of production and labeling. The agencies explained that they  believed this oversight model would leverage both FDA\u2019s experience regulating cell culture technology and USDA\u2019s expertise in regulating  livestock and poultry products for human consumption. Because of  potential risks to public health and safety, we added federal oversight of  food safety to our High Risk List in 2007, where it remains today.", "You asked us to review federal oversight of cell-cultured meat. This report  (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing  cell-cultured meat and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA  are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat.", "To address these objectives, we conducted a literature review of journal  and media articles from 2016 through 2019 to inform our understanding of  cell-cultured meat as well as regulatory activity in the United States and in  other countries. We also reviewed documents collected from FDA and  USDA, such as their 2019 interagency agreement, as well as documents  collected from cell-cultured meat firms and consumer safety groups,  among others. In addition, we attended FDA and USDA\u2019s October 2018  public meeting and four conferences in 2019 that included content  pertaining to food safety or cell-cultured meat. We also conducted site  visits to two conventional meat-processing facilities in Georgia, three cell- cultured meat firms in California, an academic cell-culturing laboratory in  California, and a medical cell-culturing facility in Maryland.

We define cell-cultured seafood as a subcategory of cell-cultured meat.  When referencing conventional meat, we are referring to food produced  from the traditional method of slaughtering an animal, such as a cow,  hog, chicken, or fish. When referencing seafood, we are referring to  shellfish, sea fish, and freshwater fish served as food.", "To describe what is known about the commercial production methods for  cell-cultured meat, in addition to the steps described above, we reviewed  two sets of public comments submitted to FDA and USDA in 2018.", "To examine the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to  provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat, we identified efforts the  two agencies took to collaborate in this area from July 2018 through April  2020 by reviewing agency documentation and public announcements and  interviewing federal officials. We then compared these efforts with the  seven leading practices for interagency collaboration.

In general, FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of virtually  all domestic and imported food products except those regulated by  USDA. USDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry,  processed egg products, and catfish. FDA and USDA cooperate with  states, tribes, and local food safety and public health agencies to carry  out their federal responsibilities. FDA and USDA carry out their  responsibilities in part through inspections of facilities where food is  produced. The frequency of inspections the agencies conduct varies, as  follows:", "FDA. FDA\u2019s authority requires a risk-based approach, in which  inspection rates vary depending on the level of risk associated with a  food product. FDA conducts risk-based inspections of high-risk and  non-high-risk food facilities. For example, the FDA Food Safety  Modernization Act, signed into law in 2011, specified that FDA had to  inspect all high-risk domestic facilities at least every 3 years.", "USDA. Depending on the type of facility, USDA conducts inspections  at least once per operating shift or maintains a constant presence.  Specifically, USDA conducts carcass-by-carcass inspection at all  federally inspected meat and poultry slaughter facilities and verifies  that these establishments follow all food safety and humane handling  requirements. At facilities that process meat and poultry products,  USDA conducts inspections at least once per production shift,  following the agency\u2019s longstanding interpretation of its statutes  requiring it to do so.", "Among other things, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires  that food additives be approved by FDA before they can be lawfully used  in foods. Substances added to food are considered unsafe unless the  agency establishes that the use of the food additive, under specific  conditions for use, will be safe, or unless the substance is generally  recognized as safe (GRAS) under the conditions of its intended use among qualified experts. As we reported in 2010, the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act exempts GRAS substances from the act\u2019s general  requirement that companies obtain FDA approval before marketing food  containing a new additive. GRAS substances include hundreds of  spices and artificial flavors, emulsifiers and binders, vitamins and  minerals, and preservatives that manufacturers add to enhance a food\u2019s  taste, texture, nutritional content, or shelf life. The GRAS exemption  allows companies, without notice to or approval from FDA, to determine  whether there is enough support to claim a substance is GRAS. For a  company to claim a substance is GRAS, it must conclude that there is  common knowledge about the safety of the substance among experts  qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety.", "In addition, as part of their oversight of the food supply, FDA and USDA  oversee food labeling of the products under their respective jurisdictions.  USDA, by statute, is charged with assuring that products under its  jurisdiction, including meat, poultry, and catfish, in interstate or foreign  commerce are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. USDA develops  and applies the labeling requirements for these products, and food  manufacturers are responsible for complying with the USDA labeling rules  and adhering to the process maintained by USDA for the evaluation and  approval of these product labels. Consistent with its statutes, USDA  requires preapproval of all labels before manufacturers can market their  products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the  misbranding of food, which includes food labeling that is false or  misleading. Consistent with its statutes, FDA ensures that foods within its  jurisdiction are not misbranded by focusing on the labels of products  already in the market.

In the case of genetically modified plants, there  are no specific regulations addressing products resulting from the  manipulation of the genetic material of living seeds. However, under FDA  policy, new genetically engineered crop varieties are treated like other  foods (including their conventional counterparts) under the Federal Food  Drug and Cosmetic Act and may not contain either unapproved food  additives or contaminants that would adulterate the food. In 1995, FDA  established a voluntary pre-market consultation process through which  companies are encouraged to notify the agency before marketing a food  produced from a genetically modified crop and voluntarily submit a  summary of the developer-performed safety assessment. FDA evaluates  the safety assessment for any issues that need to be addressed and  works with the developer to resolve those issues. In the case of  irradiated foods, companies seeking approval for a source of radiation  used to treat a food may submit a food additive petition to FDA  demonstrating the safety of the proposed use.

(See fig. 2.)", "The five-phase process is generally as follows:  1.  Biopsy. A biopsy is taken by collecting rice-sized tissue samples from  an animal, such as livestock, chicken, or fish. During this and  subsequent phases, specific laboratory sanitation procedures are  followed, and antibiotics may be used in order to avoid or minimize  contamination from bacteria.", "Growth Media  According to researchers and representatives  from cell-cultured meat firms, the growth  media for cell-cultured meat often contains  fetal bovine serum, which is obtained from  blood drawn from a bovine fetus at slaughter.  However, researchers and representatives  from cell-culturing firms we spoke with said  they are working to develop growth media that  do not contain fetal bovine serum.  Representatives from some of these firms  also told us that the composition of the growth  media, including the exact ingredients and  their proportions, can vary based on the  specific needs of the cells and the variety of  serum used. For example, cell-cultured  seafood may have different growth media and  environmental requirements than cell-cultured  livestock and poultry.", "2.  Cell banking. Biopsied cells with the most desirable traits are  selected and either used immediately for cell growth or frozen to  create a cell bank for later use. These desirable traits can be  obtained by either selecting existing cells or using genetic engineering  methods to insert, delete, or edit the DNA to target desired traits in  cells. Examples of desirable traits may include cells that divide  quickly, cells that divide a greater number of times, cells that result in  a reduced cholesterol or fat content or other desirable nutritional traits,  or cells that are more resilient to environmental factors, such as  temperature, than other cells. According to agency officials and  representatives from cell-cultured meat firms, this phase represents  an important opportunity to ensure that the source cells used to  initiate commercial production are free of pathogens or other  contaminants.   3.  Growth. During the cell growth phase, cells are placed in a bioreactor  and begin to divide and differentiate. A bioreactor is a container that  creates an environment that can sustain the growth of cells and  includes the ability to control factors such as temperature, pH, and  oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. Bioreactors can vary in  size, including microwave-sized and refrigerator-sized units, but could  be as large as 20 to 30 feet tall in commercial production. Bioreactors  contain a growth medium, which may include ingredients such as  glucose, amino acids, hormones and other growth factors, and other  basic nutrients that cells need to consume in order to thrive. In  addition to the medium needed for growth, the cells may need to be  attached to a structure, referred to as a scaffold, to properly develop  into cell-cultured meat.   4.  Harvest. Once the cells have divided to form a sufficiently large  amount of cell-cultured meat, producers remove\u2014or harvest\u2014it from  the growth medium and bioreactor. If a scaffold was used to provide a  structure for cells to grow on, then the cell-cultured meat would either  be separated from the scaffold during harvesting or left attached to an  edible scaffold.   5.  Food processing. The harvested cell-cultured meat is then prepared  into a product such as meatballs or chicken nuggets. In the future,  products similar to intact cuts of meat such as steak or chicken breast  may be produced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Technology to Commercially Produce Cell-Cultured Meat Is in Development, and the Eventual Commercial Production Methods and Aspects of a Final Product Are Not Yet Known", "paragraphs": ["The technology to produce cell-cultured meat at a commercial scale is still  in development, and information about the methods to be used for  commercial production and the composition of the final product are not  yet known. In the continuum of moving a technology from innovation to  commercialization, cell-cultured meat firms are in the middle stage of  building and testing their prototypes, based on our discussions with  representatives from these firms. Consequently, they have not finalized  aspects of the technology and eventual commercial production methods  to be used or the composition of the final product. As a result, certain  information is not yet available to stakeholders\u2014including cell-cultured  meat firms themselves, regulators, and the public\u2014about specific aspects  of the technology and commercial production methods that will be used,  such as the composition of the growth medium and of the final products.", "In addition to technology development, the scarcity of publicly available  research on cell-cultured meat production limits information available to  agency officials and the public. Each cell-cultured meat firm is developing  detailed information on its own eventual commercial production methods for making cell-cultured meat. However, the firms, similar to other  technology start-ups, are reluctant to disclose intellectual property and  business-sensitive information due to concerns about competition. For  example, one firm told us that they can reverse engineer parts of another  company\u2019s commercial production method by seeing pictures of the  equipment the other company is using. In addition, cell-cultured meat  firms compete with other firms for funding from sources such as venture  capitalists, foreign governments, and conventional meat companies.", "This competition for funding contributes to firms being reluctant to share  information they consider important intellectual property, such as parts of  their production processes. As a result, agency officials and other  stakeholders told us that they must largely rely on whatever information  the cell-cultured meat firms are willing to provide to understand details of  the companies\u2019 prototype processes and products. This limitation can  affect agencies\u2019 ability to make regulatory and other decisions.  Specifically, FDA and USDA officials said they have limited information on  cell-cultured meat production methods and products and need more in  order to regulate this new food. One USDA official explained that the  agency cannot establish labeling requirements if the agency does not  know the nutritional profile of the final product. For example, if the  scaffold on which the cell-cultured meat is grown is not edible, the  agencies may require firms to disclose certain aspects of their  commercial production methods, such as how they removed the cell- cultured meat from the scaffold. However, if the scaffold is edible, it will  affect the final composition of the product, which may require different  labeling than a product that was developed without edible scaffolding.", "This lack of information results in unanswered questions about cell- cultured meat as it relates to the eventual technology and commercial  production methods to be used and the composition of the final products.  Among other things, this lack of information creates challenges for  industry and federal regulatory agencies as cell-cultured meat nears  commercialization. The sources we reviewed and stakeholders we talked  to identified a number of open questions, including the following:", "Tissue collection. How often will producers need to collect biopsy  samples from animals, and what animals will be used? Some  stakeholders have stated concerns about whether, and how,  regulators will ensure that biopsies are collected from healthy animals.  For example, one cell-cultured meat firm stated that tissue samples  would be taken from slaughtered donor animals that met federal  standards for conventional processing at the time of slaughter.  However, USDA and FDA have not indicated whether they would  require cell-cultured meat firms to do so. Additionally, representatives  from cell-cultured meat firms stated that they did not yet know how  frequently they would need to collect biopsies from animals for  commercial-level production. Additionally, according to researchers,  there are too many unknowns to accurately estimate how much cell- cultured meat could be produced from a single biopsy of animal  tissue.", "Genetic engineering. Will commercial production methods involve  genetic engineering? Some stakeholders expressed concern that the  use of genetic engineering in cell-cultured meat production could  cause the product to experience a lengthy wait for regulatory  approval, similar to that for genetically engineered salmon, which took  approximately 20 years. One representative from a cell-cultured meat  firm noted that uncertainty about pending government regulations  could negatively affect firms\u2019 ability to attract and retain investors.  Representatives from some firms said understanding what regulatory  requirements will look like might influence which scientific pathways  they pursue as they continue to develop their commercial production  methods. According to FDA officials and representatives from one  cell-cultured meat firm, it is likely that some firms will use genetic  engineering in their commercial cell-cultured meat production  methods. However, representatives from two other cell-cultured meat  firms told us they were undecided as to whether they would use  genetic engineering in their commercial production methods.", "Antibiotics. Will antibiotics be used to make cell-cultured meat, and  will residues be present in the final product? According to agency  officials, the presence of antibiotics in commercial production and the  potential for residues in the resulting product would represent a  significant potential concern for food safety and public health. Officials  stated that they would not expect antibiotics to be used past the cell- banking phase. Representatives from cell-cultured meat firms we  spoke to differed on whether they planned to use antibiotics in their  commercial production process, but they had not finalized their  decisions. According to one firm, if antibiotics are used, the use would  be limited both in quantity and duration.", "Growth medium. What type of growth medium will producers use,  and how might variations in the media affect the final product?  According to agency officials and other stakeholders, the ingredients  used in the growth medium could affect the end product\u2019s composition  and raise potential safety concerns. For example, FDA officials stated  that residual growth factors, such as hormones, in the final product  would be something they would likely evaluate in premarket  consultations. However, representatives from cell-cultured meat firms  stated that their firms have not finalized the medium they plan to use.  In addition, the formulation of the medium firms use could be an  important piece of intellectual property or confidential business  information.", "Scaffold. What type of scaffold will producers use, if any, and will it  be edible or inedible? The use of edible or food-grade scaffolds,  where they are used, will affect the composition of the product and  may need to be evaluated by federal agencies for safety. According to  USDA officials, the composition of edible scaffolding may also create  labeling and jurisdictional concerns. For example, USDA officials  stated that the addition of edible scaffolding may require significant  additional aspects of production to be subject to USDA jurisdiction.  Additionally, researchers have commented that a chemical separation  technique needed to separate some inedible scaffolds may also need  to be evaluated for potential safety concerns.", "Point of harvest. How will FDA and USDA define the point of  harvest? The point of harvest is the point at which FDA will transfer  oversight responsibilities, including inspections, to USDA.  Stakeholders have raised concerns that not having a clear definition  of the point of harvest could lead to challenges such as overlapping  inspection requirements or a gap in inspection. Representatives from  several cell-cultured meat firms we spoke to in the spring of 2019 said  it was ambiguous how FDA and USDA intended to define the point of  harvest. These representatives also said it is unclear how often each  agency plans to conduct inspections during the phases for which it is  responsible. Agency officials stated that they are working to develop  a detailed process for the transfer of jurisdiction, including defining the  point of harvest.", "Scaling up production. How will firms scale up production to  commercial levels? One 2018 study conducted by researchers in the  United Kingdom stated that to produce one pound of cell-cultured  meat, firms would need bioreactors at least 2 1/2 times larger than  what is currently available. Similarly, a senior FDA official stated that  the capacity of existing production equipment is a challenge for firms  seeking to produce cell-cultured meat products at a commercial scale.  As a result, the firms themselves may have to develop the equipment  or custom order such equipment. Representatives from one cell- cultured meat firm told us that they are interacting with equipment  providers to identify commercial-scale production equipment.", "Production cost. How will firms sell their product at a price point that  is both profitable to the firms and affordable to the consumer? Some  studies and stakeholders we interviewed, including representatives  from cell-cultured meat firms, said that the high production cost of cell- cultured meat is a key industry challenge. For example, in the last two  years, one firm reported that it cost $600 to make a cell-cultured meat  hamburger patty and reported that it cost about $1,200 to produce a  single cell-cultured meatball. One of the biggest cost drivers in the  production of cell-cultured meat is the growth medium, according to  some studies and some cell-cultured meat firms. To address issues of  cost and scale, some firms may develop their own, less expensive  growth media.", "Safety considerations. Are potential safety hazards in commercial  production methods for cell-cultured meat different from those for  conventional meat, and how will eventual commercial production  methods affect the overall safety of the product? According to agency  officials, cell-cultured meat may present different safety challenges  compared to conventional meat. For example, according to agency  officials, residues and constituents in harvested cell-cultured meat  would be expected to be different from those in conventional meat,  depending on the details of the production process. Representatives  from one cell-cultured meat firm told us that they likely will use food  processing techniques similar to those used for conventional meat,  abide by similar health and safety standards, and possibly share food  processing facilities. However, because specific information about  commercial production methods and final products is not yet known, it  is unclear whether cell-cultured meat produced on a commercial scale  will pose any hazards not present in conventional meat.", "Product composition. What will be the composition of any eventual  products? Agency officials told us that without knowing the  composition of a cell-cultured meat product, it is impossible to predict  how food safety and labeling requirements will apply. According to  representatives from some cell-cultured meat firms, initial cell-cultured  meat products most likely will not be composed entirely of cell- cultured meat but, rather, a mixture of cell-cultured meat and other  ingredients such as binding, flavoring ingredients, and plant-based  materials used in conventional food products. Some firms have  developed prototypes of cell-cultured meat products as part of their  research and development. In April 2019, representatives from one  firm told us that their prototype included about 90 percent plant-based  ingredients and 10 percent cell-cultured meat. However,  representatives from cell-cultured meat firms stated that they aim to  produce products that contain more cell-cultured meat than other  ingredients. For example, some cell-cultured meat firms have stated  that a long-term goal is to commercially produce cell-cultured meat  products that are similar to intact cuts of meat, such as steaks. As of  December 2019, these firms had not provided regulators with specific  information detailing the composition of their cell-cultured meat  prototypes, according to FDA and USDA officials.", "Environmental, animal welfare, and health impacts. How will cell- cultured meat impact the environment, animal welfare, or human  health, if at all? Cell-cultured meat firms and researchers have made  various claims about the potential environmental, animal welfare, and  health advantages of cell-cultured meat over conventionally produced  meat. For example, some cell-cultured meat firms have claimed that  cell-cultured meat production would use less water and emit less  greenhouse gases than conventional meat production. Some cell- cultured meat firms have also claimed that cell-cultured meat will  improve animal welfare because slaughter will be unnecessary.  Additionally, some stakeholders stated that because there is less  opportunity for contamination from animal feces\u2014a potential source of  contamination for conventional meat\u2014cell-cultured meat would be  less likely than conventional meat to contain foodborne pathogens.  However, there are disagreements regarding the accuracy of these  claims. Stakeholders told us that until commercial production methods  and final products are established, these claims about impacts on the  environment, animal welfare, and human health will remain  unsubstantiated.", "Timeline to market. When will cell-cultured meat products reach  consumers? As of December 2019, no cell-cultured meat products  were available for retail sale in the United States. Stakeholders give  varying estimates for when cell-cultured meat may be commercially  available. Some estimates suggest that firms may be able to  commercially produce some form of cell-cultured meat product as  soon as 2020, while others estimate that such products may not be  available for 2 to 4 years.", "Labeling. How will cell-cultured meat be labeled? Labeling was an  area of concern for representatives from both conventional and cell- cultured meat firms who explained that the specific terminology, such  as \u201cclean meat\u201d or \u201clab-grown meat,\u201d can sometimes reflect bias for,  or against, certain products, potentially affecting consumer  acceptance of these products. Additionally, stakeholders, as well as  agency officials, have emphasized the importance of labeling to  ensure consumers have accurate information about what they are  buying. For example, in February 2018 the United States Cattlemen\u2019s  Association submitted a petition to USDA requesting that the agency  limit the term \u201cbeef\u201d to products \u201cborn, raised, and harvested in a  traditional manner\u201d and \u201cmeat\u201d to mean the \u201ctissue or flesh of animals  that have been harvested in the traditional manner.\u201d USDA received  over 6,000 comments on the petition, and the agency had not  responded to the petition as of December 2019.
