Some land  management offices have also developed software to help them  assess risk areas and prioritize fuels treatment projects. For  example, figure 6 depicts a vegetation map, and figure 7 depicts a  map showing areas with increased risk of fires. Interestingly, an  area that the map identified as being at high risk of fire later  burned during the Hayman fire of 2002.", "Land management agencies also use geospatial products related to  the weather to aid in fire planning, detecting, and monitoring  activities.

For example, the Forest Service uses  satellite data to produce images of active fires. Also, the National  Interagency Fire Center manages an aerial infrared program that  flies aircraft equipped with infrared sensors over large fires to  detect heat and fire areas. These images contribute to the  development of daily fire perimeter maps. Figure 10 depicts a  satellite image of active fires. Figure 11 depicts a satellite image of  a fire perimeter, and figure 12 depicts an aerial infrared image and  a fire perimeter map based on that image. Some incident teams  also use fire growth modeling software to predict the growth of  wildland fires in terms of size, intensity, and spread, considering  variable terrain, fuels, and weather. Using this information, incident  managers are able to estimate short- and long-term fire behaviors,  plan for potential fires, communicate concerns and needs to state  and local governments and the public, and request and position  resources. Figure 13 shows the output of a fire behavior model.", "Geospatial technologies are also used to provide information on  active fires to the general public. The wildland fire community and  the U.S. Geological Survey established an Internet Web site, at  www.geomac.gov, to provide access to geospatial information  about active fires. This site allows visitors to identify the location  of wildland fires on a broad scale and then focus in to identify  information on the location and status of specific fires.

Users of geospatial information have noted problems  in acquiring compatible and comprehensive geospatial data. For  example, GIS specialists involved in fighting fires reported that  they did not have ready access to the geospatial data they needed.  They noted that some local jurisdictions have geospatial data, but  others do not. Further, they reported that the data from  neighboring jurisdictions are often incompatible. Geospatial  information specialists reported that the first days at a wildland  fire are spent trying to gather the geospatial information needed to  accurately map the fire. While concerns with data availability and  compatibility are often noted during fire incidents, these issues are  also evident before and after fire incidents. For example, we  recently reported that the five land management agencies did not  know how effective their post-fire emergency stabilization and  rehabilitation treatments were because, among other reasons, local  land units do not routinely collect comparable information. As a  result of unavailable or incompatible data, decision makers often  lack the timely, integrated information they need to make sound  decisions in managing different aspects of wildland fire.", "On a related note, the development of data standards is a well- recognized solution for addressing some of the problems  mentioned above, but there are currently no nationally recognized  geospatial data standards for use on fires. GIS specialists  frequently cited a need for common, interagency geospatial data  standards for use with fires. They noted that the land management  agencies and states do not record information about fires\u2014such as  fire location, fire perimeter, or the date of different fire  perimeters\u2014in the same way.", "System issues. In 1996, NWCG reported that there was a  duplication of information systems and computer applications  supporting wildland fire management, noting that agencies were  using 15 different weather-related software applications, 9 logistics  applications, and 7 dispatch applications. Since that time, the  number of applications has grown\u2014as has the potential for  duplication of effort. Duplicative systems not only waste limited  funds, but they also make interoperability between systems more  difficult.", "This issue is complicated by the fact that there is no single,  comprehensive inventory of information systems and applications  that could be of use to others in the interagency wildland fire  community. A single comprehensive inventory would allow the  wildland fire community to identify and learn about available  applications and tools, and to avoid duplicating efforts to develop  new applications. We identified five different inventories of  software applications\u2014including information systems, models, and  tools\u2014that are currently being used in support of wildland fire  management. While these listings are not limited to geospatial  applications, many of the applications have geospatial components.  The most comprehensive listing is an inventory managed by NWCG.", "This inventory identifies 199 applications used in support of  wildland fire, but even this inventory is not complete. That is, it did  not include 45 applications that were included in the other  inventories. Additionally, it did not include 23 applications that we  had identified.", "Infrastructure issues. Many geospatial specialists noted that there  are problems in getting equipment, networking capabilities, and  Internet access to the areas that need them during a fire. For  example, at a recent fire in a remote location, geospatial specialists  reported that they were unable to produce needed information and  maps because they had problems with networking capabilities.  Again, this issue is critical during a fire, when incident teams try to  set up a command center in a remote location. However, it is also  an issue when federal regional managers try to obtain consistent  information from the different land management agencies\u2019 field  offices before or after fires. The majority of local field offices have  equipment to support geospatial information and analysis, but  some do not.", "Staffing issues. Geospatial specialists noted that the training and  qualifications of the GIS specialists who support fire incidents is  not consistent. Specifically, officials noted that skills and  qualifications vary widely among those who work with geographic  information systems. For example, some GIS specialists are capable  of interpreting infrared images as well as developing maps, but  others are not. Some have experience working with GIS applications  but are not specifically trained to develop GIS maps for fires.", "Use of new products. While many commercial vendors are  developing geospatial products and services that could be of use to  the wildland fire community\u2014including advanced satellite and  aerial imaging; GIS applications and equipment; and advanced  mapping products including analyses, visualization, and  modeling\u2014many have expressed concern that the wildland fire  community is not aware of these advancements or has little  funding for these products. Land managers acknowledged the  value of many of these products, but noted that they need to be  driven by business needs.  Agency officials also expressed concern  that the cost of these products and services can be prohibitive and  that licensing restrictions would keep them from sharing the  commercial data and products with others in the wildland fire  community.", "Clearly, effective interagency management of information  resources and technology could help address the challenges faced  by the wildland fire community in using geospatial information  technologies. Such an approach could address the implementation  and enforcement of national geospatial data standards for  managing wildland fires; an interagency strategic approach to  systems and infrastructure development; a plan for ensuring  consistent equipment and training throughout the wildland fire  community; and a thorough evaluation of user needs and  opportunities for meeting those needs through new products and  technologies.", "The National Wildfire Coordinating Group\u2014comprising  representatives from the five land management agencies and from  other federal, state, and tribal organizations\u2014has several initiatives  planned or under way to address challenges to effectively using  geospatial technologies and to improve the interagency  management of information resources.

These technologies run the  gamut from satellite and aerial imaging, to the Global Positioning  System, to geographic information systems, to specialized fire  models.", "Local land managers and incident teams often acquire, collect, and  develop geospatial information and technologies to meet their  specific needs, resulting in a hodgepodge of incompatible and  duplicative data and tools. This problem is echoed throughout the  fire community, as those who work with different aspects of fire  management commonly cite concerns with unavailable or  incompatible geospatial data, duplicative systems, lack of  equipment and infrastructure to access geospatial information,  inconsistency in the training of geospatial specialists, and  ineffective use of new products and technologies. These challenges  illustrate the need for effective interagency management of  information technology and resources in the wildland fire  community.

In  addition, we met with officials of other federal agencies, including  the Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey, the  Department of Defense\u2019s National Imagery and Mapping Agency,  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  Federal Emergency Management Agency, to identify their efforts to  develop geospatial information products in support of wildland  fire management.", "To summarize key challenges to the effective use and sharing of  geospatial technologies, we reviewed key reports and studies on  these challenges.
