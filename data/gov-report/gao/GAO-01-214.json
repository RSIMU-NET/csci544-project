The Fund is the chief intergovernmental  financial institution whose core mission is to promote monetary  cooperation and exchange rate stability and provide resources to Fund  member countries that experience balance-of-payments difficulties.  Considerable attention has been given to how to define the Fund\u2019s mission,  whether narrowly, to core issues as described in the Fund\u2019s charter, or  more broadly, to address other concerns less traditionally in the Fund\u2019s  purview. The Department of the Treasury has the lead role within the  executive branch regarding U.S. policy toward the Fund. The U.S.  Executive Director, who is appointed by the President, represents the  United States at the Fund and pursues U.S. policy objectives through its  vote in the Fund\u2019s Executive Board.", "As an international organization, the Fund in general is exempt from U.S.  law. One of the ways in which the U.S. Congress endeavors to influence  Fund policy is by passing legislative provisions or mandates that direct the  Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director to pursue  specific policies or vote on certain programs or assistance within the Board  of the Fund. We have identified 60 provisions of federal law that set forth  U.S. policy toward the Fund. These mandates cover a wide range of  policies, including issues considered core to the mission of the Fund, such  as exchange rate policy, and emerging issues such as environmental policy.  The legislation often directs Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive  Director to use its \u201cvoice\u201d and/or \u201cvote\u201d at the Executive Board to bring  about a policy change at the Fund. Most mandates instruct Treasury and  the U.S. Executive Director to pursue a policy goal at the Fund but also  provide some discretion in how to implement this instruction. However,  some mandates are more directive in that they require in certain  circumstances that Treasury instruct the U.S. Executive Director to  oppose (which in practice means to vote against or abstain from voting  on) a country\u2019s Fund arrangement. For example, the U.S. Executive  Director is directed to oppose financial assistance for a country that has  excessive debt service payments. (See app. I for more information on the  60 legislative policy mandates we identified concerning the Fund.)", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (P.L. 106-113  sec. 504 (e)) requires GAO to report on the extent to which Fund practices  are consistent with U.S. policies set forth in federal law. In order to address  this requirement, we (1) identified how the U.S. Treasury and the U.S.  Executive Director promote U.S. policies mandated by Congress for the  Fund and (2) assessed whether Treasury and the Executive Director have  been able to influence Fund operations and other members\u2019 policy  positions in a direction that would be consistent with U.S. policy as set  forth in law. To help answer these objectives, we analyzed the process by  which Treasury pursues its legislative mandates and conducted case  studies of specific U.S. policies and Treasury\u2019s efforts to promote them for  individual countries\u2019 Fund arrangements from 1998 through 2000.", "The policy issues we selected for the case studies are (1) sound banking  principles, (2) labor policies, and (3) audits of military expenditures. These  policies encompass issues that are both central to the traditional focus of  the Fund\u2019s mission as well as issues that are not necessarily viewed by all  Fund members as a core part of the Fund\u2019s mission. Further, these policies  represent both \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cdirected vote\u201d provisions. For each policy  issue, we reviewed Fund practices with respect to five member countries  that we selected based on a number of factors, including geographic  diversity; level of economic development; type of Fund arrangement, if  applicable; and range of issues connected to the policy concern.  Specifically, we selected 12 countries for our respective case studies:  (1) for sound banking principles\u2014India, Mexico, Romania, South Africa,  and Thailand; (2) for labor policies\u2014Argentina, Ghana, Kazakhstan,  Mexico, and Thailand; and (3) for audits of military expenditures\u2014Burkina  Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Rwanda. Since we  focused primarily on Fund rather than country practices, we did not travel  to any of these countries as part of this review. We spoke with Fund  officials who monitor developments in these countries as well as with  several executive directors of the Fund\u2019s Executive Board in Washington,  D.C.

As part of the Fund\u2019s mission to promote financial cooperation  among its members, the Fund may provide financial assistance to countries  facing actual or potential balance-of-payments difficulties that request such  assistance. The Fund\u2019s approach for providing financial assistance to its  members has two main components\u2014financing and conditionality\u2014that  are intended to address both the immediate crises as well as the underlying  factors that contributed to the difficulties. The access to and disbursement  of Fund financial assistance are conditioned upon the adoption and pursuit  of economic and structural policy measures the Fund and recipient  countries negotiate. This Fund \u201cconditionality,\u201d usually in the form of  performance criteria and policy benchmarks, aims to alleviate the  underlying economic difficulty that led to the country\u2019s  balance-of-payments problem and ensure repayment to the Fund.", "The Fund\u2019s general framework for establishing a financial assistance  arrangement is applied on a case-by-case basis that considers each  country\u2019s individual circumstances. The Fund and the recipient countries  negotiate conditions for receiving Fund assistance that include a variety of  changes in a country\u2019s fiscal, monetary, and structural policies. Over the  course of the arrangement, Fund staff and country officials periodically  review the program\u2019s status, and Fund staff determine whether or not the  country has made satisfactory progress with respect to meeting the  program\u2019s conditions. In addition to providing financial assistance, the  Fund conducts surveillance and provides policy advice regarding members\u2019  economic policies as they relate to their overall external payments  position. Article IV of the Fund\u2019s charter provides that all members undergo  a consultation process with the Fund as part of the surveillance effort;  these reviews are usually conducted on an annual basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Uses a Systematic Process to Promote Mandates Based on Countries\u2019 Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["The Treasury has instituted a systematic process for applying legislative  mandates concerning the Fund to individual countries, based on their  economic circumstances. This process, adopted in 1999, uses a task force  to facilitate coordination between Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director  and to identify early opportunities to influence decisions regarding Fund  members\u2019 programs and economic reviews. Generally, Treasury and the  U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office pursue the mandates that are most relevant  to the particular circumstances of a given country, because they believe  that this is where they can have the greatest impact and success in  influencing Fund members. Our case study analyses show that Treasury  and the U.S. Executive Director have actively promoted U.S. policies  related to sound banking principles, labor issues, and audits of military  expenditures as required by the applicable legislative mandates, through  their discussions with Fund and member country officials and formal  statements to the Fund\u2019s Executive Board."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Treasury Has a Systematic Process to Review Mandates", "paragraphs": ["In response to the growing number and complexity of legislative mandates  concerning the Fund, Treasury has created a formal process to advance  U.S. objectives at the Fund. Specifically, in March 1999 Treasury set up the  Task Force on Implementation of U.S. Policy and Reforms in the  International Monetary Fund. The task force was designed in part to  increase awareness among Treasury officials of the importance of the  mandates and identify opportunities to provide early input to the U.S.  Executive Director to advance U.S. objectives toward the Fund. Treasury  recognized the need to strengthen its efforts to routinely review and  coordinate how mandates may apply to countries, because previously it  had used an ad hoc approach of addressing mandates that relied heavily on  Treasury officials\u2019 own initiative to be cognizant of mandates.", "Under its new process, Treasury disseminates information on the mandates  to all officials working on Fund matters and also makes reference material  on the mandates easily accessible electronically. In addition,  representatives from Treasury offices who work on Fund matters, and a  representative from the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office, meet every  2 weeks as the task force to discuss how Treasury and the U.S. Executive  Director can best apply mandates, given countries\u2019 economic  circumstances. In between these meetings, Treasury and U.S. Executive  Director officials also coordinate to formulate and implement U.S.  objectives at the Fund. (A detailed description of Treasury\u2019s process for  pursuing legislative mandates concerning the Fund is provided in app. II.)", "Treasury and U.S. Executive Director officials use a variety of means to  pursue legislative mandates as part of their efforts to achieve U.S. policy  objectives within the Fund. For example, on a regular basis the U.S.  Executive Director makes oral and written statements to the Fund\u2019s  Executive Board to make Board members aware of U.S. policy objectives  regarding requests from countries for new programs, Fund reviews of  existing programs, and regular Fund reviews of all members\u2019 economic  policies. In addition, to build support for U.S. policy goals, U.S. officials  also discuss U.S. policy objectives informally with other executive  directors, Fund management and staff, and occasionally country  authorities, particularly when the Fund is involved in negotiating with  countries about financial arrangements. U.S. officials also attempt to build  support within the broader political arena to achieve U.S. objectives at the  Fund. According to the U.S. Executive Director, a large part of advancing  any policy issue is to reach a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of support among other  countries for a particular policy. Therefore, for some policies the dialogue  necessary to reach an international political consensus also takes place  outside of the Fund in other international forums."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury\u2019s Process Considers a Country\u2019s Circumstances When Applying Mandates", "paragraphs": ["Since the legislative provisions direct Treasury to instruct the U.S.  Executive Director to promote specific policies at the Fund, these policies  are often referred to as \u201cmandates.\u201d However, to varying degrees U.S.  officials have flexibility in determining how best to promote particular  policies at the Fund. This flexibility generally allows Treasury and the U.S.  Executive Director to take into account the individual circumstances of  each country when promoting specific policies. This is especially true of  mandates that do not involve directed votes, as is the case for most of the  legislative mandates that concern the Fund. Treasury officials told us they  promote such mandates for each country on a case-by-case basis, using  their knowledge and judgment to decide whether an individual mandate is  most relevant for a country and, moreover, whether a particular time is  appropriate for advancing a mandate given a country\u2019s economic  circumstances. Countries that approach the Fund for financial assistance  often face multiple economic problems, and Treasury prioritizes how best  to address these problems. According to Treasury and U.S. Executive  Director officials, the U.S. message can be made more compelling and  effective when priorities are set based on country circumstances, taking  into consideration the range of problems that can be manageably  addressed at one time.", "However, some legislative mandates that pertain to the Fund are more  prescriptive in nature. According to Treasury\u2019s Office of the General  Counsel, Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director are more constrained in  the degree of flexibility they have to implement these mandates because  they usually direct the U.S. Executive Director to oppose (which in practice  means to vote against or abstain from voting on) a financial arrangement or  Fund disbursement when a country meets or does not meet certain criteria.  Examples include when a country has what is considered excessive  external debt service payments or has been determined by the President to  violate religious freedom. The directed nature of these mandates compels  Treasury and the Executive Director to promote them regardless of  whether they believe it is an appropriate time to do so given a country\u2019s  overall circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case Study Results Show U.S. Officials Promoted Policies as Required by Legislation", "paragraphs": ["From 1998 through 2000, Treasury and U.S. Executive Director officials  actively promoted the policies we reviewed in our case studies\u2014sound  banking principles, labor standards, and audits of military expenditures\u2014 as required by the applicable legislative mandates, by identifying  opportunities to influence Fund members\u2019 program and economic reviews.  For each policy, Treasury and U.S. Executive Director staff worked  together to prioritize the issues that should be raised for each country. They  then promoted those policies that they viewed as most relevant for the  countries we reviewed, given the country\u2019s economic and political  circumstances. For example, in a 1999 statement to the Fund\u2019s Executive  Board in support of a new program for Kazakhstan, the U.S. Executive  Director urged Kazakhstan both to ensure that any reforms to its labor  code be consistent with internationally recognized labor standards and to  consult with the International Labor Organization on this matter. Also, for  a country that did not have a financial arrangement with the Fund, such as  India, but where Treasury had prominent banking sector concerns, the U.S.  Executive Director repeatedly highlighted U.S. concerns in statements to  the Board during the Fund\u2019s regular reviews of India\u2019s economic policies.", "If Treasury determines through its analysis that a policy is not a major  concern relative to other priorities for an individual country, it is not  pursued at that time, unless it is a directed vote mandate. For example,  until recently, Treasury determined that adherence to labor standards was  not a major concern in Ghana relative to other problems Ghana faces as a  poor country. According to a Treasury official, developing countries like  Ghana typically lack an industrial base large enough for the protection of  workers\u2019 rights to be a major issue. In poor countries, labor issues, such as  abusive child labor, are more likely to reflect human rights concerns than  economic ones and thus are more difficult for the Fund to address."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Difficult to Discern U.S. Unique Influence Over Fund Policies", "paragraphs": ["Our case study analysis indicates that while Treasury and the U.S.  Executive Director have had some influence over Fund policies, it is  difficult to attribute the adoption of a policy within the Fund solely to the  influence and efforts of any one member, because the Fund generally  operates on a consensus decision-making basis. Furthermore, the Fund\u2019s  willingness to adopt policy positions that are consistent with U.S.  legislatively mandated policies is affected by whether a majority of Fund  members perceive a given policy to be part of the Fund\u2019s core mission to  promote monetary cooperation and currency exchange rate stability and to  provide resources to Fund members experiencing balance-of-payments  problems. Moreover, mandated policies that constrain the U.S. Executive  Director\u2019s discretion may increase pressure on countries to implement  specific U.S.-promoted reforms but may have a negative impact on the  broader U.S. influence at the Fund by limiting the ability of U.S.  policymakers to consider the overall circumstances confronting countries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Core Policies", "paragraphs": ["While Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director have actively promoted  sound banking principles at the Fund, it is difficult to discern the unique  influence of the United States because of the general agreement within the  Fund that strengthening members\u2019 banking sectors is part of the Fund\u2019s  core mission. Moreover, since the Fund\u2019s Executive Board generally  operates on a consensus basis in making decisions, it is hard to distinguish  the U.S.\u2019 influence within the Fund from that of other members. In recent  years, partly in response to economic crises faced by Mexico in 1994-95 and  several Asian countries in 1997-98, the Fund increased its emphasis on  strengthening banking and banking supervision as part of members\u2019  programs. Fund members now see a close interrelationship between  weaknesses in a country\u2019s banking system and the susceptibility of that  country to financial shocks. Moreover, the Fund now realizes that  encouraging countries to have a strong framework of financial regulatory  policies and institutions is key to maintaining macroeconomic stability,  according to Fund officials we interviewed.", "As a result, according to Treasury and Fund officials, strengthening a  country\u2019s banking sector has been promoted irrespective of any U.S.  legislative mandate because it is now considered an important part of both  Treasury and the Fund\u2019s ongoing work. Treasury and the U.S. Executive  Director have generally been in agreement with the Fund\u2019s approach for  pursuing these reforms, and the U.S. Executive Director has been viewed  by Fund officials as a strong advocate among many supporters for the  Fund\u2019s involvement in this area. (For more information about Treasury and  U.S. Executive Director efforts to promote sound banking principles with  the Fund, see app. III.)", "The challenge to Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director, amid  widespread member support for sound banking principles, has been in  deciding how to influence what the Fund emphasizes within a country\u2019s  overall banking reform agenda. Given the complexity of banking issues and  the difficulty in addressing banking reforms, especially reforms that require  legal changes, there may occasionally be disagreement among the Board  members on the pace of reform of the banking sector in a particular  country, according to some executive directors. Nevertheless, we did not  identify evidence of disagreement on the importance of pursuing sound  banking policies for the five countries we reviewed, making it difficult to  distinguish the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s overall influence from those of  other members in this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Noncore Policies", "paragraphs": ["In contrast, Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director have found it more  difficult to advance some mandated policies, such as those promoting the  adherence to the five internationally recognized core labor standards or  the adoption of environmental protection policies, because, according to  Treasury and Fund officials, these policies do not directly relate to the  Fund\u2019s traditional mission. For example, some Fund officials believe that in  individual country circumstances, core labor standards issues are not  central to the economic problems causing the countries\u2019 macroeconomic  difficulties. Instead, the Fund views these policies as more closely related  to the work of the International Labor Organization or the missions of other  international financial institutions, such as the World Bank. The Fund  views the mission of these institutions to be more focused on problems  stemming from microeconomic, sector-specific concerns within  countries.", "According to a labor policy specialist at Treasury, the Fund\u2019s reluctance to  consider labor standards within the scope of its work is due in part to  conflicting academic literature on whether certain labor standards have  beneficial or detrimental effects on economic growth. Conventional  economic theory treats certain social policies, such as labor and  environmental standards, as government interventions that can inhibit the  efficient operation of the markets and, in turn, overall economic growth.  According to this Treasury official, since most Fund staff and country  representatives are trained as economists, they are reluctant to pursue  policies that their training tells them could be counter to the Fund\u2019s goal of  encouraging economic growth. As one Executive Director at the Fund  expressed, the implication of promoting stronger social standards in a  country is higher unemployment. If the choice is between workers being  employed under less than ideal labor conditions or not having them work at  all, the Executive Director favored having the workers be employed and  earning income.", "While Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director have made special efforts  to advance U.S. policy on core labor standards at the Fund, they have found  it challenging to convince other members that consideration of labor  standards fits within the Fund\u2019s work. Despite the resistance at the Fund to  the labor standards policy, the U.S. Executive Director has tried to build  support for this policy by discussing it with individual executive directors  who may be receptive to including this issue in Fund programs. In addition,  the U.S. Executive Director has noted in statements to the Executive Board  the importance of labor concerns in particular countries. For example, on  several occasions the U.S. Executive Director has expressed concern over  inadequate attention given to protecting labor standards in reviews of  Mexico\u2019s Fund program. Specifically, these statements noted the need to  protect the freedom of workers to associate and bargain collectively and to  prevent gender discrimination while Mexico was undertaking reforms to  modernize its labor market. Likewise, in commenting on Thailand\u2019s  program at the Executive Board, the U.S. Executive Director urged Thai  authorities to bring their labor laws into compliance with international  standards and address complaints concerning legal restrictions on the  rights to unionize and bargain collectively for employees of state  enterprises. Despite these and other statements by the U.S. Executive  Director in support of labor standards, we did not find evidence that the  Fund has sought to have the adherence of labor standards specifically  incorporated as a structural benchmark or performance criterion within a  program. (The Treasury\u2019s and the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s efforts to  promote labor policies at the Fund are described in more detail in app. IV.)", "In certain circumstances, Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director have  had difficulty reaching consensus on how adherence to core labor  standards best fits into the Fund\u2019s work and how to effectively advance  U.S. policy on labor issues at the Fund. For example, in March 2000, a  Treasury official recommended that the U.S. Executive Director ask the  Fund to report on the state of collective bargaining, union organization, and  labor and management relations in Argentina, especially in the context of  the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s and the Fund\u2019s recommended labor reforms  in that country. However, the U.S. Executive Director did not raise this  point because concerns were advanced that such a review of the Argentine  labor market was beyond the Fund\u2019s expertise.", "To help address these ongoing challenges, Treasury has developed two  documents since April 2000. One is a reference document outlining  economic arguments for the relevance of labor standards to the Fund\u2019s  work for use by U.S. officials in their discussions with Fund members. The  other is a document that sets out guidelines on how Treasury should  advance U.S. policy on labor standards at the Fund through the U.S.  Executive Director\u2019s office. Treasury adopted these guidelines in November  2000, after several months of internal debate during which senior Treasury  policy officials were consulted to settle differences of view among staff-level officials. According to Treasury officials, the guidelines clarify  U.S. policy objectives and legislative obligations concerning labor  standards to facilitate Treasury\u2019s efforts to provide the U.S. Executive  Director with timely and effective input."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Directed Vote", "paragraphs": ["The impact of directed vote mandates on U.S. influence at the Fund is  uncertain. By limiting the discretion of the U.S. Executive Director, such  mandates may increase pressure for countries to implement U.S.-promoted  reforms but may have had a negative impact on the broader U.S. influence  at the Fund by limiting the ability of U.S. policymakers to consider the  overall circumstances confronting countries. This tradeoff is demonstrated  by the audits of military expenditures mandate. Specifically, this mandate  directs the U.S. Executive Director to oppose (which in practice means to  vote against or abstain from voting on) any loan or utilization of funds for  countries that do not have a functioning system for conducting an audit of  military spending and reporting the results to a civilian authority. On the  one hand, U.S. efforts to advance the mandate have successfully increased  pressure on countries to make their military audit systems conform to the  mandate\u2019s requirements. On the other hand, the constraints the mandate  places on U.S. officials may negatively affect U.S. credibility at the Fund,  according to Treasury, U.S. Executive Director, and Fund officials. For  example, the mandate has required Treasury and U.S. Executive Director  officials to raise military audit concerns when they otherwise may not have  chosen to do so because of the overall circumstances confronting the  country. As a result, other Board members expressed the view that the  United States may at times promote the issue primarily because it is a  legislative requirement and not because it is the most appropriate for the  borrowing country at that time.", "U.S. efforts to promote audits of military expenditures and influence the  Fund have met with some success. Several countries we examined  improved their military audit systems, partly in response to the threat of  U.S. opposition to their Fund programs. All of these countries had a  financial arrangement with the Fund where the U.S. directed vote could be  applied. Although U.S. opposition to a Fund arrangement does not, on its  own, prevent a country from having access to Fund resources, countries  strive to avoid having the Fund\u2019s largest member register such opposition,  according to an official in the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office. For example,  following the threat of U.S. opposition to their receipt of resources under  their Fund arrangement, both Burkina Faso and Rwanda took steps to  improve their military audit processes or accelerated efforts to conform to  the U.S. mandate.", "U.S. efforts to advance the mandate have been successful in four of the five  countries we reviewed in part because the Fund has agreed that military  audits are important for countries where military spending is not  transparent or where there is suspicion that the country may have high  levels of hidden, off-budget spending for the military. Prior to Treasury\u2019s  implementation of the mandate in 1999, the Fund already viewed excessive  and unproductive spending by the military as having an adverse impact on  individual countries\u2019 overall macroeconomic stability. Generally, the Fund  does not require countries to perform annual audits of military spending.  Fund members we spoke with generally agreed that the auditing and  transparency mechanisms promoted by the mandate could potentially  bring important information regarding military spending to the attention of  donors. The Fund\u2019s agreement on the importance of audits of military  expenditures is part of a broader campaign to improve the transparency  and management of public finances. This has made it easier for the U.S.  Executive Director to promote this mandate than, for example, the core  labor standards mandate.", "Treasury and U.S. Executive Director officials are pleased with the  progress that has been made in bringing several countries that are under a  financial arrangement with the Fund into compliance with the mandate\u2019s  requirements. However, at the same time, several of these officials are  concerned that the lack of discretion that the mandate gives the U.S.  Executive Director can have negative consequences. For example, the  mandate required Treasury and U.S. Executive Director officials to raise  audits of military expenditures concerns with Indonesia, when they  otherwise might not have chosen to do so, given the overall circumstances  confronting the country. In their view, the economic and political turmoil  that the country has faced in recent years has presented more pressing  reform priorities than the improvement of the audit of its military  expenditures. Nevertheless, Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director were  compelled by the directive nature of the mandate to make this a high  priority issue with the country. This lack of discretion could also result in  U.S. opposition to a program that it believes should be endorsed. For  example, the U.S. Executive Director was compelled to abstain from voting  to make a financial disbursement for Rwanda\u2019s program because Rwanda  was not yet in full compliance with the standards set forth in the military  audit mandate. This occurred despite Treasury\u2019s knowledge that Rwanda  would become compliant with the mandate shortly, and, in Treasury\u2019s  judgment, was making satisfactory progress in implementing economic  reforms and improving fiscal transparency. Other Fund Board members  questioned whether the U.S. Executive Director pursued military audit  concerns because of the legislative requirements and not necessarily  because it was most appropriate for these countries at the time. These  Board members noted that limitations on an executive director\u2019s discretion  run counter to the consensus decision-making approach of the Fund.  Therefore, while Treasury and U.S. Executive Director officials agree with  the intent of the mandate, they see a risk to U.S. credibility when Treasury  and the U.S. Executive Director must emphasize an issue over other  pressing matters that a borrowing country may be confronting.

Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director have argued  that the IMF should not develop programs that may negatively impact  countries\u2019 adherence to core labor standards without taking those impacts  into consideration. Treasury officials have also taken advantage of other  forums to promote U.S. policy on the relevance of core labor standards to  the IMF\u2019s mission. For example, Treasury officials have promoted U.S.  policy at meetings with government officials of the Group of Eight,  through personal contact with other countries\u2019 officials, and at IMF annual  meetings. In addition, Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director organized a  seminar on core labor standards for the IMF and the World Bank\u2019s 1999  annual meeting in cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the  American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations  (AFL-CIO). Senior officials from these institutions, as well as a Minister of  Finance from Chile and a noted academic, presented their views on the role  of core labor standards at the IMF and the World Bank.", "Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s second approach has been to  pursue the best examples of countries where they believe that adherence to  core labor standards is deficient and that the IMF should consider core  labor standards as relevant to their macroeconomic stability. Treasury and  the U.S. Executive Director can then use these examples as successful  precedents to urge the IMF to advance core labor standards in other  countries and at the broader level. According to Treasury officials,  countries that make the best cases are those where the conditions of its  IMF program will clearly have implications for the labor market. For  example, the IMF and the Argentine government agreed that to stimulate  economic growth, Argentina would need to increase labor market  flexibility through various reforms, including legally decentralizing union  collective bargaining. While Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director  agreed with Argentina\u2019s need to increase labor market flexibility, they also  recognized that some of the reforms discussed would have implications for  Argentina\u2019s adherence to the core labor standard concerning collective  bargaining. Therefore, they monitored the progress of these reforms and  asked IMF staff to clarify whether the reform proposed to decentralize  union collective bargaining would be consistent with the ILO Right to  Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention (no. 98).", "The U.S. Executive Director also tries to set precedents by pursuing labor  policy with IMF management and staff in advance of an IMF mission to a  member country as part of a program or general economic review. For  example, Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director became aware that the  IMF and the Mexican government were exploring a possible financial  arrangement at the end of 1998. Officials from Treasury and the U.S.  Executive Director\u2019s office collaborated to determine whether the U.S.  labor mandates were relevant to the proposed IMF program in Mexico.  Based on their analysis, they became concerned that reforms the Mexican  government was proposing to increase labor market flexibility and  modernize the labor relations system could have negative implications for  the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively. The U.S.  Executive Director therefore sent a memo to the Managing Director of the  IMF, urging the IMF\u2019s mission team to, among other things, (1) incorporate  the discussion of core labor standards into their policy dialogue with  Mexican authorities in the context of any discussion of broader labor  market reforms and (2) survey labor market policies and practices in  Mexico and recommend policy initiatives that will help ensure the  maintenance or improvement of core labor standards.", "As part of another means for establishing precedents, the U.S. Executive  Director encourages IMF staff and borrowing country governments to  consult with the ILO when labor issues come up in a country or when a  country\u2019s program may have implications for the country\u2019s adherence to  core labor standards. For example, in commenting on Kazakhstan\u2019s 1999  request for a new arrangement at an Executive Board meeting, the U.S.  Executive Director encouraged the Kazakhstani government to consult  with the ILO concerning proposed reforms to Kazakhstan\u2019s labor code. In  doing so, Kazahstan could ensure that these reforms were not only better  suited to the market economy that it is trying to develop, but also  consistent with core labor standards.", "Officials at Treasury and U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office do not often  advance core labor standards with two groups of countries\u2014advanced  industrial economies and the poorest countries\u2014because they believe that  these countries do not make good precedents. According to Treasury  officials, they do not pursue these issues with advanced industrial  economies, such as France, Germany, or Japan, because their adherence to  core labor standards is generally high. In reviewing the poorest countries,  Treasury officials have found that they also do not generally make good  cases because they do not have a sufficiently large industrial base for the  core labor standards of freedom of association and freedom to organize  and bargain collectively to be important issues relative to the other  challenges facing these countries. Moreover, although child labor can be a  concern in these countries, Treasury officials noted that the root of the  problem is in the high level of poverty, cultural and societal norms, and lack  of opportunities for the children. In addition, concerns that Treasury might  have about forced labor or gender inequality in these countries are more  closely related to human rights issues than to core labor standards.  Therefore, according to Treasury officials, they address these issues in that  context. For example, according to Treasury officials, Ghana\u2019s adherence  to each of the core labor standards could be improved, but since Ghana has  a pressing need to address poverty, and most of its labor force is engaged in  agriculture, Treasury did not urge the U.S. Executive Director to comment  on core labor standards in Ghana until recently.", "To enhance Treasury\u2019s and the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s efforts to advance  U.S. policy on core labor standards, Treasury hired a labor policy specialist  in 1998 to provide background information and policy guidance on core  labor standards issues to other Treasury officials and the U.S. Executive  Director. The labor specialist is responsible for reviewing the labor  situation in each IMF member country as it comes before the IMF\u2019s  Executive Board as part of a program request, a review of an existing  program, or the IMF\u2019s periodic reviews of the country\u2019s economic  conditions. For each country, the specialist determines whether there are  concerns for that country\u2019s adherence to core labor standards and  coordinates with Treasury\u2019s country desk officers to provide the U.S.  Executive Director with input for an oral or written statement to the IMF\u2019s  Executive Board.", "Although U.S. officials have been targeting their efforts to pursue core  labor standards, two executive directors noted that some developing  countries do not support U.S. policy on core labor standards because these  countries do not believe that U.S. motives are altruistic. Rather, they view  U.S. promotion of core labor standards as a trade protectionist measure  meant to increase labor costs in developing countries, thereby potentially  averting the relocation of U.S. firms and the loss of U.S. jobs. Despite this  resistance, officials at Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office  note that they have seen signs that their efforts to advance U.S. policy are  being heard. For example, in response to U.S. interest on labor issues in  Mexico, IMF staff included an appendix concerning Mexico\u2019s efforts to  modernize labor markets and improve their efficiency in their 1999 report  on Mexico\u2019s request for an arrangement. In addition, during visits to  Argentina to discuss its ongoing arrangement, IMF staff consulted with  union officials on a variety of labor issues related to the flexibility of its  labor markets."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy on Audits of Military Expenditures at the IMF", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, Congress enacted the audits of military expenditures legislation,  which includes a specific directed voting provision that requires the U.S.  executive directors at international financial institutions to oppose  nonbasic human needs assistance to countries that do not conduct and  report regular audits of their military spending to civilian authorities. In the  five cases we reviewed, we determined that the United States has achieved  some success in advancing this mandate at the IMF and in convincing some  borrowing countries to conduct audits of military spending. The U.S.  Executive Director\u2019s effectiveness in advancing this particular mandate at  the IMF is due in part to a widespread view in the international community  that good governance, transparency of budgets, unproductive spending,  and military spending are economic issues that could impact the  effectiveness of a country\u2019s macroeconomic reform effort. Nevertheless,  the pursuit of this mandate has had an uncertain impact on the broader U.S.  influence at the IMF. While there is strong IMF support for the intent of the  legislation, U.S. and IMF officials emphasized that the military audit  mandate sometimes competes with countries\u2019 priorities and that U.S.  officials have limited discretion on when to advance the mandate for  countries deemed out of compliance. As a result, U.S. and IMF officials  believe that the limited discretion that U.S. officials have in advancing this  mandate runs counter to the consensus decision-making approach of the  Fund and could negatively impact U.S. influence at the IMF."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress has been concerned that military expenditures by some  developing countries are excessive and an unproductive drain on their  limited resources. Congress was also concerned that public information on  military expenditures for some countries is generally characterized by  incompleteness, lack of transparency, and inaccuracy. Partly in response  to these concerns, in 1996 Congress passed the audits of military  expenditures legislation. The legislation states that the U.S. Executive  Director is to use its voice and vote to oppose the use of funds, other than  those to address basic human needs, for any government that does not  have in place a functioning system for reporting audits of military  expenditures to civilian authorities or has not provided such information to  any institution that requests it. The U.S. Treasury was given a 3-year  window to develop an implementation approach, with the voting  requirement taking effect on October 1, 1999. After that date, the U.S.  Executive Director was instructed to oppose approval of IMF  arrangements for countries deemed not in compliance with the standards  set forth in the mandate. On October 18, 1999, 22 countries were deemed  noncompliant with the standards of the mandate, but by November 9, 2000,  this number had declined to 17 countries.", "In 1999, Treasury formed an Interagency Policy Group to assess countries\u2019  compliance with the military audit legislation. The group is comprised of  the Treasury, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the U.S.  Agency for International Development, the National Security Council, and  the Office of Management and Budget. The Policy Group developed the  following interpretation and definitional guidance for the legislation:  A country must be routinely conducting a post-expenditure  examination, verification of accuracy, and reconciliation of irregularities  of receipts that fund the military (annually, though a 2-year completion  lag is acceptable).", "Results of the audit must be reported to a nonmilitary entity.  Significant off-budget or commercial revenue (defined as greater than 5 percent of the total defense budget) that funds the military must also  be audited and reported to a civilian authority.", "Treasury has taken several steps to advance the military audit mandate at  the IMF, including working with the State Department to inform IMF  member countries of the legislation through U.S. embassies and providing  information to the U.S. Executive Director on the countries that are  noncompliant with the mandate. The U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office also  informed IMF management and staff of the importance it attached to the  mandate and the compliance requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Process for Registering Opposition to IMF Programs", "paragraphs": ["When a country is found to be not in compliance by the Policy Group, the  U.S. Executive Director is directed to oppose the use of IMF resources.

The Policy Group has also determined that in cases  where the only reason for opposing the use of IMF resources is a lack of  compliance with the military audit legislation, the U.S. Executive Director  should abstain. In addition, in cases where countries are actively engaged  in making necessary changes to become compliant, the U.S. Executive  Director would include strongly supportive comments in Board statements  accompanying the directed vote. The U.S. Executive Director has never  voted no under the military audit mandate but has abstained 3 times, as of  September 30, 2000. Regardless of whether the United States chooses to  abstain or vote no, its actions alone are not sufficient to veto a country\u2019s  access to IMF resources because approval of a country\u2019s arrangement  requires support from a majority of the Executive Board. Although the  United States has the largest voting share of any member (17 percent), this  is insufficient to unilaterally block access to IMF resources.", "The decision by the United States to record its opposition to a country\u2019s  program is considered by the Secretary to the Board to be a vote (and  recorded as such in the minutes). However, other members do not have to  formally vote in response. Formal votes are rarely taken at IMF Board  meetings, but any executive director may require a formal vote to be held.  According to an IMF official, Board decisions are expected to reflect the  consensus of Board members, with the views expressed as part of the  overall discussion. Over the course of the meeting, the Secretary keeps  track of each executive director\u2019s position. While directors in almost all  cases support IMF programs on the whole, they may express differences of  views with programmatic details or broader issues regarding the quality of  the program. However, if there is evidence of widespread opposition, the  Chairman or an individual member may request a poll of members\u2019 views.  Such a poll is not considered a \u201cvote\u201d by the Board but a tool for accurately  gauging the views of Board members. An analysis of the U.S. Executive  Director\u2019s voting record for the period of October 1997 through  September 2000, shows that the U.S. Executive Director voted against or  abstained from voting a total of 21 times.

The U.S.  Executive Director has emphasized issues of fiscal controls and budget  transparency in U.S. country statements to the Board, in attempting to  integrate the military audit mandate within the IMF\u2019s own operating  guidelines and institutional processes. According to the U.S. Executive  Director, the military audit mandate is easier to advance than, for example,  the labor mandate, because it fits well within the Fund\u2019s efforts to promote  good governance, fiscal transparency, and the control of unproductive  spending. While the IMF does not generally require audits of military  spending as a condition for the use of its resources, the IMF has asserted  that its staff may need information about the level of and trend in military  expenditures and related transactions in order to permit a full and  internally consistent assessment of the member\u2019s economic position and  policies. In addition, IMF members we spoke with generally agreed that the  auditing and transparency mechanisms promoted by the mandate could  potentially bring important information regarding military spending to the  attention of donors.", "We reviewed five countries that were included on the October 1999 list of  22 noncompliant countries established by the U.S. Treasury (Burkina Faso,  Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Rwanda). Of these five  countries, as of November 9, 2000, only Guinea-Bissau is not in compliance  with the military audit mandate (see table 5).", "According to the U.S. Executive Director, U.S. success in advancing the  audits of military expenditures mandate was aided by two factors:  acceptance by the IMF of the merits of the issue, and the possibility that the  United States would oppose a country\u2019s use of IMF resources. There is a  widespread view in the international community, including at the IMF, that  good governance, transparency of budgets, unproductive spending, and  military spending are economic issues that could impact the effectiveness  of a country\u2019s macroeconomic reform effort. Therefore, IMF staff consider  it appropriate to raise concerns about military expenditures in the context  of their efforts to assist countries. As shown in table 5, IMF staff  encouraged the countries\u2019 authorities to audit government accounts,  including military receipts and expenditures. In the case of Kazakhstan,  IMF support was unnecessary because the country was already compliant.  In these cases, the changes encouraged by the IMF also helped the country  in its efforts to comply with the U.S. mandate. For example, in the case of  Indonesia, IMF staff strongly encouraged Indonesian officials to include a  commitment to audit off-budget military expenditures as part of its Letter  of Intent to the IMF. The inclusion of this commitment within the  Indonesian Letter of Intent was a contributing factor in the U.S. decision to  remove Indonesia from the list of noncompliant countries.", "Based on our review of country documents and discussions with Treasury,  U.S. Executive Director, and IMF officials, we have determined that the  success of the mandate was also aided by countries\u2019 desire to avoid having  the United States oppose their receipt of resources under their IMF  arrangements. As our military audit mandate case study revealed, certain  countries have agreed to undertake military audits as a response to U.S.  pressure. According to Treasury and U.S. Executive Director\u2019s officials,  because of the key role of the U.S. government in the IMF and the donor  community, recipient countries do not like having the United States oppose  their IMF program. Although U.S. opposition is not sufficient to veto a  country\u2019s access to IMF resources, according to U.S. and country officials,  the U.S. position raised the priority of this issue and motivated some of the  countries on the noncompliant list to become compliant more rapidly. For  example, according to Treasury, because the United States was threatening  to oppose debt relief to Burkina Faso, the authorities agreed to initiate an  audit of military spending earlier than they otherwise would have. In the  case of Guinea-Bissau and Rwanda, despite their efforts to become  compliant with the audits of military expenditures mandate, the U.S.  Executive Director opposed their receipt of IMF resources because at the  time of the review of their IMF arrangement, they were not compliant with  the criteria established by the Policy Group. Both countries continued to  address U.S. concerns following their reviews; Rwanda became compliant  in September 2000, and Treasury believes the government of Guinea-Bissau  is beginning to take steps to audit government expenditures, including the  military. According to a Treasury representative, the Treasury is working  with U.S. embassy representatives to ensure that Guinea-Bissau  understands U.S. legislative criteria requiring the reporting of its military  audit to civilian authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Impact of the Military Audit Mandate on Broader U.S. Influence at the IMF", "paragraphs": ["The impact of pursuing the military audit mandate on the broader U.S.  influence on IMF policy is uncertain. Based on our discussions with U.S.  and IMF officials, we have determined that the directed nature of the  mandate has worked to advance U.S. policy goals; nevertheless, it may also  limit U.S. credibility with other IMF members. There is widespread support  by IMF members with the intent of the legislation, meaning that countries  should strive to control their level of military spending and have in place a  system that provides accurate and reliable information to the public. As our  military audit mandate case study revealed, certain countries have agreed  to undertake military audits in response to U.S. pressure. However, other  IMF members we spoke with questioned whether the United States may  have promoted the military audit issue in certain countries simply because  it is a legislatively mandated directed vote and not necessarily because it  was in the best interest of the country at the time. Therefore, while U.S.  officials are pleased with the progress realized through their pursuit of the  mandate, they see a risk to U.S. credibility when they must emphasize one  issue over other more pressing matters that a country may be confronting.", "The mandate does not give the U.S. Executive Director the discretion to  determine when to pursue the military audit issue. As a result, the U.S.  Executive Director is compelled to advance the mandate with country  authorities and with IMF staff regardless of whether the U.S. Executive  Director believes it is an appropriate time to pursue the mandate with a  given country. Treasury staff and all of the executive directors we  interviewed at the IMF expressed concern with the inflexibility of the law.  The executive directors believe that the U.S. Executive Director has been  very effective in advancing the military audit mandate but, due to the  inflexibility of the mandate, has at times been too aggressive in this pursuit.", "The constraints imposed by the directed nature of the military audit  mandate were evident in our case study analyses. For example, as a result  of a severe economic crisis and the subsequent collapse of 30 years of  military dictatorship, Indonesia has been faced with many competing  priorities. Numerous Treasury and IMF documents and Board meeting  agendas over the past 3 years indicate that the major priorities of the IMF  Board for Indonesia centered on issues such as banking and corporate  restructuring, bankruptcy law, and social safety net issues. Annual audits of  off-budget revenues that fund the military were not one of these major  priorities. According to IMF staff, while the new democratic government of  Indonesia is receptive to the military audit mandate, discussions with  authorities on this issue were highly complex. For example, according to  IMF staff, the auditing capacity in Indonesia is limited, and it has been a  challenge getting the overall fiscal accounts under control, especially when  it requires the cooperation of the military. In addition, according to IMF  staff, the time frame needed to achieve transparency in military  expenditures is quite burdensome, and there are many immediate, more  urgent issues to address. IMF staff also believe that the Letter of Intent  commitment to audit off-budget sources that fund the military was  ambitious and should be recognized as such. IMF staff expressed concern  about having U.S. officials overemphasize this issue at this point.", "Similarly, Rwanda, as a post-conflict country, has several major priorities,  including government and macroeconomic stability, building  administrative capacity, and satisfying the requirements of the Heavily  Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Based on issues before the IMF Board,  an audit of its military spending was only one of a large number of  important priorities. According to the U.S. Executive Director, as of July  2000 Rwanda continued to face very difficult humanitarian and economic  problems that require the utmost resolve and determination to effectively  address. In addition, according to the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s  representative, when the United States abstained from voting on Rwanda\u2019s  program in July 2000, it required the U.S. Executive Director to raise as the  first priority an issue that was just one of the necessary steps to address the  country\u2019s many problems. The U.S. Executive Director was compelled to  abstain from voting to make a financial disbursement for Rwanda\u2019s  program because Rwanda was not yet in full compliance with the military  audit mandate\u2019s requirements. This occurred despite the administration\u2019s  knowledge that Rwanda would become compliant with the mandate  shortly and, in its judgment, was making good progress in implementing  economic reforms and improving fiscal transparency.", "IMF Board members understand that in certain cases the U.S. Executive  Director advanced military audit concerns because of the legislative  requirements and not necessarily because a focus on military audits was  among the most important issues confronting that country. These Board  members noted that the Executive Board generally makes decisions on a  consensus basis and that limitations on an executive director\u2019s discretion  runs counter to this practice. Therefore, while U.S. officials agree with the  intent of the mandate, they believe that there is a risk to U.S. credibility at  the IMF when the U.S. Executive Director must emphasize an issue over  other, more pressing priorities for a borrowing country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (P.L. 106-113  sec. 504 (e)) requires GAO to report on the extent to which Fund practices  are consistent with U.S. policies set forth in federal law.

To select these  case studies, we identified legislative mandates concerning U.S. policy  objectives with respect to the Fund, using our own legal analysis  supplemented with documentation obtained from Treasury. We used two  criteria as the basis for identifying the relevant laws for this review. We  defined these criteria as (1) any current law that explicitly directs the U.S.  Executive Director to use the U.S. vote at the Fund to achieve a policy goal  and (2) any current law that seeks to have the U.S. Executive Director use  the U.S. voice at the Fund to promote a U.S. policy or make a policy  change.", "We selected sound banking principles, labor policies, and audits of military  expenditures as the U.S. policy focus for our case studies. We chose these  policies because they represent a range of types of legislative provisions, or  mandates, that are set forth in federal law, including both voice and  directed vote provisions. We also chose these policies on the basis of our  preliminary analysis, which suggested that the U.S.\u2019 ability to impact Fund  practice was related to whether policies encompassed issues that were  viewed as central to the traditional focus of the Fund\u2019s mission. For each  policy issue, we reviewed Fund practices with respect to five member  countries that we selected based on a number of factors, including  geographic diversity, level of economic development, type of Fund  arrangement, and range of issues connected to the policy concern. For the  labor policies and audits of military expenditures case studies, we selected  only countries that have a financial arrangement with the Fund because the  language in their corresponding mandates is expressly directed at those  countries. Specifically, we selected the following countries for each case  study: (1) for sound banking principles, India, Mexico, Romania, South  Africa, and Thailand; (2) for labor policies, Argentina, Ghana, Kazakhstan,  Mexico, and Thailand; and (3) for audits of military expenditures, Burkina  Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Rwanda.
