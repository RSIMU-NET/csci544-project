For example, all 22 TCS programs in operation as of January 2019 require SGOs to register with or be approved by the state and limit the percentage of donations they can use for non-scholarship expenses. In addition, almost all of these programs\u2014which received over $1.1 billion in donations and awarded approximately 300,000 scholarships in 2017\u2014also require SGOs to undergo annual financial audits or reviews (19 programs). Fewer programs have requirements about SGO fundraising practices (9 programs) or the qualifications of SGO leadership personnel (10 programs), such as restrictions on officials having previous bankruptcies.", "States also have various key requirements that apply to private schools that enroll students with TCS scholarships. For example, private schools in most of the 22 programs must follow certain academic guidelines related to curriculum content (18 programs) and instructional time (19 programs), and have staff undergo background checks (18 programs). Schools in fewer programs are required to conduct academic testing (11 programs), ensure their teachers have specified qualifications (12 programs), or undergo an annual audit or financial review (4 programs).", "The three states with the largest TCS programs\u2014Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania\u2014implement and oversee their programs in different ways. In all three states, state agencies administer the tax credits while SGOs are generally responsible for managing donations and awarding scholarships; the details of these processes varied based on the requirements of each program. For example, Arizona and Pennsylvania's programs allow donors to recommend that funds go to specific schools, which can affect how SGOs solicit donations and award scholarships. Florida does not permit recommendations. All three states require SGOs to report on operations and undergo annual financial audits or reviews, while the states differ in how participating private schools are overseen.

We  grouped the requirements into the broad categories of financial,  administrative, and scholarship award requirements for SGOs and  academic, administrative, and financial requirements for schools. To  determine which of these key requirements states chose to use for SGOs  and schools in each TCS program as of school year (SY) 2018-2019, we  reviewed program documents from all 22 TCS programs operating in  January 2019 and sent our findings to officials from each state program  for verification.

Specifically, five of the eight programs in the three states  have a maximum total dollar limit on the amount of all scholarship tax  credits that can be awarded in a year. In those five programs, the state  requires donors to apply for pre-approval of the tax credits to ensure the  limit has not been reached and tax credits are still available. In the Florida  and Arizona programs that have such limits, state agencies consider all  donor applications for tax credit pre-approval on a first come, first served  basis. Pennsylvania considers returning donors for pre-approval before  considering new donors (while tax credits remain).", "State officials in Pennsylvania and Florida described different methods for  reviewing donors\u2019 tax compliance before and after they file their taxes and  claim the TCS tax credit. Specifically, the Pennsylvania Department of  Revenue checks for any outstanding tax liability before approving tax  credits for the TCS programs and reviews all tax returns that claim TCS  credits to ensure the amount of tax credits claimed does not exceed the  amount that was pre-approved. The Florida Department of Revenue  reviews tax returns that claim a TCS credit to ensure the amount of tax  credits used matches the approved amount that was allocated for the  donor.

However, states may provide guidance documents to help SGOs  navigate the state\u2019s general policies for the awards process.", "The number of SGOs awarding scholarships varied across the three  states, as did program policies for how those SGOs determine which  eligible students receive scholarships. In fall 2017, Florida had two  SGOs\u2014one of which awarded 99 percent of scholarships. Meanwhile,  Arizona\u2019s four TCS programs had between 14 and 60 SGOs each and  Pennsylvania\u2019s two programs had approximately 190 and 260 SGOs  each. In addition, as described in table 1, states varied in their  requirements for how SGOs prioritize eligible students, the degree to  which SGOs may work exclusively with a subset of schools, and whether  SGOs may consider donors\u2019 recommendations when deciding which  students receive scholarships. Further, because each SGO is responsible  for establishing its own procedures for awarding scholarships within  program requirements, a TCS program with many SGOs could have  substantial variation in how scholarships are awarded.", "Prioritizing eligible students: The three states provide varying levels of  discretion to SGOs in how they prioritize eligible students when awarding  scholarships. For example, Florida\u2019s largest program requires SGOs to  award scholarships on a first-come, first-served basis with first priority to  students who previously received a scholarship, and then to students  from lower-income households or who are in foster care; its other  program requires SGOs to award scholarships to students on a first- come, first-served basis. Two programs in Arizona and one in  Pennsylvania outline requirements for how SGOs must prioritize among  eligible students, while the remaining programs do not. Further, in all four  Arizona programs and both Pennsylvania programs, SGOs are permitted  to set additional criteria for selecting scholarship recipients beyond  requirements set by the state, as long as those criteria align with program  rules and existing laws. For example, officials we spoke with at one SGO  in Arizona noted that their selection committee considers written  narratives from students and their parents about the student\u2019s character  and academic achievement when prioritizing eligible students, among  other factors.", "Working with a subset of schools: State policies about partnerships  between SGOs and schools can affect which students receive  scholarship awards and where students can use those awards. SGOs in  Florida award scholarships to students who can then use their  scholarship award at any private school that qualifies to participate in the  TCS program. In contrast, Arizona and Pennsylvania allow SGOs to  partner with subsets of participating schools and award scholarships  exclusively to students at those schools. For example, in Arizona and  Pennsylvania, some SGO officials noted that the scholarships awarded  through their SGO may only be used at partner schools that shared a  religious affiliation with the SGO.", "Allowing donor recommendations: The TCS programs in the three  states also had different rules on whether donors may recommend that  scholarships be awarded to particular schools or students. Florida  prohibits donors from making scholarship recommendations or  designations for specific schools or students. In all Pennsylvania and  Arizona programs, donors can recommend or designate donations for  specific schools, but SGOs can take different approaches to distributing  any such recommended funds. For example, one SGO in Pennsylvania  sends recommended donation funds directly to the designated schools  and the school decides how to distribute the scholarship funds among  eligible students. In Arizona, one SGO tracks the amount of donations  donors recommend for each of its partner schools and awards those  funds to eligible students enrolled at those schools.", "Further, Arizona\u2019s two TCS programs designed for individual donors  (rather than businesses), allow donors to recommend that the funds they  donate go to specific students. An official at one SGO we visited in  Arizona said they provided its external scholarship award committee with  information about students\u2019 applications, including any student-specific  recommendations, to inform the selection process. Pennsylvania  programs do not expressly prohibit donor recommendations for specific  students. In Pennsylvania, officials from one school that was also a SGO  told us that they did not accept student-specific recommendations, while  officials in a different SGO described how donors may not make student- specific recommendations, but may designate certain groups of students,  such as children of first responders.", "In addition to establishing program policies regarding how eligible  students are selected, the three states also have requirements regarding  the amount of scholarship money that can be awarded per student, and  SGO officials described different methods for determining the amount and  frequency of scholarship awards for each student. Among the schools  we visited the proportion of students who received TCS scholarships  compared to students who did not receive TCS scholarships varied. For  example, in one school in Florida, less than one percent of students  received TCS scholarships and in a school in Arizona, school officials told  us that about 80 percent of students receive TCS program scholarships.  When awarding scholarships, officials at some SGOs we visited chose to  issue a limited number of awards at the maximum allowable scholarship  amount while others chose to issue scholarships to more students in  smaller amounts\u2014sometimes for shorter periods. In addition, students in  Arizona and Pennsylvania may receive multiple concurrent scholarships  from different SGOs, different TCS programs in the state, or both. This  approach potentially increases the amount of funding students receive;  however, it can also present logistical difficulties for the schools and  families of scholarship recipients, according to SGO and school officials.  For instance, officials at one school described wanting students to receive  as much TCS funding as possible, but said it was also challenging to  track the different SGO award cycles, incoming funds, and the projected  impact on tuition balances for each student.", "As part of the scholarship award process, some SGOs we visited told us  they collected information about tuition and fees at schools to ensure  scholarship award amounts do not exceed school tuition, per program  requirements.

The extent to  which these audits or reviews include an assessment of SGO compliance  with program requirements varies.

The officials said that once a SGO has been approved through the states\u2019  initial application process it is very likely that they will be renewed each  year unless a large compliance issue arises. Officials in Pennsylvania  noted that they contact SGOs to clarify discrepancies in documentation  and have temporarily revoked approval from a small proportion of SGOs  that failed to submit required information.

Florida state officials described using a variety of  monitoring activities to oversee participating private schools, while  Arizona and Pennsylvania state agency officials said they do not conduct  ongoing monitoring activities due to the parameters of their statutory  authority. (See table 3.)", "Florida state officials described conducting site visits to schools during the  initial application process and when they determine schools are at risk of  noncompliance. They also noted their monitoring practices have led them  to identify multiple issues of noncompliance at certain schools and, as a  result, they have temporarily or permanently suspended those schools  from receiving TCS program funds. They said the state also delegates  certain monitoring activities to SGOs, such as reviewing financial audit  results, following up with schools to resolve any issues resulting from  those audits, and reporting those issues to the state. State and SGO  officials said that SGOs in Florida may also be responsible for  implementing any penalties to schools, such as adjusting scholarship  payments to schools that do not meet certain reporting requirements.", "For all Arizona programs and one of two Pennsylvania programs, officials  told us that they generally rely on SGOs to verify that schools receiving  scholarship funds meet program requirements. For example, in Arizona,  SGOs are responsible for determining if a school qualifies to participate in  the state\u2019s TCS programs. SGO officials we spoke to in Arizona noted  they require schools to sign documents attesting that the school meets  the requirements to be a qualified school. In Pennsylvania\u2019s Educational  Improvement Tax Credit Program, SGOs determine whether schools are  qualified to participate and each SGO may approach this differently,  according to state officials. For example, in addition to meeting the state\u2019s  criteria for participation in the program, one SGO we spoke with in  Pennsylvania also required schools to be tax-exempt, have a board and  budget, and share its religious affiliation. Another SGO we spoke with in  Pennsylvania required that a school attest that it meets program  requirements. In Pennsylvania\u2019s other TCS program (the Opportunity  Scholarship Tax Credit Program) state officials told us that they determine  whether schools are qualified to participate and do not conduct  subsequent monitoring activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education for  review and comment. Education\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix  III. Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate. We also provided relevant excerpts from the report to the  appropriate state agencies in each state we reviewed and incorporated  their technical changes as appropriate.", "Education did not comment on the report\u2019s findings. Instead, it provided  information about the administration\u2019s tax credit proposal and made  observations about how the scope of TCS programs covered in our report  was both similar and different from educational programs that are  addressed in the administration\u2019s proposal. In its comments, Education  further stated that given these scope differences, the GAO report may not  fully inform the debate around the administration\u2019s proposal. As stated in  the draft report, promoting school choice options\u2014both private and  public\u2014through a variety of spending and tax expenditure programs  continues to be a topic of national debate. The purpose of this report was  to examine state TCS programs that are used to fund scholarships that  students can use to attend private elementary and secondary schools by  describing: (1) key requirements state TCS programs have chosen to  establish for SGOs, (2) key requirements for private schools participating  in state TCS programs, and (3) how selected states implement TCS  programs and how they assess whether SGOs and participating private  schools are following key state requirements.", "Education stated that the draft report does not note that several TCS  programs allow scholarships to be used for educational expenses beyond  tuition. As stated in the draft report, some states use tax credit  scholarship programs to fund preschool, career and technical education,  or public school initiatives; the draft report further noted that these  programs are outside the scope of this review. This report is the second  of two GAO reports examining K-12 TCS programs. The prior report  (GAO-18-679) discussed various ways students can use state K-12 TCS  scholarships. Specifically, we reported that, as of SY 2017-2018, more  than half of the programs (13 of 22) allowed students to use their  scholarship money for costs like transportation and books in addition to  tuition, whereas the remaining programs (9 of 22) required scholarship  funds to be used for tuition only.", "Education asserted positive fiscal effects associated with state TCS  programs and cited several studies to this end. As stated in the draft  report, tax credits are a form of forgone revenue. Assessing the fiscal  impact of these programs was not among the purposes of this report.   Thus, we did not assess the reliability of these studies or the validity of  their results. Education also commented on our decision to exclude  Montana\u2019s TCS program from the scope of this report. As noted in our  report, we did not include Montana\u2019s program because it was the subject  of pending litigation at the time of our review.", "Finally, Education noted, as also stated in the draft report, that states and  school districts have obligations under the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to make  equitable services available to eligible private school students, including  those who participate in TCS programs. We agree and have reported  extensively on equitable services in the context of private schools in  GAO-16-712 and GAO-18-94. In GAO-18-94, we recommended that  Education review information provided by states related to changes in  federal special education rights when a parent places a student with a  disability in private school and work with the states to correct inaccurate  or incorrect information. In that report, we identified some private school  choice programs that were providing information that Education confirmed  inaccurately described rights under the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act when a student with a disability is moved from a public to a  private school. Education agreed with this recommendation \u2013 a  recommendation GAO considers to be among the highest priority of  recommendations we have made to the Department. However, Education  has not yet fully implemented this recommendation and, as of September  2019, we found that some information Education confirmed to be  inaccurate remains in several states\u2019 private school choice program  documents.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
