By 1998, they are expected to represent 75 percent of world agricultural trade, according to FAS. The United States\u2019 greatest strength in agricultural exports has traditionally been in bulk commodities, and it has consistently operated as the world\u2019s largest exporter of them. However, the member nations of the European Union (EU) constitute the world\u2019s largest exporter of high-value agricultural products (see app. I for a list of the 12 top exporters of high-value products in 1992).", "Because purchasing decisions for bulk commodities are based largely on price, success in exporting them depends primarily on maintaining a cost advantage in their production and transport. Because HVP purchasing decisions depend on product attributes, such as brand-name packaging and quality image, in addition to price, success in the export of HVPs is based more on the exporter\u2019s skill in developing and marketing the product. Exporting countries have a variety of programs and organizations to assist exporters in developing markets for high-value products. While the recent multilateral trade agreement of the Uruguay Round (UR) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would limit the extent to which countries could provide subsidies to the agricultural sector, it would not limit the extent to which countries could fund market development activities.

The organizations are funded either entirely through user fees and levies on private industry, as with Germany, or through a combination of private and public funds, as with France and the United Kingdom. Both public and private sector representatives play a role in managing the marketing organizations. They conduct a number of different types of promotions, provide an array of services to exporters, and promote nearly all high-value products and commodities. The Netherlands does not have a single primary market development organization but rather a number of independent commodity boards and trade associations.

USDA provides funding to support their export activities through its Market Promotion Program (MPP) and the Foreign Market Development Program, also known as the Cooperator Program. MPP provides money to the trade associations to conduct generic promotions or to fund private companies\u2019 brand-name promotions. MPP activities are predominantly for high-value products. The Cooperator Program provides financial and technical support to U.S. cooperators, representing about 40 specific commodity sectors, who work at overseas offices to increase long-term access to and demand for U.S. products. The program is mostly aimed at promoting bulk commodities, but a portion of the program\u2019s budget supports HVP market development (see app. III for a more detailed discussion of U.S. foreign market development).", "USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service administers these programs and provides funding, but the individual trade associations themselves are generally responsible for carrying out the export activities.

The European marketing organizations that promoted high-value products included various types of public-private partnerships. In all cases, however, the organizations were financed, at least in part, either through user fees or a system of mandatory levies on the agricultural industry. The sectors of agribusiness that paid the levies varied by country. They typically included producers but also sometimes included processors, wholesalers, or traders. The annual government expenditures for foreign market development ranged from zero to $29 million in 1993 in the four European countries we reviewed, according to estimates by FAS and information provided by the foreign marketing organizations. The portion of the country\u2019s total foreign market development that was funded by government expenditures ranged from zero percent to 42 percent. By contrast, the U.S. government spent about $121 million on HVP foreign market development in 1993, representing about 80 percent of all U.S. spending on foreign market development for HVPs.", "In France, about 38 percent of total foreign market development for agriculture was funded by government expenditures in 1993. About 35 percent of the 1993 budget of SOPEXA, the export promotion agency, was provided by the government; the remainder came from producers or producer groups who benefited from SOPEXA\u2019s promotions and who collected funds from producer levies. Government expenditures also funded 65 percent of CFCE, the market information agency, with the remainder coming from user fees.", "In Germany, CMA, the quasi-governmental export promotion agency, did not receive public funds in 1993. For many years, the agency has been financed entirely through compulsory levies on agricultural producers and processors.", "In the United Kingdom, about 42 percent of total foreign market development for HVPs was paid for by public funds. Food From Britain received about 60 percent of its funding in 1993 from government expenditures, with the rest coming from commodity marketing boards and user fees from individual exporters who requested services.

For example, the government expenditures previously cited include spending on foreign market development activities, such as market research and consumer promotion but do not include spending on other kinds of agricultural support and export programs, such as direct export subsidies, domestic subsidies, and price supports. These programs also serve, directly or indirectly, to increase HVP exports, and spending for such programs is estimated by FAS to be far higher in Europe than it is in the United States. According to FAS, total agricultural support spending in 1992 was $46.7 billion in the European Union, compared with $10.9 billion in the United States.", "Furthermore, the bulk of agricultural exports of the four European countries we reviewed went to other European Union members. For several reasons, an EU producer is likely to have an easier time exporting to another EU country than a U.S. producer would. The EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy has created a unified set of trade regulations and eliminated among members most tariff and nontariff trade barriers, making trade between EU members somewhat comparable to U.S. interstate commerce. European producers are also more likely to be familiar with the consumer preferences, customs, and distribution systems of other European countries. Moreover, because of the vast domestic market in the United States, U.S. producers may be less likely to seek out export markets than European producers, who have smaller domestic markets and often have a long history of exporting a substantial portion of their production."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. and European Export Promotion Activities", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. and European marketing organizations we reviewed carry out similar foreign market development activities, though the emphasis they put on the various activities differs. The activities conducted generally included market research, consulting services, trade servicing, consumer promotions, advertising, and sponsorship at trade shows.", "Market research is often considered the foundation of market development. It is conducted to determine the potential demand for a particular product, to assess consumer preferences, or to develop statistical information on agricultural trade and economics. Consulting services may be offered to provide advice to exporters on appropriate promotions and to help exporters learn about the laws, regulations, and requirements of particular markets. Trade servicing involves developing trade leads to match up exporters with appropriate importers. In addition, some organizations advertise their country\u2019s products in trade journals and other publications in order to support retail promotion strategies and to enhance the image and awareness of their country\u2019s products.", "Consumer-oriented activities include in-store promotions, where advertising materials and product samples are distributed at point-of-sale locations. These activities may serve either to promote a particular product or to enhance the overall image of a country\u2019s food products. Additionally, some organizations provide retail stores with advertising displays and decorations. Some countries\u2019 marketing organizations also do direct consumer advertising on television, on radio, or in print. Finally, marketing organizations assist their exporters by coordinating or subsidizing their participation in international trade shows. Trade shows allow exporters to test a market, meet potential buyers, and monitor the competition.", "In general, the U.S. programs place more emphasis on consumer advertising than do the European programs. MPP funds are often used by U.S. companies or producer groups to finance product advertising campaigns, which tend to be an expensive form of market promotion. Representatives of the European marketing organizations generally told us that consumer advertising was too costly, given their limited budgets. They focused more on influencing wholesalers and usually placed a higher priority on trade shows. They attempted to reach consumers more through vehicles such as in-store promotions than through direct media advertising.", "In our 1990 review of foreign market development organizations, we reported that many other nations integrated their foreign market development activities\u2014coordinating their market research, promotional activities, and production capabilities to meet consumer demand in foreign markets. U.S. producers and producer groups did not coordinate their activities in the same manner, nor did they strategically target markets as did some of their competitors. This may be because European marketing organizations, such as France\u2019s SOPEXA and Germany\u2019s CMA, promote nearly all agricultural products and thus can develop integrated marketing plans for increasing their countries\u2019 HVP exports. The system of foreign market development in the United States is far more decentralized.", "As we have reported, USDA has been slow to develop a USDA-wide marketing strategy that would assist U.S. producers in becoming more coordinated and marketing oriented in their approach to promoting U.S. exports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States and Europeans Differ in Evaluating Program Activities", "paragraphs": ["The European organizations we reviewed perform little formal, quantified evaluation of their HVP promotion efforts.

For the purposes of these 1992 export statistics, ERS\u2019 definition of HVPs included semiprocessed foods, such as wheat flour and vegetable oil, but excluded certain products that did not meet ERS\u2019 statistical definition of an agricultural product. Thus the HVP export data for 1992 did not include cigarettes, distilled spirits, fishery products, or forestry products. Trade statistics sometimes exclude intra-EU trade, since this trade is sometimes viewed as comparable to U.S. interstate commerce. However, we have included intra-EU trade in our trade statistics, since the European organizations we reviewed treat trade with other EU countries as foreign (as opposed to domestic) market development, and since a considerable portion of their export promotion activity is within the EU."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Boston Regional Office", "paragraphs": ["C.
