IRS does not make this nor other types of customer service information easily available to taxpayers, such as in an online dashboard. Without easily accessible information, taxpayers are not well informed on what to expect when requesting services from IRS.", "IRS has improved aspects of service for victims of identity theft (IDT) refund fraud. However, inefficiencies contribute to delays, and potentially weak internal controls may lead to the release of fraudulent refunds. In turn, this limits IRS's ability to serve taxpayers and protect federal dollars. While IRS has reduced its backlog of IDT cases and formed a team to improve its handling of these cases, GAO has identified areas for potential improvement. Specifically:", "File retrieval and scanning processes contributed to delays and unnecessary requests for documents. For example, in 2 of 16 cases, resolution was delayed by at least 1 month while an assistor waited for another unit to retrieve and scan documents into IRS's system. In one of those cases, plus one other, the document request was unnecessary because the assistor closed the case without the document. Inefficient processes and unnecessary requests to retrieve and scan documents can delay case resolution and refunds to the legitimate taxpayer.", "Potential weaknesses in IRS's internal control processes could lead to IRS paying refunds to fraudsters. In discussion groups with GAO, IRS assistors and managers said some assistors may release refunds even if indicators on the account show that the tax return is under review for IDT, or two returns have been filed for that taxpayer. Some participants said assistors answering telephone calls can release these holds because they do not understand the codes on the taxpayer's account. IRS officials said that these errors are not widespread and provided data to support their position. However, GAO identified weaknesses in those data, which IRS officials acknowledged. In response to this report, in January 2017 officials provided another analysis of IRS data that they said showed this type of error does occur but may not be as widespread as staff and managers suggested. GAO will continue to work with IRS to determine if these additional data are sufficient to address its recommendation.", "IRS does not notify taxpayers when a dependent's identity appears on a fraudulent return. According to IRS officials, the agency does not consider a dependent to be a victim if his or her Social Security number had been used as a dependent on a fraudulent return. However, IRS has previously provided guidance to taxpayers when a dependent was a victim of identity theft. After one data breach in 2015, IRS notified taxpayers and provided information on actions that parents could take to protect a minor's identity when their dependents were also victims. By not notifying taxpayers that their dependents' information may have been used to commit fraud, IRS is limiting taxpayers' ability to take action to protect their dependents' identity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends IRS display customer service standards and performance online; review its retrieval and scanning processes; improve existing data or collect new data to monitor how and why assistors release refunds before closing an IDT or duplicate return case; and revise its notices to IDT victims.", "IRS disagreed with GAO's recommendation to improve data for monitoring refund releases, stating that the problem is not widespread and current processes are sufficient.

Callers experienced long  wait times and only 38 percent of callers who wanted to speak with an  IRS assistor reached one. The severe decline in service highlights the  challenges of managing IRS\u2019s operations and underscores the  importance of IRS making tough decisions to improve service.  Maintaining quality customer service is important because it helps  taxpayers comply with the tax code.", "IRS also has been confronted with the growing problem of identity theft  (IDT) refund fraud over the past several years. IDT refund fraud occurs  when a fraudster obtains an individual\u2019s Social Security number (SSN),  date of birth, or other personally identifiable information (PII), and uses it  to file a fraudulent tax return seeking a refund. This crime is an evolving  and costly problem that causes hardship for legitimate taxpayers who are  victimized, and demands an increasing amount of IRS resources. IDT  refund fraud burdens honest taxpayers because authenticating their  identities is likely to delay the processing of their returns and refunds in  those cases where a legitimate refund is due. Given current and  emerging risks, in 2015, we expanded our high-risk area on the  enforcement of tax laws to include IRS\u2019s efforts to address IDT refund  fraud. IRS estimates that at least $14.59 billion in IDT tax refund fraud  was attempted in calendar year 2015 of which it prevented at least $12.35  billion (85 percent), but at least $2.24 billion (15 percent) was paid.", "You asked us to review IRS\u2019s 2016 filing season.

We also collected and reviewed relevant  documentation from IRS officials to evaluate IRS\u2019s actions to implement  selected prior recommendations. Additionally, we conducted a file review  of 16 IDT cases at an IRS facility in Atlanta where some assistors who  handle IDT cases work and where IRS\u2019s Wage and Investment Division is  located, which plays a key role in IDT prevention and case management.  We identified these cases by using stratified random sampling from an  IRS-provided list of all IDT cases either open or closed during a 10-month  period spanning 2015 and 2016. We designed the selection process to  include cases with varied statuses, and drew them from three groups\u2014 open cases, short cases, and long cases. For each case type category,  we oversampled to account for cases where the case had recently closed  and to be able to select cases with refund interest. We sent a list of the  IDT cases we selected to IRS officials with instructions about the order in  which they should pull files for our review. During our file review, we  verified the steps included in our instructions to ensure that IRS officials  completed our instructions accurately. In addition, to identify participants  we asked IRS to locate assistors and managers who are involved in  resolving IDT cases in Atlanta and Kansas City, Missouri, two of eight locations where IRS works IDT cases. We divided them into five different  discussion groups to obtain their perspectives on how IRS can more  efficiently provide customer service to IDT victims. The findings from the  file review and discussion groups cannot be generalized to all IDT cases  or the perspectives of all IDT caseworkers.", "To evaluate IRS\u2019s efforts to improve customer service, we identified  federal standards for evaluating performance under the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act and relevant  customer service-related Executive Orders, Presidential Memorandums,  and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, as well as  internal control standards, and compared IRS actions to those  standards.  We assessed the reliability of the data we report by  reviewing IRS reports for each of the areas in our review, such as multiple  key telephone service reports, reports on return processing and refunds,  and reports on IDT inventory. We examined the data in the reports to  identify obvious errors or outliers, or potential data limitations that would  affect how we use the data, and found no such problems.

For  example, IRS officials said that total overtime increased about 60 percent  (from 55 to 88 FTEs between fiscal years 2015 and 2016) for staff  working at the three centers that process tax returns from individuals.", "Another challenge IRS faced this filing season involved processing  returns from taxpayers who did not correctly report advance Premium Tax  Credit (PTC) payments they received during 2015. The PTC is a  refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families with  low- or moderate-income afford health insurance purchased through the  Health Insurance Marketplaces. When individuals enroll through a  marketplace, they can elect to have the marketplace estimate the amount  of the PTC, based on information they provide when enrolling, and have it  paid in advance to their health insurance company to lower monthly  insurance premiums. Alternatively, they can elect to claim all of the credit  when they file their tax return.  For individuals who elect to receive the  credit in advance, the amount they receive may differ from the amount  they are eligible for, which they calculate at the time they file their return.  Taxpayers who enroll in a marketplace and receive advance payments of  the PTC must file a tax return and reconcile the amount they received by  completing Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit.", "In the 2 years that the PTC has been available, many taxpayers did not  reconcile the amount they received when they filed their return.   Beginning in 2015, IRS used third-party data from the marketplaces to  conduct pre-refund matching and verify whether taxpayers had reconciled  the advance PTC. To address any discrepancies, in 2015, IRS first  processed returns that did not reconcile the PTC and then notified those  taxpayers informing them that they needed to reconcile. These  taxpayers had to file an amended return reconciling the correct PTC  amount they received in advance before they could receive health  insurance through the marketplaces in 2016. For the 2016 filing season,  IRS changed its procedures so that when taxpayers did not reconcile the  PTC, IRS corresponded with them explaining they needed to reconcile  before IRS continued processing the return. While IRS\u2019s new procedures  delayed processing for these returns, IRS officials explain that it helped  both IRS and PTC recipients. For example, according to an IRS analysis,  IRS\u2019s correspondence brought about half of these taxpayers into  compliance. IRS officials also stated that IRS will save resources by not  having to process as many amended returns that taxpayers submit to  reconcile PTC. They added this also benefits those taxpayers who  respond to IRS\u2019s correspondence because they would not have to file an  amended return before they could receive health insurance through the  marketplaces in 2017. IRS officials anticipate using this procedure again  for the 2017 filing season.", "In cases where a taxpayer did not reconcile the advance PTC, IRS does  not have the authority to automatically correct the tax return and notify the  taxpayer of the change. In other circumstances, IRS has statutory math  error authority to fix easily correctable calculation errors and check for  other obvious noncompliance in limited circumstances. According to IRS  officials, having authority to correct PTC errors would allow IRS to  process the return more quickly without having to correspond with the  taxpayer or expend further resources to audit taxpayers\u2019 compliance.  However, as we reported in 2015, the marketplace data IRS uses for  prerefund matching of PTC data were incomplete and not fully accurate.  In June 2016, IRS officials told us that, while the completeness and  quality of the marketplace data have improved, they have not yet fully  assessed whether the data are reliable to use in correcting returns.", "We have previously suggested that Congress authorize math error  authority on a broader basis with appropriate controls. For each year  beginning with fiscal year 2015, legislative proposals were submitted that,  among other things, would establish a category of correctable errors.  Under the proposals, Treasury would be granted regulatory authority to  permit IRS to correct errors in cases where information provided by a  taxpayer does not match corresponding information provided in  government databases. Congress has not granted this broad authority.  Correctable error authority could help IRS meet its goals for the timely  processing of tax returns, providing taxpayers with refunds quicker, and  reducing the burden on taxpayers of responding to IRS correspondence.  It can also reduce the need for IRS to resolve discrepancies in post-filing  compliance, which, as we previously concluded, is less effective and  more costly than at-filing compliance. However, the third-party data IRS  uses for matching should be sufficiently complete and accurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Improved Aspects of Service but Inefficiencies and Potentially Weak Internal Controls Reduce IRS\u2019s Ability to Serve IDT Victims and Protect Federal Dollars", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Reduced Time to Resolve IDT Cases, but Inefficient Processes Contribute to Delays", "paragraphs": ["IRS opens IDT cases when (1) it identifies potential IDT through its  automated filters and other reviews of taxpayer returns, or (2) taxpayers  alert IRS to potential IDT, such as when they are unable to file a tax  return electronically because a fraudster already filed one for that  taxpayer. From 2012 to 2015, IRS opened a relatively steady number of  new IDT cases. According to IRS officials, in fiscal year 2016, the number  of new IDT cases declined because IRS improved its ability to detect  fraud before processing the return. In fiscal year 2012, IRS experienced a  backlog of more than 370,000 IDT cases with an overage rate of about 57  percent. Since then, IRS has generally processed cases more quickly  and reduced the overage rate to 10 percent or less. In late fiscal year  2015, IRS formed an IDT Victims Assistance Unit, dedicating 322 FTEs to  it for that portion of the year and 1,270 FTEs for fiscal year 2016. Timely  resolution of IDT cases reduces burden to taxpayers who must deal with  delayed refunds as they authenticate their identities with IRS. It can also reduce the amount of refund interest IRS pays to some taxpayers, which  is required if IRS takes longer than 45 days after the filing deadline, or in  the case of a return filed after the deadline, within 45 days of the date the  return was filed, to issue a refund. IDT has been among the top reasons  for the largest of such payments for the past 4 years.", "IRS continues to work toward improving its processing of IDT cases, in  part by forming the IDT reengineering team to improve customer service  for IDT victims.

IRS merged its IDT compliance inventory  with some of its other IDT inventory. IRS officials said this allows IRS  to close cases faster since all of its cases are in one system and they  no longer need to transfer paper documents to different locations.", "Managing case flow. IRS developed a matrix for assistors and  managers to determine which functional area, such as exams or  accounts management, can best work a case.

The new  form is to provide an option for the taxpayer to include a secondary  taxpayer\u2019s Social Security number who was also affected by the  identity theft. This additional information will help IRS assistors better  identify the true taxpayer. Additionally, it can help prevent multiple  forms submitted separately by primary and secondary taxpayers,  which can be burdensome for the taxpayer and result in processing  delays for IRS.", "According to IRS officials, implementing these changes recommended by  the IDT reengineering team contributed to IRS closing IDT cases faster.", "IRS reduced the time an IDT case is open from an average of 242 days in  fiscal year 2012 to 106 days in fiscal year 2016. Nonetheless, overage  rates have increased from 0.7 percent in fiscal year 2015 to 8.8 percent in  fiscal year 2016.

In addition, we conducted  five discussion groups with 15 IRS assistors and 13 managers  responsible for handling IDT cases in Atlanta and Kansas City, Missouri.  The findings from the file review and discussion groups cannot be  generalized to all IDT cases or the perspectives of all IDT assistors and  managers. Further, because IRS recently implemented some  improvements, their effect may not be fully reflected in the cases we  reviewed. During our review we observed several areas that contributed  to delays in resolving cases (see table 1).", "Of the reasons for delays we observed, in addition to the complexity of  cases, the following most frequently contributed to delays of a month or  longer in handling the case. Assistors and managers in our discussion  groups generally agreed that each of these issues were primary  contributors to delays.", "Reassignments. In 6 of 16 cases that we reviewed, we found that IRS\u2019s  policies and procedures contributed to the length of time it took for IRS to  close cases. In these cases, IRS transferred work multiple times between  different units and assistors. IRS officials explained this occurs to help  IRS balance its workload and identify either the best-suited assistor or  one with availability to work the case. The officials said that its  reengineering team has been addressing this, and will continue to do so  in the future.", "Inventory Management. In 5 of 16 instances, the case remained in  inventory while waiting for an assistor to review it. For example, case 15  was in the queue for more than a month awaiting an assistor\u2019s review  before it was transferred to another assistor, and closed in August 2016  after 193 days. IRS officials explained that declining resources have  contributed to the length of time it takes to close a case.", "File retrieval and scanning. In 3 of 16 cases we reviewed, file retrieval  and scanning contributed to delays and unnecessary requests for  documents. For cases 10 and 13, resolution was delayed by at least 1  month while the assistor waited for another unit to retrieve and scan  documents into IRS\u2019s inventory system to use in reviewing the case. For  case 10, the assistor waited about 5 weeks to receive the documents and  closed the case about 2 days afterward. In case 13, the assistor  requested documents twice and it took IRS about 7 weeks to retrieve and  scan the documents. During this time, IRS reassigned the case to another  assistor who closed it without receiving the documents. Similarly, in case  11, IRS took about 6 weeks to retrieve and scan the documents into IRS\u2019s  systems, but the assistor closed the case about 3 weeks before receiving  the documents. IRS officials explained that the assistors may not require  the documents to close the case, but many assistors prefer to have the  documents. These officials noted that in June 2016, IRS revised some of  its guidance to assistors on when to request a specific type of  documentation to use in determining which tax return is legitimate.", "In our discussion groups, 14 of 28 assistors and managers generally  agreed that delays in receiving scanned documents were a primary factor  that delayed case resolution. Assistors and managers described a typical  waiting period of more than 30 days for document requests to be fulfilled.  IRS officials noted that some documents must be retrieved from IRS\u2019s  paper records storage facilities, which can take time to locate and then  scan.", "In its fiscal year 2014-2017 strategic plan, one of IRS\u2019s objectives is to  provide prompt assistance to support IDT victims. Federal agencies can  achieve their objectives and missions, and improve accountability by  having an effective internal control system. As set forth in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, internal controls comprise the  plans, methods, and procedures used to meet an entity\u2019s mission, goals,  and objectives, which support performance-based management.  Internal controls help agency program managers achieve desired results  and provide reasonable assurance that program objectives are being  achieved through, among other things, effective and efficient use of  agency resources and ensuring that personnel have the required  knowledge, skills, and abilities.", "While IRS has taken some steps to more quickly resolve IDT cases, IRS  is missing an opportunity to potentially reduce delays and unnecessary  requests related to retrieving and scanning documents. IRS officials  stated that they are not reviewing the retrieval and scanning processes to  identify efficiencies, such as prioritizing requests or providing guidance  and training to assistors on which documents are required to close a  case. Without identifying efficiencies, it is more likely cases could be  delayed, which can delay the processing of returns and refunds in those  cases where a legitimate refund is due, and contribute to increased  interest paid by IRS on late refunds. When we discussed this with IRS  officials, they agreed that it was reasonable to review the file retrieval and  scanning processes, and said the IDT reengineering team could evaluate  it as part of its ongoing efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Does Not Know the Extent to Which Its Internal Control Processes Prevent Release of Fraudulent Refunds", "paragraphs": ["Based upon our case reviews and discussion groups, we identified one  weakness in IRS\u2019s internal control processes that resulted in refunds paid  to fraudsters and another potential weakness that could lead to additional  releases of fraudulent refunds.

In one case we reviewed, case  10, IRS released a fraudulent refund of about $9,900 even though the tax  return was flagged for potential IDT. IRS screens all tax returns for  characteristics that it identified in previous IDT refund fraud schemes. If  flagged for review, IRS stops processing the return, places a hold on the  refund, and sends a letter asking the taxpayer to confirm his or her  identity. However, IRS designed several refund holds to expire after a  certain amount of time, ranging from 1 to 11 weeks. When holds expired,  IRS\u2019s computer systems automatically release the refund. In the case we  identified, a hold had been placed on the account, but it expired before an  assistor had completed the review and IRS computer systems  automatically processed the refund. IRS has processes to recoup refunds  issued to the wrong person, and in the case we reviewed, IRS has taken  steps to do so. IRS reported it identified this problem in October 2015 and  removed the automatic expirations of this type of hold.", "Assistors may release refunds before closing a case. According to  IRS assistors and managers who participated in our discussion groups,  some assistors may release refunds that could be paid to fraudsters in  spite of having a refund hold in place on the taxpayer\u2019s account. This can  occur even when indicators on the account show that the tax return is  under review for identity theft or that two returns have been filed for that  taxpayer\u2019s account (duplicate return filing). In three of our discussion  groups, we asked how refunds could be released before a case is closed,  and all 17 participants in those groups agreed that assistors may be  releasing refunds when answering telephone inquiries about them.  Several of these assistors and managers described this as a common  occurrence, and stated that, due to a lack of training, assistors may not  understand the codes on the taxpayer\u2019s account. Moreover, some   discussion group participants surmised that some of these callers could  be fraudsters.", "In contrast to the assistors and managers in our discussion groups, IRS  senior officials told us they do not consider this a widespread error or a  result from a lack of training. IRS officials further stated that the assistors  and managers we spoke to might have been observing automatic refund  releases, such as the one described above, and assumed that assistors  were manually releasing refunds. Officials also said that the culture at IRS  is such that assistors are reluctant to release a refund incorrectly.  Therefore they tend to be cautious in taking such steps. To support their  position, IRS officials provided us with data IRS collects and analyzes on  duplicate refunds, such as instances where assistors manually processed  a refund although one already had been issued. IRS also provided data it  uses to assess the quality of assistors\u2019 work and to inform training needs.  However, both sets of data do not include sufficient information for IRS  officials to determine the extent to which one assistor may release a  refund before another assistor closes an IDT or duplicate return case. In addition, in the data IRS uses to assess the quality of assistors\u2019 work, IRS  undercounted the total number of erroneous refunds. Officials later  explained they generated that data in response to our findings, but stated  that the data were not routinely collected and did not reliably count the  errors.  We were therefore unable to use any of these data to support  IRS\u2019s position that such errors were minimal and assistors did not need  training.

However,  when IRS notified the taxpayer that he or she had been a victim of IDT,  the notice did not mention that a thief had also stolen the dependents\u2019  identities and used them in the fraudulent return. According to IRS  officials, the agency treats dependents as IDT victims if their SSN had  been used fraudulently as either a primary or secondary taxpayer.  However, this is not the case when a dependent\u2019s identity is used as a  dependent on a fraudulent return, as we observed in case 11.  In such  instances, dependents do not yet have taxpayer accounts, so IRS officials  stated that there are no protections that IRS can provide, such as issuing  an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN) or flagging  those taxpayers\u2019 SSNs for use in its filters or other reviews of taxpayer  returns.", "IRS has previously provided guidance to taxpayers when a dependent  was a victim of identity theft.

The external stakeholders we selected are major  companies that prepare millions of tax returns and organizations in  the tax preparation industry that frequently interact with IRS on key  aspects of the filing season;  identified federal standards for evaluating customer service, such as  the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization  Act and Executive Orders, Presidential Memorandums and Office of  Management and Budget guidance to strengthen customer service,  and compared IRS actions to those standards; and  reviewed prior GAO reports, including filing season and IRS budget  reports, reviews on the premium tax credit, our evaluation of IRS\u2019s  website, an agency dashboard, and evaluated IRS\u2019s actions to  implement selected prior recommendations.", "To answer the third objective, we reviewed prior GAO reports on IDT  refund fraud and interviewed IRS officials who oversee customer service  for IDT victims, including members of the IRS reengineering task team  which is tasked with reviewing IRS processes and procedures to identify  ways to improve the identity theft taxpayer experience. We also collected  and reviewed data on IDT cases, such as the total number of IDT cases  and average number of days each case was open. Further, we conducted  a file review of 16 IDT victim case files in Atlanta, where IRS\u2019s Wage and  Investment Division is located. This division plays a key role in IDT  prevention and case management, and is one of eight locations where  IRS assistors handle IDT cases. The findings from this file review cannot  be generalized to all IDT cases. We identified these cases by using a  stratified random sample from an IRS-provided list of all IDT cases open  at any point between July 2015 and May 19, 2016. Since the focus of  this file review was to better understand the characteristics on a variety of  types of IDT cases and the steps that IRS takes to resolve them, we  designed the selection process to include cases with varied statuses.  Specifically, we drew cases from three groups: (1) open (unresolved)  cases, (2) cases closed in less than 120 days (short cases), and (3) cases closed in 120 or more days (long cases). In 2015, IRS reported that  a typical IDT case could take 120 days to resolve, so we used this length  of time as a threshold for separating short and long cases. For the open  case sample, we excluded IDT cases that were open for less than 120  days to ensure that enough casework had occurred to observe in our file  review. We sorted the remaining open cases by the IDT case type and  sampled randomly within each case type. For each case type category,  we oversampled to account for any cases that had recently closed and to  select cases with refund interest, which is an extra cost to the  government. We used a similar process for the short and long closed  case selection. We sorted closed cases by IDT case type and length and  selected at random within each category, with cases oversampled to  ensure a sufficient number were available for our review. We sent 225  IDT case numbers to IRS with instructions about the order they should  pull the files for review. During our file review, we verified these steps to  ensure that IRS officials completed our instructions accurately.", "We conducted a file review of 16 IDT cases, using a standardized data  collection instrument (DCI) developed for the review. To develop the DCI,  we conducted a pilot test and made revisions based on the pilot and  comments from IRS officials. To ensure that our efforts conformed to  GAO\u2019s data quality standards, another team member reviewed each of  the 16 DCIs that we completed. The reviewers compared the data  recorded within the DCI entry to the data in the corresponding case file to  determine whether they agreed on how the data were recorded. When  the analysts\u2019 views on how the data were recorded differed, they met to  reconcile any differences. In addition, IRS assistors who regularly work  IDT cases, and other officials, assisted us by explaining the cases and  answering our questions while we completed and confirmed information  in the DCIs. Due to the complexity and uniqueness of each case, we took  detailed notes about the cases in addition to the completed DCI. We used  the information collected to summarize the 16 case study reviews  presented in appendix V. To ensure we correctly understood the  information, we sought input and review from IRS officials and included  their comments as appropriate. Finally, we assessed whether IRS\u2019s  procedures for working IDT cases follow standards from Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. We selected the most  relevant control standards as criteria.", "Additionally, to obtain the perspectives of IRS assistors and managers  who are responsible for handling and reviewing IDT cases, we held five  discussion groups with selected employees who are employed at IRS  campuses in Atlanta and Kansas City, Missouri. We selected these  locations based upon the combination and availability of staff that  manage IDT-related work, as described below. We held three discussion  groups with assistors and two groups with managers that oversee  assistors who handle IDT cases. The findings from these discussion  groups cannot be generalized to the perspectives of all IDT assistors and  managers. All participants worked in one of the following groups: IRS\u2019s  Return Integrity Compliance Services, which reviews returns for potential  IDT prior to processing; Accounts Management, which reviews IDT cases  as part of adjusting taxpayer accounts when they have been victims of  IDT; or Field Assistance, which provides service to taxpayers who are  possible victims of IDT that visit an IRS walk-in site. To identify  participants in Atlanta, we asked an IRS official to locate participants and  arrange the discussion groups with assistors and managers who met the  criteria mentioned above and who work in the IRS facility we visited as  part of our IDT case file review. To identify participants in Kansas City,  IRS officials provided us with contact information for employees who met  the criteria mentioned above and we contacted those employees directly  to schedule and organize the discussion group. We conducted the Atlanta  discussion groups in person and the Kansas City discussion groups via  conference call. For each group, we used a standardized discussion  guide, one for the managers and a different one for assistors, in order to  improve the consistency and quality of information gathered. Each group  contained between 4 and 9 participants. To encourage participants to  speak openly, we ensured that no senior IRS management officials were  present during the discussions. At the beginning of each group, we  explained that any comments and opinions provided would be reported in  summary form, and individual assistors would not be identified. We used  a standardized set of questions when interviewing the assistors and  managers which focused on their experiences reviewing IDT cases and  suggestions, if any, for how IRS can more efficiently provide assistance to  taxpayers who are IDT victims. We did not administer one question about  releasing refunds to the first two discussion groups in Atlanta because we  identified the issue during the course of our file review and after  conducting the first two groups.", "Data on filing season processing and customer service, as well as IDT  casework, is provided by IRS in a variety of different reports. Accordingly,  we used various IRS telephone reports (the telephone product line  snapshot, enterprise snapshot, interactive performance template, busy  signals and disconnects, and tax law and phone accuracy) to analyze and  report on key elements of IRS\u2019s telephone service, such as the level of  service, wait time, and call volume. Similarly, we reviewed IRS\u2019s  processing reports to analyze and report key aspects, including the  number of returns processed and refund data. We reviewed reports on  IDT case inventory and closures. In reviewing these reports, we  examined the data to identity obvious errors or outliers and assessed  potential data limitations that would affect use of the data for assessing  IRS\u2019s performance during the filing season. We also reviewed IRS\u2019s  responses to questions we asked about the accuracy and reliability of  these data.

IRS closed this case  in August 2016 and the taxpayer owed tax of about $6,500. IRS also  assessed penalties and interest of more than $3,500. IRS took 193 days  to close the case, in part due to taxpayer errors it had to correct as well  as reassigning the case to multiple assistors. IRS attributed these delays  primarily to resource constraints.
