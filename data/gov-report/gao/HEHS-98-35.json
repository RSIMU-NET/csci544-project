Although questions still remain about how best to use such technology to improve students\u2019 education, many believe it has an important role to play. Schools are moving forward, as business and industry have, with plans for computer networks, Internet connections, and other technology. Acquiring and maintaining such technology, however, can be costly. One study has estimated that placing one networked computer laboratory in each school nationwide would cost $11 billion up front and $4 billion in annual costs.", "The Congress has taken steps to increase financial assistance to support the use of technology in schools. For example, for fiscal year 1998, lawmakers appropriated $425 million to fund the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund to support statewide strategies to integrate technology into school curricula and $106 million to fund the Technology Innovation Challenge Grant program to develop and implement innovative uses of education technology. Relatively little is known, however, about how districts fund the technology they acquire.", "You asked us to study the challenges school districts face in financing their technology programs. In response to your request, our study addresses the following four questions:", "What funding sources have school districts used to develop and fund their technology programs?", "What barriers have districts faced in funding the technology goals they set, and how did they try to overcome these barriers?", "Which components of districts\u2019 technology programs have been the most difficult to fund, and what have been the consequences?", "How do districts plan to handle the ongoing costs of the technology they have acquired?", "Our study is based on the experiences of five school districts selected to illustrate the experiences of many districts in developing education technology programs. We asked state education agency officials in every state, as well as officials in other organizations, to identify districts that had established education technology programs and made some progress in implementing them. Because we sought information on experiences that were likely to be relatively common among districts nationwide, we asked the officials to exclude districts that had benefited from extraordinary assistance, such as those receiving a major portion of their funding from a company or individual. We selected five districts that provided a cross section of districts in size, community type, geographic location, state assistance for education technology, state fiscal capacity, and state share of education funding.", "This report examines how five districts funded their technology goals and their difficulties in finding these resources. It does not evaluate the districts\u2019 technology goals or assess the effect of technology on students\u2019 academic progress. Although education technology can encompass a wide range of tools, including cable television and distance learning, our discussions with school district officials focused on computers and peripherals and their connectivity to local and wide area networks and to the Internet. We refer to these resources as computer-based technology. For a detailed description of our report\u2019s scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "The five districts chosen, shown in table 1, range from a rural district in North Carolina\u2019s furniture manufacturing region to the largest urban school districts in New Hampshire and Washington. These five districts were trying to do many things that other districts are doing\u2014increase the number of computers available for instruction, build computer laboratories and classroom computer resources, and make Internet access part of a teacher\u2019s instructional tool kit. Although the districts selected are not statistically representative, they give insight to the experiences districts encounter in finding resources to implement education technology programs.", "In conducting the case studies, we interviewed officials at the school, district, and state levels, as well as others involved in funding technology, such as parents and members of local organizations helping to bring technology into schools. Although we talked with several district officials, including superintendents, our most extensive interviews were with district-level technology directors who had primary responsibility for implementing the technology programs. Detailed information on each district, on the individual schools we studied, and on the state context appear in the district case studies in appendixes II through VI. We conducted our study between March and November 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Classroom Computer-Based Technology Is Growing", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, much discussion about education technology has focused on the use of computers, networks, and connections to the Internet to augment learning.

Modem or network connections can provide access to resources beyond the immediate reach of the classroom such as library card catalogs and Internet information.", "Networks can support collaborative and active learning by allowing many students, teachers, parents, experts, and others to share resources and communicate with each other both locally and over great distances.", "A computer-based education technology program has several components that range from the computer hardware and software to the training and support needed to use and maintain the technology (see fig. 1). Although technology models define components somewhat differently, they generally cover the same equipment and support elements.", "Although more complete data are needed, surveys conducted by Quality Education Data note a dramatic growth in computer-based technology in schools. In school year 1983-84, schools had 1 computer for every 125 students; in school year 1996-97, they had 1 for every 9. Nearly all schools now use personal computers, with the average school owning 86 computers for instructional use. Access to multimedia computers that have graphics, sound, and video capabilities important to taking advantage of learning opportunities on the Internet has also grown to about 1 such computer for every 22 students. In addition, schools are using computer networks more. The percentage of schools with local area networks grew more than twelvefold in just 5 years, from 5 percent in school year 1991-92 to 63 percent in school year 1996-97.", "Meanwhile, many education technology experts believe that current levels of school technology do not give students enough access to realize the technology\u2019s full potential. For example, schools should provide a ratio of four to five students for every computer or five students for every multimedia computer, many studies suggest. These ratios are much lower than the ratios at most schools. Concern has also been expressed that aging school computers may not be able to run newer computer programs, use multimedia technology, and access the Internet. In school year 1995-96, 35 percent of installed computers used for student instruction comprised aging Apple II computers, which cannot run most software designed today. Furthermore, although the percentage of schools with Internet access quickly increased from 35 to 65 percent between 1994 and 1996, just 14 percent of instructional rooms (classrooms, computer or other labs, and library media centers) have this access."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research on Impact of Technology Inconclusive", "paragraphs": ["Policymakers want to know whether computer-based technology contributes to improved student achievement. In fact, some studies of traditional, tutorial-based applications, such as drill-and-practice software to improve basic skills (such as reading or arithmetic), have shown measurable improvements in student learning. Studies also note improvements in writing and other subject areas as well as improvements in students\u2019 motivation and attitudes about learning resulting from classroom technology use. In addition, the benefits of computer-based instruction appear to be greater for educationally disadvantaged or low-achieving students. Although much research has focused on traditional, tutorial applications of technology, many are interested in technology\u2019s potential to support fundamental changes in approaches to teaching. Such approaches involve environments in which students assume a central role in their own learning, learn to think critically, and collaborate with others. Students working together to research a topic on the Internet is one example of such an application. Research data on these more complex uses of technology are few, however, and are not as well organized as research on more traditional applications. Without other research, analysts often cite anecdotal reports of the positive experiences of schools that extensively use technology.", "On the other hand, some analysts have questioned whether technology can significantly benefit schools. Concerns have been raised, for example, about whether schools can use technology effectively and about the extent to which schools might shift resources from other important education needs to support technology investments. In addition, some researchers have questioned the methodologies used to evaluate technology\u2019s impact on student achievement. For example, the influence of contextual factors in a number of studies has raised concern as have the persistence of the measured effects and the independence of those responsible for the research. Schools have also increasingly introduced technology as part of broader reform efforts, making it difficult to isolate the effects of technology alone.", "Our review did not address these issues; rather, our report describes how some districts found the funds to implement technology programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Computer-Based Technology Involves High Investment and Support Costs", "paragraphs": ["School districts that want to provide students with continuing and effective access to education technology may require substantial amounts of money for acquiring computers and maintaining their investment. Quality Education Data has reported that public schools spent an estimated $4.3 billion on technology in school year 1996-97 and are projected to spend $5.2 billion this school year. A 1996 study by the RAND Corporation estimated the cost of providing technology-rich learning environments in all schools as between $10 and $20 billion per year, depending on the level of technology. This amounts to about 3.2 to 8 percent of current expenditures for public elementary and secondary education for the 1994-95 school year. In contrast, school district expenditures on technology in 1994-95 were estimated to be 1.3 percent of current education expenditures. The researchers note that financing such costs would be difficult for some districts because of current fiscal pressures and may require them to significantly restructure their budgets, a difficult task."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal, State, and Private Initiatives for School Technology", "paragraphs": ["Several federal, state, and private initiatives are helping school districts acquire and use technology. At the federal level, substantial funding increases have been provided recently for several programs supporting education technology, including the Technology Innovation Challenge Grant program, which was appropriated $106 million for fiscal year 1998.The Congress also appropriated $425 million to fund the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund in fiscal year 1998 in support of state efforts to integrate technology into school curricula. Another major source of financial assistance was provided for in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Under this act, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted an order stating that schools should receive discounts ranging from 20 to 90 percent on all telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections, depending on the school\u2019s level of economic disadvantage and its location in an urban or rural area and subject to an annual cap of $2.25 billion. The funds to support these discounts will come from collections from interstate telecommunications and other service providers.", "A number of federal agencies provide funding for education technology, including the Departments of Education, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and Energy; the National Science Foundation; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Through these agencies, funding has been provided for technology and supported such activities as educational television programming, distance learning, assistive technologies for disabled learners, and more recently, assistance for telecommunications networks and technology planning. Other federal funding, though not specifically provided for technology, may be used for this purpose. For example, funds from ESEA programs\u2014such as title I, which provides grants for educationally disadvantaged students, and the Eisenhower Professional Development program, which supports activities to strengthen teachers\u2019 skills\u2014may be used to support education technology efforts to reach these programs\u2019 goals. Similarly, under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, districts may use the education reform funds to acquire technology and implement technology-enhanced instruction. The federal government provides several hundred million dollars annually to support education technology, according to estimates. Much of this funding is provided through federal programs for which technology is not the direct focus.", "In addition, states have provided various levels of funding and other types of assistance for education technology. Many states have provided some funding to support technology in schools: New Jersey, for example, provided a total of $10 million in grants to every school district in the state in fiscal year 1997; and Georgia provided over $50 million in lottery funds to school districts for technology in fiscal year 1997. Other assistance provided by states includes negotiating statewide hardware and software purchase agreements, establishing technology training or support centers, providing school access to statewide networks, and easing regulations to allow schools to use state textbook funds to purchase software. In addition, some states have encouraged their public utility commissions to provide schools with telecommunication services at reasonable rates.", "Other public and private entities have also helped schools implement education technology. Businesses, foundations, universities, and other organizations have provided financial assistance or contributed expertise, shared resources, or donated equipment to support schools\u2019 education technology needs. A recent example is NetDay, a national volunteer effort to install basic wiring in schools to give them Internet access. Businesses and individuals nationwide have contributed funds, technical expertise, or materials and joined with thousands of community volunteers to sponsor NetDay activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Districts Used Many Sources to Fund Technology", "paragraphs": ["Each district we studied used a combination of funding sources to support technology in its schools (see table 2). At the local level, districts allocated funds from their district operating budgets, levied special taxes, or both. They also obtained funds from federal and state programs specifically designated to support school technology or from federal and state programs that could be used for this purpose, among others. Finally, districts obtained private grants and solicited contributions from businesses. Although some individual schools raised funds in the districts we studied, obtaining technology funding was more a district-level function than a school-level function, according to our review.", "Although districts tapped many sources, nearly all districts obtained the majority of their funding from one source. This source, however, varied by district. For example, in Seattle a 1991 local capital levy has provided the majority of its education technology funding to date. In Gahanna, the district operating budget has provided the majority of technology funding.", "Regarding local funding, all five districts allocated funds from their operating budgets for technology, with such allocations ranging widely from 16 to 77 percent of their technology funding. Two districts also used funds raised through local bonds or special levies. One of them, Roswell, dedicated part of a triennial 2-mill levy to technology.", "Four districts received state funding specifically targeted for technology that totaled from less than 1 percent to 22 percent of their total technology funding. State technology funds were provided either on a per pupil basis or through competitive grants. Both Davidson County and Gahanna received state funding on a per pupil basis that funded significant portions of their hardware. Roswell also received state funding on a per pupil basis\u2014but in smaller amounts\u2014which it used to fund teacher training. Seattle competed for and won a state technology grant, which it used to purchase hardware and software for a middle school.", "Two districts won special federal technology grants. Manchester and Seattle won highly competitive 5-year federal Challenge Grants for $2.8 million and $7 million, respectively. Manchester won the grant in 1995 during the first round of Challenge Grant competition. This grant is the major source of funding for the district\u2019s technology program, providing 66 percent of the district\u2019s technology funding. A major objective of the grant is to create a network connecting computers in all schools to the Internet. Seattle won its grant in 1996 and uses it in several efforts, including activities that prepare students for employment in technology careers. The $1.5 million in grant funding Seattle has received so far accounts for about 4 percent of the district\u2019s current technology funding.", "In addition to state and federal funds targeted for technology, all five districts reported using other federal and state program funding that was not specifically designated for technology but could be used for this purpose. For example, officials in four districts reported using federal title I funds, and officials in three reported using state instructional materials funds or textbook funds to support part of their program. In Manchester, a schoolwide program at a title I elementary school we visited had funded many of its 27 computers as part of its title I program. State program funds, such as for exceptional and at-risk children as well as vocational education, were a significant funding source in Davidson County, where the district has directed about $2 million of these state funds to technology.", "All districts we studied had obtained about 3 percent or less of their technology funding from private sources. This assistance comprised grants; monetary and in-kind donations; and assistance from businesses, foundations, and individuals. Officials attributed limited business contributions to several factors, including businesses not fully understanding the extent of the schools\u2019 needs. One official said that when business representatives visit schools and compare schools\u2019 technology with technology in their workplaces, they can better understand schools\u2019 needs. Several officials also said businesses feel overburdened by many requests from the community for assistance, and some said their district had few businesses from which to seek help. Nonetheless, all five districts noted the importance of business\u2019 contribution and were trying to improve their ties with business.", "As part of our review, we also examined the efforts of individual schools to raise money for technology. In all five districts, obtaining technology funding was mainly a district- rather than a school-level function. School-level technology coordinators in all but one school worked part time or had other responsibilities in addition to technology. Their main duties involved providing technical support and training and purchasing equipment, rather than obtaining funding for technology. The majority of funding that most schools used for technology came from the school district. Sometimes these funds were provided expressly for technology, such as those from local technology levies. In other cases, schools had some choice in spending funds and chose to use them to support technology needs.", "About half of the schools we studied also supplemented their district funding with funds for technology from parent-teacher organization activities and other school fund-raisers. Amounts totaled generally less than $7,000 in any given year but did range as high as $84,000 over 4 years at one school. A few schools reported obtaining special grants for technology from local businesses, foundations, or sometimes from their districts. Individual teachers or other staff wrote the grants, which generally were for small amounts, in most cases under $7,000. Staff at two schools also reported that teachers and other staff used their personal funds to support classroom technology activities. One district official estimated that teachers at a school in her district spent an average of $100 or more on software, hardware, and supplies; the official had also spent about $700 of her own money. One of the teachers at that school told us she spent $1,200 on technology items for her classroom in a single year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Informational Efforts and Partnerships Have Addressed a Variety of Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Technology directors in the districts we studied identified a variety of barriers to obtaining funding both at the district level and from other sources such as grants. Upon analyzing their responses to open-ended survey questions, we identified several types of barriers common to a number of districts (see table 3). The case studies in appendixes II through VI discuss these barriers further. District officials usually tried to overcome these barriers and obtain support for technology using broad informational efforts and various leadership approaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competing Needs", "paragraphs": ["Officials in all of the districts we visited reported that district-level funding for technology was difficult to obtain because it was just one of many important needs that competed for limited district resources. For example, a Gahanna official reported that his district\u2019s student population had grown, and the district needed to hire more teachers. A Seattle official reported that his district had $275 million worth of deferred maintenance needs. In several cases, districts had to comply with certain mandates before making money available for needs such as technology. Manchester officials noted, for example, that required special education spending constituted 26 percent of the fiscal year 1997 district operating budget, a figure expected to rise to 27.5 percent in fiscal year 1998. As a result, officials believe that less funding may be available for other programs, including technology. In addition, one district official stated that one reason education measures were difficult to pass was that these measures competed for limited public funding with other programs such as transit systems, parks, and sports stadiums. Manchester district officials reported that the district competed even more directly with other city needs for tax revenues because the school district is a department of the city government and lacks independent fiscal authority to sponsor tax initiatives such as levies or bonds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Tax Resistance", "paragraphs": ["General communitywide anti-tax sentiment contributed to difficulties in obtaining district-level funding for technology, according to district officials. Officials from all districts said that resistance to higher taxes affected their ability to increase the district\u2019s operating revenue to help meet their technology goals. In Manchester, a district official reported that local property taxes already provide a large portion of the school district budget, and any tax increases face strong community resistance. Davidson County has one of the lowest local property tax rates in the state, and, according to officials, many county residents were attracted to the area because of the tax rates.", "In addition, two districts\u2014Roswell and Seattle\u2014lacked the ability to increase the local portion of their operating budgets. This is because\u2014to improve equity\u2014the state school finance systems limited the amount of funds districts could raise locally. Districts reported that anti-tax sentiment also affected their ability to pass special levies and bond measures. For example, Seattle voters supported a special levy to initiate the district\u2019s technology plan but rejected a second levy to fund the next phase of the plan 5 years later. Davidson County voters had passed a bond measure several years ago that provided a small amount of funds for technology, but officials said it was too soon for the fiscally conservative community to consider another bond measure for technology. In Gahanna, several levy measures were defeated in the mid-1990s, reflecting, according to officials, the community\u2019s dissatisfaction with the district\u2019s leadership at that time. Although all district officials identified a resistance to taxes in their communities, most said they believed the community generally supported education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Fund-Raising Staff", "paragraphs": ["The lack of fund-raising staff presented difficulties to districts in raising funds beyond the school district. Many officials reported that their other job responsibilities precluded their searching for technology funding. When discussing this issue, district officials often mentioned that they need lots of time to develop funding proposals or apply for grants. For example, one technology director with previous grant-writing experience said she would need an uninterrupted month to submit a good application for a Department of Commerce telecommunications infrastructure grant. As a result, she did not apply for this grant. Manchester\u2019s technology director said that when the district applied for a federal Challenge Grant, it created a team to work on the proposal. Two members of the team, the technology director, and another official had to drop everything else to complete the application within a 4-week time frame.", "Similarly, officials said they needed considerable time and effort to create the consortium of businesses, universities, and other organizations required for receiving some grants. For example, an official in Roswell said that such requirements made it difficult for geographically isolated districts like his to apply for these grants. According to some technology directors, the combination of scarce staff time and extensive grant application requirements sometimes kept them from applying for grant funding.", "In addition, although the funding potential of new sources is unclear, officials in most districts said they would like to have a staff member dedicated to pursuing new sources of technology program funding. Seattle and Manchester officials both said they had contracted with part-time grant writers. Seattle also had a general grants officer on the district\u2019s staff to identify and manage grants, but he had limited time to write grant proposals. Gahanna officials said they planned to hire a district grants officer in the next year or two."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Source Conditions or Requirements Are Restrictive", "paragraphs": ["In three districts we studied, technology officials said that some funding sources had conditions or requirements that made it difficult for the districts to obtain technology funding from these sources. In two of these districts, officials said that their districts did not meet the income requirements of some sources. For example, one official characterized her district as not being \u201cneedy\u201d enough to qualify for some funding, stating further that corporations and foundations typically like to give funds to very needy schools where they can make a dramatic difference. Although her district\u2019s student population had many students from lower income families, she said that the district was not disadvantaged overall compared with other school systems. Similarly, an official from another district said that his district\u2019s average income was too high to meet the requirements for some sources.", "Conditions associated with other types of funding, such as levy funds, concerned an official in the third district. The official believed that restrictions on raising levy funds\u2014such as minimum voter turn-out requirements, a 60-percent majority approval requirement, and a restriction prohibiting the district\u2019s involvement in a levy campaign\u2014make it harder for the district to obtain funds from this source. This particularly concerned this official because levy funding has been the main funding source for technology in this district."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Informational and Leadership Efforts Directed at Overcoming Funding Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Districts employed general strategies to overcome these funding barriers rather than focus on specific barriers. The strategies involved two main approaches: efforts to inform decisionmakers about the importance of and need for technology and a variety of leadership efforts to secure support for technology initiatives.", "To inform decisionmakers, district officials addressed school board members, city council representatives, service group members, parents, community taxpayers, and state officials. Officials gave presentations and technology demonstrations, held parent information nights, made contacts with foundation representatives, and conducted lobbying efforts with state officials and grassroots efforts to encourage voter participation in levy or bond elections. Roswell, for example, set up a model technology school to demonstrate the use of technology in classrooms. One effort by Seattle officials involved soliciting support from the state legislature for changes in education funding laws that could affect the district\u2019s spending on technology and other needs.", "In the districts we studied, district officials and business community members provided leadership to support school technology. In some districts, the superintendent garnered support for the technology program. For example, according to officials we interviewed, the superintendent in Davidson County had a long-standing commitment to technology and enough understanding of the political landscape to gain support for school technology implementation. Officials from two other districts noted that technology leadership in their districts had been lacking in recent years due in part to turnover in superintendents and other district personnel, and they looked to their current superintendents to provide it.", "Another leadership role held by some school district officials we visited stemmed from their technology expertise, including a vision for its educational use and an ability to articulate and implement this vision. Although the district\u2019s technology director most often filled this role, occasionally school officials assumed this role. In Roswell, for example, one official referred to the district\u2019s former technology director as the person who directed the effort to seek technology funding and to consider ways to spend that funding. This person was also characterized as having foresight and viewed as responsible for technology becoming such a big part of the district\u2019s bond and levy measures. Likewise, technology directors in Davidson County, Gahanna, Seattle, and Manchester each played a central role in envisioning and implementing their respective district technology programs over multiyear periods and continued to be consulted for expertise and guidance.", "Beyond the school districts, members of the business community assumed leadership roles to support technology by entering into partnerships with the districts to help with technology development efforts as well as to help obtain funding. All five districts we studied had developed such partnerships with businesses in their communities.", "In Roswell and Seattle, business community leaders had developed a formal approach to helping their school districts\u2019 efforts to implement technology by establishing a foundation that worked with each district, providing leadership and funding for technology. Seattle\u2019s foundation, the Alliance for Education, views its role as helping the district reach its goals in several different areas, including technology. In this partnership, the Alliance serves as a convener and catalyst to join representatives from the business community with the school district and match entities interested in providing funding or other assistance with programs that need funding or other assistance. As part of its technology assistance, the Alliance also helps channel equipment to schools, provides training opportunities for teachers, and coordinates an effort to allow schools to have high-speed Internet access. In Roswell, the Educational Achievement Foundation has been involved in district policy-making as well as funding. In school year 1993-94, its members helped develop the school district\u2019s initial technology plan using lessons learned by members who had developed technology programs for their businesses. The foundation also developed the concept for using technology in the district\u2019s model technology elementary school and provided part of the funding for this school. Foundation members and district officials we spoke with said this model program was instrumental in convincing voters to pass a bond measure to implement technology in schools districtwide.", "In other locations we visited, the business community and districts were developing ties but through less formal structures. For example, the Manchester school district developed relationships with 40 business and community groups when it needed to meet a community consortium requirement for its Challenge Grant proposal. A district official stated that these relationships continue to grow and that education has become a main focus of the Chamber of Commerce. In Gahanna, the school district\u2019s relationships with local businesses included ties to a local Business Advisory Council. Although providing funding is not this group\u2019s main focus, it does provide the district with curriculum recommendations about skills needed in the workplace. In Davidson County, although officials said that few businesses reside in the rural area from which to solicit support, the district had established ties with some local businesses. One activity this district noted as evidence of local business support for technology was a successful effort to get community businesses to fund notebook computers for middle school teachers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Staff-Related and Other Components Difficult to Fund", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all districts found maintenance, technical support, and training\u2014 components often dependent on staff\u2014more difficult to fund than other components, according to our review. Officials cited several restrictions or limitations associated with funding sources that affected their use for staff costs. First, some funding simply could not be used to pay for staff. Officials in Roswell and Seattle noted that special levy and bond monies, their main sources of technology funds, may not be used to support staff because the funds are restricted to capital expenditures. North Carolina\u2019s state technology program also prohibited funds from being used for staff costs. Second, some funding sources do not suit the ongoing nature of staff costs. Officials noted, for example, that grants and other sources provided for a limited time or that fluctuate from year to year are not suited to supporting staff. Furthermore, in two districts, officials said that businesses and foundations tend not to support ongoing program costs, including technical support and maintenance costs. Officials in one district also said that technical support and training were harder to fund because they were less visible than such items as hardware and software. Most districts funded technology staff primarily from district operating budgets.", "However, several officials noted that competing needs and the limited size of district budgets make it difficult to increase technology staff positions.", "Officials in all five districts reported having fewer staff than needed. Some technology directors and trainers reported performing maintenance or technical support at the expense of their other duties due to a lack of sufficient support staff. Some district officials also noted high stress levels among district technology trainers or maintenance staff trying to serve many school sites. One result of a lack of staff was lengthy equipment downtime when computers and other equipment were not available for use. In several districts, repairs for some equipment reportedly took as long as 2 weeks or more. Equipment downtime means reduced access for teachers and students, and several officials observed that this may frustrate teachers and discourage them from using the equipment.", "Limited funding for staff costs also affected teacher training, according to officials. In Gahanna, the district technology director said the district lacks enough educational technologists to assign one to each school, and, as a result, all teachers have not received in-depth training. He noted that training made a noticeable difference in teachers\u2019 effectiveness in using technology and that in cases where teachers had worked one on one with educational technologists, students were gaining new skills in acquiring, assimilating, and manipulating data. Manchester\u2019s technology director said that the most difficult costs for the district to fund are teacher release time and substitute pay to enable teachers to get training. Most district officials expressed a desire for more technology training capability, noting that teacher training promoted the most effective use of the equipment. Another official concluded that the district risked wasting the dollars it had invested in technology if it could not keep the equipment running or if teachers were not using the technology for lack of training or technical support.", "Many districts had developed some approaches to mitigating the shortfalls in technology support staff. For example, Seattle reported purchasing extended warranties on new equipment as a cost-effective way to support maintenance needs. Having manufacturers or vendors rather than district staff perform maintenance on newer machines allowed the district to concentrate its limited maintenance resources on the older equipment. Several district high schools were also training students to provide technical support in their schools. In addition, several schools we visited designated one or more teachers to help with training or provide technical support to other teachers in the building along with their full-time responsibilities. Two districts also had cooperative agreements with nearby colleges to assist with teacher training.", "In addition to staff-related components, several districts reported problems obtaining funds for hardware and telecommunication service charges. Technology\u2019s high cost and continual changes requiring higher powered machines made funding hardware difficult, according to district officials. Finding funds for equipment upgrades was also difficult, said one official, because these needs are less visible to potential funders. Despite significant hardware investments, several districts reported having less teacher and student access to equipment than desired. Difficulties in funding telecommunication services were raised by officials in three districts for different reasons. One district official said such costs posed problems because of their large expense; an official in another district said funding these services was difficult because the need for funding is ongoing; and an official in a third district cited problems due to the need for funding from limited district operating funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Districts Plan to Use Same Funding Sources for Ongoing Costs Despite Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["Most of the districts we studied planned to continue supporting the costs of their technology programs largely as they had in the past, despite the uncertainties associated with many funding sources. The ongoing costs faced by districts are basically of two types. First, districts need to fund regular annual costs, such as those for maintenance, technical support, training, and telecommunications services. Second, districts and schools need to fund the periodic costs of upgrading and replacing hardware, software, and infrastructure to sustain their programs.", "Most districts planned to continue funding ongoing maintenance, technical support, training, and telecommunications costs mainly from their operating budgets. Most hoped to sustain at least current levels of support; just one district, Seattle, anticipated losing some support staff due to districtwide budget cuts. District officials in most locations believed, however, that current levels of maintenance and technical support were not adequate and recognized that demands for staff would most likely grow with the addition of new equipment, expanded networks, and aging of older equipment. Some officials talked about hiring staff in small increments but did not know to what extent future district budgets would support such hiring. Officials in two districts looked to assistance promised under the Telecommunications Act to help with telecommunications costs, but at the time of our visit the timing and actual level of assistance they would receive had not been determined.", "The periodic cost of upgrading and replacing hardware, software, or infrastructure can be substantial and although each district had made significant progress in these areas, most faced some uncertainty in continuing to fund at least some of these costs from current sources. For example, officials in several districts noted that state technology funding was an inconsistent source of funding, subject to changing priorities of state legislatures. Davidson County and Gahanna had the most notable examples of this. Davidson County has relied heavily on state technology funds to buy hardware and establish its infrastructure, but the state reduced the program funding in the second year, and the district received only about $300,000 rather than the $900,000 it had expected. Similarly, Gahanna received only about half the amount it expected from state technology funding when the funding formula was changed to target funds to poorer districts.", "In Seattle, special levies are the district\u2019s main funding source for equipping schools with computers and expanding networking in schools, according to the technology director, despite the unpredictability of this source. A failed levy in 1996 set technology plans back several years and forced the district and schools to piece together much smaller amounts from grants and other sources. Manchester, which completed the second year of a 5-year Challenge Grant in December 1997, will have to figure out where to get funding to sustain its program after the Challenge Grant is completed given the district\u2019s operating budget limitations and a lack of state technology funds. Officials in Roswell also reported uncertainties about future funding, but the district has established a pattern of passing levies every 3 years and using some of these funds for school technology. All of the districts we visited were still working toward acquiring enough computers to reach their goals, and most had not developed plans to address the eventual need to replace current hardware. Some officials said they believed that the general public probably does not know that this will be necessary.", "Officials in all districts underscored the need for stable funding sources and for technology to be considered a basic education expenditure rather than an added expense. They suggested different ways to accomplish this. For example, officials in most districts believe the district operating budget should have a technology line item. They believe this would demonstrate district commitment to technology as well as provide a more certain funding source. An official in one district that had such a line item pointed out, however, that even this approach would not ensure funding because budget items can be decreased in times of general budget reduction or changing district priorities. Another official saw the need for state assistance to ensure stable funding for school technology. He said that technology is increasingly being considered part of basic education and as such should be included in state formula funding. Without such funding, he said districts would be divided into those that could \u201csell\u201d technology funding to voters and those that could not. Furthermore, when districts cannot provide adequate technology funding for all schools, technology tends to grow in pockets; schools with a strong, supportive parent base or a principal with good public relations or grant-writing skills are likely to get more funding than schools without these resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Education technology represents a substantial investment for school districts intent on following the lead of business and industry in making computers an integral part of everyday activities. Finding money to pay for the technology could be difficult, however, because it is but one of many education expenses\u2014such as reducing class size or renovating aging buildings\u2014that compete for limited funding. Furthermore, because technology programs involve ongoing maintenance, training, and other expenses, one-time funding is unlikely to be sufficient. As a result, technology supporters in the districts we studied not only had to garner support at the start for the district\u2019s technology needs, they also had to continue making their case year after year.", "To develop support for technology, leaders in these school districts used a broad informational approach to educate the community, and they also formed local partnerships with business. Although each district has developed some ties with business, funding from private sources for each district, including business, constituted about 3 percent or less of what each district has spent on its technology program. Other districts may, like these, need to continue depending mainly on special local bonds and levies, state assistance, and federal grants for initially purchasing and replacing equipment and on their operating budgets for other technology needs.", "Lack of staff time for seeking and applying for funding and the difficulty of funding technology support staff were major concerns of officials in all the districts we studied. Too few staff to maintain equipment and support technology users in the schools could lead to extensive computer downtime, teacher frustration, and, ultimately, to reduced use of a significant technology investment.", "The technology program in each of the five districts we studied had not yet obtained a clearly defined and relatively stable funding source such as a line item in the operating budget or a part of the state\u2019s education funding formula.

To identify possible case study sites, we asked state officials responsible for education technology in each state as well as officials in other education organizations for examples of school districts that had established education technology programs and made some progress implementing them. Because we sought information on experiences that were likely to be relatively common among districts nationwide, we asked the officials to exclude districts that had benefited from extraordinary assistance, such as those that had received a major portion of their funding from a company or individual. We selected five districts from those suggested that provided variety in size, community type, geographic location, state assistance for education technology, state fiscal capacity, and state share of education funding. For example, district size ranged from about 7,000 students in the suburban Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools to about 47,000 students in Seattle Public Schools, a large urban school district. The state share of education funding in school year 1993-94 ranged from just over 8 percent in New Hampshire to about 74 percent in New Mexico.", "We also reviewed each district\u2019s school-level experiences in funding technology. We asked district technology directors to name one school that was relatively advanced in its implementation of technology and one school whose experiences reflected a more typical school in the district. We visited a total of 11 schools\u20149 elementary and 2 high schools. Although the districts and schools we selected are not statistically representative, the diversity of those selected increases the likelihood that findings common to all five districts are relevant to other districts and schools implementing education technology.", "We visited each location and interviewed district, school, state, and other officials. At the district level, we spoke with district technology directors and in several locations also interviewed the district superintendent, budget or finance officials, and staff that provide technical assistance or training. In Roswell and Seattle, we also spoke with officials from the education foundations supporting those districts, and in Gahanna, with one city council member and one school board member. At each school, we interviewed the school principal and the technology coordinator or media coordinator responsible for technology if such a position existed. We also spoke with teachers who are technology focal points for their buildings, teachers that use technology extensively, and members of parent-teacher organizations who are involved in funding technology. At the state level, we interviewed officials responsible for education technology at state education agencies to obtain the state context for the districts\u2019 experiences.", "Although education technology includes a wide range of tools, including instructional television and distance learning, our discussions with district and school officials focused on computers and peripherals and their connectivity to local and wide area networks and to the Internet. We refer to these resources as computer-based technology. We used open-ended interview questions and focused on how the districts funded the technology they acquired and what barriers they faced in obtaining these resources. Major questions covered in district and school interviews included but were not restricted to (1) the history of the technology program, (2) efforts to obtain technology funding, (3) barriers to obtaining technology funding and strategies used to overcome them, (4) barriers to funding technology components, and (5) funding ongoing costs of the technology program.
