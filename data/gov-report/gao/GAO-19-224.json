To address these objectives, GAO analyzed UN and U.S. documents and interviewed UN and U.S. officials.

State officials noted that they do not have this information because UN peacekeeping budgets do not estimate costs by mandated task. UN peacekeeping guidance states that when the UN changes a peacekeeping mandate, it should make commensurate changes to that operation's resources. Without information on estimated costs by task, member states have difficulty determining that resources for UN peacekeeping operations accurately reflect mandate changes.", "The UN has taken steps to improve peacekeeping performance data, but member states have raised concerns about that information's quality, including its completeness and timeliness. Among other concerns, member states note that the UN does not have complete information to assess the performance of civilians, who comprised about 14 percent of peacekeeping personnel, as of December 2018. In March 2018 the UN began peacekeeping reforms, including those to improve performance data. However, according to State officials, these efforts are in the early stages and more work is needed.

Next, to determine the tasks peacekeeping operations  perform, we analyzed the UN Security Council resolutions authorizing  each peacekeeping operation\u2014generally referred to as a mandate\u2014as of  December 2018. We described the types of mandated tasks performed  by peacekeeping operations using categories and definitions published in  UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations-Department of Field  Support\u2019s training documents.

We analyzed these  documents to determine State\u2019s assessment of whether the  peacekeeping operations met the principles of effectiveness and  categorized State\u2019s results as: met, partially met, or did not meet. In  December 2018, we updated our categorization of State\u2019s assessments  based on our discussions with State/IO and officials at the U.S. Mission to  the UN (USUN). We discussed our methodology and results with officials  at State, who confirmed that our methodology and results were valid. We  also discussed with these officials additional steps the United States  could take to ensure that peacekeeping operations meet the principles for  effective peacekeeping.

She  remarked that, while peacekeeping is the UN\u2019s most powerful tool to  promote international peace and security, there is room for improvement,  citing examples of operations that no longer need to exist or have limited  host country consent. To make peacekeeping operations more effective,  she emphasized that the UN should identify operations that lack the  underlying political conditions for a resolution to the conflict, noting that  numerous studies have concluded that such conditions are central to an  operation\u2019s success. To guide this process, she announced a set of five  principles to which peacekeeping operations should be held:  1.  Peacekeeping operations must support political solutions to conflict.  2.  Operations must have host country consent.  3.  Mandates must be realistic and achievable.  4.  There should be an exit strategy, which would articulate the Security  Council\u2019s agreement on what success looks like and how to achieve  it.  5.  The Security Council should be willing to adjust peacekeeping  mandates when situations improve or fail to improve.", "Since the Permanent Representative\u2019s announcement of these principles,  State/IO has included an assessment of each peacekeeping operation  against these principles in the U.S. strategy and priorities memoranda  that it prepares for the National Security Council. With regard to the fifth  principle, in these memoranda, State/IO assesses whether and how a  mandate itself should be changed, rather than assessing the Security  Council\u2019s willingness to change the mandate. Officials indicated that they  conduct their assessment in this manner in order to inform and establish  the U.S. negotiating position."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The UN Security Council Establishes and Renews Peacekeeping Operations, Which Conduct a Range of Tasks Working with UN Member States, the UN Security Council Establishes and Renews Peacekeeping Operations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "UN Peacekeeping Operations Are Mandated to Perform Tasks Such As Maintaining Ceasefires, Protecting Civilians, and Providing Electoral Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Security Council resolutions establishing UN peacekeeping operations  define mandates, or tasks, for each operation, and the peacekeeping  operations perform a variety of activities to fulfill these tasks. In some  cases, these activities are specifically mandated by a Security Council  resolution; in others, the peacekeeping operation engages in an activity  pursuant to a broad grant of authority to achieve a task. Each UN  peacekeeping operation performs a unique set of tasks. The mandates of  peacekeeping operations established prior to 1998 tend to include the  monitoring of cease-fire as a mandated task, while those established after  1998 also include tasks such as the protection of civilians, facilitation of  humanitarian assistance, and enforcement of economic sanctions or an  arms embargo. Comparatively, operations in the African region have  mandates that include the highest number of tasks. See appendix II for a  list of the mandated tasks of all 14 peacekeeping operations.", "The UN has defined 16 categories into which these activities can be  classified, including supervision or monitoring of ceasefire agreements,  the protection and promotion of human rights, and protecting civilians.

For the 11 peacekeeping operations with mandates that renew on a  regular basis, State prepares strategy and priority memoranda for  appropriate committees of the National Security Council to inform the  mandate renewal process. We reviewed these memoranda and spoke  with State officials about their assessments of these operations against  four of the U.S. principles. Table 4 presents GAO\u2019s categorization of the  results of State\u2019s assessments.", "Supporting political solutions to conflict. Based on State\u2019s  assessment, we categorized 10 of the 11 peacekeeping operations as  having met (five) or partially met (five) the principle of supporting  political solutions to the conflict. For example, in Cyprus, State  assessed that the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus  (UNFICYP) met this principle because its activities generally support a  political solution, despite the country\u2019s slow progress toward  negotiating a final settlement of conflict between the Greek Cypriot  and Turkish Cypriot communities. We categorized one peacekeeping  operation, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western  Sahara, as not meeting this principle.", "Host country consent. Based on State\u2019s assessment, we  categorized all 11 peacekeeping operations as having met (four) or  partially met (seven) the principle of host country consent. For  example, State officials assessed that the government of the Central  African Republic cooperates fully with the UN Multidimensional  Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic  (MINUSCA). With respect to other peacekeeping operations, officials  noted that a country\u2019s consent to host an operation differs from  cooperation with all aspects of a peacekeeping operation. For  example, State reported that while the government of the Democratic  Republic of the Congo has consented to the UN Organization  Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s  (MONUSCO) presence in the country, the government has, at times,  been hostile toward and actively taken steps to undermine the  mission.", "Realistic and achievable mandates. Based on State\u2019s assessment,  we categorized seven of the 11 peacekeeping operations as having  met (two) or partially met (five) the principle of having realistic and  achievable mandates. For example, we categorized the African  Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) as having  partially met this principle because State reports that it has been able  to carry out many of its mandated tasks; however, according to  State\u2019s assessments, government obstructions, a slow peace  process, and mission management inefficiencies prevent the full  implementation of UNAMID\u2019s mandate. We categorized the remaining  four peacekeeping operations as not meeting this principle.", "Exit strategies. Based on State\u2019s assessment, we categorized five of  the 11 peacekeeping operations as having met (two) or partially met  (three) the principle of having an exit strategy in their mandates. For  example, we categorized MINUSCA as having partially met the  principle because, according to State\u2019s assessment, the operation\u2019s  mandate has an exit strategy that will take several years to achieve  given the lack of host government capacity. We categorized the  remaining six peacekeeping operations as not meeting this principle.  For example, based on State\u2019s assessment, we categorized the UN  Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) as not meeting this  principle because the operation had not considered a near-term exit  strategy because of ongoing conflict and the political stalemate in  South Sudan.", "In addition to the four principles in the table, the fifth principle for effective  peacekeeping reads as the Security Council\u2019s willingness to change the  mandate. In its memoranda, State assessed the fifth principle by  examining whether the mandate was achieving its objective and, if not,  should be adjusted. Using this method, State assessments show that the  Security Council should adjust the mandates of nine of the 11  peacekeeping operations. For example, State assessed that the  UNFICYP (Cyprus) mandate should be adapted to address the stalled  political process.", "Although we found that State\u2019s assessments show most peacekeeping  operations are not fully meeting the U.S.-stated principles for effective  peacekeeping, State officials we interviewed noted the important role UN  peacekeeping operations play in maintaining stability in volatile conflicts  around the world. These officials noted the dangerous and hostile  environments in which peacekeeping operations are located, and, in  some cases, human atrocities these operations help prevent. Further,  U.S. and UN officials cited UN peacekeeping operations\u2019 strengths,  including international and local acceptance, access to global expertise,  and the ability to leverage assistance from multilateral donors and  development banks. Officials also cited strengths of individual operations,  such as the protection of civilians against atrocities in South Sudan, the  Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic,  assistance toward the peaceful conduct of elections in numerous  countries, police capacity building in Haiti, and support to peace  processes and agreements in numerous countries.", "According to State/IO and USUN officials, continual evaluation and  adjustment of the mandates of UN peacekeeping missions to better align  with the U.S. principles remains a key tenet of the Administration\u2019s UN  peacekeeping policy, but the U.S. government faces two key challenges  in this regard. First, some aspects of two of the five principles\u2014host  country consent and support for a political process\u2014may be outside of  the control of any international organization or bilateral partner. For  example, MONUSCO\u2019s (Democratic Republic of the Congo) mandate  includes the provision of elections assistance in support of the nation\u2019s  political process, but, according to State officials, the lack of host  government cooperation has relegated MONUSCO\u2019s efforts in this area to  technical assistance. Second, these officials explained that the Security  Council does not always adopt U.S. proposals to change mandates to  align with these principles, such as including an exit strategy. Changing  peacekeeping mandates requires nine affirmative votes and no vetoes  from permanent Council members, which, according to State and USUN  officials, can be difficult. For example, USUN officials stated that the UN  Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) had fulfilled its  mandate, but Russia and China were not supporting a vote to close the  operation.", "Moreover, State officials noted that the assessment process using the  principles began in 2017 and the United States has had a limited number  of opportunities to negotiate changes to peacekeeping mandates  because renewals generally occur annually. State officials cited several  examples of notable progress, however, in improving the efficiency and  focus of UN peacekeeping operations. According to State officials,  through U.S. leadership, the Security Council reconfigured the operation  in Haiti to focus on police and the rule of law. Additionally, the Security  Council changed and downsized the operation in Darfur to reflect current  political and security realities. State officials also said that the UN Security  Council supported responsible drawdowns of peacekeeping operations,  most recently in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, while pushing peacekeepers in Lebanon to  use all of their mandated authorities to be more effective in carrying out  their tasks.", "According to State officials, adherence to these principles is not sufficient  to guarantee success. An operation could fully meet all the principles, but  still face challenges carrying out its mandate because of formidable  circumstances, such as insecure security environments or limited  government cooperation. However, State officials also noted that these  principles describe critical conditions for effective peacekeeping in that an  operation that does not meet these principles is unlikely to be able to fully  carry out its mandate. Moreover, given the importance of establishing the  necessary conditions for peacekeeping success, State/IO and USUN  officials acknowledged that State must continue to work with the Security  Council to ensure that peacekeeping operations meet the principles of  effectiveness, such as modifying mandates to include exit strategies. In  doing so, the UN and its member states could have greater assurance  that they have set up peacekeeping operations for success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The United States Has Worked with the UN to Adjust Peacekeeping Mandates, but Does Not Have Sufficient Information to Determine if UN Resource Decisions Accurately Reflect These Adjustments The United States Has Worked with Security Council Members to Adjust Peacekeeping Mandates", "paragraphs": ["When the U.S. agencies involved in peacekeeping agree that the UN  should change a peacekeeping operation\u2019s mandate, USUN officials told  us that the USUN works with other Security Council members to make  adjustments, such as adding or removing tasks from an operation\u2019s  mandate. While not all proposals are adopted by the Security Council,  State officials highlighted several types of mandate adjustments the  United States has pursued, including:", "Removal of tasks. State and USUN officials told us they strive to  remove tasks from peacekeeping mandates when those tasks have  been achieved or are no longer relevant or achievable. For example,  officials noted that the USUN successfully advocated that election  monitoring be removed from the list of mandated tasks for MINUSCA  because the elections had taken place in the previous year and,  therefore, the task was no longer relevant.", "Addition of language to prioritize tasks. State and USUN officials  told us that another strategy is to add language to a mandate to  designate priority tasks. Officials stated that, as a result of such  language in mandates for MINUSCA, MONUSCO, and MINUSMA,  management at these peacekeeping operations had shifted mission  resources to focus on priority tasks. For example, officials cited  MINUSCA\u2019s proposed budget, which increased resources for  protection of civilians\u2014a task designated as a priority by the Security  Council\u2014and reduced resources for Security Sector Reform, an area  of less relevance to the mission given the current situation in the  Central African Republic.", "Addition of language to clarify exit strategies. State and USUN  officials noted that adding language to clarify exit strategies aids an  operation\u2019s success. For example, for the MINUJUSTH (Haiti) 2017  mandate, USUN officials noted that the United States had advocated  successfully for the Security Council to include language calling for an  exit strategy with benchmarks to assist the UN in monitoring the  progress of the operation\u2019s transition to a non-peacekeeping mission  beginning in October 2019."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USUN Does Not Have Sufficient Information from the UN on the Cost of Peacekeeping Operations to Determine Accurate Resource Allocation When Adjusting Mandates", "paragraphs": ["USUN officials told us that they do not have sufficient information to allow  them to determine accurate resource allocation to peacekeeping  operations when the Security Council makes a change to the mandate.

However, the USUN did not have complete  information from the UN on all of the costs associated with this change,  including support costs, such as flight hours and fuel for transport  vehicles. In the absence of such information from the UN, USUN officials  estimated these costs and advocated for a reduction in MONUSCO\u2019s  budget based on their own estimates. USUN officials noted that without  input from the UN, they did not have sufficient information to determine  the accuracy of their estimates.", "USUN officials told us that these information gaps exist because UN  peacekeeping budgets do not include estimated costs by task. Rather,  UN peacekeeping budgets provide information on the operation\u2019s use of  financial resources for personnel and operational costs. Thus, according  to USUN officials, when the Security Council changes a peacekeeping  operation\u2019s mandate\u2014such as by adding or removing a task\u2014it is not  clear how to adjust the budget for that operation to accurately reflect the  change. UN headquarters officials told us that the UN does not prepare  peacekeeping budgets with estimated costs by task because it is  challenging to do so. However, senior officials with whom we spoke at  two peacekeeping operations said that, despite challenges, it is possible  to estimate costs by mandated task, which would provide additional  budget transparency for the UN. Further, USUN officials stated that  having UN estimates readily available to all member states would not only  improve the accuracy of decisions related to resource allocation, but also  improve the transparency of the budget negotiation process.", "UN guidance on peacekeeping states that when the UN changes an  existing peacekeeping mandate it should make commensurate changes  in the resources available to the operation. Further, internationally- accepted and federal standards for internal control note that organizations  should use quality information to make informed decisions to achieve  their objectives.

USUN officials noted that while  the UN maintains some performance information on peacekeeping  operations, such as a database with information on troop capabilities and  readiness to deploy, it does not provide a complete picture of  peacekeeping performance. Specifically, USUN officials noted that they  would like better performance information about when peacekeeping units  are engaging well, failing to engage, or lack the training to perform the  tasks they have been asked to carry out. Also, the Security Council noted  concern in a September 2018 resolution sponsored by the United States  about the underperformance of some peacekeepers, such as inaction in  the face of imminent threats of physical violence against civilians and  conduct issues.", "Another concern relates to the completeness of performance information  about civilian peacekeeping staff. According to the UN, civilian  peacekeeping staff, who comprise about 14 percent of all peacekeeping  personnel, perform many of the mandated activities of peacekeeping  operations, including promoting and protecting human rights, helping  strengthen the rule of law, and fostering the political process. However,  according to USUN officials, the UN needs more complete information on  the performance of these staff. For example, as noted above, UN officials  told us that the UN had developed a database to collect performance  information on military personnel staffed to UN peacekeeping operations,  but did not have a similar way to track information on civilian personnel.  Additionally, the Security Council noted in a September 2018 resolution  that the UN must improve evaluation of all UN personnel supporting  peacekeeping operations, including civilians.

As a  member state of the UN, a permanent member of the Security Council,  and the largest financial contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget, the  United States plays a significant role in both the management of  peacekeeping operations and encouraging reforms to improve  peacekeeping activities. According to State, the U.S.-stated principles for  effective peacekeeping are critical conditions for peacekeeping  operations to carry out their mandates. Given the importance of  establishing the necessary conditions for peacekeeping success, State/IO  and USUN officials acknowledged the imperative of continuing to work  with the Security Council to ensure that peacekeeping operations meet  U.S.-stated principles of effectiveness. In doing so, the UN and its  member states could have greater assurance that they have set up  peacekeeping operations for success. Without information on estimated  costs by task, USUN and other UN member states have difficulty  determining that resources for UN peacekeeping operations accurately  reflect changes to the mandates of peacekeeping operations. With this  information, the United States and the international community can better  ensure that resources provided to peacekeeping operations support the  tasks agreed upon by UN member states.

State bases its Mission Monitoring and Evaluation reports on annual field  visits to peacekeeping operations during which assessors interview U.S.  and UN officials to evaluate the operation\u2019s progress toward meeting its  mandate and identify factors that affect the operation\u2019s ability to do so.  Based on these reports, State\u2019s strategy and priorities memoranda  summarize U.S. observations on the peacekeeping operation and, among  other things, propose options for U.S. action within the Security Council.  Each of the 11 memoranda we reviewed also includes State\u2019s  assessment of the peacekeeping operation against the U.S.  government\u2019s stated principles of effective peacekeeping, which State  considers to be critical conditions for an operation to successfully  implement its mandate. These principles are whether a peacekeeping  operation (1) supports a political solution to conflict, (2) has host country  consent, (3) has a realistic and achievable mandate, and (4) has an exit  strategy; and (5) whether the Security Council is willing to adjust the  mandate if the situation in the country improves or fails to improve.", "We reviewed State\u2019s memoranda on the operations and considered the  following types of factors when determining whether to categorize State\u2019s  assessments as met, partially met, or not met:  Supporting political solutions: Mediation processes, peace  agreements, and support for democratic elections.", "Host country consent: Consent to the operation, and the  necessary freedom of action, both political and physical to carry  out its mandated tasks.", "Realistic and achievable mandates: Extent to which operation  tasks appeared feasible in light of current conditions and available  resources.", "Exit strategies: Strategic goals and targets, strategic planning,  and timetables for withdrawal.", "We categorized a principle as \u201cmet\u201d if State indicated that the operation  was generally succeeding in an area.

We categorized a principle as \u201cpartially met\u201d if State indicated  that the operation had some areas of success, but was generally not  succeeding or restricted from success in some way. The fifth principle for  effective peacekeeping reads as the Security Council\u2019s willingness to  change the mandate. However, in its memoranda, State/IO assesses  whether and how a mandate should be changed, rather than assessing  the Security Council\u2019s willingness to change the mandate.
