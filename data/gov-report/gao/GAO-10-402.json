Under TRICARE, beneficiaries may obtain care through TRICARE Prime, an option that includes the use of civilian provider networks and requires enrollment. TRICARE beneficiaries who do not enroll in this option may obtain care from nonnetwork providers through TRICARE Standard, or from network providers through TRICARE Extra. In addition, qualified National Guard and Reserve servicemembers may purchase TRICARE Reserve Select, a plan whose care options are similar to those of TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Extra. We refer to servicemembers who use TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Extra, or TRICARE Reserve Select as nonenrolled beneficiaries. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed GAO to analyze the adequacy of DOD's surveys of TRICARE beneficiaries and providers and report what the surveys' results indicate about access to care for nonenrolled beneficiaries. To do so, GAO evaluated the surveys' methodology by interviewing DOD officials and reviewing relevant documentation, including the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) survey standards. GAO also assessed the surveys' results by interviewing DOD officials, obtaining relevant documentation, and analyzing the response rates and data for both surveys."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's implementation of beneficiary and provider surveys for 2008, the first of a 4-year survey effort, followed the OMB survey standards for survey design, data collection, and data accuracy. In addition, DOD generally addressed the survey requirements outlined in the mandate in implementing its 2008 beneficiary and provider surveys but did not give a high priority to selecting geographic areas with a high concentration of Selected Reserve servicemembers. Instead, for both of its surveys, DOD randomly selected areas to produce results that can be generalized to the populations from which the survey samples were drawn. DOD plans to cover the entire United States at the end of the 4-year survey period, which will include any locations with higher concentrations of Selected Reserve servicemembers. In its analysis of the 2008 beneficiary survey data, GAO estimated that a higher percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries in surveyed areas where TRICARE Prime is offered (Prime Service Areas) experienced problems accessing care from network or nonnetwork primary care providers than beneficiaries in surveyed areas where TRICARE Prime is not offered (non-Prime Service Areas)--30 percent and 24 percent, respectively. GAO also found that beneficiaries in the surveyed areas most often experienced access problems related to providers' willingness to accept TRICARE payments, regardless of whether they lived in a Prime or non-Prime Service Area. Additionally, GAO's comparison of this survey data to related data from a 2008 Department of Health and Human Services' survey showed that beneficiaries in the surveyed Prime and non-Prime Service Areas rated their health care satisfaction similarly to each other and to beneficiaries of commercial health care plans, but slightly lower than Medicare beneficiaries. GAO found that the results for the 2008 provider survey are not representative of all physicians and mental health providers in the geographic areas surveyed, but the results do provide information about access to care based on the specific views of the respondents. According to a DOD official, generalizability of provider survey results to the entire country will likely be possible at the end of the 4-year survey period. GAO's review of the 2008 provider survey results indicates that a lower percentage of respondents in Prime Service Areas reported awareness and acceptance of TRICARE than respondents in non-Prime Service Areas. Additionally, there were differences between responding physicians and responding mental health providers, such as psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, regarding their awareness and acceptance of TRICARE. For example, 81 percent of physicians who responded reported that they would accept new TRICARE patients, if they were accepting any new patients at all, compared to 50 percent of mental health providers who responded. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with GAO's overall findings and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009, the Department of Defense (DOD) offered health care  and mental health care services to over 9 million eligible beneficiaries in  the United States and abroad through TRICARE, DOD\u2019s regionally  structured health care program. TRICARE is unique because eligible  beneficiaries do not have to enroll in the program to use their benefits, and  therefore DOD does not have complete information on which beneficiaries  intend to use their benefits. Because of this, DOD cannot accurately  predict from year to year the health care needs of the eligible population,  including how to ensure adequate access to health care and mental health  care.", "Under TRICARE, beneficiaries obtain care either from military hospitals  and clinics, referred to as military treatment facilities, or from civilian  providers. DOD\u2019s TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), which oversees  the program, uses managed care support contractors to develop networks  of civilian providers and to perform other customer service functions,  such as processing claims and assisting beneficiaries with finding  providers. The contractors are required to establish adequate networks of  civilian providers\u2014referred to as network providers\u2014to serve all  TRICARE beneficiaries in geographic areas called Prime Service Areas.  The contractors use estimates of the number of TRICARE users, among  other factors, to develop provider networks and ensure adequate access to  care for beneficiaries. Although some network providers may be located  outside of Prime Service Areas, contractors are not required to develop  networks in these areas (which we refer to as non-Prime Service Areas).", "TRICARE has three basic options for its beneficiaries: TRICARE Prime,  TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra. Beneficiaries who choose  TRICARE Prime, a managed care option, must enroll and can obtain care  through the networks of providers established by contractors.  Beneficiaries do not need to enroll to receive care under TRICARE  Standard, a fee-for-service option, or TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider  organization option, and can choose to receive care either through  nonnetwork providers (under TRICARE Standard) or network providers  (under TRICARE Extra).  All beneficiaries may obtain care at military  treatment facilities, although priority is first given to active duty personnel  and then to beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Prime. The choices that  beneficiaries have in selecting TRICARE options and providers can vary  depending on a beneficiary\u2019s location. Beneficiaries living in Prime Service  Areas can choose between TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Standard, and  TRICARE Extra. Beneficiaries living in non-Prime Service Areas can  choose between TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Extra. According to a  TMA official, about 18 percent of eligible beneficiaries resided in non- Prime Service Areas in fiscal year 2009.", "Users of TRICARE Standard and Extra in some locations have complained  about difficulties finding civilian providers who will accept them as  patients since TRICARE\u2019s inception in 1995. In response to these concerns,  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 directed DOD  to monitor access to care for TRICARE beneficiaries who were not  enrolled in the TRICARE Prime option through a survey of civilian  providers. The act also directed GAO to review the processes,  procedures, and analysis used by DOD to determine the adequacy of the  number of network and nonnetwork civilian providers and the actions  DOD has taken to ensure access to care for beneficiaries who were not  enrolled in TRICARE Prime. In December 2006, we reported that TMA and  its contractors used various methods to monitor access to care, including  a provider survey. According to TMA and its contractors, their methods  indicated that access was generally sufficient for users of TRICARE  Standard and Extra.", "Nonetheless, concerns about the ability of TRICARE beneficiaries to  access health care and mental health care from civilian providers  continue. For example, in the wake of current military operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq, DOD and others have reported that servicemembers  and their families are at risk for mental health problems given the stress of  deployment and exposure to combat. A June 2007 report by DOD\u2019s Task  Force on Mental Health stated that TRICARE provider networks have  been tasked with providing an increasing volume and proportion of mental  health services for families and retirees. In assessing the oversight of the  mental health network at one location, the task force discovered that out  of 100 network mental health providers contacted from a list on the  contractor\u2019s Web site, only 3 would accept new TRICARE patients.", "Additionally, concerns about access to care for National Guard and  Reserve servicemembers and their families have surfaced in light of DOD\u2019s  increasing reliance on this population to support military operations, such  as the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. DOD has reported that as of  August 31, 2009, over 731,000 National Guard and Reserve servicemembers  have been deployed in support of conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq since  September 11, 2001. DOD has reported that National Guard and Reserve  servicemembers may not live near military installations like their active  duty counterparts, and as a result, they may not have access to military  hospitals and clinics and must instead rely more heavily on civilian  providers for their care. DOD\u2019s Task Force on Mental Health also reported  that since a substantial proportion of National Guard and Reserve  servicemembers reported no civilian health plan coverage before  deployment and continue to rely on TRICARE thereafter, constraints in  access to care for this population are a real concern. Qualified members of  the Selected Reserve\u2014National Guard and Reserve servicemembers who  are considered essential to wartime missions\u2014who are not activated to  duty may sign up for TRICARE Reserve Select, a premium-based health  plan whose care options are similar to those of TRICARE Standard and  Extra. According to DOD officials, there were approximately 69,000  members of the Selected Reserve who were eligible and likely to be  interested in TRICARE Reserve Select, as of September 30, 2009. Of  these, approximately 67 percent had purchased TRICARE Reserve Select.  For the purpose of this report, we refer to beneficiaries who are not  enrolled in TRICARE Prime\u2014that is, those who use TRICARE Standard,  TRICARE Extra, or TRICARE Reserve Select\u2014as nonenrolled  beneficiaries.", "In light of continued concerns about access to civilian providers, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA 2008)  directed DOD to conduct surveys of beneficiaries and providers to  determine the adequacy of access to health care and mental health care for  nonenrolled beneficiaries.

This report  describes (1) how DOD is addressing the NDAA 2008 mandate to  implement beneficiary and provider surveys to determine the adequacy of  access to care for nonenrolled beneficiaries, (2) what the results of the  beneficiary survey indicate about the adequacy of access to care for  nonenrolled beneficiaries, and (3) what the results of the provider survey  indicate about the adequacy of access to care for nonenrolled  beneficiaries.", "To evaluate how DOD is addressing the NDAA 2008 mandate to implement  beneficiary and provider surveys to determine the adequacy of access to  care, we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials and  representatives from TMA\u2019s Health Program Analysis and Evaluation  Directorate who were responsible for developing, fielding, and analyzing  the surveys. We evaluated TMA\u2019s beneficiary and provider survey  methodologies using the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  standards and guidelines for statistical surveys. We focused our analysis  on standards specific to designing a survey (e.g., selecting random  samples), developing a list of eligible survey participants, collecting survey  data, and ensuring data accuracy. We also evaluated the beneficiary and  provider surveys to determine whether TMA had complied with all of the  requirements outlined in the mandate, such as obtaining specific types of  information and establishing benchmarks for analysis. In addition, we  spoke with officials representing beneficiary and provider groups to obtain  their views on access-to-care issues.

For example, 64 percent of the respondents in the surveyed Prime Service  Areas who reported that they are accepting any new patients reported that  they would accept nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries as new patients,  compared to 76 percent of respondents in the surveyed non-Prime Service  Areas and 72 percent of respondents in the surveyed Hospital Service  Areas.

TMA identified the 80 Prime Service Areas by collecting zip  codes where TRICARE Prime was offered from officials within each of the  three TRICARE Regional Offices. TMA grouped these zip codes into 80  nonoverlapping areas so that each area had roughly the same number of  TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries. Because non-Prime Service Areas had not  previously been defined, TMA sought to define them by grouping all zip  codes not in Prime Service Areas into one large area using Hospital  Referral Regions, which are groupings of Hospital Service Areas. TMA  divided the large area into 80 non-Prime Service Areas so that each area  had roughly the same number of TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries.", "To identify locations where beneficiaries and health care and mental  health care providers have identified significant levels of access-to-care  problems under TRICARE Standard and Extra, TMA spoke with groups  representing beneficiaries and health care and mental health care  providers as well as TRICARE Regional Offices. These groups suggested  cities and towns where access should be measured, and Hospital Service  Areas corresponding to each city and town were then identified. Based on  the groups\u2019 recommendations, a list was created and sorted in priority  order, resulting in 21 Hospital Service Areas being included in the 2008  provider survey. Additionally, TMA plans to include these 21 Hospital  Service Areas in its 2009 beneficiary survey along with additional areas  that are identified for 2009.

TMA determined a beneficiary\u2019s  eligibility to be included in the 2008 beneficiary survey if DEERS indicated  that the individual met five criteria: (1) eligible for military health care  benefits as of the date of the sample file extract; (2) age 18 years old or  older; (3) not an active duty member of the military; (4) residing in one of  the 20 randomly selected Prime Service Areas or 20 randomly selected  non-Prime Service Areas; and (5) a user of TRICARE Reserve Select, or  not enrolled in TRICARE Prime. From this database, TMA randomly  sampled about 1,000 beneficiaries from each Prime Service Area and non- Prime Service Area\u2014a sample size that would achieve TMA\u2019s desired  sample error. Specifically, TMA surveyed 48,548 TRICARE beneficiaries  representing active duty, retired, and Reserve servicemembers, including  the Selected Reserve. TMA began mailing the beneficiary survey in June  2008. After receiving the returned surveys, TMA identified the responses  that it considered complete and eligible based on whether the beneficiary  had answered at least half of TMA\u2019s identified \u201ckey\u201d questions and  answered that he or she used \u201cTRICARE Extra or Standard\u201d or \u201cTRICARE  Reserve Select\u201d in response to the following question: \u201cWhich health plan  did you use for all or most of your health care in the last 12 months?\u201d", "TMA selected the provider sample within the same 20 Prime Service Areas  and 20 non-Prime Service Areas that had been randomly selected for the  2008 beneficiary survey. In addition, TMA mailed surveys to physicians  and mental health providers in the 21 Hospital Service Areas identified by  beneficiary and provider groups as having significant levels of access-to-  care problems under TRICARE Standard and Extra. TMA used the  American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (Masterfile) to select a  sample of 20,030 physicians who were licensed office-based civilian  medical doctors or licensed civilian doctors of osteopathy within the  specified locations who were engaged in more than 20 hours of patient  care each week. The Masterfile is a database of physicians in the United  States\u2014Doctors of Medicine and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014that  includes data on all physicians who have the necessary educational and  credentialing requirements. The Masterfile did not differentiate between  TRICARE\u2019s network and nonnetwork civilian providers, which TMA  deemed acceptable to avoid any potential bias in TMA\u2019s sample selection.  As such, TMA selected this file because it is widely recognized as one of  the best commercially available lists of providers in the United States and  it contains over 940,000 physicians along with their addresses; phone  numbers; and information on practice characteristics, such as their  specialty. According to TMA, the American Medical Association updates  physicians\u2019 addresses monthly and other elements through a rotating  census methodology involving approximately one-third of the physician  population each year. Although the Masterfile is considered to contain  most providers, deficiencies in coverage and inaccuracies in detail remain.  Therefore, TMA attempted to update providers\u2019 addresses and phone  numbers and to ensure that providers were eligible for the survey by also  using state licensing databases, local commercial lists, and professional  society and association lists. For its mental health provider sample, TMA  selected a sample of 20,386 mental health providers from two sources: the  National Plan and Provider Enumeration System database maintained by  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and from LISTS, Inc., a list  of names with contact information assembled from state licensing boards.  According to TMA, it selected these sources for mental health providers  because they have been identified as the most comprehensive databases  for these health care providers. TMA did not include all physician  specialist types, such as epidemiologists and pathologists, in its survey.  From these data sets, TMA planned to randomly sample about 800  providers (400 each of physicians and mental health providers) from each  Prime Service Area, non-Prime Service Area, and Hospital Service Area\u2014a  sample size that would achieve TMA\u2019s desired sample error. In those  instances where there were not 800 providers in a single area, TMA  selected all of the providers in that area to receive surveys. TMA began  mailing the provider survey in December 2008. Upon receipt of the  returned surveys, TMA identified the responses that it considered  completed and eligible based on the following criteria for respondents:   (1) if the provider answered \u201cyes\u201d to the questions that asked whether the  provider offers care in an office-based location or private practice; (2) for  the nonphysician mental health survey, if the provider responded that he  or she was in one of the six TRICARE participating specialties\u2014certified  clinical social worker, certified psychiatric nurse specialist, clinical  psychologist, certified marriage and family therapist, pastoral counselor,  or mental health counselor; and (3) if the provider had completed three  key questions on the physician survey instrument or three key questions  on the nonphysician mental health provider survey instrument."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary and Provider Survey Content", "paragraphs": ["The NDAA 2008 required that the beneficiary survey include questions to  determine whether TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries have had  difficulties finding physicians and mental health providers willing to  provide services under TRICARE Standard or TRICARE Extra.

TMA based some of its 2008 beneficiary survey questions on  those included in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 2006  Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, a national  survey of beneficiaries of commercial health insurance, Medicare,  Medicaid, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.
