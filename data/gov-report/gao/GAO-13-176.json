To obtain, distribute, and collect payment for drugs dispensed, pharmacies interact with a network of entities, including drug wholesalers and third-party payers. With limited time and resources, independent pharmacies may need assistance in interacting with these entities, particularly with third-party payers that include large private and public health plans. Most use a PSAO to interact on their behalf. PSAOs develop networks of pharmacies by signing contractual agreements with each pharmacy that authorizes them to interact with third-party payers on the pharmacy's behalf by, for example, negotiating contracts. While specific services provided by PSAOs may vary, PSAOs can be identified and distinguished from other entities in the pharmaceutical distribution and payment system by their provision of intermediary or other services to assist pharmacies with third-party payers.", "GAO was asked to review the role of PSAOs. In this report, GAO describes: (1) how many PSAOs are in operation and how many pharmacies contract with PSAOs for services; (2) the services PSAOs offer and how they are paid for these services; and (3) entities that own PSAOs and the types of relationships that exists between owners and the pharmacies they represent. GAO analyzed data on PSAOs in operation in 2011 and 2012, reviewed literature on PSAOs and model agreements from 8 PSAOs, and interviewed federal agencies and entities in the pharmaceutical industry."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At least 22 pharmacy services administrative organizations (PSAO), which varied in the number and location of the pharmacies to which they provided services, were in operation in 2011 or 2012. In total, depending on different data sources, these PSAOs represented or provided other services to between 20,275 and 28,343 pharmacies in 2011 or 2012, most of which were independent pharmacies. While the number of pharmacies with which each PSAO contracted ranged from 24 to 5,000 pharmacies, most PSAOs represented or provided other services to fewer than 1,000 pharmacies. Additionally, some PSAOs contracted with pharmacies primarily located in a particular region rather than contracting with pharmacies located across the United States.", "While PSAOs provide a broad range of services to independent pharmacies, and vary in how they offer these services, PSAOs consistently provide contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services. All of the model agreements between PSAOs and independent pharmacies that GAO reviewed stated that the PSAO will negotiate and enter into contracts with third-party payers on behalf of member pharmacies. PSAOs may also contract with pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), which many third-party payers use to manage their prescription drug benefit. In addition to contracting, PSAOs also communicate information to members regarding contractual and regulatory requirements, and provide general and claims-specific assistance to members by means of a help-desk or a dedicated staff person. They may also provide other services to help member pharmacies interact with third-party payers or their PBMs, such as managing and analyzing payment and drug-dispensing data to identify claims unpaid or incorrectly paid by a third-party payer. PSAO services are intended to achieve administrative efficiencies, including contract and payment efficiencies for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs. Most PSAOs charge a monthly fee for a bundle of services and may charge additional fees for other services provided to its member pharmacies. Virtually all of the fees paid for PSAO services are paid by member pharmacies, with PSAOs receiving no administrative fees from other entities such as third-party payers or their PBMs.", "The majority of PSAOs in operation in 2011 or 2012 were owned by drug wholesalers and independent pharmacy cooperatives. Of the 22 PSAOs we identified, 9 PSAOs were owned by wholesalers, 6 were owned by independent pharmacy cooperatives, 4 were owned by group purchasing organizations, and 3 were stand-alone PSAOs owned by other private entities. These owners varied in their requirements for PSAO member pharmacies to also use services from their separate, non-PSAO line of business. Three PSAO owners GAO spoke with required PSAO members to also use their non-PSAO services. For example, one wholesaler-owned PSAO limited its offer of PSAO services to existing customers of its drug distribution line of business. All but one PSAO owner GAO spoke with reported that their PSAO line of business earned little to no profit. However, PSAO owners may operate PSAOs for a number of reasons, including helping pharmacies gain access to third-party payer contracts and to provide benefits to the owner's non-PSAO line of business."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Independent pharmacies dispensed almost 20 percent of all prescription  drugs in the United States in 2010, with chain pharmacies accounting for  the majority of the remaining 80 percent. To obtain, distribute, and collect  payment for the drugs they dispense, independent pharmacies interact  with a network of entities that offer a variety of services. These entities  include drug wholesalers that purchase and distribute drugs to  pharmacies, and third-party payers that pay for the dispensed drugs on  behalf of enrollees. With limited time and resources, independent  pharmacies may need assistance in interacting with these entities,  particularly with third-party payers that include large private and public  health plans such as those offered by large corporations and the federal  government through Medicare and the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program (FEHBP).", "To address independent pharmacies\u2019 need for assistance with third-party  payer interactions, both existing entities\u2014such as drug wholesalers\u2014as  well as new entities began providing a variety of administrative services to  independent pharmacies. These administrative services included, for  example, managing pharmacies\u2019 claims payments from third-party  payers. Entities that provide administrative services to independent  pharmacies to assist such pharmacies in interacting with third-party  payers are called pharmacy services administrative organizations  (PSAO). While specific services provided by PSAOs may vary, PSAOs  can be identified and distinguished from other entities in the  pharmaceutical distribution and payment system by their provision of  intermediary services to assist pharmacies with third-party payers.", "PSAOs develop networks of member pharmacies by signing contractual  agreements with individual pharmacies. These agreements set forth the  duties and obligations of the PSAO to each pharmacy and vice versa, and  generally authorize PSAOs to interact with third-party payers on behalf of  the members in their network. Among the responsibilities established  between the PSAO and the pharmacy, the PSAO is frequently given the  responsibility to contract on behalf of the pharmacy with third-party  payers. Independent pharmacies may want the assistance of a PSAO  due to the complexity of the contract terms and financial interactions with  multiple third-party payers. As an intermediary, a PSAO may also provide  other services that assist pharmacies in working with third-party payers.  Because these other services may vary by PSAO, pharmacies may  belong to multiple PSAOs\u2019 networks that provide complementary  services. For example, a pharmacy may belong to one PSAO network  that contracts with third-party payers on its behalf and belong to another  PSAO network that assists the pharmacy with reconciling claim payments  from third-party payers.", "According to industry reports, 80 percent of  independent pharmacies obtain services from a PSAO. In addition,  nearly 80 percent of the independent pharmacies surveyed by the  Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General  (HHS OIG) for its 2008 study reported obtaining PSAO services.", "Although PSAOs are focused on assisting independent pharmacies, their  services may also benefit third-party payers. In addition, PSAO services  may also benefit pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which many third- party payers use to help manage their prescription drug benefit, including  developing contracts that set forth the terms and conditions for  pharmacies to dispense prescriptions to health plan enrollees. According  to PBMs, PSAOs make it easier for third-party payers or their PBMs to  interact with multiple independent pharmacies by serving as a single point  of contact. In addition, by providing access to multiple independent  pharmacies, PSAOs enable third-party payers or their PBMs to expand  and maintain networks in certain geographic areas\u2014such as rural and  underserved areas\u2014where independent pharmacies are more likely to be  located. Thus, PSAOs help third-party payers or their PBMs build  networks of pharmacies to meet the needs of health plans and their  enrollees and, in some cases, to satisfy federal requirements.", "You expressed interest in knowing more about the role of PSAOs in the  network of entities that interact to distribute and pay for prescription  drugs.

We also analyzed National Council for  Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) data from February 2011. NCPDP  collects and maintains a database of in-depth pharmacy information from  both pharmacies and PSAOs. Specifically, we conducted a  comprehensive literature review that included materials published through  October 2012. We also obtained and reviewed published and  unpublished reports we identified through Internet searches for  information related to PSAOs and an interview with a pharmaceutical  trade association. We conducted a total of 24 interviews with various  entities including federal agencies\u2014HHS OIG and the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC)\u2014trade associations, pharmaceutical industry experts,  three independent pharmacy owners, and a sample of PSAOs and  PBMs.", "PSAO sample: Our sample of PSAOs to interview included the   5 largest PSAOs based on the number of pharmacies they contracted  with according to NCPDP data, as well as 5 additional PSAOs that  varied by the number of pharmacies they represented and by  ownership. According to NCPDP data, these 10 PSAOs represented  over 17,000 pharmacies.", "PBM sample: Our sample of PBMs to interview included the three  largest PBMs as of March 2012, as defined by prescription volume,  according to Atlantic Information Services data. Combined, these  PBMs represented about 60 percent of total prescription volume in the  United States.", "Finally, we analyzed NCPDP data and reviewed other available  information, such as industry reports. We analyzed NCPDP data to  determine the total number of PSAOs in operation in 2011 by first  identifying potential PSAOs in the NCPDP data and then verifying  whether the entity was a PSAO by reviewing its website and other  available information. We considered an entity to be a PSAO if it  contracted to provide intermediary or other services that assist  independent pharmacies in working with third-party payers or their PBMs.  We developed this criterion on the basis of information we gathered from  the literature review and interviews with key entities, including an industry  expert and a PSAO. Using our list of PSAOs, we then searched the  NCPDP database to determine the total number and types of pharmacies  that each of the PSAOs represented in 2011. We reviewed NCPDP data  for reasonableness and consistency, including screening for outliers. We  also reviewed documentation and spoke with NCPDP officials about  steps taken to ensure data reliability.", "We determined that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. However, there are some limitations to the NCPDP  data, including that these data may not contain the complete universe of  PSAOs or independent pharmacies. For example, according to NCPDP  officials, smaller independent pharmacies that do not conduct electronic  transactions may not be included in the NCPDP data. Multiple entities we  interviewed reported that there is no one comprehensive data source for  information on PSAOs; however, several entities, including the HHS OIG,  reported using NCPDP to determine the number of independent  pharmacies in operation, the number of PSAOs in operation, or the  affiliations between pharmacies and PSAOs. Due to NCPDP data  limitations, we also reviewed industry reports and other sources of  information, such as PSAO websites, to supplement these data when  answering our research objectives. These supplemental data provided  the number of PSAOs in operation and the number of pharmacies they  contracted with in 2011 or 2012, which may vary from the data reported  by NCPDP. Consequently, we report a range in the number of  pharmacies represented by PSAOs in 2011 or 2012. Additionally, since  PSAOs can represent other types of pharmacies, such as small chains, in  addition to independent pharmacies and pharmacies can have  agreements with multiple PSAOs for different services, the number of  pharmacies that we report as being represented by PSAOs may be  greater than the total number of independent pharmacies operating in the  United States.", "To describe the services provided by PSAOs and how PSAOs are paid  for these services, we interviewed officials from the various entities noted  above and reviewed agreements between PSAOs and independent  pharmacies. In conducting our interviews with PSAOs and independent  pharmacies, we asked about how payment for PSAO services were made  and received, including the frequency and amount of payments. We also  obtained model agreements from eight of the ten PSAOs we interviewed.  We reviewed these agreements to determine the duties and obligations of  each PSAO to its member pharmacies. In addition, we reviewed the  duties and obligations of member pharmacies joining the PSAO network  as well as the payment and termination provisions included in each  agreement. The information obtained from these interviews and  agreements may not be generalizeable due, in part, to variation in the  types of services offered by different PSAOs.", "To determine the entities that own PSAOs and the types of relationships  that exist between PSAO owners and the independent pharmacies they  represent, we analyzed NCPDP data, reviewed industry reports and  PSAO websites, and interviewed the various entities noted above.  Specifically, using NCPDP data, we obtained the contact information for  each PSAO, which in some cases indicated the owner of the PSAO.  Where it did not indicate the owner, we reviewed industry reports that  included ownership information for some PSAOs, reviewed the PSAO\u2019s  website, or contacted the PSAO directly. We reviewed NCPDP data for  reasonableness and consistency, including screening for outliers. We  also reviewed documentation and spoke with NCPDP officials about  steps taken to ensure data reliability.

Independent pharmacies are an important part of a wholesaler\u2019s customer portfolio because, in addition to purchasing drugs,  independent pharmacies may also pay the wholesaler to provide logistical  functions and ancillary services such as direct delivery of drugs to  individual stores and inventory management. Thus, a wholesaler\u2019s  relationship with an independent pharmacy may result in multiple  business opportunities for the wholesaler and administrative efficiencies  for the pharmacy.

Consequently, these pharmacies must carefully choose which contracts  to accept or reject. Accordingly, most independent pharmacies rely on  PSAOs to negotiate directly, or to make recommendations for negotiating  contracts on their behalf with third-party payers or their PBMs. When a  PSAO enters into a contract with a third-party payer or its PBM, the  pharmacies in its network gain access to the third-party payer or PBM  contract\u2014and the individuals it covers\u2014by virtue of belonging to the  PSAO\u2019s network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Third-Party Payers and PBMs", "paragraphs": ["Third-party payers accounted for almost 80 percent of drug expenditures  in 2010, which represents a significant shift from 30 years ago when  payment from individual consumers accounted for the largest portion of  expenditures.

This increase was made to improve  pharmacies\u2019 cash flow by giving them quicker access to funds owed them  by third-party payers or their PBMs. Two PSAOs we spoke with reported  adding certification programs, particularly vaccination/immunization  certification programs, because of the needs of third-party payers or their PBMs for this service to be provided through their network pharmacies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PSAOs Provide Services Intended to Achieve Administrative Efficiencies for Independent Pharmacies and Third- Party Payers or Their PBMs", "paragraphs": ["PSAOs provide services intended to achieve administrative efficiencies  for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs.  PSAO services enable pharmacy staff, including pharmacists, to focus on  patient-care services rather than administrative issues that pharmacists  may not have the time to address. PSAO services also reduce the  number of resources that PBMs must direct toward developing and  maintaining relationships with multiple independent pharmacies.", "PSAO services are intended to help independent pharmacies achieve  efficiencies particularly in contract negotiation. For example, independent  pharmacies and PBMs we spoke with told us that PSAO contract  negotiation services eased their contracting burden and allowed them to  expand the number of entities with which they contracted. As a member  of a PSAO, pharmacies may no longer have to negotiate contracts with  multiple third-party payers or their PBMs operating in any given market.  Independent pharmacies also told us that PSAOs provide other services  that create both administrative and cost efficiencies for them. For  example, one pharmacist told us that the marketing services provided by  his PSAO relieved him of advertising costs because the PSAO provided  advertising circulars to its PSAO-franchise members. Another  independent pharmacy reported that its PSAO provides services such as  claims reconciliation less expensively than the pharmacy could perform  on its own.", "Similar to independent pharmacies, PBMs we spoke with reported that  PSAO services create administrative efficiencies for them, including  efficiencies in contracting, payment, and their call centers. PSAO services  create contracting efficiencies because they provide PBMs with a single  point through which they can reach multiple independent pharmacies. For  example, the PBMs we spoke with each had over 20,000 independent  pharmacies in their networks, however, each PBM only negotiated  contracts with 15 to 19 PSAOs, representing a majority of the pharmacies  in its network. PBMs also reported that PSAO services create payment  efficiencies when PSAOs provide central payment services. One PBM  reported that instead of mailing checks to hundreds of individual  pharmacies, the PBM made one electronic funds transfer to the PSAO,  which then distributed the payments to its members. Finally, PBMs  benefit from reduced call center volume because PSAOs often provide  similar support directly to member pharmacies. For example, a call that  may have gone to the PBM about a claim that was not paid may instead  go to the pharmacy\u2019s PSAO, which will help the pharmacy understand  any issues with the claim. PSAOs may also aggregate member  pharmacies\u2019 issues and contact the PBM to discuss issues on behalf of  multiple pharmacies and relay pertinent information back to those  pharmacies.", "While creating efficiencies by acting on behalf of multiple pharmacies,  PSAOs must ensure that their arrangements do not unreasonably restrain  trade, thereby raising antitrust concerns. The FTC and the Antitrust  Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) are the federal agencies  responsible for determining whether a particular collaborative  arrangement may be unlawful and for enforcing applicable prohibitions.", "According to FTC officials, such a determination is dependent on multiple  factors including the geographic region that a PSAO is operating in and  the health care program (e.g., Medicare Part D) with which a PSAO is  contracting. These factors affect the PSAO\u2019s ability (and the abilities of  the pharmacies the PSAO represents) to affect the terms of a contract or  the pricing of a good. For example, a group of rural pharmacies may more  effectively influence contract negotiations than a single pharmacy  operating in an urban area with many competitors. PSAOs we spoke with  were aware of potential antitrust issues and reported taking measures to  minimize them. For example, two of the PSAOs we spoke with reported  developing their PSAO\u2019s organizational structure to ensure compliance  with antitrust laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most PSAOs Charge a Monthly Fee for Bundled Services and Additional Fees for Other Services", "paragraphs": ["Although PSAOs\u2019 charges to member pharmacies for their services may  vary depending on how the services are provided, 8 of the 10 PSAOs we  spoke with charged a monthly fee for a bundled set of services. For  example, 1 PSAO charged $40 to $80 per month for a bundle of services  that included contract negotiation, communication with member  pharmacies, help-desk services, business advice, and limited audit  support. In comparison, another PSAO\u2019s monthly fee ranged from $59 to  $149 per month depending on the combination of services that the  pharmacy requested. One of the remaining PSAOs we spoke with  charged an annual fee rather than a monthly fee, while the other PSAO  did not charge any fees for its PSAO services. The latter PSAO provided  PSAO services as a value-added service to members of its group  purchasing organization, for which it charged a monthly fee. Other  services that are offered by most, but not all, PSAOs we spoke with are  either provided within the bundle or as separate add-on services. PSAOs  may also charge fees for individual services that are based on the type or  value of that service.", "Virtually all of the fees for PSAO services are paid for by member  pharmacies. All of the PSAOs we spoke with reported that they did not  receive any type of fees from other entities such as an administrative fee  from a third-party payer or its PBM. Similarly, all of the PBMs we spoke  with told us that they did not pay PSAOs for their services. However 1 of  the 3 PBMs we spoke with reported that it paid part of a pharmacy\u2019s  dispensing fee to 1 of the 16 PSAOs with which it contracted rather than  to the pharmacy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wholesalers and Independent Pharmacy Cooperatives Owned the Majority of PSAOs; Requirements to Use Non-PSAO Services Varied by Owner", "paragraphs": ["The majority of PSAOs in operation in 2011 or 2012 were owned by  wholesalers and independent pharmacy cooperatives.PSAO owners varied as to whether they require member pharmacies to  also use the non-PSAO services they offer."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wholesalers and Independent Pharmacy Cooperatives Owned the Majority of PSAOs", "paragraphs": ["Wholesalers and independent pharmacy cooperatives owned the majority  of the PSAOs in operation in 2011 or 2012. Specifically, of the   22 PSAOs we identified, 9 PSAOs were owned by wholesalers, 6 were  owned by independent pharmacy cooperatives (\u201cmember-owned\u201d),   4 were owned by group purchasing organizations, and 3 were stand- alone PSAOs owned by other private entities. (See table 3.) Three of the  5 largest PSAOs were owned by the 3 largest wholesalers in the U.S.:  AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health Inc., and McKesson  Corporation. Across all sources included in our review, the PSAOs owned  by these wholesalers represented 9,575 to 12,080 pharmacies, and  PSAOs owned by independent pharmacies represented 4,883 to 8,882  pharmacies. According to one industry report, the services provided by  member-owned PSAOs are similar to those offered by wholesaler-owned  PSAOs. One PBM we spoke with noted that because of the financial  backing of wholesaler-owned PSAOs, their PSAOs generally offer central  payment services more often than PSAOs owned by other types of  entities. This strong financial backing is necessary to offer these services  because there is a considerable liability and risk in providing a central  payment service.", "PSAO owners may operate PSAOs for a number of reasons, including to  benefit another, non-PSAO line of their business. The wholesalers we  spoke with provided various reasons for offering PSAO services, such as  wanting to assist independent pharmacies in gaining access to third-party  payer or PBM contracts, or to help pharmacies operate more efficiently.  Additionally, one wholesaler noted that it created its PSAO because third- party payers and independent pharmacies indicated there was a need for  PSAO services in the market. These third-party payers wanted a sole  source for reaching multiple pharmacies, while independent pharmacies  wanted a facilitator to assist them with reviewing third-party payer  contracts. Other pharmaceutical entities noted that wholesalers may have  an interest in developing relationships with independent pharmacies,  which are potential customers of the wholesaler\u2019s drug distribution line of  business. By obtaining multiple services from a wholesaler, an  independent pharmacy may be less likely to switch wholesalers.  Additionally, by having their PSAOs assist independent pharmacies with  entering multiple third-party payer or PBM contracts, wholesalers may  benefit from the increased drug volume needed by independent  pharmacies to serve the third-party payer\u2019s or PBM\u2019s enrollees. Other  types of PSAO owners also provided a number of reasons for providing  PSAO services, for instance, a number of these owners stated that they  began offering PSAO services as a market-driven response to the growth  of third-party payers and PBMs. In fact, one PSAO owner we spoke with  stated that it reluctantly began offering these services at the request of  customers of its group purchasing services, who wanted help navigating  the issues and complexities of third-party payer and PBM contracting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PSAO Owners Vary As to Whether They Require Member Pharmacies to Use Their Non-PSAO Services", "paragraphs": ["The owners of PSAOs we spoke with varied as to whether they require  PSAO member pharmacies to also use services from a separate non- PSAO line of their business. Of the nine PSAO owners we spoke with that  had a separate non-PSAO line of business (e.g., drug distribution or  group purchasing), six did not require their PSAO member pharmacies to  use services from that non-PSAO line of business. Of the remaining  three, one wholesaler-owned PSAO limited its offer of services to  pharmacies that were existing customers of its drug distribution line of  business, while two member-owned PSAOs reported requiring their  PSAO member pharmacies to join their group purchasing organizations.  Officials from the wholesaler-owned PSAO stated that their limiting the  availability of PSAO services to existing customers ensures that their  PSAO already has basic information about their member pharmacies and  a salesperson who serves as each member pharmacy\u2019s point of contact.", "While most PSAO owners do not require their member pharmacies to use  services from their primary line of business, member pharmacies may  choose to do so. In this case, a pharmacy must contract and pay for  PSAO and other services separately. In fact, according to one wholesaler  we spoke with, approximately 36 percent of its drug distribution  customers were also members of its PSAOs. required to submit an application to join a PSAO network. PSAO  applications we reviewed requested information about the pharmacy\u2019s  licensing, services provided, and insurance. Additionally, applications  asked pharmacies to indicate whether they had been investigated by the  HHS OIG, had filed for bankruptcy, or had their pharmacy\u2019s state license  limited, suspended, or revoked. PSAOs stated they used the information  provided in applications to verify that the pharmacies applying for  membership in their network are licensed by their state and in good  standing.", "Pharmacies may choose to obtain PSAO services from their wholesaler, but not all do  so. Instead, some pharmacies may choose to join another PSAO.", "Most PSAOs we spoke with operated their PSAO separately from any  separate non-PSAO line of business. For example, most wholesalers we  spoke with stated their PSAO staff and drug distribution staff are distinct  and do not interact. One of these wholesalers reported its PSAO has a  distinct corporate structure, management team, sales organization and  financial component from its drug distribution line of business. However,  nearly all of the PSAO owners we spoke with operate their PSAO as a  subsidiary of their non-PSAO line of business. For example, two PSAOs  were organized as subsidiaries of a member-owned buying group, while  another PSAO operated as a branded service under the owner\u2019s non- PSAO line of business.", "Most PSAO owners reported that PSAO services are not a profitable line  of business. Only 1 of the 10 PSAO owners we spoke with stated that its  PSAO service was profitable. Other PSAO owners reported little to no  profit earned from the PSAO services they provided. For those PSAOs  that are not profitable, the cost of operating them may be subsidized by  the owner\u2019s non-PSAO lines of business. As previously noted, it may be  the case that offering PSAO services may benefit the owner\u2019s non-PSAO  line of business even if the PSAO service itself is not profitable. For  example, one member-owned PSAO we spoke with also owned a group  purchasing organization to which its members must belong in order to  obtain PSAO services. The group purchasing organization may benefit  from increased membership driven by pharmacies that want to obtain its  PSAO services.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
