In addition, our analysis found that  companies (both exempt and nonexempt) that obtained an auditor  attestation generally had fewer financial restatements than those that did  not, which suggests that knowing whether a company has obtained the  auditor attestation may be useful for investors in gauging the reliability of  a company\u2019s financial reporting. However, because SEC regulations  currently do not require explicit statements regarding the voluntary  attainment of auditor attestation, investors may have to interpret reporting  requirements and filings to determine whether exempt companies have  obtained an auditor attestation. Previously, when certain companies were  temporarily exempt from the auditor attestation requirement, SEC  required explicit disclosure of exemption status in companies\u2019 annual  reports.

We conducted an analysis of our survey results to identify potential  sources of nonresponse bias using two methods. First, we examined the  response propensity of the sampled companies by several demographic  characteristics. These characteristics included market capitalization size  categories, region, and sector. Our second method consisted of  comparing weighted estimates from respondents and nonrespondents to  known population values for total market capitalization. We conducted  statistical tests of differences, at the 95 percent confidence level, between  estimates and known population values, and between respondents and  nonrespondents. We determined that there was significant bias induced  by the largest companies (measured by market capitalization) not  responding to the survey. In other words, we found that companies with  market capitalization over $10 billion were underrepresented in our  sample. However, we found no evidence of substantial nonresponse bias  based on these characteristics when generalizing to the population of  companies with market capitalization less than or equal to $10 billion.  Therefore, we adjusted the scope of our survey to include only those  companies with market capitalization of less than or equal to $10 billion  (see table 8).", "Because we found no evidence of substantial nonresponse bias when  generalizing to the adjusted target population and the weighted response  rate of 25 percent, we determined that weighted estimates generated  from these survey results are generalizable to the population of in-scope  companies.
