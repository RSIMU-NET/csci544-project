Both perspectives provide valuable insights. An adequacy perspective focuses on benefit levels and how well they maintain pre-entitlement living standards. An equity perspective focuses on rates of return and other measures relating lifetime benefits to contributions. Both perspectives examine how their measures are distributed across earnings levels. However, equity measures take all benefits and taxes into account, which is difficult for reform proposals that rely on general revenue transfers because it is unclear who pays for those general revenues. The Social Security program's distributional effects reflect both program features and demographic patterns among its recipients. In addition to the benefit formula, disability benefits favor lower earners because disabled workers are more likely to be lower lifetime earners. In contrast, household patterns reduce the system's tilt toward lower earners, for example, when lower earners have high-earner spouses. The advantage for lower earners is also diminished by the fact that they may not live as long as higher earners and therefore would get benefits for fewer years on average. Proposals to alter the Social Security program would have different distributional effects, depending on their design. Model 2 of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security proposes new individual accounts, certain benefit reductions for all beneficiaries, and certain benefit enhancements for selected low earners and survivors. According to our simulations, the combined effect could result in lower earners receiving a greater share of all benefits than promised or funded under the current system if all workers invest in the same portfolio."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under Social Security, retired workers receive benefits that equal about  50 percent of pre-retirement earnings for a worker with relatively lower  earnings but only about 30 percent of earnings for one with relatively  higher earnings.

We tailored the analysis to examine the effects of  specific program features, such as spouse, survivor, and disability benefits.  In consultation with your staff, we selected three reform proposals for our  analysis to illustrate a range of possible approaches to restoring solvency.  To describe the distributional effects of the \u201cModel 2\u201d proposal put forth  by the President\u2019s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS), we  used our model to simulate benefits for workers born in 1985. In our  modeling, we focused on workers born in 1985 because all prospective  program changes under all alternative policy scenarios would be almost  fully phased in for such workers. We focused on examining the  distribution of benefits and did not assess their adequacy. We did not  examine other sources of retirement income, such as employer pensions  or other individual retirement savings, and such sources may interact with  Social Security benefits. Also, in our modeling, to illustrate a full range of  possible outcomes, we used hypothetical benchmark policy scenarios that  would achieve 75-year solvency either by only increasing payroll taxes  (which simulated \u201cpromised benefits\u201d) or only reducing benefits (which  simulated \u201cfunded benefits\u201d). If benefits were reduced proportionally  under the funded-benefits benchmark, then even though the benefits  would be lower, the shape of the distribution of benefits would be very  similar to that of the promised benefits benchmark. We also conducted a  qualitative analysis of the distributional effects of two other proposals, one  offered by Peter Ferrara and the other by Peter Diamond and Peter  Orszag.

The program was designed to  provide benefits that workers had earned to some degree through their  contributions and those of their employers. The benefit amounts would  depend in part on how much the worker had earned and therefore  contributed. Today, about 10 percent of the elderly have incomes below  the poverty line, compared with 35 percent in 1959. However, for about  half of today\u2019s elderly, incomes excluding Social Security benefits are  below the poverty line. Importantly, Social Security does not just provide  benefits to retired workers. In 1939, coverage was extended to the  dependents of retired and deceased workers, and in 1956 the Disability  Insurance program was added.", "To restore the long-term solvency and sustainability of the program,  reductions in promised benefits and/or increases in program revenues will  be needed. Within the program\u2019s current structure, possible benefit  changes might include increases in the full retirement age, changes to the  benefit formula, or reductions in cost-of-living increases, among other  options. Revenue increases might include increases in payroll taxes or  transfers from the Treasury\u2019s general fund.", "Some proposals would change the structure of the program to incorporate  a system of individual retirement savings accounts. Many such proposals  would reduce benefits under the current system and make up for those  reductions to some degree with income from the individual accounts.

Social Security is a form of insurance, while  individual accounts would be a form of savings. As social insurance, Social  Security protects workers and their dependents against a variety of risks  such as the inability to earn income due to old age, disability, or death. In  contrast, a savings account provides income only from individuals\u2019  contributions and any earnings on them; individuals effectively insure  themselves under a savings approach.", "Defined-benefit versus defined-contribution. Social Security provides  a \u201cdefined-benefit\u201d pension, while individual accounts would provide a  \u201cdefined-contribution\u201d pension. Defined-benefit pensions typically  determine benefit amounts using a formula that takes into account  individuals\u2019 earnings and years of earnings. The provider assumes the  financial and insurance risk associated with funding those promised  benefit levels. Defined-contribution pensions, such as 401(k) plans,  determine benefit amounts based on the contributions made to the  accounts and any earnings on those contributions. As a result, the  individual bears the financial and insurance risks under a defined- contribution plan until retirement.", "Pay-as-you-go versus full funding. Social Security is financed largely on  a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d basis, while individual accounts would be \u201cfully funded.\u201d  In a pay-as-you-go system, contributions that workers make in a given year  fund the payments to beneficiaries in that same year, and the system\u2019s  trust funds are kept to a relatively small contingency reserve. In contrast,  in a fully funded system, contributions for a given year are put aside to pay  for future benefits. The investment earnings on these funds contribute  considerable revenues and reduce the size of contributions that would  otherwise be required to pay for the benefits. Defined-contribution  pensions and individual retirement savings are fully funded by definition.", "To evaluate reform proposals, we have suggested that policy makers  should consider three basic criteria:  1.  the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable solvency and  how the proposal would affect the economy and the federal budget;  2.  the balance struck between the twin goals of individual equity (rates  of return on individual contributions) and income adequacy (level and  certainty of benefits); and  3.  how readily such changes could be implemented, administered, and  explained to the public.", "Providing higher replacement rates for lower earners than for higher  earners is just one of several aspects of our criterion for balancing  adequacy and equity. With regard to adequacy, this criterion also considers  the extent to which the proposal    changes benefits for current and future retirees;    maintains or enhances benefits for low-income workers who are most  reliant on Social Security; and    maintains benefits for the disabled, dependents, and survivors.", "In addition, providing higher replacement rates for lower earners than for  higher earners does not by itself ensure adequacy. A reform proposal  could make replacement rates vary even more by earnings level than  under the current system yet provide lower and less adequate benefits.", "With regard to equity, our criterion for balancing adequacy and equity also  considers the extent to which the proposal    ensures that those who contribute receive benefits,    expands individual choice and control over program contributions,  increases returns on investment, and  improves intergenerational equity.", "Moreover, reform proposals should be evaluated as packages that strike a  balance among individual reform elements and important interactive  effects. The overall evaluation of any particular reform proposal depends  on the weight individual policy makers place on each criterion.", "In 2001, the President created the Commission to Strengthen Social  Security to develop reform plans that strengthen Social Security and  increase its fiscal sustainability while meeting certain principles:    no changes to benefits for retirees or near retirees,    dedication of entire Social Security surplus to Social Security,    no increase in Social Security payroll taxes,    no government investment of Social Security funds in the stock market,    preservation of disability and survivor components, and  inclusion of individually controlled voluntary individual retirement  accounts.", "The commission developed three reform models, each of which  represented a different approach to including voluntary individual  accounts as part of Social Security. Under all three models, individuals  could have a portion of their Social Security contributions deposited into  individual accounts, and their Social Security defined benefits would be  reduced relative to those account contributions. A governing board would  administer the accounts in a fashion similar to the Thrift Savings Plan for  federal employees. To continue paying benefits while also making deposits  to the accounts, funds would need to be transferred from the Treasury\u2019s  general fund.

The choice  of measures reflects a particular perspective on the goals of the program.  For example, those who analyze Social Security from an adequacy  perspective are primarily concerned with the program\u2019s role in securing  adequate income and consequently tend to use measures of how much  income Social Security provides. In contrast, those who view Social  Security from an equity perspective focus on whether beneficiaries receive  a fair return on their contributions and tend to choose measures balancing  lifetime taxes against lifetime benefits. For each perspective, assessing  progressivity involves determining how lower earners fare relative to  higher earners on appropriate measures. In the context of Social Security  reform, those scenarios in which the well-being of lower earners increased  proportionally more, or decreased proportionally less, would be  considered more progressive. Because of the different kinds of benefits  that Social Security provides, many researchers agree that to investigate  the distributional effect of the program, aggregating workers and their  dependents into households better captures well-being, but doing so poses  certain methodological challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Adequacy Perspective Focuses on Reducing Poverty and Dependency", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception, Social Security\u2019s primary goal has been to provide  adequate income, upon entitlement, so as to reduce dependency and  poverty among its participants. Studies emphasizing this goal reflect the  adequacy perspective; they view the program more as a safety net that  helps ensure a minimum level of subsistence. Consequently, such studies  use measures of how much income Social Security benefits provide. These  measures include absolute benefit levels at a point in time and benefit-to- earnings ratios. Benefit levels are useful for estimating whether Social  Security offers adequate protection for people covered by the system.  Benefit-to-earnings ratios, which reflect how much of past earnings Social  Security benefits replace, help gauge the extent to which the program  allows people to maintain their past standard of living.", "One way to assess the distributional effect of the current Social Security  program or of various reform options is to look at how these adequacy  measures are distributed across earners. Regarding benefit levels, one  possibility is to compute the ratio of benefits received by lower earners to  benefits received by higher earners, at a particular point in time.  Comparing these benefit ratios under different policies helps determine  how the well-being of lower earners changes relative to that of higher  earners across reform proposals. If, for example, benefits collected by  individuals in the 20th percentile of the earnings distribution relative to  benefits collected by those in the 80th percentile increased from one  Social Security system to the next, the adequacy perspective would  conclude that, other things being equal, the second is more progressive,  that it is tilted toward lower earners. Alternatively, one could compute  the proportion of total benefits various groups of earners receive relative  to the proportion the median gets and determine the manner in which  these relative proportions change across proposals. For all groups below  the median, for instance, an increase in this ratio would indicate a more  progressive system.", "The distribution of replacement rates also helps assess progressivity. The  change in the replacement rate of lower earners relative to that of high  earners across reform options shows the extent to which lower earners  are able to maintain their pre-entitlement standard of living relative to  higher earners. Under the current Social Security system, for instance, the  monthly benefit lower earners receive upon entitlement replaces a larger  portion of their monthly earnings; from an adequacy perspective, the  system is therefore tilted in their favor.

Studies  that reflect the equity perspective focus on whether, over their lifetimes,  beneficiaries can expect to receive a fair return on their contributions or  get their money\u2019s worth from the system. These studies use such measures  as lifetime benefit-to-tax ratios, internal rates of return, and net lifetime  benefit-to-earnings ratios. The benefit-to-tax ratio measure compares the  present value of Social Security lifetime benefits with the present value of  lifetime Social Security taxes. The internal rate of return can be thought  of as the interest rates individuals effectively receive on their lifetime  contributions, given their lifetime Social Security benefits. Net lifetime  benefit-to-earnings ratios show lifetime benefits minus lifetime taxes  relative to lifetime earnings. This measure, also called the average rate of  net taxation, borrows from the public finance literature the idea that  equity measures ought to contain earnings.", "From an equity perspective, examining the distribution of these measures  helps gauge the distributional effects of Social Security or reform options.  Many studies adopting the equity perspective find, for example, that the  current program favors lower earners because this group enjoys higher  rates of return and benefits whose value is larger relative to the value of  their contributions. Other studies confirm this result by observing that  the net benefit-to-earnings ratio is higher for low earners. If under a  reform proposal, these measures increased more for lower earners, then  that system would be considered more progressive.", "Reform options that involve general revenue transfers to ensure solvency  make it difficult to evaluate progressivity from an equity perspective  because they do not typically specify how such transfers are to be  financed or who will eventually bear their burden. Yet general revenue  transfers implicitly require future tax increases, spending cuts, or a  combination of both, all of which have substantial distributional  consequences. Such consequences are difficult to evaluate analytically.  Without knowing who will bear the costs of financing these transfers, the  equity perspective cannot accurately determine how well lower earners  fare relative to higher earners in a given system or across proposed  reforms. Even if we knew how the tax burden of general revenues is  distributed today, the tax system could change in the future in ways that  would alter the distribution. Some proposals with individual account  features, for example, involve general revenue transfers. They divert part  of existing payroll tax revenues from traditional Social Security benefits  and toward individual accounts. Consequently, to remain financially  solvent, such proposals typically require additional resources from  Treasury\u2019s general fund for several years after implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyzing Households to Assess Social Security\u2019s Distributional Effects Offers Insight but Presents Analytical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Both the adequacy and the equity perspectives consider families or  households, in addition to individuals, in assessing distributional effects.

Household analysis has implications for  progressivity. Most studies using equity measures find Social Security  somewhat less progressive once workers and their dependents are  combined in a single unit. This is largely due to the fact that some  individuals with little or no earnings, hence \u201cpoor\u201d by themselves, end up  in high-earning households.

Disability  benefits use the same progressive benefit formula, and disability recipients  are disproportionately lower lifetime earners. However, the extent to  which these features favor lower earners may be offset to some degree by  demographic patterns and other program features. Household formation  reduces the system\u2019s tilt toward lower-income people because some of the  lower-earning individuals helped by the program, in fact, live in high- income households.

The PIA is determined by  applying the Social Security benefit formula to a worker\u2019s Average  Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). The AIME is the monthly average of a  worker\u2019s 35 best years of earnings, with earnings before age 60 indexed to  average wage growth.

Disability Insurance favors lower earners  because it uses the same progressive benefit formula as retired worker  benefits and because DI recipients are more likely to be lower earners.

We compared benefits under Model 2 with hypothetical  benchmark policy scenarios that would achieve 75-year solvency either by  only increasing payroll taxes or by only reducing benefits. The tax- increase, or \u201cpromised benefits,\u201d benchmark scenario pays benefits  defined by the current benefit formula and raises payroll taxes to bring the  Social Security system into financial balance. The proportional benefit- reduction, or \u201cfunded benefits,\u201d benchmark scenario maintains current tax  rates and achieves financial balance by gradually phasing in proportional  benefit reductions. In order to compare Model 2 with the benchmarks, we  assumed all account participants convert their account balances at  retirement into periodic monthly payments. We did not simulate other  sources of retirement income, such as employer pensions or other  individual retirement savings, and such sources may interact with Social  Security policy.

For example, households in  the bottom fifth of earnings received about 12.5 percent of all lifetime  benefits under both benchmark scenarios. According to our simulations,  households in the bottom fifth of earnings would receive greater shares of  lifetime benefits under both Model 2 scenarios than under the benchmark  scenarios, while households in the top fifth of earnings would receive  smaller shares under Model 2 than under the benchmarks.", "It should be noted that while the simulations suggest that the distribution  of benefits under Model 2 is more progressive than under the benchmarks,  this does not mean benefit levels are always higher for the bottom fifth  under Model 2. (See fig. 6.) According to our simulations, median  household lifetime benefits for the bottom fifth under Model 2-0 percent  would be 3 percent higher than under the funded benefits scenario but 21  percent lower than under the promised benefits scenario. Median  household lifetime benefits for the bottom fifth under Model 2-100 percent  would be 26 percent higher than under the funded benefits scenario but 4  percent lower than under the promised benefits scenario. While Model 2  may improve the relative position of lower earners, it may not improve the  adequacy of their benefits.", "To further understand how Model 2 distributes benefits toward lower  earners, we examined the distributional effects of each of its core features.

Next we simulated a version that included  the defined-benefit reductions and the individual accounts with the $1,000  cap on account contributions. Finally, we simulated the complete Model 2- 100 percent scenario, which included the enhanced benefits for lower  earners and survivors.", "Our analysis suggests that the effect of the individual accounts and defined  benefit reductions, which favor higher earners, would be more than offset  by the limit on account contributions and the enhanced benefits for lower  earners and survivors. Figure 7 shows the distributional impact of each  reform feature. First, we simulated adding the individual accounts and  reducing Social Security defined benefits. The share of benefits received  by the bottom fifth of earnings falls relative to the benchmarks by as much  as a percentage point, and the share received by the top fifth increases by  about 1.5 percentage points. Under this scenario, benefits from individual  account balances effectively replace some of the benefits calculated from  the Social Security benefit formula and the disability program. This shift  favors higher earners because, unlike the benefit formula, accounts by  themselves do not provide higher replacement rates for lower earners  and because DI recipients are more likely to be lower earners.", "Figure 7 also shows the impact of the cap on contributions and the  enhanced benefits for low earners and survivors. Adding the cap on  contributions would increase the share of benefits for the lowest fifth of  earnings by more than a percentage point and would reduce the top fifth\u2019s  share by two percentage points. The cap would reduce total benefits more  for higher earners than for lower earners because higher earners have a  greater proportion of earnings above the limit. As expected, adding the  enhanced benefits for low earners and survivors also favors lower  earners. The lowest fifth\u2019s share of benefits increases by about a  percentage point, and the top fifth\u2019s share of benefits decreases by almost  a percentage point.", "It should be emphasized that these simulations are only for individuals  born in 1985, and the distributional impact of Model 2 could be different  for individuals born in later years. For example, under the proposal, initial  Social Security defined benefits only grow with prices, while initial  benefits from account balances grow with wages. Since wages generally  grow faster than prices, Social Security defined benefits will decline as a  proportion of total benefits, reducing the importance of the progressive  benefit formula, disability benefits, and the enhanced benefits for low  earners and survivors.", "It should also be noted that the account feature of Model 2-100 percent  likely exposes recipients to greater financial risk.

Specifically, under the proposal,    Account contributions would be redirected from the Social Security  payroll tax. They would equal 10 percent of the first $10,000 of annual  earnings and 5 percent of earnings over $10,000 up to the maximum  taxable earnings level, which is $87,900 in 2004.

In addition, benefits for disabled workers and  those who die before retirement would remain in place, and the  distributional effects of these parts of Social Security would remain largely  unchanged. Thus, any changes to the distribution of benefits would occur  through the individual accounts for those choosing the accounts. All  workers would initially continue to pay payroll taxes at the same rate as  under current law, which is the same for all earnings up to the maximum  taxable earnings. At the same time, lower earners would have larger  contributions made from the payroll tax to their voluntary individual  accounts. As a result, holding all else equal, the annuities that lower  earners could receive from their accounts would replace a higher share of  their pre-retirement earnings than annuities for higher earners. However,  without rigorous quantitative analysis, it remains unclear how the  distributional effects of the accounts would compare with and interact  with the effects of the current system. In particular, actual investment  returns could vary depending on individuals\u2019 investment choices or on  market performance, and in some cases returns may not be high enough to  completely replace Social Security benefits, in which case the guarantee  would apply.", "The Ferrara proposal also would have significant distributional effects  from an equity perspective due to its revenue provisions. The general  revenue transfers needed to cover the transition to individual accounts  could have substantial effects on rates of return and other equity  measures.

In addition, payroll  taxes would increase 3 percentage points (divided equally between  employees and employers) for all earnings above the maximum taxable  earnings level. Benefit calculations would not reflect the additional  earnings taxed under this provision.

This provision is  conceptually similar to the enhanced benefit for lower earners under CSSS  Model 2 but uses a different formula. Benefits would increase for old-age  surviving spouses to 75 percent of the benefit the married couple would  have received if both were still alive. This provision is conceptually similar  to the enhanced survivor benefit under CSSS Model 2 but is specified  somewhat differently.

Proportional reductions do not, by definition, change the share of benefits  received by each segment of the earnings distribution.

Moreover, greater progressivity is not the same thing as greater adequacy.  Under some reform scenarios, Social Security could distribute benefits  more progressively than current law yet provide lower, less adequate  benefits. At the same time, our analysis shows that reform provisions that  favor lower earners can offset other provisions that disfavor them. In  addition, greater progressivity may result in less equity. As a result, any  evaluations should consider a proposal\u2019s provisions taken together as a  whole. Moreover, distributional effects are only one of several kinds of  effects proposals would have.

Nevertheless,  alternative approaches to increasing revenues could have very different  effects on individual equity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefit-Reduction-Only, or \u201cFunded Benefits,\u201d Benchmark Policies", "paragraphs": ["We developed alternative benefit-reduction benchmarks for our analysis.  For ease of modeling, all benefit-reduction benchmarks take the form of  reductions in the benefit formula factors; they differ in the relative size of  those reductions across the three factors, which are 90, 32, and 15 percent  under the current formula.

Therefore, it would not be appropriate to  reduce some benefits and not others.

We chose this phase-in period to achieve  a balance between two competing objectives: (1) minimizing the size of  the ultimate benefit reduction and (2) minimizing the size of each year\u2019s  incremental reduction to avoid \u201cnotches,\u201d or unduly large incremental  reductions. Notches create marked inequities between beneficiaries close  in age to each other. Later birth cohorts are generally agreed to experience  lower rates of return on their contributions already under the current  system. Therefore, minimizing the size of the ultimate benefit reduction  would also minimize further reductions in rates of return for later cohorts.  The smaller each year\u2019s reduction, the longer it will take for benefit  reductions to achieve solvency, and in turn the deeper the eventual  reductions will have to be. However, the smallest possible ultimate  reduction would be achieved by reducing benefits immediately for all new  retirees by over 10 percent; this would create a huge notch.", "Our analysis shows that a 30-year phase-in should produce incremental  annual reductions that would be relatively small and avoid significant  notches. In contrast, longer phase-in periods would require deeper  ultimate reductions.", "In addition, we feel it is appropriate to delay the first year of the benefit  reductions for a few years because those within a few years of retirement  would not have adequate time to adjust their retirement planning if the  reductions applied immediately. The Maintain Tax Rates (MTR)  benchmark in the 1994-96 Advisory Council Report also provided for a  similar delay.", "Finally, the timing of any policy changes in a benchmark scenario should  be consistent with the proposals against which the benchmark is  compared. The analysis of any proposal assumes that the proposal is  enacted, usually within a few years. Consistency requires that any  benchmark also assume enactment of the benchmark policy in the same  time frame. Some analysts have suggested using a benchmark scenario in  which Congress does not act at all and the trust funds become exhausted.  However, such a benchmark assumes that no action is taken while the  proposals against which it is compared assume that action is taken, which  is inconsistent. It also seems unlikely that a policy enacted over the next  few years would wait to reduce benefits until the trust funds are  exhausted; such a policy would result in sudden, large benefit reductions  and create substantial inequities across generations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining the PIA Formula Factor Reductions", "paragraphs": ["When workers retire, become disabled, or die, Social Security uses their  lifetime earnings records to determine each worker\u2019s PIA, on which the  initial benefit and auxiliary benefits are based. The PIA is the result of two  elements\u2014the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) and the benefit  formula. The AIME is determined by taking the lifetime earnings earnings  record, indexing it, and taking the average of the highest 35 years of  indexed wages.

This maintains a constant rate of benefit  reduction from year to year. In contrast, taking the reduction as a  proportion of each preceding year\u2019s factors implies a decelerating of the  benefit reduction over time because each preceding year\u2019s factors get  smaller with each reduction. To achieve the same level of 75-year  solvency, this would require a greater proportional reduction in earlier  years because of the smaller reductions in later years.", "The proportional reduction hits lower earners hard because the constant  x percent of the higher formula factors results in a larger percentage point  reduction over the lower earnings segments of the formula. For example,  in a year when the cumulative size of the proportional reduction has  reached 10 percent, the 90 percent factor would then have been reduced  by 9 percentage points, the 32 percent factor by 3.2 percentage points, and  the 15 percent factor by 1.5 percentage points. As a result, earnings in the  first segment of the benefit formula would be replaced at 9 percentage  points less than the current formula, while earnings in the third segment of  the formula would be replaced at only 1.5 percentage points less than the  current formula.", "Hypothetical-account reduction: Each formula factor is reduced by  annually subtracting a constant amount that is the same for all factors in  all years.

Therefore, it avoids hitting lower earners  as hard as the proportional reduction.", "We call this a hypothetical-account reduction because it has the same  effect as a benefit reduction based on using a hypothetical account. In fact,  we developed this benchmark first using a hypothetical-account approach  and then discovered it can be reduced to a simple change in the PIA  formula. Hypothetical-account calculations have become a common way  to offset benefits under individual account proposals, such as those by the  President\u2019s Commission to Strengthen Social Security. Such proposals  reduce Social Security\u2019s defined benefit to reflect the fact that  contributions have been diverted from the trust funds into the individual  accounts. The account contributions are accumulated in a hypothetical  account at a specified rate of return and then converted to an annuity  value.", "We used a hypothetical-account offset in our 1990 analysis of a partial  privatization proposal. In that analysis, we were charged with finding a  benefit reduction that would leave the redistributive effects of the program  unchanged while allowing a diversion of 2 percentage points of  contributions into individual accounts. We demonstrated the distributional  neutrality of this benefit reduction by showing that if all individuals earned  exactly the cohort rate of return on their individual accounts, then their  income under the proposal from Social Security and the new accounts  would be exactly the same as under the current system.", "For the purposes of developing a benefit-reduction benchmark, we applied  the hypothetical-account approach even though there are no actual  individual accounts. From our previous analysis, we realized a  hypothetical-account approach may produce distributional effects that  might in some sense be more neutral than other reduction approaches and  therefore worth studying as an alternative. In effect, using it to calculate a  benefit-reduction benchmark implies calculating an annuity value of the  percent of payroll that represents the system\u2019s revenue shortage.", "As it turns out mathematically, the hypothetical-account approach to  reducing benefits translates into PIA formula factor changes. Such a  benefit reduction is proportional to the AIME, not to the PIA, because the  contributions to a hypothetical account are proportional to earnings.  Therefore, a benefit reduction based on such an account would also be  proportional to earnings; that is,  Benefit reduction = y AIME  Therefore, the new PIA would be  PIAnew =(90% - y)  AIME + (32% - y)  AIME + (15% - y)  AIME  Thus, the reduction from a hypothetical account can be translated into a  change in the PIA formula factors. Because this reduction can be  described as subtracting a constant amount from each PIA formula factor,  it is reasonably transparent.", "In our analysis of CSSS Model 2, we found that Model 2 had a benefit  distribution that was very close to our hypothetical-account benefit- reduction benchmark. For example, households in the bottom fifth of  earnings received about 13.8 percent of all lifetime benefits under Model 2,  compared with 13.5 percent under the hypothetical-account benefit- reduction benchmark. In this report, we present the results using the  proportional benefit-reduction benchmark because this benefit-reduction  approach is more easily understood.", "Table 2 summarizes the features of our three benchmarks."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Social Security Reform: Analysis of a Trust Fund Exhaustion Scenario.
