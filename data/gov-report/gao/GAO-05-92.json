IRS estimated that EITC overclaim rates for tax year 1999, the most recent data available, were between 27 and 32 percent of dollars claimed or $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. We were asked to describe the three tests IRS has begun to reduce overclaims and how the funds appropriated for them were spent; assess how well IRS implemented the tests and describe planned refinements for the 2005 tests; and assess whether IRS's evaluation plans had sufficient documented detail to facilitate managerial review and stakeholder oversight and describe the status of the 2005 evaluation plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS implemented three tests in 2004 to address leading sources of EITC errors: a qualifying child test, where selected taxpayers were asked to document that their child lived with them for more than half the year in 2003; a filing status test, where selected taxpayers were asked to provide documentation to prove the accuracy of their 2003 filing status, and an income misreporting test, where a new screening process was used to select EITC returns that identify taxpayers likely to have the most significant changes in their assessments due to underreporting of income on their tax return. IRS's implementation of the tests proceeded smoothly and largely as planned. However, some information, such as a key change in the filing status test, was not well documented and the level and quality of some services provided to test participants were not measured. This lack of documentation hindered monitoring, oversight, and did not foster a common understanding of the tests. For the 2005 tests, IRS made key changes to the qualifying child test to encourage taxpayers to certify in advance of filing their return and to attempt to simulate what might happen with nationwide implementation. IRS also changed the sample selection criteria for the filing status test to better target noncompliant taxpayers. IRS's plans for evaluating the 2004 tests generally lacked documentation and detail for many key issues, which undermined their value to managers and stakeholders. For example, IRS did not specify how it planned to analyze some qualifying child survey data. In essence, an evaluation plan is the management plan or roadmap for the evaluation endeavor and well-developed plans facilitate test management and oversight. Despite the importance of having evaluation plans prior to implementation, IRS had not completed its plans for the 2005 tests before two of the tests had begun."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Researchers generally consider the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a  federal program providing tax relief to low-income workers, to be a  successful antipoverty program.  The Council of Economic Advisers  reported that because of the EITC, an estimated 4.3 million individuals\u2014 including 2.2 million children\u2014were lifted out of poverty in 1997.  In  recent years, IRS has paid about $30 billion annually to about 20 million  EITC recipients.  However, the EITC program has long experienced high  rates of noncompliance.  IRS\u2019s most recent EITC compliance study  estimated that between $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion of the EITC claims filed  for tax year 1999 should not have been paid. This amount represents an  estimated rate of EITC overclaims\u2014total erroneous claims less any  amount that IRS recovered or expects to recover\u2014of between 27 and 32  percent of EITC dollars claimed.", "In February 2002, when the most recent compliance study was released, a  task force of IRS and Treasury officials was convened to find ways of  reducing EITC overclaims.  The IRS/Treasury task force found that the  three leading errors were responsible for about $7 billion of overclaims  each year.  These errors resulted from taxpayers (1) claiming children who  were not a qualifying child, meaning they do not meet certain requirements,  primarily that the child did not live with them for more than half the tax  year ($3 billion in overclaims); (2) using an incorrect filing status of either  single or head of household, when the correct status was married filing  jointly or married filing separately ($2 billion in overclaims); and   (3) misreporting, primarily underreporting, their income ($2 billion in  overclaims). In all three cases, these errors resulted in taxpayers receiving  a larger credit than they should have received.", "IRS received about $52 million in fiscal year 2004 for a new EITC five-point  initiative to improve service, fairness, and compliance with the EITC  program.  Included in that amount were funds for three EITC tests to  evaluate new methods for reducing the overclaim rate in the three leading  problem areas identified by the IRS/Treasury task force\u2014qualifying child,  filing status, and income misreporting.  After designing the tests and  evaluation plans to guide the agency in its assessment of the tests, IRS  implemented them beginning in fiscal year 2004.  Although the tests and  evaluation of them continued into fiscal year 2005, IRS issued a status  report to Congress on the tests in August 2004 to comply with a legislative  mandate.  IRS also decided to begin another round of EITC tests in fiscal  year 2005 in the same three areas, but with some refinements.  The  qualifying child and income misreporting tests started in the first quarter of  fiscal year 2005 and the filing status test will begin in the second quarter of  2005.", "Because IRS\u2019s plans surrounding the tests have garnered much attention,  you asked us to review each of the fiscal year 2004 tests and (1) describe  the tests and how funds appropriated for them were spent, (2) assess how  well IRS implemented the tests and describe IRS\u2019s planned refinements for  the fiscal year 2005 tests, and (3) assess whether IRS\u2019s plan for evaluating  the tests contained sufficient documented detail to facilitate managerial  review and stakeholder oversight and describe the status of IRS\u2019s  evaluation plan for the fiscal year 2005 tests.", "To describe the tests and determine how the funds appropriated for them  were spent, we analyzed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials.  Our  assessment of IRS\u2019s implementation of the tests and documentation of its  evaluation plans for the tests was based on IRS\u2019s stated goals for them,  which were that the tests reduce overclaims and, for the qualifying child  test, also maintain EITC participation for eligible participants and minimize  taxpayer and IRS administrative burden.", "To assess how well IRS implemented the tests and describe IRS\u2019s planned  refinements for the 2005 tests, we developed criteria to evaluate IRS\u2019s  implementation (i.e., the execution and day-to-day management) of the  tests.  Those criteria included whether IRS sent correspondence to the  taxpayers\u2019 correct address, where taxpayers could go to receive assistance  about the tests and the quality of that assistance, IRS\u2019s hiring and training  of staff, and other aspects of administering the tests.  To assess the  implementation based on these criteria, we analyzed IRS\u2019s status reports;  reviewed policies and procedures; observed test operations in Kansas City,  Missouri; Atlanta, Georgia; and Fresno, California and selected those  locations based on a variety of reasons, including the location of key  managers and work; interviewed IRS officials; and reviewed a judgmentally  selected sample of cases for each test at those locations in order to review  a variety of case types.", "To assess whether IRS\u2019s plans for evaluating the tests contained sufficient  documented detail to facilitate managerial review and stakeholder  oversight, we used GAO guidance and the social science evaluation  literature to identify key attributes of an evaluation.  We shared these  attributes with IRS officials and they generally agreed to their relevance.   These attributes included the research design, outcome measures, target  and sample populations, data collection activities, analyses, and  dissemination of results. We obtained all available documentation on IRS\u2019s  evaluation plans for each of the tests and reviewed that documentation to  determine whether we could understand from the documentation alone  how IRS planned to address the key attributes.  Where we could not, we  interviewed IRS officials to further understand whether and how the  officials planned to address those key attributes.  Written documentation  should be complete, facilitate tracing of events, and be readily available for  examination to foster a common understanding of the program and facilitate oversight.  To describe the status of IRS\u2019s evaluation plan for the  fiscal year 2005 tests, we primarily relied on interviews with IRS officials.   Appendix I provides more detail on the scope and methodology, including a  more detailed description of the implementation criteria used in  conducting our work.", "We reviewed documentation and interviewed IRS officials to ensure that  the data that we received from IRS were reliable for the purposes used in  this report and determined they were.  As we conducted our work, IRS  continued to collect and analyze significant amounts of data from each test.   The tests continued into fiscal year 2005, primarily to finish cases where  taxpayers had either not responded to IRS\u2019s request for substantiation or  the substantiation provided was deemed insufficient by IRS.   Thus, the  analyses presented in this report are based on work that we performed  while the tests were ongoing.  Final conclusions about the impact of the  tests on overclaim rates, burden, and participation should not be made  until all data are collected and analyzed and IRS publishes its final report,  which is due to Congress by June 30, 2005.

The credit has been modified several times since its  introduction, and three laws have been enacted in recent years aimed at  resolving some concerns with EITC rules.  Despite modifications, the  original goal of the credit remains intact and the EITC continues to provide  a substantial benefit to millions of American families.", "The EITC is a refundable tax credit, meaning that qualifying working  taxpayers may receive a refund greater than the amount of income tax they  paid for the year.  EITC payments have a (1) phase-in range in which higher  incomes yield higher EITC amounts, (2) plateau phase in which EITC  amounts remain the same even as income rises, and (3) phase-out range in  which higher incomes yield lower EITC amounts.  The amount of credit a  taxpayer receives is based on several other factors, such as the presence  and number of qualifying children.  In general, taxpayers with one or more  qualifying children receive a higher credit than taxpayers without  qualifying children.  For tax year 2003, the amount of EITC that could be  claimed with two qualifying children ranged from $0 to $4,204 per tax  return filed, depending on income and filing status.", "EITC requirements for tax year 2003 include rules for all taxpayers  claiming the credit and additional rules that differ depending on whether or  not a taxpayer has qualifying children (see table 1).", "IRS has periodically measured EITC compliance.  For tax year 1999, (the  most current data available), IRS estimated the EITC overclaim rates at 27  to 32 percent of EITC dollars claimed, or $8.5 billion to $9.9 billion.  IRS  has limited data on underclaims, which for tax year 1999 were estimated to  be $710 million to $765 million. Because of the persistently high rates of  noncompliance, we also have identified the EITC program as a high-risk  area for IRS since 1995.", "In February 2002, the compliance study was released and the Assistant  Secretary of the Treasury, Tax Policy, and IRS Commissioner convened a  joint IRS/Treasury task force to identify ways of reducing EITC overclaims,  while maintaining participation among eligible claimants and minimizing  taxpayer and IRS\u2019s administrative burden.  The task force found that the  leading causes of errors resulting in EITC overclaims were due to  taxpayers (1) claiming children who were not a qualifying child, (2) using  an incorrect filing status, and (3) misreporting their income. With this  information, the task force designed what ultimately became initial  versions of the three tests, as show in figure 1.  As envisioned by the task  force, even if fully implemented, IRS does not plan to apply the test  requirements to the entire EITC population because IRS can use available  data to verify the eligibility of certain taxpayers.", "Because a new analysis of EITC compliance using 2001 tax return  information is not expected to be complete until spring 2005, IRS did not  know whether compliance has significantly changed since 1999 when  developing the EITC tests.  However, IRS officials do not think EITC  compliance has improved substantially since then.   In October 2004,  Congress passed a new law to make the definition of a qualifying child  uniform in various IRS provisions, but those changes are not effective until  tax years after December 31, 2004.  In general, the revised definition  appears to mainly affect other tax situations, such as claiming dependents,  more than just affecting the EITC.

Under current rules,  taxpayers are only required to substantiate that their child satisfied this  residency requirement if they are being audited by IRS on this issue.", "This test involved two random samples of 25,000 taxpayers who claimed  one or more qualifying children for tax year 2002: a test sample, whose  members were asked to substantiate their qualifying child\u2019s residency, and  a control sample, whose members had similar characteristics to the test  sample, but were not asked for any substantiation. Both samples were  designed to include taxpayers (1) most likely to make errors and (2) whose  qualifying child eligibility could not be verified from information available  to IRS.  IRS used prior research results to determine which taxpayers  would be most likely to incorrectly claim a qualifying child.", "The research showed that with those taxpayers most likely to make errors,  the errors often correlated with the taxpayer\u2019s relationship to the child and  the taxpayer\u2019s gender and filing status.  Taxpayers most frequently making  qualifying child errors included both fathers and males and females who  were not the child\u2019s parents and who filed as single or head of household.", "IRS also used available data to obtain evidence about taxpayers and  whether their qualifying children met residency and relationship  requirements. For example, a child\u2019s residency could be established with  some certainty by using the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  Federal Case Registry,  and a child\u2019s relationship to the taxpayer could be  established with some certainty using the Social Security Administration\u2019s  KIDLINK.  When this available evidence supported the taxpayers\u2019 EITC  claim that they had a qualifying child, those taxpayers were excluded from  the qualifying child test.", "Prior research showed that taxpayers who comply with the residency  requirement also comply in most cases with the relationship requirement.   Thus, if a taxpayer\u2019s child met the residency requirement, there was a high  probability that the relationship requirement would be met as well. Given  this analysis and difficulties IRS encountered in identifying documents that  taxpayers could readily obtain to prove their relationship to the child, any  taxpayer whose EITC eligibility was not verified from available data  became eligible to be selected for the qualifying child test in which they  would be asked to substantiate that the child lived with the taxpayer for  more than 6 months during the year.  Our September 2003 report contains a  more detailed explanation on how the sample was designed.", "As figure 2 shows, males filing as single or head of household comprised  the majority of the test sample.  The control group had characteristics  similar to the test group.", "The qualifying child test had three components\u2014a general test and two  subtests. Under the general test, taxpayers received test documentation in  English only and could have provided substantiation in one or any  combination of three ways\u2014records, letters, or a Schedule A, also known  as the general affidavit. Records that a taxpayer could provide included  school, medical, landlord, or child-care provider documentation.  Letters  were statements from certain individuals, such as a member of the clergy  or a community based organization official, on official letterhead.", "Affidavits were legal documents in which an individual attests that the  taxpayer\u2019s qualifying child resided with the taxpayer for a certain period of  time.  To be accepted, the document(s) had to contain various data, such as  the names of the qualifying children and the dates the child lived with the  taxpayer.", "In response to concerns that taxpayers may have difficulty obtaining  certification through the official sources cited on the Schedule A, such as  through an attorney or landlord, and that English-only documents might  weaken participation among taxpayers with limited English proficiency,  IRS also implemented two subtests.  The Schedule B, also known as the  friends and neighbors affidavit subtest, for 1,000 of the 25,000 taxpayers,  broadens the definition of the individuals allowed to certify the child\u2019s  residency to include those who have personal knowledge of a taxpayer\u2019s  circumstances, such as certain family members. The purpose of this  subtest was to determine whether such individuals could facilitate an  increase in residency certification for eligible taxpayers.  The taxpayers in  the Spanish subtest, 1,000 of the remaining 24,000, received documents in  both English and Spanish. The purpose of this subtest was to determine  whether Spanish language documents would increase the number of  taxpayers attempting to certify their child\u2019s residency.  Table 2 describes  the test and subtests.", "IRS sent the selected taxpayers five documents in December 2003  informing them about the test, including:  1. Notice 84-A, a letter informing the taxpayer about the new certification  2. Form 8836, Qualifying Children Residency Statement, to be  completed by the taxpayer and returned to IRS;  3. Schedule A or B (an affidavit) that could be used for certification;   4. Publication 3211M, Earned Income Tax Credit Questions and  5. Publication 4134, Free/Nominal Cost Assistance Available for Low  Income Taxpayers.", "Under the test and subtests, once taxpayers received the documents from  IRS, they were supposed to obtain supporting documents to prove their  qualifying child\u2019s residency and send that documentation back to IRS in the  same envelope as their 2003 tax return. IRS would withhold, or \u201cfreeze,\u201d the  EITC portion of the taxpayers\u2019 refund until acceptable documentation  proving a child\u2019s residency was received. Once IRS received the  documentation, IRS examiners in Kansas City, Missouri, would review it  and send a letter to the taxpayer accepting the claim, asking for additional  information, or rejecting the claim. If the taxpayers provided acceptable  documents, IRS would release the taxpayer\u2019s EITC portion of their refund.", "If acceptable documentation was not provided or if no response was  provided following a second notification letter, the taxpayer\u2019s EITC claim  would be denied and the taxpayer would be informed of his or her right to  appeal to the U.S. Tax Court.

EITC filing status errors occur when married taxpayers incorrectly  use single or head of household. Married taxpayers who incorrectly file  individually as single or head of household could qualify for a larger EITC  than they would otherwise be entitled to if they claimed the correct filing  status. This is because, pursuant to statute, IRS considers the combined  income of married taxpayers who file jointly for purposes of determining  the amount of EITC for which the taxpayer(s) qualifies.  Using combined  income may result in taxpayers exceeding the EITC income ceiling,  therefore receiving no credit at all, or qualifying for a lesser credit amount.  For example, in tax year 2003, married taxpayers filing jointly with $17,500  of income each, or a combined earned income of $35,000, and four  qualifying children would not be eligible for the EITC.  However, if each  taxpayer incorrectly filed as head of household, claimed two qualifying  children, and their $17,500 income, they would each receive a credit of  $3,405 or a combined total of $6,810.  IRS\u2019s databases offer limited ability to  independently or systematically identify taxpayers who may be claiming an  incorrect filing status.", "The primary purpose of the filing status test was to evaluate the impact on  overclaims of requiring taxpayers whose filing status has changed from  married to single or head of household any time between 1999 through 2002  to substantiate the filing status they claimed on their 2003 tax return.  To  select the population for the filing status test, IRS started with a computer  file of approximately 1.6 million taxpayer returns, or a 10 percent sample of  all taxpayers who claimed the EITC with one or more qualifying children  on their 2002 return.  IRS eliminated the qualifying child and income  misreporting test populations and, applied other exclusions, such as  taxpayers subject to an audit examination, or taxpayers with more than  one potential EITC-related issue. From that population, IRS selected  taxpayers whose returns showed a filing status of married at least once in  the previous 3 years.  This resulted in a sample of 69,000 taxpayers, which  IRS sorted by gender, zip code and filing status.  Using a random sampling  method, IRS selected 36,000 of these taxpayers for this sample who filed as  single or head of household on their 2003 tax return.  Females filing as  single or head of household comprised 96.9 percent of the test sample.", "The taxpayers in the 36,000 sample who filed a 2003 tax return claiming the  EITC received a letter from IRS about 2 weeks after filing their return  informing them that the EITC portion of their refund would be delayed  until IRS reviewed their return.  Within 30 days, IRS sent a second letter  asking taxpayers to verify their filing status, using the enclosed Form 886- FS, Filing Status Information Request and send it back to the IRS. This form  requires taxpayers to provide documentation as to why they did not file as  married for tax year 2003.  Taxpayers were asked to provide IRS with  documentation that they were divorced or legally separated as of  December 31, 2003, they did not live with their spouse for the last 6 months  of the year, the spouse was deceased, or some other reason existed to warrant a change of filing status.  IRS examiners reviewed the form and  accompanying documentation and sought clarification or additional proof,  if needed. If IRS examiners accepted the documentation, they released the  EITC portion of the taxpayer\u2019s refund and closed the case.", "If a taxpayer did not respond or IRS found the taxpayer\u2019s documentation  unacceptable, then IRS sent the taxpayer a notice stating that IRS (1)  changed the taxpayer\u2019s filing status from single or head of household to the  married filing separate status, (2) disallowed the EITC, and (3) changed the  taxpayer\u2019s standard deduction to the appropriate amount.  In addition, IRS  forwarded the taxpayers a letter informing them of their right to appeal the  changes to U.S. Tax Court.  This process is depicted in figure 4.", "The filing status test also included a subtest to gather additional  information on EITC claimants who used the head of household filing  status. The IRS/Treasury task force found that taxpayers using the head of  household filing status were more likely to misstate their filing status than  taxpayers using a different one.  IRS selected 500 taxpayers who filed as  head of household on their 2003 tax return.  The sample of 500 taxpayers  showed 99 percent females and 1 percent males with the head of household  filing status.", "Unlike the test for the 36,000 sample, IRS did not ask taxpayers in the  subtest of 500 who filed a 2003 return to provide supplemental  documentation to support their filing status until after they had received  their EITC refunds.  And, unlike taxpayers in the 36,000 sample, where IRS  had some information they had filed as married at least once from 1999 -  2002, IRS did not have such information on the taxpayers in the 500 sample.", "In fact, IRS could not determine whether these taxpayers were ever  married.  As a result, IRS asked these taxpayers to confirm their eligibility  for the head of household filing status, which they claimed on their 2003  tax return, by either (1) calling IRS on a special toll-free number and stating  that they used the correct filing status or (2) completing a stub that was  attached to the letter they received, checking yes or no, and mailing or  faxing it to IRS. IRS did not ask these taxpayers to provide substantiation  to support the filing status they claimed.  This was, in part, because IRS had  not identified any documentation that would be available to support a  taxpayer\u2019s claim that he or she had never been married.  If taxpayers  indicated they were not eligible to use the head of household filing status,  they could correct their filing status by sending in an amended tax return  either by mail or fax.  IRS asked taxpayers to provide the information  within 45 days from the date on the letter.  All taxpayers who did not  respond would be subject to an examination before their 2004 EITC refund  would be released.", "In another aspect of the filing status test, IRS planned to determine  whether a third-party service that attempted to locate the address of  taxpayers could be as reliable as the filing status test in identifying  taxpayers who had used an incorrect filing status.

In instances where this matching process identifies discrepancies,  IRS may assess additional taxes on the taxpayer.  The annual AUR  matching program identifies far more cases than IRS has staff to work.  In  determining which cases to work, IRS selects not only cases that it believes  will generate the highest probable assessment, but also cases involving  taxpayers who underreport different types of income (e.g., wages,  interest).  In the past, some of those cases\u2014roughly 300,000 per year\u2014 involved the EITC.

IRS employed a computer selection tool that used variables  such as the taxpayer\u2019s filing history, filing status, and number of children to  rank the cases in terms of the highest probable EITC assessments.", "Additionally, IRS designed the test to determine whether certain  characteristics of the selected cases made them more likely to yield higher  assessments.  Thus, IRS placed each of the selected cases in one of four  groups: (1) \u201crepeater egregious,\u201d cases in the same income category for the  third year in a row and were assessed an additional tax for the previous 2  years; (2) \u201crepeater worked,\u201d cases worked at least once during the last 3  years; (3) \u201crepeater not worked,\u201d cases in the income misreporting  inventory at least once in the last 3 years, but not worked; and (4) \u201cother  criteria,\u201d cases randomly selected from the other three categories and  other criteria, such as first-time underreporters.", "As figure 5 shows, the majority, 62 percent, of the taxpayers  selected for  the income misreporting test filed their return using the head of household  filing status, while 30 percent claimed married filing jointly and 8 percent  claimed a single filing status.", "IRS added the income misreporting test cases back into the general AUR  inventory, and examiners in Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Fresno,  California worked the test cases using the same processes as for all other  AUR cases.  Examiners manually screened all cases for simple math errors  or errors that could not be picked up by a computer (e.g., placing an  amount on the wrong line).  If such an error was found and resolved, the  tax return was accepted, and the case was closed.  If the examiner could  not resolve the discrepancy, the examiner sent a notice to the taxpayer  explaining that IRS found a discrepancy on his or her return.  The taxpayer  was given 30 days to respond to the notice.  If no response was received,  IRS sent another notice informing the taxpayer that the IRS had determined  there was a deficiency in the return and the taxpayer must pay an  assessment based on the deficiency or file a petition with the U.S. Tax  Court within 90 days.  If IRS received a response that took issue with IRS\u2019s  assessment, the examiner would then determine whether the response was  sufficient to support the taxpayer\u2019s original tax return.

The initiative addresses:  reducing the backlog of pending EITC examinations to ensure that  eligible taxpayers whose returns are being examined receive their  refunds quickly;   minimizing burden and enhancing the quality of communications with  taxpayers by improving the existing audit process;   encouraging eligible taxpayers to claim the EITC by increasing outreach  efforts and making the requirements for claiming the credit easier to  understand;   ensuring fairness by refocusing compliance efforts on taxpayers who  claimed the credit, but were ineligible because their income was too  high (or filing status was incorrect); and  piloting a certification effort to substantiate qualifying child residency  eligibility for claimants whose returns are associated with a high risk of  error.", "Of the $52 million budgeted, IRS reported spending or obligating   $51.8 million in fiscal year 2004.  Of that, IRS officials said they spent about  $17.5 million on the tests---$7.4 million was spent on the income  misreporting test, $5.6 million on the filing status test, and $4.5 million on  the qualifying child test.  IRS officials noted that, in some cases, the  amounts they reported spending differed from what they budgeted.  For  example, IRS originally budgeted $7.2 million on the filing status test, but  reported spending $5.6 million on direct costs for that test.", "According to IRS officials, they spent about $3.2 million less than  anticipated on the tests primarily because some planned work did not  materialize.  For example, for the filing status test, IRS originally planned to  work more cases but about 10,000 taxpayers who were originally selected  for the filing status test were not included for various reasons, such as they  did not claim the EITC.

The income misreporting  test cases were worked in three locations\u2014Atlanta, Georgia; Fresno,  California; and Austin, Texas.  IRS officials said they did not believe there  would be a consistency problem in having the income misreporting test  conducted across these locations because the test was not a significant  departure from the general AUR work that had been done in these  locations for the past several years.  Other examples of steps IRS took to  ensure consistent decision-making by examiners included holding multiple  team meetings with staff, sending out notices to staff when errors were  noted, having certain groups work only certain kinds of cases, preparing a  job aid for examiners, and conducting extensive quality reviews.   According to IRS managers and examiners we spoke with, these steps  helped examiners make consistent decisions in the cases they were  reviewing.", "Another step IRS took to ensure consistency was to have managers in  Kansas City review all those cases where taxpayers provided  substantiation for the qualifying child test prior to filing their tax return\u2014a  total of about 800 reviews. This review helped IRS identify and correct  problems that arose early in the tests. IRS officials stated that the review  helped provide for a smooth implementation because it identified  problems, which IRS corrected, and enabled IRS to issue supplemental  guidance to ensure repeat errors did not occur.

Other examiners  interpreted this same information to mean July 1 through December 1,  therefore not giving taxpayers the time needed to qualify their child.

For example, although IRS had previously asked taxpayers to  provide documents substantiating their qualifying child upon audit, IRS has  not previously allowed taxpayers to provide affidavits to prove their claim;  therefore, examiners had never reviewed such documents.  In contrast, IRS  considers the filing status and income misreporting tests expansions of  existing IRS programs.", "Examples of problems and IRS\u2019s actions to address them include:   Early in the implementation of the test, some examiners advised  taxpayers who had called about letters received from IRS to complete  documentation for the qualifying child test even though they were  selected for the filing status test.  Examiners were instructed via an e- mail alert to use the EICPC database to determine the test for which the  taxpayer was selected.", "Some qualifying child and filing status case files (paper and electronic)  had documentation deficiencies, such as not getting a taxpayer\u2019s phone  number for the case file or not obtaining complete/required information  for cases where the taxpayer agreed with IRS\u2019s proposed changes.   Through an e-mail alert, IRS officials reminded examiners of the  procedures they must follow to properly document files.", "Some files were missing for the qualifying child and filing status tests.

Some important information  about all three tests, including a key policy decision regarding the filing  status test, were either not well documented or not documented at all.   Internal control standards state that significant decisions and events  should be documented and readily available for examination.  When  documentation is lacking, it is difficult for management or staff to gain an  understanding of the program, refine work processes, or fully monitor the  implementation.  Further, developing and documenting such information  would help ensure that test results are accurately determined and would  enable others to review the methodology.", "IRS developed various management documents to organize, direct, and  monitor the test operations. However, while some important decisions  about the tests were made after these documents were developed and after  test implementation began, IRS did not explain the decisions by making  additions to the documents.  For example, IRS\u2019s initial plan required that  the filing status subtest involving taxpayers who had never filed as married,  but had filed as head of household on their 2003 return, include 5,000  taxpayers.  Several months later, IRS reduced the sample to 500, but did not  document the rationale for this decision until much later and at our  request.  Also, certain other key information, such as when and how  information from a third- party locator service for the filing status test  would be used, was not fully developed or sufficiently detailed.  The  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found similar  deficiencies in IRS\u2019s documentation about the tests occurring during  implementation.  As a result, this lack of documentation hindered not only  test monitoring and oversight, but also did not foster a common  understanding of the tests.", "According to IRS officials, time or other priorities caused some significant  decisions about the test not to be documented at the time those decisions  were made.  Further, they said that changes to tests are common during  implementation and that they focused attention on ensuring the tests were  carried out correctly, rather than on documenting the reasons for changes  and other decisions as the tests proceeded.  However, IRS officials  acknowledged that documenting significant events was important.", "In some correspondence to taxpayers about the tests, IRS referred  taxpayers to LITCs or walk-in sites for assistance. However, IRS did not  gather information on or measure the level or quality of assistance  provided to test participants at LITCs or walk-in sites.  IRS officials said  they did not collect these data because they thought taxpayer use of this  assistance would be minimal and there was no practical or cost effective  way to gather the information.  In his response to our draft report, the  Commissioner echoed this sentiment, noting that because qualifying child  test participants were randomly selected from around the country, efforts  to measure services would be extremely difficult.  Further, IRS officials did  not view this as an implementation problem, but instead viewed it as a  limitation of the tests.  Whether it is a problem with implementation or test  design, there are some important reasons why it would be useful to know  the level and quality of services provided.  For example, our prior work  found that the quality of service IRS walk-in sites provided taxpayers was  unknown. Further, face-to-face assistance is costly, especially when  compared to telephone services, which were used extensively in the 2004  tests.  Recognizing that options for providing taxpayer assistance and  outreach efforts are important, if IRS had data on the level and quality of  service provided, it would be in a better position to determine the cost and  benefit of providing this assistance.

IRS officials told us that their modifications to letters and forms for  the qualifying child and filing status tests to be used for the 2005 tests were  primarily based on case file reviews and discussions with IRS examiners  who interacted with the taxpayers selected for the 2004 tests.  In April 2004,  for example, EITC program officials reviewed case files and met with  examiners to discuss common taxpayer errors and questions about letters  and forms for the qualifying child and filing status tests.  Examples of  taxpayer questions were: \u201cHow do I prove I did not live with my spouse?\u201d  or \u201cWho can fill out the affidavit?\u201d Examples of taxpayer errors on forms  included no signature, incomplete dates to prove residency, and either no  Social Security number listed on the form or an incorrect number.  As a  result of their review, IRS officials revised the forms containing such  information (Form 8836, Qualifying Children Residency Statement and the  accompanying affidavit).  For example, IRS changed the layout of the  affidavit to help reduce taxpayer errors involving dates and the amount of  time a child resided with the taxpayer.  IRS did not make changes to the  letters and forms for the income misreporting test because they were the  same ones used under the general AUR program.", "Improvements to key database based on examiner suggestions.   Examiners in Kansas City, the site responsible for the qualifying child and  filing status cases, suggested about 30 updates or other improvements to  the EICPC system that they said would either reduce errors in the  database, help IRS better manage the cases and workload, or improve  subsequent data analyses. For example, examiners noted they were lacking  computer fields to record certain information such as the taxpayer\u2019s  telephone number, whether the case was worked by the Taxpayer  Advocate\u2019s Office, or if an amended return had been received. As a result,  examiners suggested ways to capture these data, which have been  incorporated into the EICPC.  IRS is continuing to update and make  improvements to the EICPC.", "Use of automated telephone voice response expanded.  For the fiscal  year 2004 qualifying child and filing status tests, IRS did not use automated  responses to answer routine telephone calls and did not have a mechanism  in place to obtain taxpayers\u2019 views about telephone services provided.   Both options were available for the income misreporting test and are  available for users of IRS\u2019s other toll-free telephone numbers.  Officials  recognized that commonly asked questions, such as \u201cWhere do I mail the  required documentation?\u201d or \u201cWho can sign an affidavit?\u201d could be  answered via automated responses, and plan to provide this option for the  fiscal year 2005 tests, leaving only the more difficult questions to be  answered by an examiner.   IRS also decided to implement a random  feedback survey of taxpayers on the quality of service they received for the  qualifying child and filing status tests when they called the toll-free number.   The survey is a modified version of the one that IRS uses for its regular toll- free telephone operations.", "Changes made to the qualifying child test encourage early  certification and simulate implementation across the country.  There  are two major changes to the qualifying child test for 2005: (1) taxpayers  will be encouraged to certify in advance of filing their return that their child  met the EITC residency requirement; and (2) a portion of the taxpayers will  be drawn from a single community\u2014Hartford, Connecticut, while the rest  will be drawn randomly from across the nation.", "IRS officials contend that an early certification could help reduce delays in  releasing EITC refunds because examiners would be able to validate cases  before the start of the tax filing season when workloads reach their peak.   Eligible taxpayers who provide acceptable documentation before the start  of the tax filing season could get their EITC refund more expeditiously, IRS  officials say, because the documentation would already be validated at the  time taxpayers file their tax returns.  IRS has some evidence that taxpayers  are willing to certify in advance of the filing season because about 800  taxpayers did so as part of the 2004 qualifying child test, even though they  were only asked to do so when filing their returns.", "Regarding the targeting of the single Hartford, Connecticut community, IRS  officials told us that they intend to simulate what might happen if an early  certification requirement were imposed across the country.  This change  was the result of a recommendation from a contractor\u2019s review of the 2004  test\u2019s sampling methodology.  As part of this test, IRS plans to mount an  outreach campaign to include partnering with local governmental and  community-based entities to provide taxpayers assistance.", "Need for refinement prompts reduction in filing status sample size.  Based on its experience with the sample selected for the 2004 filing status  test, IRS decided to dramatically reduce the sample size for next year\u2019s test,  while simultaneously trying to improve the criteria for selecting the  sample.  As this year\u2019s test was implemented, IRS officials realized that the  test was yielding a high number of taxpayers claiming the correct filing  status, suggesting that the criteria for selecting them could be improved  and the burden on taxpayers to prove their filing status was high, relative to  the benefits gained.  As a result, IRS officials reduced the sample size from  36,000 to 5,000 for the 2005 test to minimize taxpayer burden as IRS works  to improve the selection criteria.", "IRS also is testing two refinements in the sample selection criteria for the  2005 filing status tests to determine whether the selection criteria can be  improved.  First, IRS plans to apply TIGTA\u2019s finding, which IRS officials  said that they had also identified, that IRS could better use information it  possesses to verify the filing status of some taxpayers, such as those whose  spouses have died or those who have submitted an amended return.  Any  such taxpayers whose filing status could be verified using such information  would not be included in the sample.  Second, IRS also plans to refine the  sample selection to not include taxpayers whose filing status of single or  head of household can be corroborated by information from the third-party  locator service, which was tested in 2004.", "Income misreporting changes designed to improve sample selection.   IRS has planned minimal changes for the 2005 income misreporting test  because it found few issues that needed to be addressed.  Changes were  made to selection criteria to help identify cases with a potentially higher  assessment amount.

Such plans help (1) ensure that the agency has  addressed the principal aspects of the evaluation, including the research  design, outcome measures, target and sample populations, data collection  activities, analyses, and dissemination of results, (2) officials monitor  changes to tests and assess the impact of those changes on the planned  evaluations, and (3) facilitate management and stakeholder review.  Having  comprehensive and detailed evaluation plans helps ensure that all those  working directly on the evaluation have a common understanding of how  data will be collected, analyzed and impacts assessed.  Concerns or  weaknesses can be identified and corrected, and plans can be updated to  reflect any changes during implementation and afterwards, as the  evaluation plan could be considered to be a \u201cliving document.\u201d   Finally, a  well-developed plan helps ensure that evaluation results can be  communicated with appropriate recognition of the evaluation\u2019s strengths  and limitations so stakeholders can better understand how to use the  results when making decisions.", "The following are illustrations of the overall lack of detail and  documentation in IRS\u2019s evaluation plans for the 2004 tests.", "Evaluation objectives were not documented in one place.", "Although we found that IRS\u2019s evaluation plans had objectives linked to  the test goals, the objectives were not identified in any single location  for any of the three tests nor specifically identified as objectives.  Thus,  we pieced together the information from multiple sources, including  interviews with IRS officials.  For example, we had difficulty identifying  the evaluation objectives pertaining to the use of the third-party locator  service for the filing status test.", "Key outcome measures lacked important detail.  IRS\u2019s evaluation  plans lacked important information for all the key outcome measures,  such as their definition and purpose, formula/methodology, data source  and collection method.  For example, IRS\u2019s evaluation plans for the  qualifying child test did not identify the specific data that would be used  to produce the outcome measure\u2014the number of taxpayers who claim  (or do not claim) the EITC. IRS has provided this type of information  about its measures for other programs.  For example, for its telephone  and other operations, IRS annually prepares a comprehensive document  known as a data dictionary, which includes items such as the definition  and purpose of the measure and its formula/methodology. IRS officials  agreed that providing such information in the evaluation plans could  have been valuable in managing the EITC tests. Without knowing details  on outcome measures, stakeholders do not have enough information  about a measure to know whether it is valid and reliable.", "Limited information was provided on planned analyses.  The  evaluation plans also lacked specificity with regard to the key analyses  planned and what those analyses were intended to accomplish.  For  example, IRS conducted a survey to obtain information about a  taxpayer\u2019s experience with the qualifying child test.  IRS originally  planned to survey these taxpayers in April 2004.  The survey was not  conducted until September 2004, primarily due to delays in selecting a  contractor and developing the survey instrument.  The 5-month delay  may substantially reduce the number of taxpayers who accurately  remembered the actions they took and thus affect the quality of the  responses (i.e., recall bias).  The accuracy of individuals\u2019 survey  responses declines the further away those responses are from the date  of the actual events.  IRS and the contractor are aware that such recall  bias could exist and stated that they will consider it when analyzing the  survey results, but no detail was available on how they would do so.   This is critical because the potential utility of the survey results could be  in question.", "The lack of detail in IRS\u2019s evaluation plans also increased the risk that  reports disseminating the results of the tests would not fully disclose the  evaluations\u2019 potential limitations.  In its August status report to Congress,  IRS did not make clear that the qualifying child test results could only be  generalized to taxpayers IRS had reason to believe were most likely to  make an erroneous claim for the EITC when filing for the EITC in 2002.   Absent such clarity, stakeholders might incorrectly assume that test results  apply to all taxpayers claiming qualifying children for the EITC.  Also, IRS  did not describe potential limitations of the outcome measures,  specifically, how non-respondents would be accounted for in measure  calculations.", "IRS officials recognize that their final 2005 report will need to include  information on the evaluation limitations, and expect to provide sufficient  detail and explanation of limitations in that report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluation Plans for 2005 Tests Not Completed Before Two of the Tests Began", "paragraphs": ["As of early December 2004, IRS had not completed evaluation plans for the  2005 testing, even though the qualifying child and income misreporting  tests began in November.  According to IRS officials, they had not yet  completed an evaluation plan for the 2005 tests because final decisions  about the testing were still being deliberated in October.  In their view, it  was less important to finish an evaluation plan for these tests by the time  testing began, because IRS could use the 2004 evaluation plans in the  interim.  IRS officials acknowledge that evaluation plans are important and  have started to develop them for the 2005 tests.", "IRS can build upon the 2004 evaluation plans for all three tests.  However,  IRS made substantial changes for the qualifying child and filing status tests,  which would need to be taken into account in developing comprehensive  and detailed evaluation plans for the 2005 tests.

IRS\u2019s three tests\u2014qualifying child certification, filing status, and income  misreporting\u2014are major initiatives to reduce overclaims by addressing the  leading errors taxpayers make.  Given the importance of the EITC to many  low-income households and concerns about high overclaims, these tests  are being closely watched by numerous stakeholders.", "Although IRS has generally implemented each of the tests smoothly, it did  not fully document some key management decisions and other significant  events.  Documentation supports a common understanding among staff  about the program they are administering\u2014particularly one as complicated  as the EITC\u2014and helps managers monitor whether a program is  implemented as planned.  Having adequate documentation during the 2005  tests could help foster a better understanding of the tests, ensure results  are accurately determined, and facilitate review and oversight.  In addition,  while IRS told taxpayers selected for the qualifying child test they could  visit various physical locations for assistance, including LITCs and IRS  walk-in sites, IRS did not collect information from those sites to determine  the level and quality of services provided.  Because officials believe  relatively few taxpayers used these sites, collecting information from the  sites may not have been practical.  However, the single city simulation of  nationwide implementation may offer an opportunity to gather some  information on these services.", "The evaluations that IRS is conducting of each test are likely to yield some  useful information and results that will help IRS officials and other  stakeholders judge whether and how to proceed with further  implementation of the new approaches to reducing EITC overclaims.
