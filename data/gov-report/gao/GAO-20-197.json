Acquisition planning. DHA defined the contract requirements\u2014the  work to be performed by the contractor\u2014and developed an  acquisition plan to meet those requirements. The T-2017 program  manager and contracting officer developed key acquisition  documents\u2014including the T-2017 Acquisition Strategy and the  Acquisition Plan\u2014and conducted market research. The T-2017  Acquisition Strategy provides a high-level description of the  milestones in the acquisition process and how those milestones will  be achieved. The T-2017 Acquisition Plan outlines the specific actions  necessary to execute the approach outlined in the approved  acquisition strategy.  2.  Request for proposals. DHA issued an RFP that documented the  requirements for T-2017\u2014including the contract type, significant  contract dates, pricing arrangements, and the criteria to be used to  assess offerors\u2019 proposals.  3.  Award. DHA established a source selection team to evaluate the  proposals received in response to the RFP. The source selection  authority selects the winning proposals using a best value tradeoff  process after considering reports written by other members of the  source selection team.  4.  Post-Award Activities. DHA provides a 12-month transition period  between its outgoing and incoming contractors to ensure that its  incoming contractors are prepared for their new responsibilities. The  transition period for the T-2017 contracts began on January 1, 2017,  and ended on December 31, 2017.

DHA  officials explained that their leadership prioritized the continuation of  beneficiary services during the T-2017 planning process over making  significant changes to contract requirements that could potentially be  disruptive. We found that some of the changes that were made to the T- 2017 contracts are consistent with specific provisions and themes we  identified in prior NDAA legislation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Changes to the T- 2017 Contracts Are Consistent with Specific NDAA 2017 Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Although the NDAA 2017 was enacted after the T-2017 contracts had  been awarded, some of the contract changes for T-2017 may be  consistent with specific provisions outlined in section 705(c)(1), such as  provisions related to improving access to care, health outcomes, health  care quality, beneficiaries\u2019 experience, as well as lowering health care  costs. However, DHA officials stated that because health care delivery  under the T-2017 contracts began in 2018, it is too early to measure any  benefits from these changes. These contract changes include (1) the  consolidation of contract regions, (2) the combining of administrative  costs, and (3) the introduction of new contract incentives.  1.  Consolidation of contract regions. While DHA awarded the T-3  contracts for three regions (West, South, and North), it consolidated  two of the regions (North and South) for the T-2017 contracts (see  figure 2).", "By eliminating the additional regional contract, DHA anticipates a savings  of approximately $25 million a year in overhead and management costs.  In addition, beneficiaries are less likely to have a disruption in care when  moving. For example, beneficiaries who moved between the former North  and South regions would now stay enrolled with the same contractor in  the larger East region.  2.  Combined administrative costs. For T-2017, DHA combined all  administrative costs in one contract line item in order to lower total  cost of care. For example, under the T-3 contracts, DHA reimbursed  the contractors for processing individual claims with a higher rate for  paper claims and a lower rate for electronic claims. Without a  difference in costs for T-2017, contractors are incentivized to lower  their costs and prioritize electronic claims, which DHA officials say are  more efficient.  3.  Contract incentives. DHA incorporated incentives into the T-2017  contracts to encourage contractors to negotiate reimbursement rate  discounts with network providers in order to reduce health care costs.  The T-2017 contracts state that the contractor must meet a required  discount rate on care provided by network providers. If this discount  rate is not met, DOD will offset the discount deficit amount from the  next payment due to the contractor. DHA expects that negative  incentive will reduce health care costs and result in government  savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Contract Changes Are Consistent with Acquisition Themes in Prior NDAA Legislation", "paragraphs": ["We also found examples of changes to the contract or acquisition process  for T-2017 that are consistent with selected acquisition themes we  identified in prior NDAA legislation. These acquisition themes are 1)  leveraging commercial best practices, 2) promoting competition, and 3)  focusing on value. We previously reported that the identified acquisition  themes can reduce costs and increase value for the government.  1.  Leveraging commercial best practices: T-2017 required  contractors to increase utilization of commercial best practices,  including the use of automation technology to process referrals and  authorizations, episodes of care, and procedure diagnosis coding. As  we have previously reported, federal agencies can leverage  commercial best practices to lower costs and maximize the value of  the services they buy. According to DHA officials, adapting  automation technology already in use in the health care industry  should improve the quality of services, beneficiary satisfaction, and  result in cost savings to the government. In addition, officials from one  of the current TRICARE contractors stated that the T-2017 RFP was  structured to incentivize contractors to innovate and bring best  practices from their industry experience in both the commercial sector  and other government programs, such as Medicare. For example, the  T-2017 contract included a new requirement for contractors to use  industry best practices when collecting health care data, in order to  identify and reduce gaps in care and enhance quality of care for  beneficiaries.  2.  Promoting competition: We found that DHA made an effort to  promote competition for the T-2017 RFP. Competitive contracts can  result in cost savings for the federal government and promote  accountability for results. In the acquisition planning phase, DHA  identified an increased number of interested contractors through  market research, from eight for T-3 to 22 for T-2017. In addition, DHA  officials stated that they took steps during the acquisition planning  process to ensure that the incumbent contractors did not have a  significant advantage over prospective contractors. For example, the  T-2017 contracting officer was assigned early in the planning process  and did not participate in management of the T-3 contracts or in  interactions with the incumbent contractors. DHA officials stated that  they expected greater contractor interest in the East region because  the larger beneficiary population of that region would result in a more  valuable contract. However, DHA received a total of seven proposals  each for T-3 and T-2017, including one new company that participated  in T-2017 but had not previously submitted a proposal for T-3.  3.  Focusing on value: We found that DHA\u2019s approach for T-2017  emphasizes value and quality, not just lower costs. Specifically, DHA  focused on the value of improving health care by considering the total  cost of care over time, rather than the cost of individual health care.  This is reflected in the T-2017 Acquisition Strategy, which prioritizes  quality and delivery of health care above lowest cost. For example,  the T-2017 contracts required additional preventive screenings and  diseases covered under a chronic care program to achieve improved  quality of care despite the cost of screenings. We have previously  reported that these preventive health services are determined to be  cost-effective when they improve the benefit (e.g., health outcomes) in  a less costly way than a given alternative care option. Some  preventive services may also result in cost savings, where the cost of  implementing the service is less than the expected future costs to  treat a disease or condition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHA Has Implemented Two Value-Based Incentive Pilots; Other Pilots Are Planned", "paragraphs": ["As of October 2019, DHA had implemented two of the three value-based  pilots described in its January 2018 report to Congress, which outlines the  department\u2019s plans for addressing the NDAA 2017\u2019s requirement for  developing value-based incentive programs. Specifically, in this report,  DHA described its intent to implement three value-based pilots in  response to section 705(a) of the NDAA 2017\u2014(1) the Performance- Based Maternity Payments Pilot, (2) the Medication Adherence Pilot, and  (3) the High-Value Primary Care Provider Pilot\u2014through modifications to  its TRICARE contracts over the next 6 to 18 months.  1.  Performance-Based Maternity Payments Pilot. DHA modified its T- 2017 contracts to begin implementing the Performance-Based  Maternity Payments Pilot in April 2018. This pilot was designed to  provide both non-financial and financial incentives to hospitals that  achieve and maintain excellence in maternity care quality. The first  phase of this pilot focused on non-financial incentives by promoting  greater transparency about the quality of maternity care delivered by  hospitals in the TRICARE network. Specifically, DHA implemented a  \u201csteerage model\u201d that identifies higher-performing hospitals in the  managed care support contractors\u2019 provider directories using specific  visual prompts in order to encourage beneficiaries to seek care from  those institutions. The second phase of the pilot began in October  2018 and incorporated performance-based payments, or financial  incentives, for network hospitals that achieve a certain level of  performance on specified maternity care quality measures. The  anticipated end date for the pilot is March 2021.  2.  Medication Adherence Pilot. DHA modified its TRICARE pharmacy  contracts to begin implementing the Medication Adherence Pilot in  February 2018. This pilot is designed to incentivize beneficiaries\u2019  adherence to medication regimens by reducing or eliminating  copayments for two medications (one for diabetes and another for  cardiovascular-related illnesses).  3.  High-Value Primary Care Provider Pilot. As of October 2019, DHA  officials told us they were still assessing the feasibility of implementing  the High-Value Primary Care Provider Pilot, which would provide  financial incentives (such as additional payments or reduced network  discounts) to primary care providers who exceed certain quality  thresholds, as well as financial incentives (such as reduced co-shares  and copayments) for beneficiaries who use these providers.", "DHA officials said other value-based efforts are being planned to address  section 705(a) of the NDAA 2017, such as value-based pilots and  demonstrations that aim to incentivize providers to provide quality care\u2014 including hospital, home health, and episode-based bundled payments  pilots, among others.
