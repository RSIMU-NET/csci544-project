Specifically, from October 2012 to October 2013, DOD returned from Afghanistan or destroyed 14,664 vehicles, an average of 1,128 vehicles per month. Future progress toward drawdown goals will depend on equipment turn-in rates, which, in turn, depend on having more information about the post-2014 force level and mission. In addition, over the course of the last 8 months of the above period, the number of vehicles turned in by units for the drawdown averaged 55 percent of what had been forecast. This is because some vehicles that had been forecast for turn-in were instead redistributed to other units in Afghanistan. A senior DOD official stated that units have retained equipment because of uncertainty regarding future operational needs in Afghanistan. Once the post-2014 force level and mission are announced, these vehicle turn-in rates may increase.", "DOD has taken some steps to improve efficiencies and manage costs in its Afghanistan drawdown processes. For example, U.S. Central Command amended its drawdown instruction to allow for aggregation of equipment at U.S. ports. According to DOD officials, this will allow for shipment of equipment via rail, resulting in potential savings when compared with trucking costs. However, due to ineffective internal controls, the Army and Marine Corps may be incurring unnecessary costs by returning equipment that potentially exceeds service needs or is not economical to return and repair. Specifically, GAO found the following:", "In a 12-month period, the Army and Marine Corps returned more than 1,000 potentially unneeded vehicles, thereby incurring estimated transportation costs of up to $107,400 per vehicle, depending on the type of vehicle.

To examine the status of the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) efforts to reduce equipment in Afghanistan, we  identified drawdown goals and key sources of documentation.  Specifically, we identified and analyzed the processes and facilities that  support CENTCOM in the execution of the drawdown and examined  guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of  Staff, CENTCOM, U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), military  departments and services, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). We  then examined the metrics used by drawdown decision makers, reviewed  Afghanistan drawdown statistics, and compared these statistics with  DOD\u2019s drawdown goals.", "To analyze the steps DOD has taken to create efficiencies and consider  costs concerning the return of equipment from Afghanistan, we obtained  and analyzed standard operating procedures and other guidance used to  return equipment from Afghanistan and interviewed officials familiar with  the transportation of equipment out of Afghanistan. To determine the  extent to which the services have taken steps in their disposition decision- making process to consider costs related to the return of equipment, we  reviewed equipment-management guidance and interviewed service  equipment managers. We focused our review on vehicles because of the  costs associated with transporting them, the number of vehicles that are  candidates for disposition, and the ability to track vehicles by identification  number. We also focused our review on theater-provided equipment or  nonunit equipment that will be repaired. In addition, we focused our  review to include only the Army and the Marine Corps since these  services have owned the preponderance of equipment in Afghanistan.  We examined the factors and data used by decision makers who issued  disposition instructions, and analyzed the results of those decisions.  Specifically, we examined service inventories and approved acquisition  objectives\u2014the amount of equipment needed by the services for  peacetime and wartime requirements\u2014used by equipment managers to  make disposition decisions. To determine the service-approved  acquisition objective for any specific item, we relied on the databases  used by service officials to manage the relevant equipment. These data,  along with the disposition decision and inventory data, were used to  determine how many vehicles were returned that exceeded approved  acquisition objectives. Specifically, to determine whether an item that  exceeded its approved acquisition objective was returned from mid-March  2012 to mid-March 2013, we conducted one analysis for the Army and  one for the Marine Corps. For the Army, its equipment-management  officials determined which types of rolling stock exceeded service- approved acquisition objectives. We then took a list of these types of  rolling stock that the Army personnel had identified and compared this list  to data that the Army provided that contained the service\u2019s disposition  decisions regarding rolling stock or vehicles in Afghanistan from mid- March 2012 to mid-March 2013. For the Marine Corps analysis,  equipment-management officials provided us with approved acquisition  data and inventory data from fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013. We  then compared the inventory to the approved acquisition objective for  both years to identify the types of vehicles that exceeded the approved  acquisition objective. We took this list of the types of vehicles and then  compared it to data that the Marine Corps provided that contained the  service\u2019s disposition decisions regarding rolling stock or vehicles in  Afghanistan from mid-March 2012 to mid-March 2013.", "To determine the results of each service\u2019s equipment disposition  decisions, we obtained and reviewed data containing approximately  10,000 disposition decisions made by the Army and Marine Corps over a  12-month period. Of these decisions, roughly 87 percent resulted in the  return of vehicles to the United States (the remaining 13 percent resulted  in either the return of the vehicles to a site outside of the United States or  the transfer or destruction of vehicles in country). Because our second  objective is related to the return of equipment, we focused our analysis on  these approximately 9,000 vehicle-return decisions. Moreover, we chose  the 12-month period spanning mid-March 2012 to mid-March 2013  because by that time each service had several months\u2019 experience in  drawing down its equipment.", "We also examined the transportation costs of returning these vehicles. To  estimate the costs of returning equipment, we used the rates  TRANSCOM charges the military services for representative types of  equipment. We surveyed the organizations responsible for maintaining  the databases in order to determine the reliability of the data. From these  efforts, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  determining how many vehicles were returned that exceeded approved  acquisition objectives. To obtain additional information for our review, we  contacted or interviewed officials from the", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology", "CENTCOM;", "U.S. Forces-Afghanistan;", "TRANSCOM;", "Surface Deployment and Distribution Command;", "Headquarters, Department of the Army;", "U.S. Army Materiel Command;", "U.S. Army Sustainment Command;", "U.S. Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command;", "U.S. Marine Corps/Installations and Logistics;", "U.S. Marine Corps Logistics Command;", "U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command;", "Headquarters, U.S. Navy;", "Headquarters, U.S. Air Force/Equipment Management Branch; and  and Logistics;  Joint Staff;  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services  We conducted this performance audit from January 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "Background  The Army has stated that  equipment will not be  abandoned in Afghanistan. To  assist units in processing  equipment for return and  arranging proper disposition, the  Army\u2019s 401st Army Field  Support Brigade operates seven  RPAT facilities. Army officials  told us that each site has at  least 20 acres and is equipped  to prepare equipment to meet  international and U.S. customs  standards. RPAT yards process  equipment that is excess to  needs in theater and also  handle equipment that is battle- damaged or declared as a battle  loss. As seen below in figure 4,  the Bagram and Khandahar  yards account for more than 60  percent of the in-country RPAT  capacity.", "Army Redistribution Property Assistance Teams (RPAT) operate facilities  in Afghanistan to process equipment, including vehicles and non-rolling  stock, for return to the United States. Units leaving Afghanistan bring  equipment that is no longer needed in Afghanistan to an RPAT yard to be  processed for return. After turn-in, it can take on average 29 days for non- rolling stock and 60 days for vehicles to be processed for shipment. As a  result, there is about a 2-month delay from turn-in to the final processing  of vehicles. Because all nonunit equipment must go through RPAT yard  processing before shipment, efficient RPAT operations are critical for the  transport of equipment out of Afghanistan. Further, to meet future  drawdown demand, it is likely that RPAT processing throughput will have  to increase from existing levels (see fig. 3).", "RPAT processing capacity may become a limiting factor for the  Afghanistan drawdown. Army officials stated that RPAT facilities in  Afghanistan have the capacity to process more than 1,000 vehicles per  month. However, they have tested the upper limits of this capacity in only  3 months of a 20-month period (see fig. 3). Officials further stated that  they have not reached their capacities due to the limited rate of equipment  turn-in. Going forward, we note that simultaneous unit moves, base  closures, and other events may result in turn-in levels that exceed the  capacity of the facilities. Moreover, RPAT capacity is also a function of  space availability and the efficiency with which equipment can be moved  out of a yard. This efficiency depends on the ability of units to forecast  what equipment will be turned in as well as the ability of the transportation  system to move the equipment. From March 2012 to October 2013,  average transportation wait times were 44 days for vehicles and 19 days  for containers. In the future, RPAT output could be limited by the  scheduling of transportation assets and the availability of lines of  communication.", "Background  In the drawdown from Iraq, the  majority of equipment was  processed and returned through a  nearby port in Kuwait. Due to the  landlocked geography of  Afghanistan and the challenging  political environment in Central  Asia, TRANSCOM must rely on  multiple routes and modes of  transportation for the return of  equipment from Afghanistan.", "U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) has established 18 surface,  airlift, and multimodal airlift routes for the return of equipment from  Afghanistan. The Pakistan Ground Lines of Communication (PAKGLOC),  terminating at the port of Karachi, is the least expensive route out of  Afghanistan. To the north, the Northern Distribution Network (NDN)  broadly comprises three land routes terminating at several seaports: one  through Central Asia into the South Caucasus; one through Uzbekistan,  Kazakhstan, and Russia that ends in the Baltic states; and one through  Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Russia that also ends in the  Baltic states. These routes have limitations concerning the kinds of  equipment that can be transported through them, and availability is subject  to geopolitical complexities. For example, the PAKGLOC remained closed  for 8 months from 2011 to 2012 and did not become operational until  March 2013. Only about 4 percent of equipment return shipments flow  through the NDN, but the NDN routes proved critical for inbound cargo  during the PAKGLOC closure (see fig. 5). Airlift and multimodal movement  (air and sea) reduce the amount of time needed to return equipment, but  are substantially more expensive.", "Route limitations will affect cost and time required for equipment  reduction. Transportation officials told us that when demands for return of  equipment increase in late 2013 and early 2014, it is unlikely that the  PAKGLOC will be able to fully support the demand. Officials stated that  equipment return may continue for some time after December 2014 due to  the volume of equipment remaining and the limited availability of assets  and capabilities to move it. Officials also anticipate that the physical limits  of transportation routes such as aerial port capacities could present a  constraint in the drawdown. TRANSCOM officials cautioned that, in the  future, it is possible that the volume of equipment to be returned could  exceed the capacity of the system.", "Background  There are two types of transfers  of equipment in the Afghanistan  drawdown: those associated  with a base closure and those  independent of a base closure.", "Subject to limitations, equipment  in Afghanistan may be  transferred within DOD and to  other federal agencies, U.S.  states, foreign countries, and  other recipients.", "For transfers to Afghanistan  through the Foreign Excess  Personal Property program,  DOD has issued guidance  establishing who can approve  the transfer of certain equipment  by cost threshold. Transfers are  coordinated with the U.S.  Embassy team.", "Equipment in Afghanistan that U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)  determines to be no longer needed in the region and that the services and  Department of Defense (DOD) want to divest is either destroyed or  transferred to another U.S. agency, to U.S. states, to Afghanistan, to  another country, or to certain organizations. A number of factors are used  to determine whether equipment used in Afghanistan will be transferred,  including whether the equipment is in good condition; the needs of the  receiving organization or government; the ability of the recipient to sustain  the equipment; and the need to maintain critical timelines for base  closures and transfer actions. According to Army and Marine Corps  forecasts, the amount of equipment in Afghanistan that will be divested  (transferred or destroyed) is limited, and the majority will be returned (see  fig. 6). The ability to transfer equipment minimizes the need for in-country  destruction and could also avoid transportation charges when equipment  is not returned to the United States. In fiscal year 2012, the Army  estimated that transfers of excess equipment in Afghanistan resulted in  the avoidance of at least $1.2 billion in return transportation costs.", "Transfer will be a limited option for the reduction of the equipment in  Afghanistan. According to CENTCOM officials, they have sufficient  authorities to transfer equipment to Afghanistan, surrounding countries,  and coalition partners. However, while DOD has been able to transfer  equipment such as heaters and air conditioners to Afghanistan, it faces  challenges in transferring more advanced equipment due to Afghanistan\u2019s  limitations in absorbing and maintaining these items. Equipment used in  Afghanistan can also be transferred to U.S. state and local government  agencies, but these transfers may be limited by agencies\u2019 having to  arrange and fund the transportation of the equipment out of Afghanistan.  In addition, Army officials said they may transfer some equipment once it  has been returned to the United States. This transfer would occur after  transportation costs have been paid through Overseas Contingency  Operations funds.", "Background  The functions of DLA Disposition  Services include reutilizing end  items, selling or donating surplus  property, managing disposal of  hazardous property, and  coordinating the precious metals  recovery program. DLA Central\u2019s  area of responsibility includes  Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq, as  well as other Gulf States. Within  Afghanistan, it operates facilities  at Bagram, Kandahar, Camp  Leatherneck, and Camp John  Pratt, as well as at several other  sites. Protocols are in place to  prevent the destruction of  serviceable items unless  specifically authorized.", "If the services choose to divest an item in Afghanistan, it is either  transferred or destroyed (demilitarized). The Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA) Disposition Services has established procedures and facilities  within Afghanistan to demilitarize the equipment. Demilitarization is the act  of destroying the military offensive or defensive capabilities inherent in  certain types of equipment or materiel. Demilitarization can be effected  through mutilation, dumping at sea, scrapping, melting, burning, or  alteration designed to prevent the further use of the equipment and  materiel for its originally intended military or lethal purpose.  Demilitarization applies equally to materiel in unserviceable or serviceable  condition that has been screened and declared excess to Department of  Defense (DOD) needs.", "DLA Disposition Services charges the coalition forces on a per pound  basis for the services necessary to demilitarize an item and is currently  charging about 28 to 31 cents per pound. The price is generally based on  defraying the costs of overhead and operations, and it also considers that  sale of resulting scrap material will yield a certain amount of revenue.  Because this is a working capital fund operation, the military services pay  a rate adjusted proportionally for the amount of the service they receive.  Table 2 compares the price of demilitarizing listed items with the cost of  transporting the items to the Gulf Coast of the United States.", "Potential Future Challenges   Space could be a limiting factor at DLA Disposition Services  demilitarization facilities in Afghanistan. A senior DLA Disposition Services  official said it is conceivable that demand for demilitarization or destruction  could exceed the capacity of facilities. To accommodate demand and flow,  DLA Disposition Services has created some flexibility by reprogramming  personnel from one task to another to match demands. A DLA Disposition  Services official also acknowledged that demilitarization or destruction  operations are likely to continue well after December 2014, noting that  such operations in Iraq continued into 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, individuals who made key  contributions to this report include: Guy LoFaro, Assistant Director;  Carolynn Cavanaugh; Carole Coffey; Timothy DiNapoli; Charles Johnson;  Cale Jones; Larry Junek; Anne McDonough-Hughes; Carol Petersen;  Terry Richardson; Michael Shaughnessy; Amie Steele; Jose Watkins;  Cheryl Weissman; Amanda Weldon; and Steve Woods."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Afghanistan: Key Oversight Issues.
