The $12.5 billion M-ATV is for use in Afghanistan; JLTV is the future replacement for vehicles like the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). GAO was asked to assess (1) DOD's progress in rapidly acquiring and fielding M-ATVs, (2) JLTV's expected features and cost compared to other TWV, and (3) the extent to which the current plans for M-ATV and JLTV are consistent with the services' TWV investment strategies. GAO reviewed documents and held discussions with key officials to determine program strategies, costs, performance, and anticipated features; and compared M-ATV and JLTV plans with service strategies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The M-ATV program has been successful, delivering well-performing vehicles ahead of schedule at an estimated cost of $12.5 billion. No major issues have been identified in testing and early fielding. In developing the M-ATV acquisition strategy, lessons learned from the acquisition of MRAPs in Iraq were applied. Like the earlier MRAPs, the M-ATVs did not require technology development, a key factor in the program's success. As of late August 2010, 7,488 vehicles had been delivered to the government and 4,379 had been fielded to units in Afghanistan. Fielding is expected to be completed in December 2010. The urgent need for these vehicles resulted in their fielding and testing at the same time; however, source selection testing was conducted, and no vehicles were fielded until their safety was verified. Jointly managed by the Army and Marine Corps, JLTV is expected to provide protection levels that are comparable to the M-ATV but without loss of payload or automotive performance. JLTV's acquisition costs are yet to be determined but are expected to be substantial. Unit costs could be over $800,000--somewhat less than M-ATV, with mission equipment making up more than half of the costs. Unlike M-ATV and earlier MRAPs, JLTV has demanding projected requirements that necessitate technological and engineering advances. Key challenges are whether the vehicle can provide the performance and reliability required yet stay within the weight limits for helicopter transport. Difficult tradeoffs in requirements may be necessary. At this point, it is a well-structured program with desirable features like a competitive technology development phase. This phase is scheduled to be completed by late fiscal year 2011, when DOD will decide if the program should enter the engineering and manufacturing development phase. That is the point where JLTV should clearly demonstrate that its projected requirements can be met with available resources. Evidence of that match would include a completed preliminary design review and a technology readiness assessment that shows all technologies to be fully mature. Current plans for M-ATV and JLTV dovetail with the objectives of the most recent Army and Marine Corps investment strategies. The implementation of those strategies, however, will be influenced by (1) the decision to continue producing new HMMWVs, recapitalize the existing HMMWV fleet, or both; (2) long-term funding for MRAP and M-ATV sustainment, and (3) specific cost and capabilities of JLTV. The departmentwide strategy for TWVs that DOD plans to prepare would benefit greatly from the resolution of these issues. To the extent this strategy captures the knowledge gained by the services, the strategy can reconcile the aggregate affordability and other implications of the various tactical wheeled vehicle programs with the competing demands of the department. For example, at this point, the service strategies consider MRAP vehicles to be additive to the force structure, not offsetting quantities of HMMWVs or JLTVs. Any potential offsets between the MRAP vehicles and JLTVs, to the extent they are supported by cost-benefit analyses, could save both acquisition and support costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) ensure that the JLTV program clearly demonstrates a match between requirements and resources; (2) stage the timing of the DOD-wide TWV strategy so that it captures key knowledge; and (3) include in the strategy a cost-benefit analysis that could minimize the collective acquisition and support costs of the various TWV programs, and reduce the risk of unplanned overlap or duplication.

In response, the Marine Corps identified the solution as  the up-armored HMMWV. Over the next 18 months, however, combatant  commanders continued to call for more robust mine-protected vehicles.  The solution to the requirement was the MRAP family of vehicles.", "MRAPs provide warfighters with platforms capable of mitigating the  effects of improvised explosive devices, underbody mines, and small arms  fire threats, which are currently the greatest casualty producers overseas.  The MRAP family of vehicles consists of four categories: Category I for  urban combat missions; Category II for convoy escort, troop transport,  explosive ordinance disposal, and ambulance missions; Category III for  clearing mines and improvised explosive devices; and the M-ATV for small- unit combat and tactical operations in complex and highly restricted rural,  mountainous, and urban areas. The current M-ATV requirement is to  rapidly acquire 8,104 vehicles for use primarily in Afghanistan. Delivery  orders for production were awarded to a single contractor, Oshkosh  Defense. Like the Category I, II, and III variants, vehicles are prepared to  accommodate government-furnished equipment during production at  Oshkosh with government-furnished equipment integrated at the Space  and Naval Warfare Systems Command.", "In 2007, the Army reported that there were approximately  120,000 HMMWVs in use by the services. The Army also reported that the  need for additional armor for current operations, among other things, had  pushed the use of the HMMWV far beyond its original purpose and  capabilities. The effect of this employment, according to the Army, led to  an imbalance in protection, payload, and performance; specifically,    protection: light vehicles required the adoption of supplemental armor;    payload: the supplemental armor reduced the vehicles\u2019 useable payload  (including warfighters, mission equipment, and cargo); and    performance: the supplemental armor degraded mobility, reliability, and  maintainability, decreased fuel efficiency, decreased vehicle stability and  safety, and decreased operational availability.", "The objective of the JLTV program is to address the HMMWV fleet\u2019s  protection, payload, and performance imbalance within a transportable  vehicle.

The vehicle\u2019s weight is driven by the  level of force protection expected from JLTV. Force protection is achieved  with armor and the currently available armor is heavier than desired. JLTV  vehicles are being designed with a basic layer of armor that is integrated  with the chassis and additional armor that is bolted on over that basic  layer of armor. Transportability by rotary winged aircraft is a critical joint  requirement, with the potential that the Marine Corps could withdraw  from the program if rotary wing transport of JLTV is not possible.

The transport  weight differs from the gross vehicle weight in that the add-on armor is  removed prior to transport by aircraft. However, the JLTV program is  concerned that the transport weight may be in excess of the CH-47F\u2019s lift  capacity. In order to meet the weight limit, the services are considering  design and requirement trade-offs. Although a six passenger Category B  vehicle was the original joint priority, the services are now focusing on a  four-passenger vehicle, at least initially. According to program officials,  the technology will not have advanced far enough to make armor light  enough to build a six-passenger vehicle with the needed protection level  and at a transport weight that can be transported by the CH-47F. As a  result, the services are proposing to build a four-passenger vehicle in the  first increment. A six-passenger vehicle is still under consideration by the  Army for the first increment; however, it would not be in the initial  procurement. Progress in armor technology development and  demonstration\u2014and its impact on JLTV force protection and  transportability requirements\u2014will be evaluated throughout the  technology development phase and at the Milestone B review.", "The JLTV requirement for operational availability has been set at               95 percent and is considered a key performance parameter. JLTV  reliability is a key system attribute and is an element within operational  availability. The original technology development requirement was  4,500 mean miles between operational mission failures for the Category B  vehicles and 6,100 miles for the Category A and C variants. This level of  reliability may be aggressive since it is two to three times greater than the  reliability levels for other tactical vehicles. For example, the M-ATV  requirement is 600 miles between failures and at least one version of the  ECV/UAH has a reliability of less than 1,300 miles between failures. If the  JLTV reliability metrics cannot be met, availability will suffer and total  ownership cost, another key system attribute, could increase significantly.  While contractor modeling suggests that JLTV will meet its requirements  at the subcomponent level, program officials remain uncertain. The  services are conducting extensive reliability testing of JLTV prototypes  during the technology development phase. However, according to program  officials, the reliability requirement is up for reconsideration and may need  to be adjusted.

The HMMWV Recapitalization program  converts older utility HMMWVs into upgraded configurations. Begun in  2004, approximately 30,000 vehicles have been recapitalized at a cost of  approximately 35 percent of the value of a new production light-utility  vehicle.

The Marine Corps has a  combined MRAP and M-ATV fleet of about 3,300 vehicles. Both services  acknowledge the potential operating and support costs as a factor that  could affect implementation of their plans. Thus far, most of the cost to  acquire, field, operate, and sustain the M-ATV and the MRAP has been  funded through supplemental appropriations.

With much of it currently funded out of  supplemental appropriations, the services have expressed some concerns  about their ability to fund operations and support costs for TWVs in the  out years within base budget requests. For example, Marine Corps officials  acknowledged that the projected cost to sustain their tactical vehicle fleet  contributed to a decision to reduce the quantities of tactical vehicles by 30  percent over the next few years.

Given the high potential cost of the JLTV, an offset could offer substantial  savings, albeit with potential performance tradeoffs. To illustrate, a             5 percent reduction in JLTV quantities could save nearly $2.5 billion,  assuming a unit cost of $800,000; a 10 percent reduction could save nearly  $5 billion.
