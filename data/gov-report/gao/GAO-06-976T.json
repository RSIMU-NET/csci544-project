At two of these locations--Texas and Arizona--CBP allowed the agents entry into the United States without asking for or inspecting any identification documents. After completing our investigation, we briefed officials from CBP on June 9, 2006. CBP agreed that its officers are not able to identify all forms of counterfeit identification presented at land border crossings and fully supports a new initiative that will require all travelers to present a passport before entering the United States. We did not assess whether this initiative would be effective in preventing terrorists from entering the United States or whether it would fully address the vulnerabilites shown by our work."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss our  investigation of the effectiveness of U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) in screening entrants into the United States at land border  crossings.

At no time did CBP officers  question the authenticity of any of these agents\u2019 identification.  Furthermore, at one of the Washington crossings, agents were able to walk  across the border without passing through any security checkpoints and  without presenting identification. However, at the New York crossing, one  agent was not allowed entry into the United States after presenting as  identification an expired, altered U.S. tourist passport and a counterfeit  driver\u2019s license.

The other carried a counterfeit  Virginia driver\u2019s license and a counterfeit New York birth certificate. As  the agents were about to cross the border, another agent who had crossed  the border earlier using his genuine identification phoned to inform them  that the CBP officer on duty had swiped his Virginia driver\u2019s license  through a scanner.

The agents observed three  CBP officers on duty; one was manning the checkpoint and the other two  were standing a short distance away.

CBP agreed its officers are  not able to identify all forms of counterfeit identification presented at land  border crossings. CBP officials also stated that they fully support the  newly promulgated Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which will  require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, within the Western  Hemisphere to have a passport or other secure identification deemed  sufficient by the Secretary of Homeland Security to enter or reenter the  United States. The current timeline proposes that the new requirements  will apply to all land border crossings beginning on December 31, 2007.  The proposed timeline was developed pursuant to the Intelligence Reform  and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The act requires the Secretary of  Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to  implement a plan no later than January 1, 2008, to strengthen the border  screening process through the use of passports and other secure  documentation in recognition of the fact that additional safeguards are  needed to ensure that terrorists cannot enter the United States. However,  the Senate recently passed a bill to extend the implementation deadline  from January 1, 2008, to June 1, 2009. Additionally, the Senate bill would  also authorize the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of  Homeland Security, to develop a travel document known as a Passport  Card to facilitate travel of U.S. citizens to Canada, Mexico, the countries  located in the Caribbean, and Bermuda. We did not assess whether this  initiative would be fully implemented by either the January 2008 or June  2009 deadline or whether it would be effective in preventing terrorists  from entering the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The results of our current work indicate that (1) CBP officers at the nine  land border crossings tested did not detect the counterfeit identification  we used and (2) people who enter the United States via land crossings are  not always asked to present identification. Furthermore, our periodic tests  since 2002 clearly show that CBP officers are unable to effectively identify  counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses, birth certificates, and other documents. This  vulnerability potentially allows terrorists or others involved in criminal  activity to pass freely into the United States from Canada or Mexico with  little or no chance of being detected. It will be critical that the new  initiative requiring travelers within the Western Hemisphere to present  passports or other accepted documents to enter the United States address  the vulnerabilities shown by our work.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my  statement.
