Spectrum capacity is necessary for wireless broadband (high-speed Internet access) and broadband deployment will boost the nation's capabilities in many important areas. As the demand for spectrum continues to increase, there is concern about adequate access to meet future needs. This requested report examines (1) how the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is managing spectrum needs of federal agencies, (2) how federal agencies are using and managing assigned spectrum, and (3) what steps NTIA has taken to meet recent initiatives aimed at making spectrum available for broadband. GAO reviewed NTIA's spectrum management documents; surveyed the 19 federal agencies comprising the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee; and interviewed NTIA officials and industry and academic experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NTIA is responsible for governmentwide federal spectrum management, but its efforts in this area have been limited. In 2003, the President directed NTIA to develop plans identifying federal and national (both federal and nonfederal) spectrum needs, and in 2008, NTIA issued the federal plan. GAO found this plan has several limitations, does not identify governmentwide spectrum needs, and does not contain key elements and best practices of strategic planning. NTIA has yet to issue the national plan. Furthermore, NTIA's primary spectrum management operations do not focus on governmentwide needs. Instead NTIA depends on agency self-evaluation of spectrum needs and focuses on interference mitigation, with limited emphasis on holistic spectrum management. Lacking a strategic vision, NTIA cannot ensure that spectrum is being used efficiently by federal agencies. Additionally, NTIA's data management system is antiquated and lacks internal controls to ensure the accuracy of agency-reported data, making it unclear if decisions about federal spectrum use are based on reliable data. NTIA is developing a new data management system, but full implementation of the system is years away. Federal agencies use spectrum for many purposes such as emergency communications and national defense, and NTIA requires the agencies to periodically evaluate their current and future spectrum needs. Agencies are supposed to ensure spectrum assignments fulfill established mission needs; however, NTIA does not have specific requirements for agencies to justify their spectrum assignments or validate data used for these evaluations. Consequently, NTIA has limited assurance that the data used to make spectrum management decisions are accurate. Federal agencies rely heavily on their program offices to obtain data for the required evaluations and often face challenges, such as resource constraints and staff turnover, when coordinating with field program staff. Given that validating spectrum assignments could require significant agency resources, it would be beneficial for NTIA to consider options for a different approach to obtain and validate critical spectrum assignment information from the agencies, such as requiring agencies to conduct site surveys or attest to the accuracy of data they submit. In response to recent initiatives, NTIA has taken steps to identify spectrum that could be made available for broadband use. First, NTIA evaluated various spectrum bands and identified 115 megahertz of spectrum that could be made available for broadband within the next 5 years based on criteria it developed. Second, NTIA developed an initial plan and timetable for evaluating and repurposing additional spectrum for broadband use in 10 years. Affected federal agencies--that is, those agencies operating devices in the spectrum bands being evaluated--encountered difficulties providing NTIA with the necessary data and analyses during the most recent evaluation. For example, according to the affected agencies, they were required to analyze and submit a significant amount of detailed impact analyses that were not readily available. Agencies will likely continue to face challenges providing such analyses to NTIA in the future as NTIA begins evaluating a larger number of spectrum bands for possible broadband use in the next 10 years. NTIA should develop an updated strategic plan, examine its assignment review processes to determine if the current approach can be improved, and establish internal controls to ensure the accuracy of agency-reported data. The Department of Commerce concurred with GAO's recommendation to examine the review processes and, citing competing priorities, partially concurred with the remaining two."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The radio frequency spectrum is a natural resource that is used to provide  an array of wireless communications services critical to the U.S. economy  and a variety of government functions, such as scientific research, national  defense, homeland security, and other vital public safety activities.  Spectrum capacity is necessary to deliver wireless broadband to  consumers and businesses and also to support the communication needs  of industries that use commercial wireless broadband to transmit large  quantities of information quickly and reliably. Broadband deployment  stimulates economic growth, spurs job creation, and boosts the nation\u2019s  capabilities in education, health care, homeland security, and other areas.  As the U.S. experiences significant growth in commercial wireless  broadband services, the demand for radio frequency spectrum has  increased and additional capacity will be needed to accommodate future  growth. As new spectrum-dependent technologies and services are  brought to the market and new mission needs unfold among government  users, Congress, industry stakeholders, and federal agencies expressed  concern about the availability of additional spectrum for future needs, and  that current spectrum management in the U.S. may not be able to respond  adequately to these rapidly changing needs. This is compounded by the  fact that not all radio frequency spectrum has equal value. The spectrum  most highly valued generally consists of frequencies between 300  megahertz (MHz) and 3 gigahertz (GHz), as these frequencies have  properties well suited to many important wireless technologies, such as  mobile phones, radio, and television broadcasting. According to the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA), as of December 2009, federal agencies  had exclusive access to about 18 percent of these high-value frequencies,  nonfederal users had exclusive licenses to about 30 percent, and access to  the remaining 52 percent is shared between federal and nonfederal users.", "Within the federal government, NTIA is responsible for managing the  federal government\u2019s use of the radio frequency spectrum, and the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for regulating  nonfederal spectrum use. Currently, there are federal government  initiatives under way aimed at identifying spectrum that can be made  available to meet the nation\u2019s increased demand for commercial wireless  broadband services. For example, in March 2010, an FCC task force issued  the National Broadband Plan recommending that 500 MHz of spectrum  be made newly available for broadband use within the next 10 years, and  in June 2010, the President issued a memorandum directing NTIA to begin  identifying federal spectrum that can be made available for wireless  broadband. NTIA\u2019s ability to implement these initiatives is important\u2014 specifically its ability to identify spectrum needs of federal users, ensure  spectrum is being used efficiently, and develop policies to strategically  meet these needs while simultaneously providing federal agencies with  adequate access to spectrum to conduct their essential missions.", "In response to your request and in light of the recent focus on federal use  of spectrum, we examined (1) the extent to which NTIA\u2019s spectrum  management oversight and policy addresses governmentwide spectrum  needs, (2) how federal agencies are using assigned spectrum and the  extent to which they manage their spectrum use, and (3) what steps NTIA  and the federal agencies have taken to meet the requirements and  expectations of the National Broadband Plan and presidential  memorandum to repurpose spectrum for broadband, and the challenges  these efforts face. While the focus of this report is on federal use of  assigned spectrum, we have ongoing work examining FCC\u2019s oversight of  spectrum used by commercial entities. Further, we expect to continue  reviewing issues related to spectrum management in the United States,  including what lessons have been learned from prior efforts to repurpose  spectrum from government to commercial entities and the extent to which  the government is collaborating with the private sector to understand their  spectrum needs.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and reviewed NTIA documents,  including its Manual of Regulations and Procedures for the Federal Radio  Frequency Management (commonly referred to as the Redbook); an  assessment of spectrum bands that could possibly be repurposed for  wireless broadband (referred to as the Fast Track Evaluation); and other  documentation of NTIA\u2019s current processes, policies, and procedures. To  develop an understanding of how federal agencies use and manage  spectrum, we conducted a Web-based survey of the 19 federal agencies  comprising the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), whose  agencies hold over 90 percent of federally assigned spectrum, and which is  responsible for coordinating federal use of spectrum and providing NTIA  policy advice on spectrum issues. The agency officials responding to the  survey were top-level spectrum managers. We received completed  responses from 18 of the 19 IRAC members; the results of our survey can  be found in appendix III. To supplement information from our survey, we  obtained documents from and interviewed top-level spectrum managers  from the following 10 federal agencies: Department of Defense (DOD),  Department of Homeland Security, Department of Labor, Environmental  Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and  Urban Development, and Department of the Treasury. We selected these  federal agencies to achieve a mix of characteristics for various factors,  such as the number of spectrum assignments, representation on IRAC,  particular band of spectrum holdings, and mission needs. We also  interviewed officials from NTIA\u2019s Office of Spectrum Management about  their spectrum management policies and procedures and interviewed  stakeholders with knowledge of spectrum issues including industry and  academic experts, and representatives of an industry association and  telecommunications companies. We selected the experts and industry  stakeholders based on prior published literature, stakeholders\u2019 recognition  and affiliation with the spectrum management industry, and NTIA and  other stakeholders\u2019 recommendations.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to April 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Federal agencies use spectrum to help meet a variety  of missions, such as national defense, law enforcement, weather services,  and aviation communication. Nonfederal entities (which include  commercial companies and state and local governments) also use  spectrum to provide a variety of services. For example, state and local  police departments, fire departments, and other emergency services  agencies use spectrum to transmit and receive critical voice and data  communications, while commercial entities use spectrum to provide  wireless services, including mobile voice and data, paging, broadcast radio  and television, and satellite services. See figure 1 for examples of how  spectrum is used.", "In the United States, responsibility for spectrum management is divided  between NTIA and FCC. NTIA and FCC jointly determine the amount of  spectrum allocated for federal, nonfederal, and shared use. After this  allocation occurs, in order to use spectrum, nonfederal users must obtain  a license from FCC to use specific spectrum frequencies, and federal users  must obtain a similar authorization from NTIA\u2014usually referred to as a  frequency assignment. In addition to its spectrum allocation and  authorization duties, NTIA serves as the President\u2019s principal advisor on  telecommunications and information policy and manages federally  assigned spectrum, including preparing for, participating in, and  implementing the results of international radio conferences, as well as  conducting extensive research and technical studies through its research  and engineering laboratory, the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences.  NTIA has authority to issue rules and regulations as may be necessary to  ensure the effective, efficient, and equitable use of spectrum both  nationally and internationally. It also has authority to develop long-range  spectrum plans to meet future government spectrum requirements,  including those of public safety.", "In addition to NTIA and FCC, there are other entities involved in spectrum  management:    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is involved in managing  agency spectrum use through the budget process. OMB\u2019s Circular A-11,  Section 33.4, directs agencies to consider the economic value of spectrum  when requesting funding to procure a spectrum-dependent system. The  circular states that spectrum should generally not be considered a free  resource, but rather should be considered to have value and be included,  to the extent practical, in economic analyses of alternative systems.", "IRAC\u2014an interagency advisory committee\u2014was established in 1922 to  coordinate federal use of spectrum and provide policy advice on spectrum  issues. It is comprised of representatives from 19 federal agencies that use  spectrum. IRAC\u2019s mission and placement have evolved over its 80-year  history. IRAC was originally organized by federal agencies that were  seeking a way to resolve issues related to federal spectrum use in a  cooperative manner; its initial mission was to assist in the assignment of  radio frequencies to federal users and to coordinate federal government  spectrum use. In 1952, its mission was expanded to include formulating  and recommending policies, plans, and actions for federal government  spectrum use. Currently, IRAC is primarily involved in the frequency  assignment and system certification processes and is chaired by NTIA,  whose role as chair is to call IRAC meetings, establish IRAC agendas, and  manage other tasks associated with the administrative operations of IRAC.", "The Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee (CSMAC)\u2014a  federal advisory committee\u2014provides advice and recommendations to  NTIA.

As such, NTIA has a role in ensuring that federally allocated spectrum  is used efficiently. According to NTIA\u2019s Redbook and agency officials,  efficient use includes ensuring that federal agencies\u2019 decisions to use  spectrum to support government missions have been adequately justified  and that all viable tradeoffs and options have been explored before making  the decision to use spectrum-dependent technology, and ensuring that  these tradeoffs are continuously reviewed to determine if the need for  spectrum has changed over time.

For example, the plan does not identify or include quantitative  governmentwide data on federal spectrum needs. Instead, NTIA\u2019s plan  primarily consists of a compilation of the plans submitted by 15 of the  more than 60 agencies that use federal spectrum.

As shown in appendix II,  NTIA discontinued many of the governmentwide projects initiated by the  Spectrum Policy Initiative for the 21st Century, demonstrating a lack of  continuity in its spectrum management operations. For example, NTIA  was directed to issue annual progress reports on the status of the  initiatives. While NTIA issued four annual progress reports from fiscal  years 2005 through 2008, these reports focused on detailing the individual  activities agencies have undertaken to improve their spectrum  management and provided limited information on actions NTIA is taking  to improve governmentwide use of spectrum. Furthermore, NTIA has not  issued a progress report since fiscal year 2008. We asked NTIA officials  why the agency was not implementing many of the presidential initiatives,  and they said due to limited resources the agency has decided to put its  strategic planning activities on hold, and has instead turned its focus to  recent initiatives directed by the Obama Administration. Based on our  conversations with NTIA officials, it is unclear when or if NTIA will  resume its forward-looking strategic planning activities.

According to NTIA officials, this focus on day-to-day spectrum activities,  such as interference mitigation, is due to the agency\u2019s limited resources.  This focus, while important, makes limited consideration about the overall  best use of federally allocated spectrum. Therefore, NTIA\u2019s current  processes provide limited assurance that federal spectrum use is evaluated  from a governmentwide perspective to ensure that decisions will meet the  current and future needs of the agencies, as well as the federal  government as a whole. Additionally, throughout these processes, there is  heavy reliance on agencies to self-evaluate and report their current and  future spectrum needs. For example, in the frequency assignment process,  all analysis to determine whether spectrum-dependent technology should  be used is made by the agencies prior to a request for authorization,  therefore agencies are expected to have adequate expertise and resources  to make these determinations.", "Finally, NTIA has limited ability to monitor federal spectrum use. NTIA  has four programs in place to oversee agency use of spectrum, yet  according to NTIA officials, only one program is actively implemented,  one is conducted on an as-needed basis, and two programs have been  discontinued due to lack of resources, as shown in table 2.

Shortly after the relocation,  the agency was contacted by a commercial wireless carrier that had  acquired the frequency informing the agency that it still had a system  transmitting on the frequency, causing interference. The agency contacted  its regional program office and discovered that a transmitter at the  identified location had not been actively used by the agency for years but  was emitting a carrier signal, which was the source of the interference.  Once the transmitter was shut off the interference on that frequency  stopped. According to the agency\u2019s spectrum manager, regional program  officials never notified the agency about the system\u2019s existence, and as a  result, there was no record of the system in the agency\u2019s inventory list.

NTIA and the Policy and Plans Steering Group  (PPSG) identified and recommended portions of two frequency bands,  totaling 115 MHz of spectrum within the ranges of 1695\u20131710 MHz and  3550\u20133650 MHz to be made available for wireless broadband use. In  November 2010, NTIA publicly released its results.

For these bands, NTIA  reviewed the number of federal frequency assignments within the band,  the types of federal operations and functions that the assignments support,  and the geographic location of federal use. Additionally, NTIA applied the  following criteria to identify the 115 MHz of spectrum:  the band must be able to be made available within 5 years,  the band must be between 225 MHz and 4400 MHz,  the decision to recommend bands for repurposing could be made prior to  October 1, 2010 (therefore due to time constraints decisions would not  require relocation of federal users), and    opportunities for geographic or other sharing within the bands must have  already been successfully proven.", "Since clearing these bands of federal users and relocating incumbent  federal users to new bands was not an option in the given time frame, the  bands that NTIA recommended be made available will be opened to  geographic sharing by incumbent federal users and commercial  broadband.  10-Year Plan.

NTIA  publicly released this report in November 2010. In total, NTIA and the  National Broadband Plan identified 2,264 MHz of spectrum to analyze for  possible repurposing, of which 639 MHz is exclusively used by the federal  government and will be analyzed by NTIA. Additionally, NTIA will  collaborate with FCC to analyze 835 MHz of spectrum that is currently  located in bands that are shared by federal and nonfederal users.

According to NTIA, this band was given top priority for evaluation by  NTIA and the federal agencies, based on a variety of factors, including  industry interest and the band\u2019s potential for commercial use within 10  years. Agencies currently operating in this band have been notified of the  pending evaluation, and NTIA and PPSG have identified comparable bands  for agency operations. Affected agencies are now conducting analyses to  determine which of these comparable bands best meets their needs and  will provide NTIA with their input in spring 2011. According to NTIA  officials, a decision on how to proceed with its analysis will be made in  June 2011. This is not the first time NTIA has studied these bands.

The evaluation required  Navy, NOAA, and FAA to analyze and submit a significant amount of  detailed impact analyses that were not readily available, according to  officials with those agencies. Further, Department of the Navy and U.S.  Marine Corps officials said they were required to conduct analyses based  on a number of different scenarios to determine what the impact might be  for mission performance by making various spectrum bands available for  wireless broadband. According to one Navy official, while DOD collects a  large amount of data on its spectrum-dependent systems, NTIA\u2019s request  required DOD to conduct a time-consuming, in-depth analysis on the  operational impact of repurposing certain spectrum bands. NTIA officials  recognize that completing this analysis required significant agency  resources, but they noted that agencies were the only ones with the  requisite expertise to complete the analysis.", "In response to our survey, the Department of the Navy and the Department  of the Air Force expressed concerns over data accuracy as a result of the  short time frame given to them to collect the data. One official stated that  the speed of identifying available spectrum appeared more important than  the accuracy of the data. According to a DOD official, these data requests  were time-consuming because they required regional spectrum managers  to identify and contact all field program offices using spectrum- dependent  systems in the band being analyzed to determine their use of spectrum and  how their mission performance would be affected if the band were no  longer available for federal use. Four IRAC agencies that completed our  survey\u2014NOAA, Department of the Air Force, Department of the Navy, and  Department of the Army\u2014expressed further concerns about the resources  required to collect spectrum data for the Fast Track Evaluation.", "In addition to the challenges that federal agencies reported in gathering  data, making the 115 MHz of spectrum available for wireless broadband  will have operational effects on agencies. For example, according to  NTIA\u2019s Fast Track Evaluation, as a result of the decision to make the 1695\u2013 1710 MHz band available for wireless broadband, NOAA will have to  redesign its next generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental  Satellite-R series (GOES-R) satellites. According to NOAA, this redesign  will increase costs and delay implementation. Additionally, NTIA does not  expect DOD to experience any immediate operational impacts due to the  repurposing of the 3550\u20133650 MHz band; however, such a repurposing  based on exclusion zones will limit DOD\u2019s future flexibility to implement  new systems or operate at new locations. As table 4 illustrates, NOAA and  DOD will be the primary agencies affected by the decision to make this  spectrum available.", "Further, data- and resource-related challenges could affect  implementation of NTIA\u2019s 10-Year Plan. As experienced in previous  relocations, inaccurate and incomplete data submitted by agencies can  impact the transition time from federal to commercial use once  reallocated spectrum has been auctioned by FCC and purchased by  commercial users. During the relocation of federal users as a result of the  Advance Wireless Service spectrum auction in 2006, according to a  winning bidder of the spectrum, some agencies submitted inaccurate  inventory data to NTIA and OMB causing delays in the transition from  federal to commercial use. As previously discussed, federal agencies faced  resource challenges in providing NTIA data on system inventory,  operational use, and operational impacts. These challenges raise concerns  because the Fast Track Evaluation focused on only 115 MHz of spectrum,  while NTIA is now expecting to evaluate 1,474 MHz of spectrum, meaning  these challenges could be magnified.", "Without adequate and timely funding for agencies to conduct research and  planning, the goals of the 10-Year Plan and timetable may not be achieved.  In previous auctions, as part of the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement  Act (CSEA),agencies have been reimbursed for their relocation costs  through the Spectrum Relocation Fund. CSEA does not provide agencies  with up-front funding to conduct detailed analysis during the spectrum  evaluation phase. The lack of funding may delay analysis and band  characterization for repurposing, as agencies have limited staff and  resources to dedicate to data collection and band analysis. This can be  problematic because agencies have reported significant costs associated  with collecting the data and conducting the analysis requested by NTIA.  For example, a DOD official told us he committed 400 staff hours to  collecting operational impact data for the Fast Track Evaluation for two  affected DOD systems; under the 10-Year Plan, the official expects to have  to collect and prepare operational impact data for 120 systems. To address  this funding issue, NTIA stated in the Fast Track Evaluation analysis that  changes to expand the CSEA would be needed to provide agencies with  up-front funding for analysis and planning related to repurposing.

Overall, there has been limited interest in the bands above 3 GHz for  mobile broadband use because, according to industry stakeholders, there  have been minimal technological developments for mobile broadband in  bands above 3 GHz and no foreseeable advances in this area at this time.", "According to industry representatives, the 1755\u20131780 MHz band that NTIA  considered as part of the Fast Track Evaluation has the best  characteristics for mobile broadband use, and it is internationally  harmonized for this use. NTIA did not select this band to be made  available in the 5-year time frame due to the large number of federal users  currently operating there. Recently, however, NTIA has identified it as the  first band to be analyzed under the 10-Year Plan to determine if it can be  made available for commercial broadband use.", "An industry stakeholder has stated that the 1695\u20131710 MHz band identified  by NTIA in the Fast Track Evaluation is the second-best alternative for  wireless broadband if the 1755\u20131780 MHz band were not made available;  however, the 1695\u20131710 MHz band is not currently used internationally for  wireless broadband, which may reduce device manufacturers\u2019 incentive  for developing technology that can be used in these frequencies.", "Additionally, an industry stakeholder also expressed concern over the  exclusion zones established by NTIA in the 1695\u20131710 MHz band, which  would make the band unavailable for wireless broadband in select major  cities across the United States that account for over 12 percent of the U.S.  population. Similarly, one industry stakeholder has also noted that the  exclusion zones NTIA has established for the 3550\u20133650 MHz band would  prevent wireless broadband access along the entire East and West coasts.  Considering the geographic exclusion zones and the location of the  spectrum above 3 GHz, an industry stakeholder we contacted said that  they are not as immediately interested in this spectrum as they are in the  1755\u20131780 MHz band, which, according to one industry stakeholder, may  impact future spectrum auction prices. On March 8, 2011, FCC released a  Public Notice seeking comment on steps the Commission can take to best  promote wireless broadband deployment in the 1695-1710 MHz and 3550- 3650 MHz bands. Amongst other things, FCC sought comment on the  extent to which these bands could be made available for broadband  deployment; how the conditions placed on the bands, such as the  exclusion zones, could affect their usefulness for broadband deployment;  and whether broadband technologies are readily available to operate on  these bands.", "While spectrum auctions can generate substantial funds for the U.S.  Treasury\u2014for example, the Advance Wireless Services auction that took  place in September 2006 fetched over $13.7 billion, a portion of which  went to the U.S. Treasury\u2014if industry participants are not as interested in  the spectrum being auctioned, lower bids would be expected. Agencies are  currently reimbursed with funding from auction revenue for data  collection, analysis, and planning-related costs, after costs for relocating  federal users have been paid. Lack of industry interest in spectrum above 3  GHz creates concerns as to whether large amounts of spectrum will be  able to meet the minimum price at auction, which the CSEA has set at 110  percent of federal relocation costs. Since relocating federal users is likely  as part of the 10-Year Plan, if the reserve is not met, agencies may not be  reimbursed for their data collection, analysis, and planning costs. As  previously stated, NTIA officials have raised concerns that without this  funding, agencies will not be able to conduct adequate analysis for the 10- Year Plan.

NTIA\u2019s spectrum management authority is broad in scope, but NTIA\u2019s  efforts do not align with its authorities. Its focus is on the technical  aspects of spectrum management, such as ensuring new frequency  assignments will not cause interference to spectrum-dependent devices  already in use, rather than on whether new assignments should be  approved based on a comprehensive evaluation of federal spectrum use  from a governmentwide perspective. NTIA officials noted that due to  limited resources, the agency has put its strategic planning activities on  hold and has instead turned its focus to recent initiatives directed by the  Obama Administration. However, lacking an overall strategic vision, NTIA  cannot ensure that spectrum is being used efficiently by federal agencies.", "Agencies are supposed to review all their spectrum assignments every 5  years and delete any assignments not essential to their missions; however,  we found that these reviews are often perfunctory. Furthermore, agencies  have concerns about not having access to sufficient spectrum in the future  to meet mission-critical needs and therefore might be reluctant to  relinquish any assignments for fear they will be unable to get more  spectrum in the future. The absence of requirements for agencies to  submit justifications for their spectrum use combined with NTIA\u2019s limited  oversight of the agencies has led to decreased accountability and  transparency in how federal spectrum is actually being used and whether  the spectrum-dependent systems the agencies have in place are necessary.  However, federal agency officials face challenges\u2014such as staff turnover  and resource constraints\u2014when coordinating with field program staff to  obtain the information necessary for the frequency assignment  applications and reviews. Given that verifying the information for each  frequency assignment record could require significant spectrum  management resources that federal agencies might not currently have, it  would be beneficial for NTIA to consider options for a different approach  to obtain critical assignment information from the agencies. Approaches  may include efforts such as requiring agencies to conduct site surveys of  their spectrum-dependent systems, attesting to the accuracy of the data  provided to NTIA, or making changes to the structure of the 5-year review  program.", "As part of its spectrum management processes, NTIA depends primarily  on an antiquated data collection system and does not have a mechanism in  place to validate and verify the accuracy of spectrum-related data  submitted by the federal agencies. The data management system also lacks  transparency and internal controls, which are essential for ensuring  accountability for government resources and for achieving effective and  efficient results. Although NTIA is developing its new FSMS, full  implementation is still years away. In the meantime, without meaningful  data validation requirements, NTIA has limited assurance that the agency- reported data it collects are accurate and complete.

Specifically, Commerce concurred  with our recommendation to examine the 5-year assignment review  processes and consider best practices to determine if the current approach  can be improved. Commerce stated that NTIA, in consultation with IRAC,  would review the current assignment process with agencies to determine  what improvements could be implemented. Commerce partially concurred  with our recommendation to develop an updated strategic plan, stating  that NTIA will have to weigh updating strategic plans against other  spectrum management needs and directives and determine priorities.  Commerce agreed that key elements of strategic planning are central to  NTIA\u2019s work, but stressed that given funding limitations, NTIA must  consider our recommendation in light of its other spectrum-related  obligations and fundamental spectrum mission. We recognize that NTIA  has been tasked with responding to other spectrum management  directives, but lacking an overall strategic vision, NTIA cannot ensure that  its spectrum management decisions reflect the overall best use of federally  allocated spectrum.

We did not receive a completed survey  from the Department of State IRAC representative despite our multiple  attempts to obtain the information. Because we selected a nonprobability  sample of federal agencies with assigned spectrum to survey, the  information we obtained from the survey may not be generalized to all  federal agencies with assigned spectrum. However, because the IRAC  member agencies that we included in our sample survey hold the vast  majority of all federally assigned spectrum, the information we gathered  from these agencies provided us with a general understanding of federal  agencies\u2019 spectrum management policies. In addition, we took steps in the  development of the survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to  minimize nonsampling errors. For instance, a survey specialist designed  the survey and the draft survey was pre-tested with IRAC representatives  from three federal agencies. We conducted these pre-tests to ensure that  (1) the questions and possible responses were clear and thorough, (2)  terminology was used correctly, (3) questions did not place an undue  burden on the respondents, (4) the information was feasible to obtain, and  (5) the questionnaire was comprehensive and unbiased.

We selected federal agencies for our  comprehensive profiles to achieve a mix of the following characteristics:  large spectrum holdings (more than 5,000 assignments) and small  spectrum holdings (less than 1,000 assignments);  IRAC and non-IRAC member agencies to ensure that we had  representative views from both groups; and    assignments located in different spectrum bands and used for different  mission needs.", "We also consulted internal stakeholders, experts, associations, and NTIA  officials to assist us in identifying potential agencies to interview.  Although using these criteria allowed us to obtain information from a  diverse mix of federal agencies, the findings from our in-depth profiles  cannot be generalized to all federal agencies because they were selected  as part of a non-probability sample.", "To determine what steps NTIA and federal agencies have taken to meet  the requirements and expectations of the June 28, 2010, presidential  memorandum and what challenges these efforts will face, we reviewed  pertinent documents related to their efforts, such as NTIA\u2019s Assessment of  Spectrum Bands That Could Possibly be Repurposed for Wireless  Broadband (referred to as the Fast Track Evaluation) and 10-Year Plan.  We also conducted interviews with NTIA and federal agency officials.  Through our interviews, we collected up to date information on actions  being taken to make spectrum available for wireless broadband including  information on what criteria NTIA is using to make these decisions, how  NTIA and federal agencies are collaborating on identifying spectrum, and  what potential challenges they may face in reallocating federal spectrum.  We also contacted four wireless service providers to obtain their  viewpoints and opinions on (1) NTIA\u2019s process and methodology for  identifying additional spectrum to be made available for commercial  broadband use, (2) the level of private sector demand for the spectrum  identified by NTIA, and (3) the potential value of spectrum that NTIA has  identified for analysis as part of its Fast Track Evaluation and 10-Year  Plan.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to April 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.
