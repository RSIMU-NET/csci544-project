Monitoring is essential to ensuring that USAID's nonemergency food aid programs in developing countries are implemented as intended, and evaluation helps to assure that these programs achieve their goal of reducing global food insecurity. First, with funding from the Food for Peace Act, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) plans to increase the number of field staff responsible for the monitoring of nonemergency food aid programs, has provided funding for the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, and has initiated an upgrade of its information technology system. However, FFP's plans for the information technology upgrade lack a concept of operations document, which describes system characteristics for a proposed system from a user's point of view and includes high-level descriptions of information systems, their interrelationships, and information flows. Second, with funding from other sources, USAID plans to carry out additional actions in an effort to improve its oversight of food aid, including the expansion of a computerized system for monitoring the implementation and management of nonemergency food aid programs. However, USAID has not determined a stable source of funding for these initiatives beyond the first year of operations due to legal restrictions that preclude the agency from using the newly authorized funding for grants and cooperative agreements. USAID's monitoring and evaluation of its nonemergency food aid programs are consistent to varying degrees with some of the principles established by the American Evaluation Association's Task Force on Evaluation Policy to integrate evaluation into program management. GAO found that (1) FFP's actions were generally consistent with the principles for policies and procedures and for independence. For example, FFP has issued policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating food aid programs and generally uses external evaluators to assess its multiyear assistance programs. (2) FFP's actions were partially consistent with the principles for scope and coverage, dissemination of results, professional competence, and resources. For example, FFP relies on a range of staff to perform its monitoring and evaluation, but does not have reliable data on the numbers of field staff who have competencies in monitoring and evaluation, or their specific skills. (3) FFP's actions were not consistent with the principles for monitoring and evaluation plans. While FFP plans some of its monitoring and evaluation activities--such as final evaluations for multiyear assistance programs--it lacks an integrated plan to ensure that monitoring and evaluation results will be used to improve program management."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The number of undernourished people worldwide has been growing and  now exceeds 1 billion, according to the estimates of the United Nations  (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This calls into question  the feasibility of attaining the 1996 World Food Summit target of reducing  the number of hungry people by half to no more than 420 million by 2015.  The United States is the world\u2019s largest donor of food aid, and the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID) Office for Food for Peace  (FFP) administers the largest nonemergency food aid program funded  under the Food for Peace Act. FFP has adopted as its strategic objective  the reduction of food insecurity in vulnerable populations. Specifically,  FFP\u2019s Strategic Plan for 2006-2010 identifies two intermediate results:  (1) enhancing FFP\u2019s global leadership in reducing global food insecurity  and (2) increasing FFP\u2019s program impact in the field.", "Monitoring and evaluation of nonemergency food aid\u2014one of the largest  sources of U.S. funding focused on food security\u2014are critical oversight  and program management tools that would help to ensure that FFP meets  its strategic objective.

In 2007, we found that the USAID Inspector General had  previously reported that monitoring had not been regular and systematic  and that, in some cases, intended recipients had not received food aid or  the number of recipients could not be verified. In April 2007, we reported  that USAID had only 23 Title II-funded staff assigned to missions and  regional offices in just 10 countries to monitor programs that cost about  $1.7 billion in 55 countries in the previous fiscal year. Our audit work also  indicated that monitoring had been insufficient due to various factors  including limited staff, competing priorities, and legal restrictions on the  use of food aid resources. To ensure the effective use of food aid, we  recommended that USAID improve its monitoring of food aid programs to  strengthen proper management and implementation of these programs.  USAID agreed, noting that monitoring of all its grant programs is required  and that its implementing partners are legally required to monitor and  report their findings to USAID. Like monitoring, evaluation is crucial to  ensuring that best practices and lessons learned are considered in the  management and implementation of existing programs and in designing  new ones. However, for many years, USAID did not place a great deal of  importance or invest many resources in evaluation. In a June 2009 speech,  the Secretary of State, whose department coordinates U.S. development  assistance, recognized that \u201c\u2026too often, program evaluation is treated as  an afterthought, and sometimes is overlooked entirely.\u201d To rectify this  situation, the Secretary announced that the Department of State (State)  had for the first time developed a policy for integrating evaluation into its  work worldwide.", "In passing the Food for Peace Act in 2008, Congress authorized up to $22  million annually in funding for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 to USAID for  program oversight to improve, monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness and  efficiency of nonemergency food aid programs\u2014and, consistent with our  2007 recommendation, required the USAID Administrator to submit an  implementation report on the agency\u2019s efforts in these areas. Congress  also required the Comptroller General of the United States to review  USAID\u2019s report and provide recommendations for improvement. To  address this congressional mandate, we reviewed (1) USAID\u2019s plans and  actions to improve its monitoring and evaluation of nonemergency food  aid programs provided under the Food for Peace Act and (2) the extent to  which USAID has integrated its monitoring and evaluation of  nonemergency food aid with program management, particularly with  regard to established principles. In this review, we focused on oversight  practices of FFP, not of USAID as a whole.", "To address these objectives, we examined USAID\u2019s December 2008 report  to Congress, which outlines FFP\u2019s plans to improve its monitoring and  evaluation of nonemergency food aid programs, and actions FFP has taken  to date. We interviewed USAID officials, including FFP field staff  responsible for monitoring the implementation of nonemergency food aid  programs, and implementing partners such as nongovernmental  organizations (NGO) and the World Food Program (WFP). We considered  established principles for monitoring and evaluation\u2014especially the  \u201cRoadmap\u201d principles of the American Evaluation Association (AEA),  which have been developed to integrate monitoring and evaluation with  program management; GAO standards and prior GAO work; USAID  guidance; and guidelines that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE) has established for information technology.

Yet FFP officials in Washington, D.C., and in  the field, as well as some external evaluators, have expressed concerns  about the competency of these staff to perform certain aspects of  monitoring and evaluation, as follows:    Staff can lack key evaluation skills. Implementing partners\u2019 staff can lack  key evaluation skills, according to an AED employee who provided  training and support to FFP\u2019s implementing partners and several external  evaluators. According to the AED employee, implementing partners\u2019 staff  could execute research designs adequately but often were not capable of  designing the research themselves, or of taking responsibility for key  aspects of data collection, such as developing surveys or selecting  statistical samples. FFP officials stated that they recognize the need to  build capacity among the implementing partners, and are providing  monitoring and evaluation training in the field for these FFP and  implementing partner staff.", "Difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified staff. Adequacy of staffing  levels and staff turnover have been cited as a concern in some countries.  For example, the implementing partners in Haiti told us that it was  difficult to attract and retain technically qualified staff. They stated that  Haiti has only a limited supply of people with the appropriate skills and  training for monitoring and evaluation. To address the shortage, one  implementing partner recently hired a new monitoring and evaluation  program officer from an African country who had appropriate  methodological skills but did not speak either French or Creole, Haiti\u2019s  official languages, at the time of his arrival in-country.", "FFP Lacks Data on the Monitoring and Evaluation Competencies of  Its Field Staff  FFP does not have the data necessary to assure that it has enough staff  with the right skills. According to FFP officials, USAID does not collect an  inventory of its staff\u2019s skills and abilities, which would help the agency to  determine whether it has staff with sufficient training and skills in  monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, neither USAID nor FFP have  data that can indicate which staff spend the majority of their time on  monitoring and evaluation, or how much staff time is spent on various  monitoring and evaluation activities, such as checking on warehouses,  advising implementing partners on performance indicators, or  participating in evaluation designs. While FFP attempted to gather some  data for us on its field staff who perform monitoring and evaluation, these  data were not reliable.", "In Haiti, for example, FFP officials initially told us that nine staff acted as  field monitors. However, we found that this number included staff  members who did not spend much of their time involved in routine  monitoring and evaluation, such as the FFP officer, his deputy, and two  secretaries. Of the FFP staff in country, only four appeared to spend  substantial parts of their time on specific monitoring activities, such as  performing routine checks of warehouses or health clinics and giving  implementing partners advice on indicators.", "One reason that it is difficult for FFP to determine which staff spend the  majority of their time on monitoring is that definitions of this function  vary. For example, while a recent FFP bulletin defined monitoring as the  regular tracking of program implementation, FFP guidance to field staff  defined monitoring more broadly, to include activities such as reviewing  contracts and ensuring that financial audits are performed. If the broader  definition of monitoring is used, more staff members can be classified as  performing this function, but then it is not possible to determine which of  those staff are spending the majority of their time on monitoring program  inputs and program implementation.", "FFP Lacks Staff in Headquarters Who Are Skilled in Monitoring  and Evaluation  AEA has recommended that to support evaluations agencies either  establish centers of evaluation or appoint evaluation coordinators for  individual programs that conduct their own evaluation. According to FFP  officials, FFP has been unable to hire monitoring and evaluation staff at  headquarters to assist and support its officers in the field. FFP officials  attributed this to restrictions in the Food for Peace Act, which precludes  them from hiring any staff in Washington, D.C., to monitor and evaluate  nonemergency food aid programs.
