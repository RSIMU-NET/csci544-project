Three of these states met their target date while three did not for various reasons, such as needing more time to develop student academic growth measures. The six states that did not fully implement either piloted or partially implemented. The scope of pilots varied. One state piloted to about 14 percent of teachers and principals while another piloted to about 30 percent of teachers. State or district officials in four of the six states expressed some concerns about their readiness for full implementation.", "Officials in most RTT states cited challenges related to developing and using evaluation measures, addressing teacher concerns, and building capacity and sustainability. State officials said it was difficult to design and implement rigorous student learning objectives--an alternate measure of student academic growth. In 6 states, officials said they had difficulty ensuring that principals conducted evaluations consistently. Officials in 11 states said teacher concerns about the scale of change, such as the use of student academic growth data and consequences attached to evaluations, challenged state efforts. State and district officials also discussed capacity challenges, such as too few staff or limited staff expertise and prioritizing evaluation reform amid multiple educational initiatives. Officials in 10 states had concerns about sustaining their evaluation systems.", "Education helps RTT states meet their goals for teacher and principal evaluation systems through a new monitoring process and through technical assistance. Education officials said the RTT monitoring process differs from other monitoring efforts in the frequency of contact with the states and the emphasis on continuous improvement and quality of RTT reforms. Officials from 8 of the 12 RTT states expressed generally positive views about Education's monitoring. When states have not demonstrated adequate progress, Education has taken corrective action. For example, Education designated two states as high-risk, which resulted in additional monitoring.

RTT is the largest competitive  grant fund ever administered by Education, and in 2010, Education  awarded nearly $4 billion in grant funds to 12 states. To be competitive  for RTT grants, states had to demonstrate a commitment to reforming K- 12 education across four interconnected areas: adopting standards and  assessments, building data systems, supporting teachers and principals,  and improving the lowest-achieving schools.

We interviewed state officials from all 12 grantee  states as well as school district officials in Maryland, New York, and North  Carolina, either in person or by phone. We chose states that differed in  terms of the flexibility they provided to districts to design their teacher and  principal evaluation systems (Maryland and New York offer districts more  flexibility, whereas North Carolina has a statewide evaluation system and  offers districts less flexibility). In selecting these states, we also  considered the RTT award amount and the percentage of students  served by school districts participating in RTT. We interviewed a total of  12 school districts in these three states. We asked state officials to  identify districts that varied in terms of the design of their evaluation  systems (if applicable) and the range of challenges they faced. Other  criteria included whether a district was urban, suburban, or rural and the  percentage of high-poverty or high-minority schools in the district. The  views of these 12 districts cannot be generalized to all districts that  participated in RTT, but they do provide important insights into some  districts\u2019 experiences with RTT implementation. The state and district  officials we interviewed provided information on the key components of  their evaluation systems, the implementation status of these systems,  what they considered to be their design and implementation challenges,  and Education\u2019s monitoring activities and technical assistance.

Twelve states received  grants in 2010 in Phases 1 and 2 to support the design and  implementation of their teacher and principal evaluation systems and  other RTT reforms. Award amounts ranged from $75 million to $700  million (see table 1). States were required to subgrant at least 50 percent  of their total grant award to districts that chose to participate in RTT. The  4-year grant period began on the date funds were awarded to the state.  States must obligate all funds within that period, and they have 90 days  following the end of their grant period to liquidate all obligated funds  unless they receive a no-cost extension.

For students in grades  and subjects that are not tested by state standardized tests, Education  defines student achievement based on alternative measures of student  learning and performance. These measures include student scores on  pre-tests and end-of-course tests, student performance on English  language proficiency assessments, and other measures of student  achievement that are rigorous and comparable across classrooms.  Student achievement for students in tested grades and subjects can also  be assessed using other measures as appropriate, including the same  measures as students in nontested grades and subjects.", "Education provided background information in its notice of proposed  priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria for RTT on why  it included student growth as a factor in its criteria for teacher and  principal evaluation. Education noted the difficulty in predicting teacher  quality based solely on the qualifications that teachers bring to the job.  The department cited research on the limited predictive power of  measures such as certification, education, and years of experience, and  research on the value of measuring student growth to assess teacher  quality. In response to public comments that expressed concern about  the use of student growth data as the sole means to evaluate teachers  and principals, Education revised its definitions of an effective teacher  and effective principal to require that multiple measures be used to  assess effectiveness, with student growth as a significant factor.  Education also provided examples of these supplemental measures, such  as multiple observation-based assessments of teacher performance and  high school graduation rates as a measure for evaluating principals.", "Education also established criteria for peer reviewers to consider a state\u2019s  capacity to sustain its reforms.

SLOs measure student  academic growth for teachers in nontested grades and subjects, which  represent 65 to 75 percent of teachers nationwide, according to an RSN  report. SLOs are learning objectives for groups of students, such as  students in a social studies class, that use a specific measure, such as a  course exam, to track academic progress throughout a school year.However, some RTT state and district officials said it can be difficult to  ensure that these learning objectives are rigorous and accurately  measure student learning. Tennessee officials said that while SLOs are  popular and promising in theory, they are difficult to reliably implement  because some teachers set non-rigorous goals in order to get high  scores. Tennessee officials further explained that some teachers selected  a schoolwide social studies score for their SLO measure\u2014despite having  no connection to the subject\u2014because students did well on that exam,  rather than selecting learning objectives relevant to their own subject  matter. Officials in three Maryland districts said determining how to  measure student academic growth using learning objectives was a  challenge because, for example, they may have difficulty assessing  students\u2019 abilities when they enter a class, not just when they leave.  Officials in a New York district described the difficulty of implementing  learning objectives in their small, rural district (see sidebar). Despite these  challenges, RTT state and district officials said that SLOs improved their  evaluation systems, in part by engaging teachers in the evaluation  process and by leading to more in-depth discussions about teacher  performance. To address some of their challenges, RTT states developed  guidance, templates, or model learning objectives to help districts develop  and use SLOs.

Officials in a few of these states attributed this  to principals lacking the skill to differentiate between effective and  ineffective teachers, or the will to rate teachers in lower categories or to  rate them lower than under the prior evaluation system. Officials in  Tennessee and in two North Carolina districts said evaluation data have  shown that some teachers with low scores on their student academic  growth component received high professional practice ratings. They said  this may indicate that some principals are inflating scores or not  identifying lower-performing teachers and providing critical feedback.  Officials in another North Carolina district described a different concern  about the mismatch in professional practice ratings and student academic  growth. They noted that student academic growth data are not available  until the following year and might influence how some principals assess  teachers in the year in which the data become available. For example,  after receiving data that shows a teacher demonstrated good student  academic growth the prior year, a principal might overlook poor  classroom management when observing the teacher.

Tennessee officials  said that during the first year of implementation, principals participated in  4 days of training and had to pass a test in order to perform classroom  observations. During the second year, Tennessee identified principals  who did not evaluate teachers appropriately and provided them with  additional support and coaches. Officials also said that Tennessee plans  to make its certification test more rigorous.

For example,  state, district, and union officials in Maryland said that teachers did not  trust the validity of the state test scores used in some of the student  academic growth measures. Officials in one New York district were  concerned generally about the rise in annual testing and its use in  evaluations to inform personnel decisions. District and union officials in  New York said the release of teacher evaluation ratings to parents added  to concerns about evaluation systems. Officials in one small district said  their teachers were particularly concerned because protecting their  anonymity might be difficult even if data are aggregated and not linked to  individual teachers. Officials in three states and one district said they had  difficulty convincing teachers that evaluation systems were focused on  professional development, rather than consequences. Some RTT state  and district officials said the simultaneous transition to new state  assessments and the Common Core curriculum\u2014a single set of  educational standards in language arts and math\u2014increased teacher  concerns about consequences. For example, North Carolina officials  said teachers were concerned about the fairness of measuring student  academic growth while schools are implementing a new curriculum. In  some RTT states, according to state and union officials, lengthy collective  bargaining processes or lawsuits slowed implementation efforts.", "State and district officials said they took steps to address teacher  concerns, in part by involving teachers in the design and implementation  of the evaluation systems and through ongoing communication with  teachers.

In  addition, officials from all three state organizations representing teachers  said they helped develop the legal framework or overarching standards  for their states\u2019 evaluation systems and participated on committees or  provided training to teachers and principals to support their state\u2019s efforts.  To reduce teacher concerns once reform efforts were under way, officials  in Maryland regularly distributed a document to key stakeholders that,  among other things, provided updates related to evaluation components.  Officials in Georgia said they made presentations in the community, held  focus groups in districts, and provided training to help manage the culture  shift to the new evaluation system.", "State or district officials in most RTT states (9 of the 12) said they faced  fewer concerns related to principal evaluations due to greater principal  support, the smaller scale of implementation, or because principals were  used to being evaluated based on student performance. According to  North Carolina officials, superintendents used student academic growth in  principal evaluations prior to RTT, so principals did not have the same  level of concern as teachers. In addition, North Carolina officials noted  that the state had 2,600 administrators compared to 95,000 teachers,  which made principal evaluation easier to implement. Hawaii officials said  implementing principal evaluations was a generally collaborative and  productive process for several reasons. For instance, they said principal  associations were relatively easy to work with, administrator assessments  already existed, and principals understood the need for a new evaluation  system and contributed significantly to its design.

Some state officials also said they faced capacity challenges  related to supporting district efforts, such as reviewing and approving  district evaluation systems and providing technical assistance. For  example, Florida officials said that, because their RTT districts had the  flexibility to design their own systems, it was difficult to develop solutions  to challenges that would be applicable to all RTT districts. State and  district officials said that at the local level, districts had difficulty managing  principal workloads or prioritizing evaluation reform amid multiple  educational initiatives. For example, officials in a New York district said  that the time commitment required for observing and evaluating teachers  prevented some principals from thoroughly reviewing evidence submitted  for evaluations or providing meaningful feedback to teachers. District  officials in New York and Maryland told us that their evaluation reform  efforts took precedence over other initiatives, such as implementation of  the Common Core curriculum. Building capacity to enact education  reforms has been a recurring challenge for states and districts, as we  have discussed in previous reports.", "While RTT was designed to encourage education innovation and  reform\u2014rather than covering all costs of reform efforts\u2014several state and  district officials cited the high cost of designing and implementing  evaluation systems as a challenge. For example, officials in Hawaii and  Delaware (see sidebar) noted that they underestimated how much it  would cost to develop these systems. Similarly, officials in 7 of the 12  districts we spoke with said their RTT funds did not cover the costs of  reforming their evaluation systems. For example, one small, rural New  York district spent about $62,400 on its teacher and principal evaluation  systems in addition to the $22,856 it received in RTT funds. Other New  York districts faced similar challenges. A 2011 survey conducted by the  New York State Council of School Superintendents shows that 81 percent  of responding superintendents were concerned that cost considerations  might prevent their districts from soundly implementing new evaluation  requirements. Cost may have been more of a challenge for some districts  because they were responsible for a significant part of the design and  implementation work. Six of the 7 districts in which officials raised cost as  a capacity challenge were in Maryland and New York, both of which  provide RTT districts with significant flexibility to design their own  systems. Officials in Tennessee explained that some RTT districts in their  state did not have funding concerns because they used the evaluation  system and data system provided by the state.", "States and districts responded to capacity challenges through different  efforts to supplement their staff and resources (see fig. 4). Several RTT  states also submitted amendment requests and received approval from  Education to shift funds among RTT projects to provide additional funding  for particular aspects of their evaluation systems. For example,  Tennessee shifted approximately $1.1 million to support, among other  things, additional training on evaluation systems because the state did not  originally estimate sufficient funds for this purpose. Similarly, New York  increased its budget for its evaluation systems by $11.9 million by shifting  funds to develop its student academic growth model, pilot evaluation  system software, and provide additional resources to districts.", "State or district officials in most RTT states (10 of the 12) said that fewer  staff or other resources after RTT grant funds are no longer available  could affect their ability to sustain their evaluation systems. For example,  Rhode Island officials said they will likely lose staff that they hired using  RTT funds because the state may not be able to use other education  funds to make these positions permanent. Officials in New York said that  with the loss of RTT funding, the state will have fewer staff to review  district evaluation plans every year and to provide technical assistance to  districts, as well as to manage the analysis of statewide evaluation data.  District of Columbia officials were concerned that without RTT funds, they  would be unable to pay the contractor that operates the student academic  growth model used by its charter school districts.", "Officials from all 12 RTT states said they are considering how to sustain  their evaluation systems after RTT grant funds are no longer available.  Officials in a few of these states discussed some of the difficulties they  have faced in preparing for sustainability, such as turnover in state  leadership and uncertainty over future funding levels, and a few officials  provided examples of how they might address sustainability. For  example, Hawaii officials said they are considering how to reallocate  funds to sustain the systems but are concerned about the availability of  other federal and state funds to do so. Georgia officials said they are  collaborating with stakeholders to develop a sustainability plan\u2014to be  completed in summer 2013. In addition, Florida officials said they were  working to ensure that they have in-house expertise on all aspects of the  evaluation systems. For example, contractors who assisted with the  state\u2019s student academic growth component will train state staff on how to  run the models.", "Officials in 5 of the 12 RTT states told us more information from  Education could help address their concerns about sustaining their  evaluation systems and other reforms after RTT grant funds are no longer  available. Specifically, state and district officials from some of these  states told us they were concerned about or would like guidance on how  to use other federal funds to support their evaluation systems. For  example, officials in one state said Education issued some guidance on  acceptable uses of ESEA funding, but could provide more concrete  information on how best to leverage those funds for RTT initiatives. In  addition, Education officials told us a few states have requested technical  assistance to support their sustainability planning. Officials from four  states told us it was too soon for them to know whether they would need  Education\u2019s assistance with sustainability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Supports RTT State Implementation Efforts through Monitoring and Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education Monitors States Using a New Process to Hold Them Accountable for Quality of Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Education developed a new process to monitor RTT states\u2019 progress  toward meeting their RTT goals, including those related to teacher and  principal evaluation systems. Education officials said that the RTT  monitoring process differs from the department\u2019s other monitoring efforts  in that Education has more frequent contact with the states in order to  identify and address implementation challenges. In addition, the new  process emphasizes states\u2019 continuous improvement and quality of RTT  reforms, rather than focusing solely on compliance with laws and  regulations and the ability of states to meet their time frames.said the intensity of communication with RTT states and the quality  standards are greater for RTT than for Education\u2019s previous monitoring  efforts. Education developed the new process to provide assistance to  RTT states as they implement comprehensive reforms and to differentiate  support based on individual state needs.", "Education officials said they work to identify and address obstacles to the  goals states established in their RTT plans through ongoing  communication, including monthly monitoring calls, the amendment  consideration process, and other contacts with RTT state officials. To  assess the quality of implementation efforts, officials said they consider  each state\u2019s progress toward its goals and timelines, risk factors and  strategies for addressing them, and the state\u2019s own assessment of its  quality of implementation, among other factors. For example, in addition  to verifying that a state implemented an evaluation tool, such as a test or  performance measure, Education officials work with the state to ensure  that the tool is meeting the state\u2019s needs. Instead of focusing solely on  RTT compliance, program officers also help identify areas in which  Education can assist states in meeting their goals, according to Education  officials.", "Officials from 8 of the 12 RTT states expressed generally positive views  about Education\u2019s RTT monitoring activities. Some said, for example, that  Education officials were collaborative, well-informed, and that they  generally provided useful feedback. For example, officials from one state  said that Education staff were very detailed and thorough in monthly  monitoring calls and that they usually provided actionable feedback.  Officials from another state said they spoke almost daily with Education  officials and received strong support. They noted that, as a result,  monitoring reviews were not stressful, and they were not surprised by the  results. Officials from another state said they appreciated the discussion  with Education officials about the state\u2019s amendment requests and how  Education worked with them to ensure that the state maintained its  original RTT goals.", "While RTT state officials expressed generally positive views about the  monitoring process overall, officials in nine states expressed concerns  about specific aspects of the process, including delays in the amendment  process, time-consuming monthly calls and related requirements, and  slow feedback from Education after site visits. Officials from one state  said monitoring requirements seemed more burdensome than those for  other federal education programs. Education officials stated that they  have revised some aspects of their monitoring process in response to  state feedback. For example, they modified the monthly monitoring call  and onsite review protocols, revised the amendment process and dollar  threshold amounts that require approval, and worked to explain the  rationale and use of the information Education requests.", "To ensure that states are held accountable for meeting their RTT goals  for teacher and principal evaluation systems, Education may take the  following corrective actions for states that have not demonstrated  adequate progress in implementing their systems:", "Conditional amendment approval. If Education has concerns about  a state\u2019s requested amendments to its RTT plans, it may grant  conditional approval, requiring the state to provide additional  information over a period of time. For example, Rhode Island  submitted a proposed amendment requesting a change related to its  use of SLOs. Education approved the request on the condition that  the state provide additional information, such as quarterly progress  updates during SY 2012-13 and additional reports. In addition,  Maryland received approval to decrease the percentage of the  evaluation component that is based on student academic growth  models on the condition that the state provide Education a plan for a  statewide field test of its evaluation systems. Maryland was also  required to commit to measuring student academic growth using  common assessments of high school teachers and principals when  those assessments are available, among other requirements.  Education may also elect not to approve an amendment request.", "High-risk status. Education placed 2 of the 12 RTT states\u2014Georgia  and Hawaii\u2014on high-risk status because officials determined that the  states required intensive attention and support in order to meet their  RTT goals. In July 2012, Education placed the teacher and principal  evaluation portion of Georgia\u2019s RTT grant on high-risk status because  officials were concerned about the overall strategic planning,  evaluation, and project management of the evaluation system.  Education officials also expressed concern that Georgia had  requested two major amendments that seemed to constitute  significant changes to the evaluation system in the state\u2019s approved  plan. As a result of the high-risk designation, Georgia was required to  provide Education a revised work plan for its system, monthly updates  in accordance with the work plan, and related information. As of July  2013, Education officials said the evaluation system portion of  Georgia\u2019s RTT grant remains on high-risk status because of  Education\u2019s continued concerns about the quality of implementation.  In December 2011, Education designated Hawaii\u2019s entire RTT grant  as high-risk because the state experienced major delays and made  inadequate progress on implementing its systems and because the  scope and breadth of amendment requests indicated a potentially  significant shift in the state\u2019s approved plans. Education temporarily  placed Hawaii on a cost-reimbursement basis, which required the  state to submit receipts for expenditures to the department prior to  drawing down grant funds. The state was also required to submit  documentation prior to obligating funds and to submit a revised scope  of work and budget. As of July 2013, Education had removed Hawaii\u2019s  high-risk designation based on the state\u2019s demonstrated progress in  implementing its RTT reforms, including its evaluation systems.", "Additional information. Education has required certain reporting or  follow-up information, other than that included in conditional approval  of amendments or high-risk status, and has used other measures  deemed appropriate. For example, according to Education officials,  one state that experienced procurement problems is required to  provide monthly procurement information to Education.", "Withholding of funds. Although Education may withhold grant funds  from states if they do not comply with the terms of the award,Education officials said they have not withheld funds from any RTT  state.

RSN officials said they provide  individualized assistance to states when requested, particularly for states  in more advanced stages of implementation with needs that could not be  met through larger group technical assistance activities. RSN also  developed publications related to teacher and leader effectiveness,  including case studies, tool kits, and lessons learned, and has provided  them through the RTT grantee web portal. These publications included  longer reports on school reform and shorter briefs, such as a paper that  described rules governing classroom observations used in teacher  evaluations in selected RTT states.", "RSN has worked to strengthen the quality of its technical assistance and  adapt to states\u2019 changing needs, according to Education and RSN  officials. They said that early in the contract, RSN revised its approach to  better meet the needs of states. For example, in response to state  feedback, RSN provided states with access to education practitioners  who had worked in schools rather than experts without hands-on  experience, as they had done in the initial stages of the contract. RSN  officials also said issues for which states requested technical assistance  changed as implementation progressed, and RSN adapted its technical  assistance accordingly. For example, early in implementation, states  often requested assistance with designing evaluation systems,  communicating with stakeholders, working with unions, and measuring  growth in nontested grades and subjects, according to RSN officials. As  implementation progressed, states requested assistance with issues such  as the consistency of observations and the sustainability of evaluation  systems.", "Officials from 10 of the 12 RTT states told us that Education\u2019s technical  assistance related to teacher and principal evaluation systems was  generally helpful, and officials in several states said assistance had  improved since the start of the contract. Officials from Hawaii said RSN  had helped states by sharing existing knowledge and developing new  information. Officials in Massachusetts told us that RSN\u2019s in-person  meetings had been especially helpful because they provided a platform  for states to share best practices. Although most states were  complimentary of RSN assistance, officials in some states said RSN and  Education could improve technical assistance by providing additional  information on specific topics, such as information about states that have  successfully implemented evaluation systems and more opportunities to  share lessons learned.", "A recent survey by RSN also indicates that states are generally satisfied  with the contractor\u2019s technical assistance on teacher and principal  evaluation systems. In March 2013, RSN surveyed and obtained  responses from officials in all RTT states regarding their perception of  technical assistance, including assistance provided through the teacher  and leader effectiveness community of practice. Sixteen of the 18 states  that participated in teacher and leader effectiveness assistance reported  that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the assistance, and the  remaining states were neutral. On multiple dimensions, the state officials  rated assistance with teacher and leader effectiveness higher than other  areas and higher than RSN activities overall. States also identified  opportunities for strengthening technical assistance by ranking potential  topics on the basis of impact and urgency. For teacher and leader  effectiveness, states ranked continuous improvement of teacher  evaluation as one of the top areas of interest, according to RSN.

Although  Education has not asked states to provide specific plans for addressing  sustainability, department officials said they have learned about state  plans through ongoing communication with states. For example, a few  states discussed their sustainability planning during monthly monitoring  calls. In addition, Education obtained information on state sustainability  strategies through RTT applications. In general, states provided this  information on RTT reforms as a whole.
