For fiscal years 2008 and 2009, Congress authorized the use of borrower fees to pay the costs of loan guarantees through Title XVII's \"borrower pays\" option, under which DOE will limit loan guarantees to $38.5 billion. Congress mandated that GAO review DOE's progress in implementing the LGP. GAO assessed DOE's progress in (1) issuing final regulations and (2) taking actions to help ensure that the program is managed effectively and to maintain accountability. GAO also assessed how inherent risks due to the nature of the LGP may affect DOE's ability to achieve intended program outcomes. GAO analyzed DOE's regulations, guidance, and program documents and files; reviewed Title XVII; and interviewed DOE officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In October 2007, DOE issued regulations that govern the LGP and include requirements for application submissions, project evaluation factors, and lender eligibility and servicing requirements. The regulations also generally address requirements set forth in applicable guidance. Some key aspects of the initial LGP guidelines were revised in the regulations to help make the program more attractive to lenders and potentially reduce financing costs for projects. For example, the maximum loan guarantee percentage increased from 80 to 100 percent of the loan. In addition, the regulations define equity as \"cash contributed by the borrowers,\" but DOE officials told us they also plan to consider certain non-cash contributions, such as land, as equity. As a result, applicants may not fully understand the program's equity requirements. DOE is not well positioned to manage the LGP effectively and maintain accountability because it has not completed a number of key management and internal control activities. As a result, DOE may not be able to process applications efficiently and effectively, although it has begun to do so. DOE has not sufficiently determined the resources it will need or completed detailed policies, criteria, and procedures for evaluating applications, identifying eligible lenders, monitoring loans and lenders, estimating program costs, or accounting for the program--key steps that GAO recommended DOE take over a year ago. DOE also has not established key measures to use in evaluating program progress. Risks inherent to the LGP will make it difficult for DOE to estimate subsidy costs, which could lead to financial losses and may introduce biases in the projects that receive guarantees. The nature and characteristics of the LGP and uncertain future economic conditions increase the difficulty in estimating the LGP's subsidy costs. Because the LGP targets innovative technologies and the projects will have unique characteristics--varying in size, technology, and experience of the project sponsor--evaluating the risks of individual projects will be complicated and could result in misestimates. The likelihood that DOE will misestimate costs, along with the practice of charging fees to cover the estimated costs, may lead to biases in the projects that receive guarantees. Borrowers who believe DOE has underestimated costs and has consequently set fees that are less than the risks of the projects are the most likely to accept guarantees. To the extent that DOE underestimates the costs and does not collect sufficient fees from borrowers to cover the full costs, taxpayers will ultimately bear the costs of shortfalls. Even if DOE's estimates of subsidy costs are reasonably accurate, some borrowers may not pursue a guarantee because they perceive the fee to be too high relative to the benefits of the guarantee, affecting the project's financial viability. To the extent that this financial viability is not distributed evenly across the technologies targeted by Title XVII, projects in DOE's portfolio may not represent the range of technologies targeted by the program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005)\u2014Incentives for  Innovative Technologies\u2014authorized the Secretary of Energy to  implement a new loan guarantee program (LGP) for energy projects that  satisfy three criteria: avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or  greenhouse gases; employ new or significantly improved technologies  compared with commercial technologies in service at the time the  guarantee is issued; and provide a reasonable prospect of repayment. To  date, the Department of Energy (DOE) has not approved any loan  guarantees under the LGP.", "Federal loan guarantee programs help borrowers obtain access to credit  with more favorable terms than they may otherwise obtain in private  lending markets because the federal government guarantees to pay lenders  if the borrowers default, which makes extending credit more attractive to  lenders. However, loan guarantee programs can expose the government to  substantial financial risks. In the past, problems with loan guarantee  programs have occurred, in part, because agencies did not exercise due  diligence during the loan origination and monitoring processes. In  addition, agencies have had difficulty estimating program costs because of  faulty assumptions that caused cost estimates to be too low, limited  historical data, and deficient policies and procedures for assessing risk  and estimating costs.", "Title XVII has a requirement related to the subsidy cost of the LGP: DOE  must either receive an appropriation for the subsidy cost or it must collect  fees from borrowers to cover the subsidy cost (referred to as the  \u201cborrower pays\u201d option). In DOE\u2019s appropriations acts for fiscal years 2007  and 2008, Congress specifically instructed DOE to proceed under the  borrower pays option. The subsidy cost, as defined by the Federal Credit  Reform Act (FCRA) of 1990, is the government\u2019s estimated net long-term  cost, in present value terms, of direct or guaranteed loans over the entire  period the loans are outstanding (not including administrative costs). In  calculating the subsidy cost for a guaranteed loan program, agencies  estimate (1) payments from the government to cover interest subsidies,  defaults, delinquencies, or other payments, and (2) payments to the  government, including fees, penalties, and recoveries on defaults. Under  FCRA, DOE would estimate the expected subsidy costs before issuing loan  guarantees and is generally required to annually update, or reestimate, this  cost to reflect actual loan performance and changes in expected future  loan performance. To the extent that DOE underestimates subsidy costs  and does not collect enough fees from borrowers, taxpayers will  ultimately make up the difference.", "Through the appropriations process, Congress authorizes the amount of  loans that may be guaranteed, thereby setting limits on the government\u2019s  exposure to financial losses. For DOE\u2019s LGP, Congress appropriated funds  out of any borrower fees to be received for DOE to make up to $4 billion  of loan guarantees for fiscal year 2007 and placed no cap on guarantees for  fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Because of the financial risks associated with  loan guarantees under the LGP, we assessed DOE\u2019s efforts to implement  the program in early 2007. We reported that rather than taking and  completing key steps to better ensure that the LGP would be well managed  and accomplish its objectives, DOE focused on soliciting preapplications  for proposed projects. We recommended that before DOE select eligible  projects for loan guarantees, it first issue program regulations, develop  policies and procedures for operating the program, and define goals and  metrics to measure program effectiveness. Subsequently, in Public Law  110-5, Congress directed DOE not to award any loan guarantees until it  issued final regulations. These regulations were to include programmatic,  technical, and financial factors for the Secretary of Energy to use in  selecting projects, as well as policies and procedures to monitor loans and  lenders.", "Congress also mandated that we annually review DOE\u2019s progress in  implementing the LGP and directed us to report to the House and Senate  Committees on Appropriations to help inform their oversight. In response,  we assessed DOE\u2019s progress in (1) issuing final regulations to govern the  program and (2) taking actions to help ensure that the program is  managed effectively and to maintain accountability. We also examined  whether inherent risks due to the nature and characteristics of the LGP  may affect DOE\u2019s ability to make the program pay for itself and support a  broad spectrum of innovative energy technologies.", "For this assessment, we reviewed and analyzed Title XVII of EPAct 2005,  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on federal credit  programs, GAO\u2019s guidance on Government Performance and Results Act  and standards for internal control, DOE\u2019s program guidance and  regulations, and other information. We interviewed relevant DOE officials.  We also reviewed preapplication files to determine if DOE conducted its  review process consistently and documented its decisions sufficiently. We  did not evaluate the technical or financial soundness of the projects DOE  invited to apply for loan guarantees. To examine whether the inherent risks  due to the nature and characteristics of the LGP may affect DOE\u2019s ability to  make the program pay for itself and support a broad spectrum of innovative  energy technologies, we reviewed reports by the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) and reviewed past GAO reports of other loan programs that  had some similar characteristics with the LGP. We did not assess the  benefits of this program because doing so at this stage would be premature.  It remains to be seen what projects will receive loan guarantees and when  this may occur. We recognize that the program could have substantial  benefits; our assessment of how the nature and characteristics of the LGP  may affect its effectiveness is not intended to address its overall merits.  Rather, our intent is to highlight how these aspects of the program could  have a bearing on program performance and what the LGP can achieve. We  conducted this performance audit from September 2007 through June 2008,  with limited updates after we sent the draft report to DOE for comment on  May 13, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Title  XVII identifies 10 categories of projects that are eligible for a loan  guarantee, such as renewable energy systems, advanced fossil energy  technologies, and efficient end-use energy technologies. Appendix II  provides a list of these categories.", "The LGP office is under DOE\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer. LGP\u2019s  actions are subject to review and approval by a Credit Review Board. The  Board met for the first time in April 2007; it approves major policy  decisions of the LGP, reviews LGP\u2019s recommendations to the Secretary of  Energy regarding the issuance of loan guarantees for specific projects, and  advises the Secretary on loan guarantee matters. DOE first received  appropriated funds for the LGP\u2019s administrative costs in early 2007 and  began processing preapplications\u2014in response to the August 2006  solicitation\u2014and at the same time began to obtain staff and take other  steps to initiate the program. During 2007, it reviewed preapplications for  143 projects and in October 2007 invited 16 of the preapplicants to submit  full applications for loan guarantees. Appendix II includes information on  the 16 projects invited to submit full applications. In general, according to  DOE, the processing of full applications will require DOE to have  numerous interactions with the applicants and private lenders. It will also  require financial, technical, environmental, and legal advisors to assist  with underwriting, approving, and issuing a loan guarantee. DOE  estimated that the time between receiving an application and completing  negotiations for a loan guarantee contract would range from 9 to 25  months, with additional time at the beginning to prepare and issue the  solicitation and at the end to close the loan.", "On April 11, 2008, DOE issued a fiscal year 2008 implementation plan for  $38.5 billion in solicitations, to respond to a requirement that DOE provide  Congress information about future solicitations 45 days prior to issuing  them. On June 30, 2008, DOE simultaneously issued three solicitations  that total $30.5 billion\u2014on (1) efficiency, renewable energy, and electric  transmission ($10 billion), (2) nuclear power facilities ($18.5 billion), and  (3) nuclear facilities for the \u201cfront end\u201d of the nuclear fuel cycle ($2  billion). DOE plans to subsequently issue a fourth solicitation in late  summer 2008 for advanced fossil energy projects ($8 billion). DOE is also  required to annually provide Congress a report on all activities under Title  XVII and issued the first report on June 15, 2007.

DOE had previously issued program guidelines in  August 2006. The final regulations contain requirements for preapplication  and application submissions; programmatic, technical and financial  evaluation factors for applications; and lender eligibility and servicing  requirements. The regulations incorporate and further clarify requirements  of Title XVII related to eligibility, fees, default conditions, and audit  documentation. The regulations also generally incorporate requirements  set forth in OMB Circular A-129 Policies for Federal Credit Programs and  Non-Tax Receivables, which prescribes policies and procedures for  federal credit programs, such as applicant screening, lender eligibility, and  corrective actions. Because loan guarantee programs pose significant  financial risks, it is important to include appropriate mechanisms to help  protect the federal government and American taxpayers from excessive or  unnecessary losses.", "DOE changed some key aspects of the initial program guidelines in its final  regulations to help make the program more attractive to lenders and  potentially reduce financing costs for projects. These changes included  increasing the maximum guarantee percentage, allowing the lender to  separate or \u201cstrip\u201d the nonguaranteed portion of the debt, and revising its  interpretation of a Title XVII requirement that DOE have superior right to  project assets pledged as collateral. Other important changes relate to  increased specificity in key definitions and a requirement for independent  engineering reports. Specifically, we found the following:    Guarantee percentage. The final regulations allow for loan guarantees of  up to 100 percent of the loan amount, which is limited to no more than 80  percent of the project costs, provided that, for a 100 percent guarantee, the  loan must be disbursed by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The use of  the FFB is required, in part, because a private lender may exercise less  caution when underwriting and monitoring a loan with a 100 percent  guarantee. The guidelines stated that DOE preferred not to guarantee  more than 80 percent of the loan amount, which was limited to no more  than 80 percent of the project costs. Because the regulations increased the  maximum guarantee percentage, this change increases the risk that the  government is willing to assume on a project by project basis.", "Stripping the nonguaranteed portion. When DOE guarantees 90 percent  or less of a loan, the final regulations allow the nonguaranteed portion of a  loan to be separated or \u201cstripped\u201d from the guaranteed portion. This  change allows lenders greater flexibility in selling portions of a loan on the  secondary market and could reduce overall funding costs for projects. In  contrast, the guidelines and the proposed regulations did not allow  stripping.", "Superiority of rights. Title XVII requires DOE to have superior rights to  project assets pledged as collateral. In the proposed regulations, DOE  interpreted this provision to require DOE to possess first lien priority to  assets pledged as collateral. Therefore, holders of nonguaranteed portions  of loans would be subordinate to DOE in the event of a default. In the final  regulations, DOE changed its interpretation to allow proceeds received  from the sale of project assets to be shared with the holders of  nonguaranteed portions of loans in the event of a default. As noted in  public comments on the proposed regulations, this practice is an  established norm in project lending. DOE stated that it retains superiority  of rights, as required by Title XVII, because DOE has sole authority to  determine whether, and under what terms, the project assets will be sold  at all.", "Key definitions. In the context of \u201cinnovative technologies,\u201d the final  regulations added a definition that clarified the definition of what  constitutes a \u201cnew or significantly improved\u201d technology, considerably  expanded the definition of \u201ccommercial\u201d technology already in use, and  clearly linked the definitions to each other. According to the regulations, a  new or significantly improved technology is one that has only recently  been developed or discovered and involves a meaningful and important  improvement in productivity or value in comparison with the commercial  technology in use. DOE\u2019s regulations define a commercial technology as  being in general use if it is employed by three or more commercial projects  in the United States for at least 5 years.", "Independent engineering report. The final regulations require the  applicant to provide an independent engineering report on the project,  which was not required under the guidelines. According to the regulations,  the engineering report should assess the project, including its site  information, status of permits, engineering and design, contractual  requirements, environmental compliance, testing and commissioning, and  operations and maintenance.", "Although the final regulations generally address requirements from  applicable guidance, we identified one key aspect related to equity  requirements that is not clear. The final regulations state that DOE will  evaluate whether an applicant is contributing significant equity to the  project. The regulations define equity as \u201ccash contributed by the  borrowers and other principals.\u201d Based on this definition, it appears that  non-cash contributions, such as land, would not be considered equity.  However, the LGP director told us that land and certain other non-cash  contributions could be considered equity.

DOE received one application in April 2008, which it has  begun to review, and DOE officials told us they will begin reviewing other  applications as soon as they are submitted. This influx of applications  could cause a surge in workload, but it is not clear that DOE has obtained  the resources it needs to carry out its application review activities.  Although it is critical for agencies to determine the timing and type of  resources needed, DOE has not determined the number and type of  contractor resources it will need to review the applications, which could  lead to delays. For example, DOE expects to need legal, engineering,  environmental, and financial contracting expertise but has not completed  plans describing the types of expertise needed, estimated when   the expertise will be required, or determined to what extent each type   of expertise will be needed. According to the LGP director, much of this  expertise will have to be acquired through new contracts that DOE must  negotiate and that generally take some months to put into place. To the  extent that these resources are not available when needed, DOE could  experience delays in reviewing the applications. In early April 2008, the  LGP director said that his office is working with other DOE offices to  develop these contracts and considers this activity high priority; while the  completion date for an acquisition and contract vehicles strategy was  initially set for the end of April, the timetable DOE includes in its agency  comments letter indicates an August 2008 completion date. In addition, as  of April the LGP office was 7 staff short of its authorized level of 16 for  fiscal year 2008; the director told us it has faced delays in hiring permanent  staff, although he indicated that the office has enough permanent staff to  review the first 16 applications.

Conducting the preapplication  process also enabled DOE to respond to congressional interest in  launching the program, according to DOE officials.", "We found that, during its preapplication review process, DOE did not  always sufficiently document why it ultimately selected projects that  reviewers did not score highly or recommend initially. DOE documented  the results of the selection process, including its technical and financial  reviews for individual projects, its joint technical-financial reviews for  categories of projects, and its decisions made during its secondary review  process. However, we found that DOE\u2019s documentation for deciding which  projects to recommend to the Credit Review Board did not always provide  sufficient justification. While our discussions with DOE officials helped  clarify the documentation for 6 of the 16 invited projects, they did not for 2  of those projects. According to DOE officials, they gave greater weight to  the technical merit than the financial merit of the projects during the  preapplication selection process. In addition, a consultant DOE hired to  review the preapplication process found that although the files were in  \u201cgood working order,\u201d DOE did not consistently conduct and document its  technical evaluations and did not document financial evaluations in depth.  The consultant recommended that DOE take steps to establish standards  for these evaluations and increase the level of transparency in the  preapplication evaluation process.", "We also found that the financial and technical criteria DOE used to review  the preapplications were not sufficiently defined in some cases.

After the initial review process was  completed, DOE further defined what it considers \u201cnew and significantly  improved\u201d in its final regulations, but has not correspondingly updated the  review criteria. In addition, when DOE conducted its financial reviews, it  evaluated projects by assigning scores between zero and four\u2014with zero  being the weakest score and four being the strongest score. However,  DOE did not define what the possible scores signified. Moreover, 60  percent of a preapplicant\u2019s financial score was based on creditworthiness;  yet, DOE did not require preapplicants to submit pertinent financial and  credit information such as audited financial statements or credit histories.", "DOE has not fully developed detailed internal policies and procedures,  including criteria, for selecting applications.

According to DOE officials, as of May 2008,  DOE has also hired one staff person to develop credit policies and  procedures specific to LGP, and to fully establish its credit policy function.  They also said that these credit policies and procedures would provide  internal guidance related to some aspects of application review.", "DOE officials told us they also expect the application process guidance  they developed for companies to also serve as internal review policies and  procedures.

The guidance generally aligns with information in the  final regulations on the factors DOE plans to review and should make it  easier for companies to develop applications. However, in some cases the  guidance lacks specificity for applicants. In addition, when considering the  guidance for use as internal policies and procedures, as DOE has indicated  it will be used, we determined that it does not contain criteria or guidance  that would be sufficient for DOE reviewers. Specifically, it lacks  instruction and detail regarding how DOE will determine project eligibility  and review applications, such as roles and responsibilities, criteria for  conducting and documenting analyses, and decision making. For example,  we found the following:    Project eligibility. DOE does not delineate how it will evaluate project  eligibility\u2014that is, how each project achieves substantial environmental  benefits and employs new or significantly improved technologies. The  guidance requires applicants to submit background information on the  technologies and their anticipated benefits but does not require enough  detail for DOE to assess the information. Without such detail, it is unclear  how DOE will measure each project\u2019s contribution to the program.", "Independent engineer\u2019s report. DOE\u2019s guidance does not provide  sufficient detail on the technical information applicants should submit in  this report, even though the guidance requires that the report  comprehensively evaluate five technical elements as well as contractual  requirements and arrangements. DOE officials told us that applicants  generally develop this report for investors and that the reports will likely  be of varying quality and detail. DOE officials also expect that, in  developing a separate report that assesses this information, they will likely  need to fill considerable gaps and conduct additional analyses.

However, the criteria DOE has established to evaluate creditworthiness\u2014 which it used during the preapplication process and plans to use for future  applications\u2014did not take into account the more meaningful and thorough  information required for the full application process.

OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission and  Execution of the Budget, calls for credit issued by FFB to be budgeted for  as a direct loan.

However, it has not yet gathered and  analyzed the necessary data on, for example, existing capacity or  current emission levels for categories of LGP project technologies.", "DOE included a measure for the recovery of administrative costs but  not one for the recovery of subsidy costs, which will most likely be the  more significant program cost.", "DOE\u2019s metric to assess the effectiveness of financing decisions\u2014 containing the loss rate to 5 percent\u2014may not be realistic; it is far  lower than the estimated loss rate of over 25 percent that we calculated  using the assumptions included in the fiscal year 2009 president\u2019s  budget."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Inherent Risks Will Make Estimating Subsidy Costs Difficult and May Introduce Self- Selection Biases in the Projects That Ultimately Receive Loan Guarantees", "paragraphs": ["The nature and characteristics of the LGP will make estimating the  program\u2019s subsidy costs difficult even if DOE develops a sound and  comprehensive methodology. Evaluating the risks of individual projects  applying for loan guarantees will be difficult because the LGP targets  innovative energy technologies and because projects will likely have  unique characteristics\u2014varying in size, technology, and experience of the  project sponsor. For the first solicitation alone, the technologies range  from a modest energy efficiency project to multiyear advanced coal  projects, and estimated project costs range from around $25 million to  more than $2 billion. In fiscal year 2008, DOE plans to further diversify the  types of technology projects that it will consider for its loan portfolio,  including nuclear power facilities, whose project costs may be more than  $5 billion for each facility. Further, DOE will not gain significant  experience in each technology because the program\u2019s objective is to  commercialize a limited number of each type of innovative technologies.  Therefore, the types of projects will, by design, evolve over time, and the  experience and data that DOE gains may not be applicable to evaluating  the risks of projects applying in the future.", "The composition of DOE\u2019s eventual portfolio will even further limit the  data available to help DOE evaluate project risks. Unlike an agency that  provides a high volume of loan guarantees for relatively similar purposes,  such as student loans or home loans, DOE will likely approve a small  number of guarantees each year, leaving it with relatively little experience  to help inform estimates for the future. In addition, DOE\u2019s loan guarantees  will probably be for large dollar amounts, several of which could range  from $500 million to more than $1 billion each. As a result, if defaults  occur, they will be for large dollar amounts and will likely not take place  during easily predicted time frames. Recoveries may be equally difficult to  predict and may be affected by the condition of the underlying collateral.  In addition, project risks and loan performance could depend heavily on  regulatory and legislative actions, as well as future economic conditions,  including energy prices and economic growth, which generally can not be  predicted accurately. These factors combine to make it difficult for DOE  to prepare reliable estimates of subsidy costs. To the extent that DOE  underestimates the costs of the LGP and does not collect enough fees from  borrowers, taxpayers will ultimately have to pay for any shortfalls. Under  FCRA, DOE is required to update, or reestimate, the subsidy costs of LGP  to reflect actual loan performance and changes in expected future loan  performance. Shortfalls identified in annual reestimates are automatically  funded by the federal government under the terms of the FCRA and are  not subject to congressional scrutiny during the annual appropriation  process.", "The likelihood of misestimates and the practice of charging fees to cover  all the estimated costs may lead to biases in the projects that ultimately  receive loan guarantees and tilt the portfolio of loan guarantees toward  those that will not pay for themselves. In general, potential borrowers will  know more about their projects and creditworthiness than DOE. As a  result, borrowers will be more likely to accept loan guarantee offers if they  believe DOE has underestimated the projects\u2019 risks and therefore set the  fee too low, than if they believe DOE has overestimated risks.  Underestimated fees amount to an implicit subsidy. The CBO reported that  such a bias in applicants\u2019 acceptance of loan guarantees increases the  likelihood that DOE\u2019s loan guarantee portfolio will have more projects for  which DOE underestimated the fee. CBO evaluated the cost of the LGP  and estimated that DOE would charge companies, on average, at least 1  percent lower than the likely costs of the guarantees. To the extent that  DOE underestimates the fee, and does not collect enough fees from  borrowers to cover the actual subsidy costs, taxpayers will bear the cost  of any shortfall.", "Even if DOE estimates the subsidy cost with a reasonable degree of  accuracy and charges the applicants fees to cover the true costs, there is a  potential for a self-selection bias in the companies participating in the  program toward those for which the fee is small relative to the expected  benefits of the loan guarantee (such as more favorable loan terms or a  lower interest rate). As CBO recently reported about the LGP, a loan  guarantee would improve a project\u2019s financial viability if the cost of the  guarantee is shifted to the federal government. However, when the  borrower pays a fee to cover the subsidy cost, as is the case with the LGP,  the cost and most of the risk stay with the project and the viability of the  project may not be substantially improved. Therefore, for such projects,  there is a practical limit to how large the fee can be without jeopardizing  the project\u2019s financial prospects; these constraints add to the challenge of  setting fees high enough to compensate for uncertainties. To the extent  that some projects targeted by Title XVII are not financially viable without  some form of federal assistance or favorable treatment by regulators,  these projects will not pursue loan guarantees even though they are  otherwise eligible. As a result, if this financial viability is not distributed  evenly across technologies targeted by Title XVII, the projects that  ultimately receive loan guarantees may not represent the full range of  technologies targeted by Title XVII.", "DOE officials noted that the borrower pays option may cause the more  risky potential borrowers that would be required to pay a higher fee to  either (1) contribute more equity to their projects to lower the fee or (2)  abandon their projects and not enter the program. If potential borrowers  contribute more equity, this could decrease default risk or improve  potential recoveries in the event of a default."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["More than a year has passed since DOE received funding to administer the  LGP and we recommended steps it should take to help manage the  program effectively and maintain accountability.

However, instead of working to ensure that controls are in place  to help ensure the program\u2019s effectiveness and to mitigate risks, DOE has  focused its efforts on accelerating program operations. Moreover, because  loan guarantee programs generally pose financial risk to the federal  government, and this program has additional inherent risks, it is critical  that DOE complete basic management and accountability activities to help  ensure that it will use taxpayer resources prudently. These include  establishing sufficient evaluation criteria and guidance for the selection  process, resource estimates, and methods to track costs and measure  program progress. Without completing these activities, DOE is hampering  its ability to mitigate risks of excessive or unnecessary losses to the  federal government and American taxpayers.", "The difficulties DOE will face in estimating subsidy costs could increase  LGP\u2019s financial risk to the taxpayer. If DOE underestimates costs, the  likely end result will be projects that do not fully pay for themselves and  an obligation to taxpayers to make up the difference. Furthermore, the  inherent risks of the program, along with the expectation that borrowers  will cover the costs of their loan guarantees, may lead to self-selection bias  that tilts the portfolio of projects toward those for which costs have been  underestimated. Neither we nor DOE will be able to fully evaluate the  extent or magnitude of the potential financial costs to the taxpayer until  DOE has developed some experience and expertise in administering the  program. Expanding the LGP at this juncture, when the program\u2019s risks  and costs are not well understood, could unnecessarily result in significant  financial losses to the government. Self-selection bias may also\u2014under  certain conditions\u2014lead to less than the full range of projects of  technologies targeted by Title XVII represented in the LGP. The likely  costs to be borne by taxpayers and the potential for self-selection biases  call into question whether the program can fully pay for itself; they also  call into question whether the program will be fully effective in promoting  the commercialization of a broad range of innovative energy technologies.", "It is important to note that, while we found that inherent risks and certain  features of the program may lead to unintended taxpayer costs and that  self-selection biases may reduce the scope of participation in the program,  this is not an indication that the overall costs of the program outweigh the  benefits. Rather, it simply means that the costs may be higher and the  benefits lower than expected. Finally, the extent to which these costs and  benefits will differ from expectations over the life of the program is  something that cannot be reasonably estimated until DOE gains some  experience in administering the LGP.

DOE further stated that our  report contains flawed logic, significant inaccuracies, and omissions;  however, DOE did not provide evidence to support these assertions. Our  evaluation of DOE\u2019s comments follows.  A more detailed analysis is  presented in appendix III.", "In particular, DOE stated that we placed disproportionate emphasis on  activities that should be completed for a fully implemented loan guarantee  program rather than one that is currently being implemented, and that we  overlooked DOE\u2019s accomplishments to date. We disagree. We believe that  our report accurately assesses the LGP in its early development stage and  focused our report\u2019s analysis and recommendations on activities that  should be completed before DOE begins to substantively review any  applications. DOE states that it will have completed many of these  activities before it issues loan guarantees, but we continue to believe these  activities should be completed before DOE reviews applications and  negotiates with applicants so that it can operate the program prudently. In  several cases, DOE cites as complete documents and activities that were,  and still are at the time of this report, in draft form. For example, in  several instances DOE states that it has \u201cimplemented\u201d its credit subsidy  model. However, as of June 24, 2008, DOE indicated that OMB has not  approved its model. Further, DOE illustrates in an updated timetable it  provides in its appendix B of its comment letter that a majority of these  activities are not yet complete and that several will not be complete until  the end of the calendar year 2008. DOE\u2019s entire letter, including its  appendixes, is reproduced as appendix III of this report.", "Regarding our recommendation on policies and procedures for conducting  reviews, DOE cites policies and procedures that it believes are adequate  for continuing program implementation. We disagree. DOE is developing  credit policies and procedures, but it does not have complete internal  application policies and procedures, which it should have as it begins to  review and negotiate its first loan guarantee applications. DOE also lacks  any substantive information in its external application guidance on how it  will select technologies. DOE has indicated that some of this information  will be included in future solicitations.", "DOE partially agreed with our recommendation to define the expertise it  will need to contract for and stated that it is developing descriptions of  necessary contractor expertise on a solicitation-specific basis. Although  DOE may plan to complete such descriptions and other preparatory work  for future solicitations, DOE did not provide us with any information for  contractor expertise for the 2006 solicitation. DOE\u2019s timetable provided in  Appendix B indicates an August 2008 completion date for its acquisition  strategy and contract vehicles; this target may be in time for future  solicitations but it is not in time for the applications that companies are  now submitting and DOE is reviewing. DOE also states that it is not  possible to develop generic definitions of needed contractor expertise  because the department\u2019s needs will vary from solicitation to solicitation.  We continue to believe it is both reasonable and feasible for DOE to  develop estimates for the timing and type of resources the department will  require. To be transparent and consistent in its review and negotiation  processes, DOE\u2019s statements of work within sectors and across sectors  should have similar frameworks and rationale. Specifically, DOE may need  assistance in areas common to all technologies, such as cost and risk  analysis, project management, and engineering and design reviews. DOE  should be able to start defining these and other areas on the basis of past  experience.", "DOE disagreed with our recommendation to provide more specific  application guidance on the content of independent engineering reports.

Providing more specificity to  companies on DOE\u2019s expectations for an application\u2019s content\u2014and basic  information about how it will review the projects\u2014will help companies  develop higher quality application materials and help ensure thorough,  consistent, and efficient evaluations. Taking this step is also likely to  decrease the number of requests for more analyses or information from  the applicant.

DOE stated it is appropriate to track the  costs of the LGP office and that it plans to develop a methodology for  doing so, but there is no reason to track the costs of certain support  activities.  We disagree.  Title XVII requires DOE to charge and collect fees  that the Secretary determines are sufficient to cover applicable  administrative expenses.  The federal accounting standard for managerial  cost accounting requires agencies to determine and report the full costs of  government goods and services, including both direct and indirect costs  associated with support activities.  Therefore, we believe it is appropriate  for DOE to consider costs associated with support activities, such as costs  associated with the time general counsel staff spend working on issues  related to the LGP, to be \u201capplicable administrative costs.\u201d  If DOE does  not consider support costs when setting fees, it cannot be assured that the  fees it collects will fully cover all administrative costs incurred to operate  the LGP.", "Regarding our recommendation to further develop and define  performance measures and metrics before substantially reviewing LGP  applications, DOE stated it has developed initial draft performance  measures and metrics with the aim of completing them by the end of  calendar year 2008.

As we stated in the draft report, LGP\u2019s director told us he has enough  resources for reviewing and negotiating the loan guarantee  applications related to the 2006 solicitation that companies are  submitting.  3.  We recognize DOE is in the process of hiring experienced staff.", "Nevertheless, the nature of the program may not allow DOE to develop  significant expertise for any particular technology.  4.  DOE has not yet developed final metrics and measures or gathered the  data necessary to establish meaningful sector-specific baselines for its  2006 solicitation, from which it formally invited 16 solar, biomass,  advanced fossil energy coal, and other projects to apply for loan  guarantees.  5.  We do not imply that DOE may be biased toward underestimating the  subsidy costs of the program. Rather, we point out that the LGP\u2019s  inherent risks due to its nature and characteristics could cause DOE to  underestimate its subsidy costs and therefore not collect sufficient  fees from borrowers.  6.  We do not believe that our report creates the impression that DOE  could choose not to develop a methodology to calculate the credit  subsidy cost. On the contrary, we state that it is critical that DOE  develop a sound and comprehensive methodology to estimate subsidy  costs because inherent risks due to the nature and characteristics of  the program will make estimating subsidy costs difficult.  7.  DOE did not provide us with a detailed presentation of the LGP\u2019s  credit subsidy model. On several occasions, the LGP director told us  that we would be given a detailed presentation once the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) approved the credit subsidy model. As  of June 24, 2008, DOE stated that OMB had not approved the model.  8.  We believe that our report and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  report DOE cites adequately explain the rationale for potential biases  in applicants\u2019 acceptance of loan guarantees that may increase the  likelihood that DOE\u2019s loan portfolio will have more projects for which  DOE underestimated the fee.  9.  The fiscal year 2009 President\u2019s budget states that the assumptions  related to the LGP reflect an illustrative portfolio; that is, the  assumptions do not apply to a specific loan. Nevertheless, the 25- percent loss rate assumption from the budget does call into question  whether the 5-percent loss rate draft metric DOE established to assess  the effectiveness of financing decisions is realistic.  10. We have not inaccurately characterized the operation of the Federal  Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). Instead, we specifically discuss  reestimates to explain that even though DOE is proceeding with LGP  under the provision that borrowers pay for the subsidy cost of the  program, taxpayers will bear the cost of any shortfall, depending on  the extent to which DOE underestimates the risks (subsidy cost) and  therefore does not collect sufficient fees from borrowers.  DOE  correctly states that reestimates that increase the subsidy costs are  funded by permanent indefinite budget authority, but DOE does not  explain that these funds come from taxpayers. Furthermore, because  of the nature and characteristics of the program, we believe it is  unlikely that the program as a whole will result in savings associated  with the subsidy cost because, to the extent that any loans default, the  cost of the default will likely be much larger than the fee collected.  Lastly, we did not discuss modifications under FCRA because DOE has  not completed its policies and procedures on estimating subsidy costs.  We would expect one component of these policies and procedures to  explain how DOE will identify, estimate the cost of, and fund  modifications.  11. If a project defaults, the cost of the default will likely be greater than  the fee collected, thus creating a shortfall. Under FCRA, this shortfall  would be identified during the reestimate process and would  ultimately be subsidized by taxpayers.  12. OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the  Budget, describes the budgetary treatment for credit programs under  FCRA requirements. While DOE explains that the financing accounting  is nonbudgetary (its transactions are excluded from the budget totals),  DOE fails to explain the sources of the financing account funds.  According to OMB Circular A-11, \u201can upward reestimate indicates that  insufficient funds had been paid to the financing account, so the  increase is paid from the program account to the financing account to  make it whole.\u201d The program account is a budgetary account, and its  transactions do affect the deficit and may require Treasury to borrow  from the public.  13. We recognize that DOE plans to take steps to assess risk and develop  mitigation strategies; however, we continue to believe that the nature  and characteristics of the LGP result in certain inherent risks that, by  definition, DOE is unlikely to be able to mitigate or accurately quantify.  As a result, there are likely to be many cases in which the risks will not  be covered by the borrower fee or a risk reserve.  In addition, even in  instances where DOE\u2019s estimates of subsidy costs are reasonably  accurate, the \u201cborrower pays\u201d option may cause some potential  borrowers to not pursue loan guarantees because the fee is too high  relative to the benefits to the borrower of the loan guarantee.   14. As stated in the report, the inherent risks of the program, along with  the expectation that borrowers will cover the costs of their loan  guarantees, may lead to self-selection bias that tilts the portfolio of  projects toward those for which costs have been underestimated. To  the extent that some projects targeted by Title XVII are not financially  viable without some form of federal assistance or favorable treatment  by regulators, these projects will not pursue loan guarantees even  though they are otherwise eligible. As a result, if this financial viability  is not distributed evenly across technologies targeted by Title XVII, the  projects that ultimately receive loan guarantees may not represent the  full range of technologies targeted by Title XVII.  15. We changed \u201cclearly\u201d to \u201csufficiently.\u201d We distinguish between the  technical and financial reviews that staff conducted, and the rational  and clarity of documentation that management provided for its  decision-making processes. We observed from our file review that,  when preapplications contained sufficient information, reviewers  applied the criteria LGP provided, and in some cases applied  additional criteria in their assessments. These assessments were  specific to the preapplication process, not the application process. At  times the preapplications lacked meaningful information for reviewers  to assess. The cases we highlight in our report are those in which the  LGP office did not provide sufficient justification for inviting projects.", "GAO welcomes the LGP\u2019s office efforts to establish formal standards  and procedures. In recommending that LGP complete its measures and  metrics associated with achieving benefits and employing new and  significantly improved technologies, we believe this effort will also  help inform future selection processes.  16. DOE did not require preapplications to include proforma \u201cfinancial  statements.\u201d Rather, preapplicants were required to submit financing  plans, estimated project costs, and a financial model detailing the  projected cash flows over the life cycle of the project. We believe that  audited financial statements and credit ratings would be more useful in  assessing creditworthiness. In addition, when evaluating  preapplications, DOE did not combine technical and financial scores.  Therefore, it is accurate to state that creditworthiness comprised 60  percent of the preapplicant\u2019s financial score.  17. DOE erroneously refers to the preapplication process here. This  analysis on project evaluation is specific to our discussion of project  eligibility, and DOE\u2019s use of external guidance as a proxy for internal  policies and procedures for applications.  18. The statement DOE cites is in context with the prior sentence, \u201cWhile  DOE recognizes these reports serve an important due diligence  function, DOE has not provided applicants with specific instructions  on what to include.\u201d This sentence is also prefaced with \u201cas a result\u201d in  the draft report. We changed the word \u201cunderwriting\u201d to \u201cevaluating\u201d  and added \u201capplications\u201d after \u201cloan guarantees\u201d to clarify our  statement.  19. We generally agreed with the consultant\u2019s finding. Specifically, we  found that DOE program offices used Credit Review Board-approved  criteria as well as other criteria. In one case, these criteria were  appropriate to differentiate projects in accordance with Title XVII. We  could not fully determine whether the use of these additional criteria  had any impact on the selection process.  20. See also comment 17. DOE\u2019s response does not address our report\u2019s  analysis; specifically, we are referring to DOE\u2019s application guidance.  In addition, while DOE\u2019s final rule states what applicants should  submit, it and the application guidance do not indicate how DOE will  evaluate these submissions.  21. Federal loan guarantees do help borrowers obtain more favorable  terms than they may otherwise obtain. For example, a borrower may  be able to get a lower interest rate, an extended grace period, or a  longer repayment period when the loan is guaranteed by the federal  government.  22. For clarification, we revised the report to indicate that DOE needs to  \u201cidentify eligible lenders.\u201d  23. For clarification, we incorporated DOE\u2019s suggested revision.  24. We revised the report to reflect this update of information.  25. We revised the report to state \u201cAccording to DOE, as of May 2008, DOE  has hired one staff person to develop credit policies and procedures  specific to LGP, and to fully establish its credit policy function.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Marcia Carlsen and Karla  Springer, Assistant Directors; Abe Dymond; Richard Eiserman; Jeanette M.
