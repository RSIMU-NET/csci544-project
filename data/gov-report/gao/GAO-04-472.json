GAO attempted to examine the relationship between uncompensated care and undocumented aliens by surveying hospitals, but because of a low response rate to key survey questions and challenges in estimating the proportion of hospital care provided to undocumented aliens, GAO could not determine the effect of undocumented aliens on hospitals' uncompensated care costs. Federal funding has been available from several sources to help hospitals cover the costs of care for undocumented aliens. The sources include Medicaid coverage for emergency medical services for eligible undocumented aliens, supplemental Medicaid payments to hospitals treating a disproportionate share of low-income patients, and funds provided to 12 states by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In addition, the recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 appropriated $1 billion over fiscal years 2005 through 2008 for payments to hospitals and other providers for emergency services provided to undocumented and certain other aliens. By September 1, 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish a process for hospitals and other providers to request payments under the statute. Border Patrol and U.S. port-of-entry officials encounter aliens needing medical attention under different circumstances, but in most situations, Homeland Security is not responsible for aliens' hospital costs. The agency may cover medical expenses only for those people in its custody, but border officials reported that sick or injured people they encounter generally receive medical attention without being taken into custody."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An estimated 7 million undocumented aliens resided in the United States  in 2000, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  Concern has been raised that uncompensated care costs due to treating  undocumented aliens place financial strain on hospitals in many areas of  the United States, including along the U.S.-Mexican border. Some hospital  associations and hospital officials report that increasing numbers of  persons they believe to be undocumented aliens, including some whom  the U.S. Border Patrol has encountered and found in need of immediate  medical attention, are arriving at their hospitals. In addition, U.S. port-of- entry officials may grant aliens humanitarian parole, a means of allowing  temporary access into the United States, and these aliens may also arrive  at hospitals in need of medical care. Because federal law requires hospitals  participating in the federal Medicare health insurance program to  medically screen and, if necessary, treat to stabilize any person seeking  care for an emergency medical condition, regardless of immigration status,  some hospital officials have said they believe the federal government  should help pay for emergency and other medical care provided to  undocumented aliens.", "Although hospital officials contend that they are left to absorb  uncompensated care costs for emergency treatment and other medical  services provided to undocumented aliens, questions remain about the  magnitude of the problem. No national data are available on the number of  undocumented aliens who receive medical care, the specific services they  receive, or the uncompensated care costs associated with their treatment.  At your request, we conducted a study to address this issue. We focused  our work on the following questions:    To what extent are hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs related to treating  undocumented aliens?", "What has been the availability of federal funding sources to help offset  hospitals\u2019 costs of treating undocumented aliens?", "What is the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security  (Homeland Security) to cover the medical expenses of aliens needing  emergency medical care who are either encountered by Border Patrol  agents or granted humanitarian parole by U.S. port-of-entry officials?", "To conduct this work, we focused our review on 10 states: Arizona,  California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,  North Carolina, and Texas. We selected the 4 Southwest states\u2014Arizona,  California, New Mexico, and Texas\u2014because uncompensated care costs  due to treating undocumented aliens has been a long-standing issue for  hospitals located in communities near the U.S.-Mexican border. We  selected the other 6 states because high estimated numbers of  undocumented aliens resided there in 2000, according to INS. In all, the 10  states comprised an estimated 78 percent of the population of  undocumented aliens in the United States in 2000. We mailed a  questionnaire to 503 hospitals located in the 10 states. We received survey  responses from 351 hospitals (70 percent), of which 198 (39 percent of  surveyed hospitals) provided the information necessary for us to calculate  their total uncompensated care costs and the proportion of care they  provided to patients without a Social Security number, a proxy we used  for undocumented aliens. To determine the availability of federal funding  sources to hospitals treating undocumented aliens, we obtained  documents and interviewed officials from state Medicaid offices and state  hospital associations in the 10 states, as well as from the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS). In addition, we reviewed provisions of the recently enacted  Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003  pertaining to payments to providers for treating undocumented and other  aliens. Finally, to determine the policies and practices used by the U.S.  Border Patrol and U.S. port-of-entry officials when they encounter aliens  needing emergency medical care, we interviewed Homeland Security  officials, including officials from relevant Border Patrol jurisdictions and  U.S. ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Many states that had relatively few undocumented aliens in 1990  experienced rapid growth of this population during the decade. The  estimated number of undocumented aliens residing in Georgia, for  example, rose from 34,000 in 1990 to 228,000 in 2000. INS estimates  indicate that the vast majority of undocumented aliens were concentrated  in a few states, with nearly 70 percent from Mexico.", "Undocumented aliens\u2019 use of medical services has been a long-standing  issue for hospitals, particularly among those located along the U.S.- Mexican border. As required by the Emergency Medical Treatment and  Active Labor Act (EMTALA), hospitals participating in Medicare must  medically screen all persons seeking emergency care and provide the  treatment necessary to stabilize those determined to have an emergency  condition, regardless of income or immigration status. Two recent studies  have reported on hospitals\u2019 provision of care to undocumented aliens, but  they were limited in scope. National data sources on health insurance  coverage do not report the extent to which undocumented aliens have  health insurance or are otherwise able to pay for their medical care.  Available data on the broader category of foreign-born noncitizens  suggests that a large proportion may be unable to pay for their medical  care.

The bureau\u2019s Office of Field  Operations oversees U.S. port-of-entry officials who inspect and determine  the admissibility of all individuals seeking to enter the United States at  official ports of entry. Both Border Patrol agents and U.S. port-of-entry  officials may come into contact with persons needing emergency medical  care. For example, Border Patrol agents may encounter persons suffering  from severe dehydration or who have been injured in vehicle accidents,  and U.S. port-of-entry officials may encounter persons with urgent medical  needs, such as burn victims, seeking entry because the closest capable  medical facility is in the United States.", "Border Patrol operations are divided into 21 sectors, but more than 95  percent of Border Patrol apprehensions in 2002 occurred in 9 sectors  bordering Mexico. Since the mid-1990s, the Border Patrol has been  implementing a strategy to strengthen security and disrupt traditional  pathways of illegal immigration along the border with Mexico. As we  reported in August 2001, however, one of the strategy\u2019s major effects has  been a shift in illegal alien traffic from traditional urban crossing points  such as San Diego, California, to harsher, more remote areas of the  border. Rather than being deterred from illegal entry, many aliens have  instead risked injury and death trying to cross mountains, deserts, and  rivers. To reduce the number of undocumented aliens who die or are  injured trying to cross the border illegally, INS in 1998 created the Border  Safety Initiative, whose focus includes searching for and rescuing those  who may have become lost. One element of the initiative is tracking the  number of aliens whom Border Patrol agents rescue, a subset of all Border  Patrol encounters with sick or injured aliens.", "U.S. port-of-entry officials inspect and determine the admissibility of  persons seeking entry at air, land, and sea ports of entry around the  country.

Determining the number of undocumented aliens  treated at a hospital is challenging because hospitals generally do not  collect information on patients\u2019 immigration status and because  undocumented aliens are reluctant to identify themselves. After speaking  with experts and hospital administrators, we determined that one  potentially feasible method for hospitals to estimate this population is to  identify patients without a Social Security number, recognizing that this  proxy can over- or underestimate undocumented aliens. We surveyed 503  hospitals in 10 states to collect information on patients without a Social  Security number and their effect on hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care  levels\u2014that is, uncompensated care costs as a percentage of total hospital  expenses.

Although about 70 percent of  hospitals responded to the survey, only 39 percent provided sufficient  information to evaluate the relationship between uncompensated care  levels and the proportion of care provided to patients without a Social  Security number. Of all responding hospitals, fewer than 5 percent  reported having a method other than the lack of a Social Security number  alone to identify their undocumented alien patients, and the methods used  by these hospitals varied. For example, one hospital identified  undocumented aliens as those who were both Hispanic and lacked a  Social Security number; other hospitals identified undocumented alien  patients through foreign addresses or information from patient interviews.  Furthermore, the estimates produced by these other methods were  inconsistent with those produced by using lack of Social Security number  alone. Because we did not receive a sufficient survey response rate and  because we were unable to assess the accuracy of the proxy, we could not  determine the effect of undocumented aliens on hospital uncompensated  care levels.

Enrollment in  Medicaid involves filling out an application; providing personal  information such as income and place of residency; and, in some states, an  interview.

The hospital that  treated most of the paroled patients reported receiving no payment for any  of the 27 patients paroled from June through August 2003 and noted that 4  of these patients were later transferred to other hospitals for further care.  The other 19 paroles occurred at three ports of entry in Arizona and three  ports of entry in Texas, near small towns straddling the border.", "Most (17 of 24) of the Southwest border ports of entry reported granting  no paroles for urgent medical reasons from June through October 2003.  Officials at three ports of entry we reviewed granted no humanitarian  paroles for urgent medical reasons during that time and are located near  large cities in Mexico. Officials at one of these ports of entry told us that  hospital care is available in the Mexican cities across the border, so that  Mexican residents need not be treated at U.S. hospitals. Hospital officials  in Arizona noted that several Arizona hospitals and the U.S. government  have provided funds and equipment to help improve the capabilities of  nearby Mexican medical facilities and that these measures helped reduce  their burden of cases from Mexico.", "Finally, although aliens may be granted humanitarian parole for urgent  medical reasons, several port-of-entry officials told us that the majority of  persons seeking entry into the United States for emergency medical care  have proper entry documents. For example, some aliens arriving at U.S.  hospitals may be Mexican nationals with border crossing cards, which  allow entry into the United States within 25 miles of the border for  business or pleasure for up to 72 hours. Another port official reported that  many U.S. citizens live in Mexico and sometimes arrive in ambulances to  go to U.S. hospitals. According to some officials responsible for ports of  entry, hospitals may not be fully aware of the immigration status of  patients who have crossed the border to obtain emergency medical care;  this uncertainty may create the impression that ports are granting more  humanitarian paroles for urgent medical reasons than they are."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Despite hospitals\u2019 long-standing concern about the costs of treating  undocumented aliens, the extent to which these patients affect hospitals\u2019  uncompensated care costs remains unknown.

Likewise, with respect to  undocumented aliens referred to hospitals but not first taken into custody  by the Border Patrol, neither the Border Patrol nor hospitals track their  numbers, making it difficult to estimate these patients\u2019 financial impact on  hospitals. Until reliable information is available on undocumented aliens  and the costs of their care, accurate assessment of their financial effect on  hospitals will remain elusive, as will the ability to assess the extent to  which federal funding offsets their costs.

The  agency said it is currently developing a process for providers to claim  these funds and indicated that it would be helpful for GAO to provide  insight into the specific internal controls that would be useful in ensuring  that claims are paid only for unreimbursed emergency services for  undocumented and certain other aliens. In response to CMS\u2019s request, we  amended our recommendation to be more specific. CMS also agreed that  the new federal funding may offer an incentive for those hospitals  incurring significant costs for undocumented aliens to collect more  reliable information on the number of undocumented alien patients they  treat and the costs of their care, but it also noted that other providers,  especially those who do not regularly see undocumented aliens in  emergency department settings, may choose to continue to provide  uncompensated care to this population without ever trying to document  the costs.
