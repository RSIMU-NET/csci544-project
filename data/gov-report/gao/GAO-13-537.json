First, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) along with PIF and other entities have committed to lend $485 million to the Affordable Mortgage and Loan Company (AMAL) to support mortgages for low- and medium-income borrowers in the West Bank. OPIC has committed to lend about $313 million; PIF has committed about $72 million, and two banks account for the balance of the committed lending. However, as of April 2013, OPIC and PIF had not yet disbursed any funds. Second, OPIC and PIF are co-guarantors in a Loan Guarantee Facility (LGF) program in the West Bank, guaranteeing up to $110 million and $50 million in loans, respectively, to nine regional banks to support lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Third, USAID officials stated that, in 2009, USAID provided a U.S. implementing partner $2.1 million for technical assistance and training to enhance the lending practices of participating banks in support of the LGF. Finally, according to USAID, it provided about $1.3 million from 2010 to 2013 to three U.S. implementing partners to provide technical, in-kind, and scholarship assistance to the American International School in Gaza (AISG), which is owned by the Palestine Technology and Education Complex, a PIF-owned entity.

OPIC officials stated that OPIC has vetted PIF's board of directors and senior executives, the non-U.S. board members and shareholders of AMAL, and key officials of the banks against information sources such as the FBI Terrorist Screening Center database, OFAC list, and OPIC's Information Center databases. For the LGF program, OPIC said that, based on OPIC's procedures and the LGF agreements, it has vetted all the participating banks and has vetted key officials of each borrower and guarantor before loans are approved using information sources such as Treasury's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes and FBI's Terrorist Screening Center databases. According to USAID officials, its process for vetting key participants of the Technical Assistance and Training program and the AISG program was based on documented vetting procedures for the West Bank and Gaza Mission.

The government of Israel and the Palestine  Liberation Organization signed the Oslo Peace Accords, which called for  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of the West Bank and Gaza and  affirmed the Palestinian right to self-government within those areas, under  the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority was established in  May 1994 to begin assuming self-governing responsibilities in the West  Bank and Gaza Strip.  1994: PCSC, Forerunner of the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF),  Established as a Holding Company. The Palestinian Authority began  acquiring shareholdings in a number of companies across various sectors  of the economy. According to a report by the World Bank,commercial undertakings were placed under the umbrella of a holding  company, the Palestine Commercial Services Company (PCSC),  managed by the economic advisor to the Palestinian Authority\u2019s then- president, Yasser Arafat. According to the World Bank Report, the PCSC  had full equity ownership of the Cement Company, which held an  exclusive contract for the import of cement from Israel. In addition, the  report stated that PCSC had partnerships with private investors in  numerous businesses, including hotels, casinos, cigarettes, telecoms,  real estate, flour milling, and other sectors.  1997: Inquiry Finds PCSC Profits Diverted Outside of Palestinian  Authority Budget. According to the World Bank report, following a public  inquiry, the Palestinian Legislative Council found that PCSC was not  monitored by the external audit body of the Palestinian Authority, known  as the General Audit Institute, and that PCSC generated significant  profits, which were diverted outside of the Palestinian Authority budget.  Additionally, the report stated that the finances of the PCSC were not  released to Palestinian Legislative Council members or the public.  2000: Initiative Calls for PIF Creation. The International Monetary Fund  (IMF) and President Arafat initiated the Economic Policy Framework  reform which, among other reforms, called for the creation of a Palestine  Investment Fund, although no action was taken to establish such a fund  at that time. According to a report by the IMF,Framework initiative resulted in two achievements: the consolidation of  excise tax revenue within the Minister of Finance\u2019s office, and the auditing  of the assets of the PCSC.  2000: External Audit Values PCSC\u2019s Asset at $345 million. An external  audit of PCSC\u2019s 1999 operations found that the PCSC had net profits of  $77 million and assets valued at $345 million. In addition to this audit, an  IMF report found that many of PCSC\u2019s commercial operations were  funded from diverted tax revenue. These commercial activities generated  profits which, according to the IMF report, were also being diverted away  from the Palestinian Authority budget. Because PCSC did not publish  balance sheets or annuals reports, the IMF reported that it was difficult to  determine PCSC\u2019s profits between 1995 and 2000; however, the IMF  estimated that about $300 million in profits from PCSC were channeled  outside of the Palestinian Authority budget from 1995 to 2000.  2002 (June): Reform Plan Prepared. A new Palestinian Authority cabinet  was appointed and a ministerial committee prepared a 100-day reform  plan, which, according to an IMF report, began addressing revenue  consolidation, budget reform, and monopolies, among other reforms.  2002 (October): PIF Formally Established. According to the World Bank  report, as part of broader reforms the Palestinian Authority was  undertaking under the 100-day plan, PIF was formally established by  presidential decree, to consolidate all Palestinian Authority commercial  activities and asset ownership. According to the report, it became illegal  for the Palestinian Authority to conduct any commercial activity or hold  any assets outside of PIF.", "According to a PIF official, the President appointed a board of  directors, which included the Minister of National Economy and was  chaired by the Minister of Finance.", "The report noted that the board of directors ordered a full valuation  and transparency assessment of Palestinian Authority assets\u2014 previously held under PCSC\u2014to be transferred to PIF.  2003: External Assessment Values PIF Assets at $633 million. The  Democracy Council and Standard and Poor\u2019s published the valuation and  transparency assessment of Palestinian Authority assets, as ordered by  the board of directors.", "As of January 1, 2003, PIF assets were valued at $633 million,  including 67 commercial entities and liquid assets.  2006-2007: PIF Governance Structure Changed Following Hamas  Legislative Election Victory. According to PIF and U.S. officials, following  the Hamas victory in the Palestinian legislative elections, President Abbas  initiated major changes in the governance structure of PIF. According to a  PIF official, the changes to the governance structure were initiated to  insulate PIF\u2019s assets from Hamas interference. By Presidential decree,  both the Minister of National Economy and the Minister of Finance were  removed from the board and replaced by external appointees.  2008: President Appointed 30-member General Assembly. According to  its annual report, PIF added a 30-member general assembly to its  governance structure to provide strategic guidance to the board of  directors, with the Palestinian Authority President appointing each  assembly member to serve a 3-year term. According to a PIF official, this  change was made in accordance with existing Palestinian corporate law  and to enhance accountability, transparency, and good governance.   2011: Hamas Seized PIF Assets in Gaza. Hamas seized a number of PIF  assets in Gaza, including PIF\u2019s branch office, a commercial building, and  a juice factory. Following the seizure of assets, PIF officials released a  statement denouncing the seizures as illegal and in violation of  Palestinian law. A PIF official estimated the value of these assets at  around $10 million, which PIF had to write off. According to this official, as  of February 2013, PIF\u2019s only remaining asset in Gaza is vacant land,  valued at about $5 million. The official also told us that PIF has no control  over or access to the vacant land, which Hamas has publicly stated it has  seized. However, the official noted that PIF continues to keep the land on  its books because Hamas has not taken physical control of the land.   2013 (June): PIF currently governed by Board of Directors and Generally  Assembly. According to PIF\u2019s audited financial statements and a PIF  official, PIF is governed by a board of directors and a general assembly,  both appointed by the Palestinian Authority President. The board of  directors is comprised of 11 members responsible for setting and  overseeing PIF\u2019s goals and objectives, while the general assembly,  comprised of 30 members, provides strategic guidance to the board.  According to PIF\u2019s publicly available annual financial statements, Ernst  and Young was PIF\u2019s external auditor from 2006 to 2012. According to a  PIF official, internal auditing functions at PIF are performed by Deloitte, to  help ensure there are adequate internal controls and that management  complies with the law and standards governing administrative and  investment operations.
