VA's updated plan states that the agency will develop goals and measures for all appeals options after fully implementing appeals reform.

According to VA, developing this measure is not feasible because the  legacy process has no defined endpoint. Submission of additional  evidence by veterans can, at any point, cause additional cycles of re- adjudication. However, VA has not articulated other options for comparing  the timeliness of the new and legacy processes in its May 2018 update to  its plan.

VA\u2019s updated plan  provided new details about some sub-activities related to processing  legacy appeals, monitoring implementation, drafting Board policies, and  training. Moreover, the May 2018 updated master schedule was  reorganized to improve its flow and alignment, according to VA officials.  However, the overall updated master schedule generally does not  indicate logical relationships regarding the sequence in which activities  should occur, and whether any delays in one activity will dynamically  affect other activities linked to it. This type of logic is necessary to define  both when an activity may start and finish and when an activity must start  and finish for meeting a specified program completion date. These are  known as early and late dates, respectively. For example, the plan does  not indicate the latest date regulations can fall behind schedule before the  planned February 2019 implementation date is impacted, or related  activities such as training. This sound planning practice is especially  important because VA officials said the agency is concurrently executing  many of the activities. Without logical relationships, the master schedule  is less effective for modeling the impact of delayed or accelerated  activities on related activities, and ultimately for estimating the final  implementation date.", "Interim goals and milestones for monitoring implementation. VA has  taken steps to address this aspect of the recommendation. In addition to  reiterating the use of an agency-wide governance structure to coordinate  implementation of its new appeals process, VA in its updated May 2018  plan added indicators to monitor and assess its readiness for full  implementation. Indicators include monitoring the status of implementing  regulations and information technology as well as considering any  lessons learned through its piloting of the new process.

For BEAAM, the Board  is partnering with veterans service organizations to identify 50 veterans  who are dissatisfied with a recent claim decision, and allowing these  veterans to appeal directly to the Board. Participating veterans have  begun opting in, and VA plans to collect information on adjudication of  these appeals.

Further, VA  anticipates using the analyses to determine distribution of resources, and  quickly react to changes in its pending legacy and new appeals  processes, and other trends.

It also states that VA will use the  results to inform the assumptions in its sensitivity analyses. In addition,  the updated plan states that VBA is refining the methods to evaluate  RAMP.", "The applicability of BEAAM results to a fully implemented appeals  process may be limited. For example, the BEAAM pilot and the Board\u2019s  implementation of RAMP provide limited time in which to conduct and  assess the results. Moreover, because VA\u2019s test is very small in scale (up  to 50 veterans), it will be important for VA to consider, for example,  whether these appeals reflect the complexity of cases and the range of  circumstances expected in a fully implemented new appeals process.

VA officials said they would consider these concerns.", "Finally, although VA\u2019s updated plan includes a timeline for testing and  assessing the new processes, VA\u2019s updated schedule indicates that VA is  planning to assess RAMP results between February 15, 2019 and May  10, 2019.

Thus, VA may not have comprehensively reflected key risks in its updated  plan.", "In conclusion, although VA intends to fully implement the new disability  appeals process in about 6 months (February 2019), VA still has an  opportunity to create a stronger foundation of sound planning practices.  To its credit, VA has taken a number of positive steps toward  implementing our prior recommendations to improve its planning for  disability appeals reform while it attends to legacy appeals. Efforts such  as testing Board appeals options and resuming sensitivity analysis will  provide useful information to guide VA through the uncertainty often  associated with process change. However, VA needs to fully address our  four recommendations to reasonably assure smooth implementation of  appeals reform.
