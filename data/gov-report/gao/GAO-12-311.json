These efforts include air sovereignty alert (ASA) operations, for which the Air Force provides personnel and fully fueled, fully armed aircraft sitting on constant alert at 18 sites across the United States. In 2009, GAO found shortcomings in the Department of Defense\u0092s (DOD) management of ASA operations, leading to a number of GAO recommendations. For this report, GAO examined the extent to which (1) the Air Force has implemented GAO\u0092s 2009 recommendations, (2) DOD has implemented a risk-based management approach for ASA operations, and (3) the Air Force has accurately identified expenditures for ASA operations. To do so, GAO analyzed relevant strategies, planning documents, guidance, and expenditure data; and interviewed North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), Air Force, National Guard Bureau, and other DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has not fully implemented the recommendations from GAO\u0092s 2009 report. With regard to GAO\u0092s recommendation that the military services should formally assign ASA duties to the units that consistently conduct them and ensure that the readiness of those units is fully assessed, the Air Force did so. However, the National Guard Bureau is considering reversing that action because it believes that the recommendation can be better addressed through the Air Force\u0092s standard deployment process. The Air Force has also not established a timetable to implement ASA as a steady-state mission; has not developed and implemented a plan to recapitalize the aging fighter aircraft that conduct ASA operations before the end of their service lives; and, when ASA units are deployed to support other ongoing operations, the Air Force continues to identify replacement units to perform the ASA mission on an ad hoc basis. All of the above were related to recommendations GAO made to the Air Force in its 2009 report. Separately, GAO found considerable confusion about the capabilities associated with ASA operations in part because, in September 2011, NORAD stopped using the term \u0093air sovereignty alert\u0094 and created a new term, \u0093aerospace control alert\u0094 (ACA), without clearly defining ACA or the missions that are now included within it.", "DOD has taken a series of actions for ASA operations that are consistent with a risk-based management approach. However, several key actions have yet to be taken that would enable the department to better balance risk and costs. Risk-based management includes conducting routine risk assessments that evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and criticality of assets, as recommended in GAO\u0092s 2009 report, and selecting between alternative courses of action to mitigate risk and make decisions about allocating resources. Although threats to the nation\u0092s air sovereignty continue to emerge and evolve, GAO found that DOD is unable to measure the extent to which ASA helps to achieve the department\u0092s homeland-defense goal of securing the United States from direct attack because DOD has not established performance measures. NORAD has not conducted routine risk assessments of ASA operations. DOD has also yet to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for two of the three alternatives to current ASA operations that GAO evaluated. Adopting a more-rigorous risk-based management approach\u0097including balancing risk and costs\u0097would help policymakers within DOD and elsewhere more effectively allocate finite DOD resources.", "Weak internal controls limit the ability of the Air Force and National Guard Bureau to accurately identify ASA expenditures. GAO analyzed the fiscal year 2010 expenditure information that the Air Force and National Guard Bureau submitted to Congress along with DOD\u0092s fiscal year 2012 budget justification and found the reported expenditures of more than $246 million to be inaccurate. For example, GAO found that the Air Force overstated ASA flying-hour expenditures by at least $22 million and included expenditures related to national special-security events, which are not part of ASA operations. GAO found that the Air Force\u0092s ability to identify ASA expenditures is limited by unclear roles and responsibilities for programming and budgeting and a lack of guidance on defining and tracking ASA expenditures. These types of internal controls are important to ensuring basic accountability, maintaining funds control, and preventing fraud and abuse."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress may wish to consider requiring the Air Force to fully implement GAO\u0092s 2009 recommendations.

As a result of  these efforts, the Transportation Security Administration believes that a  hijacking scenario over the United States remains a possibility although it  is less likely to occur today. Other threats to the nation\u2019s air sovereignty  continue to emerge and evolve. As a part of the federal government\u2019s  overall efforts to protect U.S. airspace, the Department of Defense (DOD)  performs Operation Noble Eagle, which consists of several operations,  including the maintenance of fighter aircraft and trained personnel on alert  24 hours a day, 365 days a year, at 18 alert sites across the United  States. Since its inception in 2003, these efforts have been commonly  referred to as air sovereignty alert (ASA) operations. The ASA sites serve  to deter, respond to, and if necessary, defeat airborne threats over the  United States and Canada. In effect, these fighter jets can be the last line  of multiple layers of defense.", "As a component of Operation Noble Eagle, ASA operations are  conducted by several DOD components under the command of North  American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) for the airspace over  North America, which includes Alaska and the continental United States,  and under the command of U.S. Pacific Command for the airspace over  the state of Hawaii and U.S. territories in the Pacific. The Joint Chiefs of  Staff have directed the Air Force (among other components) to provide  support for ASA operations. Generally, Air National Guard aircraft and  personnel are used for alert, since the National Guard Bureau believes  that ASA operations are consistent with the Air National Guard\u2019s  homeland mission. Both the Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command and the  National Guard Bureau believe that Air National Guard units can conduct  alert duty with less effect on overseas missions and at a lower cost than  active-duty Air Force units. Consequently, Air National Guard units are on  alert at 17 of the 18 ASA sites. In addition, units at all 18 ASA sites (i.e.,  both Air National Guard and active-duty personnel) are dual-tasked to  conduct both expeditionary missions, such as Operation Enduring  Freedom in Afghanistan, and ASA operations.", "In January 2009, we issued a report that identified a number of   First, we found shortcomings in DOD\u2019s management of ASA operations. that NORAD faced difficulty determining the appropriate levels and types  of units, personnel, and aircraft for ASA operations. We also found that,  after 8 years of operations, the Air Force had not yet established ASA as  a steady-state mission, which would include integrating ASA operations  into the Air Force\u2019s planning, programming, and budgeting cycle. Partly  resulting from the absence of a steady-state mission, NORAD had only  partially assessed the readiness of units that consistently conduct ASA  operations to ensure that those units were organized, trained, and  equipped to perform ASA operations. In addition, we found that the Air  Force faced significant challenges replacing or extending the service life  of aging fighter aircraft, to the extent that, if aircraft were not replaced, 11  of the 18 ASA sites could be without aircraft by 2020. On the basis of  those findings, we identified a number of actions that DOD needed to take  to improve management of ASA operations. Specifically, we  recommended that DOD should conduct routine risk assessments as part  of a risk-based management approach, implement ASA as a steady-state  mission, and develop plans to address future challenges.", "GAO and other federal agencies have long advocated the use of a risk- based management approach to enhance preparedness against potential  terrorist threats. Risk management is a systematic, analytical process to  determine the likelihood that a threat will harm physical assets or  individuals and then to identify actions to reduce risk and mitigate the  consequences of an attack. The principles of risk management  acknowledge that while risk generally cannot be eliminated, enhancing  protection from known or potential threats can serve to reduce risk. Key  elements of risk management include assessing threats, vulnerabilities,  and criticality of assets and selecting between alternative courses of  action to mitigate risk. As we have previously reported, risk management  can help policymakers make informed decisions, take actions, and  prioritize resource investments under conditions of uncertainty. For  additional information, see the Related GAO Products list at the end of  this report.", "On the basis of your request that we review DOD\u2019s actions on our  January 2009 recommendations, other issues associated with ASA  operations, and the Air Force\u2019s ability to sustain those capabilities, this  report examines the extent to which (1) the Air Force has implemented  the recommendations made to the service in our 2009 report, (2) DOD  has implemented a risk-based management approach for ASA  operations\u2014including our 2009 recommendation for routine risk  assessments\u2014that balances risk with cost, and (3) the Air Force  accurately identified expenditures for its ASA operations. We are also  issuing a classified version of this report. That version includes a  classified appendix of our analysis of NORAD\u2019s ASA basing model.", "To determine the extent to which the Air Force has implemented the  recommendations from our 2009 report, we reviewed ASA-related  guidance, plans, and other documents from the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security  Affairs, Air Force\u2019s homeland defense office, Air Force\u2019s Air Combat  Command, National Guard Bureau, and 3 of the 18 ASA units. We also  interviewed officials from these organizations. To determine the extent to  which DOD has adopted a risk-based management approach to balance  risk and costs for ASA operations, we evaluated documents and  interviewed officials from NORAD, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs, the Air Force, and the  National Guard Bureau. On the basis of our analyses of these documents  and discussions, we compared actions that DOD has taken to three of the  five phases within GAO\u2019s risk-based management framework. To  determine the extent to which the Air Force was able to accurately identify  ASA expenditures, we analyzed the fiscal year 2010 expenditure  information the Air Force included in ASA budget justification materials  provided to Congress in support of the fiscal year 2012 budget and  documented the steps taken to identify those expenditures through  interviews, e-mails, and related documentation. We also compared the  practices used by the Air Force to prepare the ASA budget justification  against best practices for producing cost estimates. To determine the  expenditures of each ASA site, we developed a survey that we sent out to  the Air National Guard and active-duty Air Force ASA units to gather  fiscal year 2009 and 2010 expenditures. We were provided information  from 18 of the 19 ASA sites that incurred expenditures for ASA  operations.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s 2009  National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies a six-phase risk- management framework as shown in figure 2. The overall difference  between this framework and GAO\u2019s is that the National Infrastructure  Protection Plan\u2019s framework splits GAO\u2019s risk-assessment phase into two  separate phases.", "According to the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the core  criteria for risk assessments include information needed to understand  and address each of the following components of risk\u2014threat,  vulnerability, and consequence.

For example, DOD\u2019s defense critical infrastructure program is a  risk-management program that seeks to ensure the availability of certain  identified assets critical to DOD missions.

Since the 2009 report  was issued, some issues have arisen that might have been averted had  the Air Force implemented the recommendations. For example, since the  Air Force canceled the ASA program action directive that clearly identified  the service\u2019s Air Combat Command as responsible for programming for  ASA operations, the National Guard Bureau assumed programming and  budgeting for its ASA sites to ensure that its units that were conducting  ASA operations were funded. This in turn has led to the National Guard  Bureau having to fund emergent expenses with funds that were  programmed for other purposes.

While U.S. Pacific  Command has established one type of performance measure identified in  Joint Chiefs of Staff doctrine on joint planning (measures of  effectiveness), the command has not established the other type of  performance measure (measures of performance).

While the budget justification included one military construction project for  a munitions storage unit at the Toledo, Ohio, ASA site, it did not include  any other expenditures associated with constructing, maintaining, and  upgrading ASA facilities in fiscal year 2010. For example, when asked if  the officials included the construction expenditures related to establishing  an ASA site at McEntire Joint National Guard Base, South Carolina, in  fiscal year 2010, such as constructing hangers for the alert fighter jets  and upgrading crew quarters, the officials stated that these expenditures  were not included in the ASA budget justification.

Consequently, the financial-management guidance does not clearly  define the expenditures that should be associated with ASA operations.  Instead, the guidance that is provided to the Air Force by the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) contains broad categories that  do not clearly state what specific expenditures should or should not be  included in the budget exhibit. For example, the guidance associated  with identifying ASA military-personnel expenditures states that Air Force  officials should provide military-personnel costs associated with the  military full-time equivalents supporting the ASA mission. Since the  guidance does not clearly identify the type or group of military personnel  who are associated with ASA, financial managers could respond to this  reporting requirement with a range of different personnel, such as  personnel that work at NORAD\u2019s air-defense sectors and DOD\u2019s refueling  units since they assist in ASA operations, but are not necessarily included  within the 18 alert sites.", "Second, Air Force and National Guard Bureau financial-management  officials told us that they had not issued any guidance explaining the  process for tracking ASA expenditures at the local level. According to Air  Force guidance, financial managers and budget officers at all levels must  make sure that operating personnel are made aware of the importance of  properly identifying and capturing all costs associated with emergency  and special programs, like ASA, because only accurate cost data can  provide the documentation to meet reporting requirements.

However, this guidance has not been  updated since shortly after September 11, 2001, and DOD has produced  other similar lists within the department that it uses in some contexts.  For  these reasons, we continue to believe that DOD should consider updating  existing guidance or developing new guidance concerning a prioritized list  of metropolitan areas and critical infrastructure locations. We anticipate  that NORAD and DOD could seek additional guidance from the National  Security Staff if they believe the Staff\u2019s guidance needs to be reviewed or  updated.

However, our analysis of the model found that it did not  incorporate threat, vulnerability, and consequence (or criticality) data  because NORAD designed the model to assess the ability of its aircraft to  respond to a single type of threat regardless of its location in the United  States.  DOD\u2019s comments also stated that NORAD would explore  improvements to the ASA model in support of NORAD/NORTHCOM  decision making as targets and threats evolve and capabilities improve.   We continue to believe it appropriate that NORAD\u2019s future improvements  to the model should include the three components that DOD has long- considered essential in risk assessments: threat, vulnerability, and  consequence (or criticality).

Further, when we asked which  organization would be responsible for completing such studies, the  officials provided us conflicting views of whose responsibility it would be.

Further, the Air Force could have challenges if the retirement of the current fleet of F-15s  and F-16s are not managed in a manner that considers the effect on ASA operations. For  example, if the Air Force were to decrease the number of older models of F-16s in the  inventory, this could affect ASA operations since these aircraft are flown by units that  conduct these operations.

However, the approach that DOD uses to backfill personnel and units for ASA  operations is still managed on an ad hoc basis.  NORAD and the Air Force have developed some planning documents, such as a plan for  backfilling ASA units on a large scale. For example, one of the planning documents  identifies potential units that could conduct ASA operations at bases that are equipped  with F-15s if those aircraft were grounded for a period of time as they were in 2008.

However, the Air Force has not developed similar Operation Noble Eagle planning  documents to replace ASA units that deploy to support overseas operations or units that  are taken off alert for a short period of time when they fail an alert force evaluation.  Consequently, the National Guard Bureau, in coordination with Air Combat Command,  must try to find personnel and equipment that are available to support these units.
