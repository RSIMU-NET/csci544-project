During acquisition planning for the upcoming TRICARE pharmacy services contract, DOD solicited feedback from industry through its market research process to align the contract requirements with industry best practices and promote competition. For example, DOD issued requests for information (RFI) in which DOD asked questions about specific market trends, such as ensuring that certain categories of drugs are distributed through the most cost-effective mechanism. DOD also issued an RFI to obtain information on promoting competition, asking industry for opinions on the length of the contract period. DOD officials told us that responses indicated that potential offerors would prefer a longer contract period because it would allow a new contractor more time to recover any capital investment made in implementing the contract. The request for proposals for the upcoming contract, issued in June 2013, included a contract period of 1 base year and 7 option years. DOD also identified changes to contract requirements in response to legislative changes to the TRICARE pharmacy benefit. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2013 required DOD to implement a mail-order pilot for maintenance drugs for beneficiaries who are also enrolled in Medicare Part B. DOD officials incorporated this change in the requirements for the upcoming pharmacy services contract.", "DOD has not conducted an assessment of the appropriateness of its current pharmacy services contract structure that includes an evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternative structures. Alternative structures can include incorporating all pharmacy services into the managed care support contracts--a carve-in structure--or a structure that incorporates certain components of DOD's pharmacy services, such as the mail-order pharmacy, into the managed care support contracts while maintaining a separate contract for other components. DOD officials told GAO they believe that DOD's current carve-out contract structure continues to be appropriate, as it affords more control over pharmacy data that allows for detailed data analyses and cost transparency, meets program goals, and has high beneficiary satisfaction. However, there have been significant changes in the pharmacy benefit management market in the past decade, including mergers and companies offering new services that may change the services and options available to DOD. GAO has previously reported that sound acquisition planning includes an assessment of lessons learned to identify improvements. Additionally, GAO has reported that a comparative evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternatives can provide an evidence-based rationale for why an agency has chosen a particular alternative. Without this type of evaluation, DOD cannot effectively demonstrate that it has chosen the most appropriate contract structure in terms of costs to the government and services for beneficiaries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD conduct an evaluation of the potential costs and benefits of alternative structures for the TRICARE pharmacy services contract, and incorporate such an evaluation into acquisition planning.

In many of the RFIs,   The RFIs  DOD asked questions about specific market trends so that it could  determine if changes were needed to the upcoming contract  requirements to help align them with industry best practices. For  example, DOD issued one RFI in November 2010 that asked  about establishing a mechanism that would allow for centralized  distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals and preserve DOD\u2019s  federal pricing arrangements. Specialty pharmaceuticals\u2014high- cost injectable, infused, oral, or inhaled drugs that are generally  more complex to distribute, administer, and monitor than  traditional drugs\u2014are becoming a growing cost driver for  pharmacy services. According to DOD officials, the RFI responses  received from industry generally reinforced their view that the RFP  should define any specialty pharmacy owned or sub-contracted by  the contractor as a DOD specialty mail-order outlet, which would  subject it to the same federal pricing arrangements as the mail- order pharmacy.", "Promote competition. DOD has also used the RFI process to  obtain information on promoting competition. DOD recognized that  a limited number of potential offerors may have the capability to  handle the pharmacy services contract given the recent  consolidation in the pharmacy benefit management market and  the large size of the TRICARE beneficiary population. DOD  contracting officials told us that, in part because of the  department\u2019s Better Buying Power Initiative to improve acquisition  practices, they have a strong focus on maintaining a competitive  contracting environment for the pharmacy services contract,  thereby increasing the use of market research early in the  acquisition planning process. For example, DOD\u2019s December  2011 RFI asked for industry perspectives on the length of the  contract period. DOD was interested in learning whether a longer  contract period would promote competition. DOD officials told us  that the responses they received confirmed that potential offerors  would prefer a longer contract period because it would allow a  non-incumbent more time to recover any capital investment made  as part of implementing the contract. The RFP for the upcoming  contract includes a contract period of 1 base year and 7 option  years. DOD also used the RFI process to confirm that there  were a sufficient number of potential offerors to ensure full and  open competition for the pharmacy services contract.

In each instance, DOD officials  needed to determine whether to make the change for the upcoming  contract, or whether to make the change via a modification to the current  contract. According to DOD officials, there were over 300 modifications  to the current pharmacy services contract; 23 of these were changes to  the work to be done by the contractor. DOD officials told us that it is not  possible to build a level of flexibility into the contract to accommodate or  anticipate all potential changes (and thus avoid modifications to the  contract), because doing so would make it difficult for offerors to  determine pricing in their proposals.", "Legislative changes to the pharmacy benefit. Legislative  changes have been one key driver of DOD\u2019s revisions to its  pharmacy services contract requirements. For example, one  legislative change required DOD to implement the TRICARE  Young Adult program, which resulted in DOD adding a  requirement for the contractor to extend pharmacy services to  eligible military dependents through the age of 26. This change  was made as a modification under the current contract. Another  legislative change that necessitated changes to the contract  requirements was the increase in beneficiary copayments for  drugs obtained through mail-order or retail pharmacies, enacted  as part of the NDAA for fiscal year 2013, which DOD changed  through a modification to the current contract. A third legislative  change to the pharmacy benefit was the mail-order pilot for  maintenance drugs for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. DOD  officials incorporated this change in the requirements for the  upcoming pharmacy services contract, as outlined in the RFP.", "Efforts to improve service delivery. DOD has also updated  contract requirements to improve service delivery to beneficiaries  under the pharmacy services contract. DOD initiated a  modification to the current contract to require the contractor to  provide online coordination of benefits for beneficiaries with health  care coverage from multiple insurers. Specifically, the contractor is  required to ensure that pharmacy data systems include  information on government and other health insurance coverage  to facilitate coverage and payment determinations. According to  DOD officials, this change is consistent with the updated national  telecommunication standard from the National Council for  Prescription Drug Programs, which provides a uniform format for  electronic claims processing. According to DOD officials, this  change to the contract requirements eliminates the need for  beneficiaries to file paper claims when TRICARE is the secondary  payer, simplifying the process for beneficiaries and reducing costs  for DOD. Another modification to the current contract to improve  service delivery was to require the contractor to provide vaccines  through its network of retail pharmacies. According to DOD  officials, this modification was made to allow beneficiaries to  access vaccines through every possible venue, driven by the 2010  H1N1 influenza pandemic.", "Contractor performance. DOD officials told us that  improvements identified through the monitoring of contractor  performance have also led to changes in contract requirements.  Through the CORs\u2019 monitoring of the contractor\u2019s performance  against the standards specified in the contract, the CORs may  determine that a particular standard is not helping to achieve the  performance desired or is unnecessarily restrictive. For example,  DOD officials told us that in the current contract, they had a three- tiered standard for paper claims processing (e.g., 95 percent of  paper claims processed within 10 days, 99 percent within 20 days,  and 100 percent within 30 days). Through monitoring the  contractor\u2019s performance, the CORs determined that there was a  negligible difference between the middle and high tiers, and  holding the contractor to this performance standard was not  beneficial. The requirements for the upcoming contract as  described in the RFP only include two tiers\u201495 percent of claims  processed within 14 calendar days, and 100 percent within   28 calendar days.", "When making changes to contract requirements, DOD officials told us  they try to ensure that the requirements are not overly prescriptive, but  rather outcome-oriented and performance-based. For example, DOD  officials told us that they allowed the pharmacy and managed care  support contractors to innovate and apply industry best practices  regarding coverage and coordination of home infusion services.  According to DOD officials, the contract requirements regarding home  infusion are focused on the desired outcome\u2014providing coordination of  care for beneficiaries needing these services with the physician as the  key decision maker\u2014and DOD officials facilitated meetings between the  pharmacy contractor and managed care support contractors to determine  the details of how to provide the services. This approach is consistent  with DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power principles that emphasize the  importance of well-defined contract requirements and acquisition officials\u2019  understanding of cost-performance trade-offs. This approach also  addresses a concern we have previously identified regarding overly  prescriptive contract requirements in TRICARE contracts; specifically, in  our previous work on the managed care support contracts, we reported  that DOD\u2019s prescriptive requirements limited innovation and competition  among contractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Conducted an Assessment of Its Pharmacy Services Contract that Includes an Evaluation of the Costs and Benefits of Alternative Structures", "paragraphs": ["Since retail pharmacy services were carved out about 10 years ago, DOD  has not conducted an assessment of the appropriateness of its current  pharmacy services contract structure that includes an evaluation of the  costs and benefits of alternative structures. Alternative structures can  include a carve-in of all pharmacy services into the managed care support  contracts, or a structure that carves in a component of pharmacy  services, such as the mail-order pharmacy, while maintaining a carve-out  structure for other components. DOD officials told us they believe that  DOD\u2019s current pharmacy services contract structure continues to be  appropriate, as it affords more control over pharmacy data and allows for  more detailed data analyses and increased transparency about costs.  DOD\u2019s continued use of a carve-out contract structure for pharmacy  services is consistent with findings from research and perspectives we  heard from industry group officials\u2014that larger employers are more likely  to carve out pharmacy services to better leverage the economies of scale and cost savings a stand-alone pharmacy benefit manager can achieve.These arrangements may also provide more detailed information on drug  utilization that can be helpful in managing drug formularies and their  associated costs.", "In its December 2007 report, the Task Force on the Future of Military  Health Care recommended examining an alternative structure for the  pharmacy services contract.health care system, the task force reviewed DOD\u2019s pharmacy benefit  program, recommending that DOD pilot a carve-in pharmacy contract  structure within one of the TRICARE regions with a goal of achieving  better financial and health outcomes as a result of having more integrated  pharmacy and medical services. The managed care support contractors  we spoke with expressed similar concerns. However, DOD did not agree  with the task force\u2019s recommendation. In its response, DOD assessed the   In addition to other aspects of DOD\u2019s  benefits of the current structure and affirmed the department\u2019s  commitment to this structure.", "Potential cost savings. In its response to the task force report,  DOD did not concur with the recommendation to pilot a carve-in  pharmacy contract structure, in part because of the cost savings  achieved through the carve-out. Specifically, DOD stated that the  carve-out arrangement is compatible with accessing federal  pricing arrangements and other discounts available for direct  purchases. DOD stated in its response that, under a carve-in  arrangement, even on a pilot basis, it would lose access to  discounts available for direct purchases, including some portion of  the $400 million in annual discounts available for drugs dispensed  at retail pharmacies under the NDAA for fiscal year 2008. DOD  officials told us that this loss would result from the managed care  support contractor being the purchaser of the drugs, rather than  DOD. DOD also stated that it would possibly lose access to the  volume discounts obtained for drugs purchased for the mail-order  pharmacy and military treatment facility pharmacies under a  carve-in structure. DOD officials told us that these disadvantages  of a carve-in structure remain the same today. Additionally, during  this review, DOD noted that dividing the TRICARE beneficiary  population among contractors under a carve-in would dilute the  leverage a single pharmacy benefit manager would have in the  market. For example, DOD would lose economies of scale for  claims processing services provided by the pharmacy contractor,  resulting in increased costs.", "However, research studies have found, and officials from  TRICARE\u2019s managed care support contractors told us, that a  contract structure with integrated medical and pharmacy services  could result in cost savings for DOD. For example, one recent  study found that employers with carve-in health plans had   3.8 percent lower total medical care costs compared to employers  with pharmacy services carved out. The researchers attributed  the cost difference, in part, to increased coordination of care for  the carve-in plans, leading to fewer adverse events for patients,  resulting in fewer inpatient admissions; they reported that plans  with a carve-out arrangement had 7 percent higher inpatient  admissions. Similarly, representatives from one managed care  support contractor we spoke with stated they thought they could  achieve similar cost savings to what DOD currently has through its  federal pricing arrangements by using integrated medical and  pharmacy services as a means of reducing costs in a carve-in  arrangement. Being able to analyze integrated, in-house medical  and pharmacy data may help health plans to lower costs by  identifying high-cost beneficiaries, including those with chronic  conditions such as asthma and diabetes, and targeting timely and  cost-effective interventions for this population.", "Potential health benefits from data integration. In  recommending that DOD pilot a carve-in pharmacy contract  structure, one of the task force\u2019s goals was to improve health  outcomes as a result of integrated medical and pharmacy  services. DOD noted in its task force response that it could  achieve this goal under the current carve-out contract structure by  including requirements in the pharmacy services contract and  managed care support contracts requiring data sharing between  the contractors.", "While the current contract requires the pharmacy and managed  care support contractors to exchange data for care coordination,  current TRICARE managed care support contractors told us there  continue to be challenges with data sharing to facilitate disease  management. Contractors expressed similar concerns about  sharing medical and pharmacy data as part of our previous work  related to DOD\u2019s managed care support contracts. Additionally,  during this review, officials from one of the managed care support  contractors told us that they continue to find it challenging to  generate data that provide a holistic view of beneficiaries when  medical and pharmacy data remain separate. Representatives  from another managed care support contractor told us that their  disease management staff faced challenges in analyzing  pharmacy data for groups of patients they were managing. They  also told us that if these staff had more complete and real-time  access to pharmacy data, as they would under a carve-in  structure, they could be more proactive in assisting DOD\u2019s efforts  to identify patients who should participate in disease management  programs. Additionally, researchers have found that disease  management interventions may be challenging to conduct in a  carve-out arrangement due to the lack of fully integrated medical  and pharmacy data.", "According to DOD officials, any changes to the current contract structure  would result in less efficient and inconsistent pharmacy service delivery  across the three TRICARE regions, as officials observed when the retail  pharmacy benefit was part of the managed care support contracts. One of  DOD\u2019s reasons for the initial carve-out was a concern that pharmacy  services were not being consistently implemented across the TRICARE  regions. For example, DOD officials told us that two health plans in  different TRICARE regions were able to have different preferred drugs  within the same therapeutic class, and while both drugs may be included  on DOD\u2019s formulary, beneficiaries in different parts of the country were  not being consistently provided with the same drug. In addition, according  to DOD, beneficiaries were dissatisfied with a benefit that was not  portable across TRICARE regions\u2014specifically, retail pharmacy networks  differed by region, so beneficiaries who moved from one TRICARE region  to another would have to change retail pharmacy networks. With one  national pharmacy services contract, DOD officials said they can ensure  that the formulary is implemented consistently and that beneficiaries have  access to the same retail pharmacy network across the TRICARE  regions.", "Since the current pharmacy services contract structure was implemented  almost 10 years ago, DOD has not incorporated an assessment of the  contract structure that includes an evaluation of alternative structures into  its acquisition planning activities. DOD officials told us that they consider  their task force response to be an assessment of the current contract  structure. While the response included a justification for the current  structure, it did not include an evaluation of the potential costs and  benefits of alternative structures, such as carving in all or part of the  pharmacy benefit. In addition, the acquisition plan for the upcoming  contract described two alternative carve-out configurations (separate  contracts for the mail-order and retail pharmacies and a government- owned facility to house drugs for the mail-order pharmacy contract).  However, the plan similarly did not include an evaluation of the potential  costs and benefits of these options, nor did the plan include an evaluation  of any carve-in alternatives. DOD officials told us there are no current  plans to conduct such an evaluation as part of the department\u2019s  acquisition planning efforts.", "DOD officials also told us that they continue to believe the current  structure is appropriate because the current carve-out structure provides  high beneficiary satisfaction and is achieving DOD\u2019s original objectives,  namely consistent provision of benefits, access to federal pricing  arrangements, and transparency of pharmacy utilization and cost data.  Further, officials told us that the current carve-out structure is more  efficient to administer with one pharmacy services contractor than the  previous carve-in structure that involved multiple managed care support  contractors.", "While DOD officials believe the current structure is appropriate, there  have been significant changes in the pharmacy benefit management  market in the past decade. These changes include mergers, as well as  companies offering new services that may change the services and  options available to DOD. For example, representatives from one  managed care support contractor we spoke with told us that they can  offer different services to DOD today than they were able to offer when  pharmacy services were part of the managed care support contracts.", "While the contractor had previously sub-contracted with a separate  pharmacy benefit manager to provide pharmacy services under its  managed care support contract, this contractor\u2019s parent company now  provides in-house pharmacy benefit management services for its  commercial clients. Additionally, according to the parent company of  another managed care support contractor, its recent decision to bring  pharmacy benefit management services in-house will enhance its ability  to manage total health care costs and improve health outcomes for clients  who carve in pharmacy services.", "As we have previously reported, sound acquisition planning includes an  assessment of lessons learned to identify improvements. The time  necessary for such activities can vary greatly, depending on the  complexity of the contract. We have also reported that a comparative  evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternatives can provide an  evidence-based rationale for why an agency has chosen a particular  alternative (such as a decision to maintain or alter the current pharmacy  services contract structure). We have reported that such an evaluation  would consider possible alternatives and should not be developed solely  to support a predetermined solution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With each new pharmacy services contract, DOD officials have the  opportunity to conduct acquisition planning activities that help determine  whether the contract\u2014and its current structure\u2014continues to meet the  department\u2019s needs, including providing the best value and services to  the government and beneficiaries. These activities can include changing  requirements as necessary, learning about current market trends, and  incorporating new information and lessons learned. Acquisition planning  can also incorporate an assessment of the pharmacy services contract  structure that includes an evaluation of the potential costs and benefits of  alternative contract structures. Incorporating such an evaluation into the  acquisition planning for each new pharmacy services contract can provide  DOD with an evidence-based rationale for why maintaining or changing  the current structure is warranted. Without such an evaluation, DOD  cannot effectively demonstrate to Congress and stakeholders that it has  chosen the most appropriate contract structure, in terms of costs to the  government and services for beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide decision makers with more complete information on the  continued appropriateness of the current pharmacy services contract  structure, and to ensure the best value and services to the government  and beneficiaries, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to take the following two  actions:  conduct an evaluation of the potential costs and benefits of alternative  contract structures for the TRICARE pharmacy services contract; and  incorporate such an evaluation into acquisition planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment. DOD generally  concurred with our findings and conclusions and concurred with our  recommendations. DOD also commented that based on past experience  with alternative contract structures, it is confident that the current contract  structure is the most cost efficient and beneficial.", "In response to our recommendation that DOD conduct an evaluation of  the potential costs and benefits of alternative contract structures for the  TRICARE pharmacy services contract, DOD commented that there is a  lack of data to support inferences that a carve-in arrangement would  result in cost savings to the government, and noted that the full  development of two separate RFPs would be necessary to provide a valid  cost comparison. While detailed cost estimates can be a useful tool for  DOD, they are not the only means of evaluating alternative structures for  the pharmacy services contract. For example, as we noted in our report,  DOD has previously used RFIs to obtain information from industry to  inform its decisions about the pharmacy services contract, and this  process also may be helpful in identifying costs and benefits of alternative  contract structures.", "In response to our recommendation that DOD incorporate such an  evaluation into acquisition planning, DOD commented that it included an  evaluation of its past contract experience into acquisition planning for the  upcoming pharmacy services contract. However, as noted in our report,  the acquisition plan for the upcoming contract did not include an  evaluation of the potential costs and benefits of alternative contract  structures, and DOD did not directly address how it would include such an  evaluation in its acquisition planning activities. We continue to emphasize  the importance of having an evidence-based rationale for why maintaining  or changing the current structure is warranted. With each new pharmacy  services contract, DOD officials have the opportunity to determine  whether the contract continues to meet the department\u2019s needs, including  providing the best value to the government and services to beneficiaries.", "In addition, DOD stated in its comments that our report did not address its  direct-care system and noted that carving pharmacy services back into  the managed care support contracts would fragment the pharmacy  benefit and undermine its goal of integrating all pharmacy points of  service. Our review was focused on DOD\u2019s purchased-care system for  providing pharmacy services, although we did provide context about the  direct-care system as appropriate. Furthermore, we did not recommend  any specific structure for DOD\u2019s pharmacy services contract, but rather  that DOD evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative structures such  that it can have an evidence-based rationale for its decisions.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II.
