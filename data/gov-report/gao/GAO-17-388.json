The legislation required covered agencies to develop data center consolidation strategic plans and report cost savings to OMB. It also included a provision for GAO to annually review agencies' data center inventories and strategies. OMB's Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) subsequently launched DCOI to build on prior data center consolidation efforts and improve federal data centers' performance.", "GAO reviewed agencies' data center closure plans and consolidation savings progress and plans; and evaluated the extent to which agencies' annual consolidation strategic plans are complete. To do so, GAO assessed DCOI agencies' data center inventories, reviewed agencies' reported cost savings documentation, and evaluated their data center optimization strategic plans. GAO also updated its assessments in April 2017 in response to agency comments on its draft report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 24 agencies participating in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) have made progress on their data center closure efforts. As of August 2016, the agencies collectively had identified a total of 9,995 data centers, of which they reported having closed 4,388 and having plans to close a total of 5,597 through fiscal year 2019. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Treasury accounted for 84 percent of the completed closures.", "In addition, 18 of the 24 agencies reported achieving about $2.3 billion collectively in cost savings and avoidances from their data center consolidation and optimization efforts from fiscal year 2012 through August 2016. The Departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, and Treasury accounted for approximately $2.0 billion (or 87 percent) of the total. Further, 23 agencies reported about $656 million collectively in planned savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. This is about $3.3 billion less than the estimated $4.0 billion in planned savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 that agencies reported to GAO in November 2015. (See figure.)", "This reduction in planned savings is the result of eight agencies reporting less in planned cost savings and avoidances in their annual DCOI strategic plans, which are required by December 2014 information technology (IT) acquisition reform legislation, as compared to the savings these agencies previously reported to GAO in November 2015. The reduction also does not include cost savings information for one agency that had not submitted its strategic plan in time for our review. GAO has previously recommended that agencies fully report these savings.", "Additionally, as of April 2017, 23 of the 24 agencies had submitted a strategic plan. Of the 23 plans, only 7 included all required information. The remaining plans either partially met or did not meet the requirements. Until agencies submit plans that address all required elements, they may be challenged in implementing the data center consolidation and optimization provisions of the legislation. GAO also identified inconsistencies in how 11 agencies reported historical cost savings in their DCOI strategic plans, as compared to a separate required quarterly report to OMB. These inconsistencies, due in part to weaknesses in OMB's oversight of agencies' savings information and their DCOI strategic plan, resulted in a reporting discrepancy of approximately $1.5 billion between the two sources. Until OMB improves its oversight of agencies' reporting of cost savings, and until agencies address inconsistencies in their reporting, the likelihood of further reporting errors is increased."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that OMB ensure that agencies complete their DCOI strategic plans and report achieved data center cost savings consistently across all reporting mechanisms. GAO is also recommending that 17 agencies complete their DCOI strategic plans and that 11 agencies ensure the amounts of achieved cost savings are consistent across reporting mechanisms. Twelve agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations, 2 disagreed, and 11 did not state whether they agreed or disagreed, as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s demand for information technology (IT) is ever  increasing. In recent years, as federal agencies have modernized their  operations, put more of their services online, and improved their  information security profiles, their need for computing power and data  storage resources has grown. Accordingly, this growing demand has led  to a dramatic rise in the number of federal data centers and a  corresponding increase in operational costs. In response, the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO)  launched the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) in  2010 to reduce the growing number of centers.", "Congress has also recognized the importance of reforming the  government-wide management of IT, and in December 2014, enacted  Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform provisions  (commonly referred to as FITARA) as a part of the Carl Levin and Howard  P. \u2018Buck\u2019 McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2015.

The specific objectives of this  report were to (1) review agencies\u2019 data center closures to date and plans  for further closures, (2) evaluate agencies\u2019 progress in achieving data  center consolidation savings and describe plans for future savings, and  (3) evaluate the extent to which agencies\u2019 annual strategic plans for data  center consolidation and optimization are complete.", "On December 19, 2016, we delivered a briefing to congressional  committees on the results of our study. This report officially transmits the  results of our review.", "To perform this work, we assessed the data center inventories of the 24  agencies participating in the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)  (which are the same agencies covered by FITARA\u2019s data center  consolidation provisions) as of August 2016, reviewed agency-reported  cost savings and avoidance documentation as of August 2016, and  evaluated the extent to which agencies\u2019 data center optimization strategic  plans (as of December 2016) provided the key elements identified in  OMB\u2019s memorandum implementing FITARA. The briefing slides included  in appendix I provide greater detail on our scope and methodology.  Further, this report includes updated information provided to us by the  agencies we reviewed, as part of their comments on a draft copy of the  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to May 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "As noted above, FITARA requires 24 agencies to submit to OMB a  comprehensive inventory of the data centers owned, operated, or  maintained by or on behalf of the agency. It also requires agencies to  report on data center consolidation and optimization progress.  Subsequent to the enactment of FITARA, in August 2016, the Federal  CIO announced in a memorandum the DCOI as a successor effort to  FDCCI. According to OMB, this new initiative supersedes and builds on  the results of FDCCI and is intended to improve the performance of  federal data centers in areas such as facility utilization and power usage.  Among other things, DCOI requires 24 federal agencies to develop plans  and report on strategies (referred to as DCOI strategic plans) to  consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve  security posture, and achieve cost savings. Through its August 2016  memorandum, OMB defines a framework for achieving specific data  center consolidation and optimization requirements, the criteria for  successful agency data center strategies, and the metrics OMB will use to  evaluate the success of those strategies.", "The guidance also revised the definition of a physical data center to  include any room with at least one server that provides services (such as  testing and development). In light of this new definition, OMB directed all  agencies to perform a comprehensive review of their data centers and  maintain a complete and updated data center inventory.", "In summary, the agencies have collectively made progress on their data  center closure efforts. Specifically, as of August 2016, the agencies had  identified a total of 9,995 data centers, of which they reported closing  4,388. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Treasury  accounted for 84 percent of the completed closures.", "Further, the agencies collectively reported that they are planning to meet  OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018 consolidation targets to close 25 percent of tiered  data centers and 60 percent of non-tiered centers. Specifically, as of  August 2016, our analysis of the agencies\u2019 data center inventories  showed that they were planning to close approximately 25 percent of the  government-wide total of tiered data centers and approximately 66  percent of the government-wide total of non-tiered centers by the end of  fiscal year 2018. When accounting for additional closures expected in  fiscal year 2019, the agencies reported that they plan to close a total of  5,597 centers. Figure 1 provides a summary of the 24 agencies\u2019 total data  centers and completed and planned closures.", "Additionally, FITARA and OMB\u2019s guidance require the DCOI agencies to  provide yearly estimates of cost savings. FITARA contains a series of  requirements for OMB and agencies related to reporting on cost savings.  For example, according to the law, agencies are to submit a multi-year  strategy for achieving the consolidation and optimization of data centers  that includes year-by-year calculations of investment and cost savings  through fiscal year 2018.", "OMB\u2019s August 2016 guidance also provides additional information  regarding how agencies should implement the requirements of FITARA,  including how to report cost savings and avoidances. Specifically,  covered agencies are to establish a strategic plan that includes  information on historical cost savings and avoidances due to data center  consolidation and optimization through fiscal year 2015. In addition,  OMB\u2019s guidance states that agency strategic plans are to include year-by- year calculations of target and actual agency-wide spending and cost  savings on data centers from fiscal years 2016 through 2018. OMB has  also required agencies to report both their data center consolidation cost  savings and avoidances, among other areas, as part of OMB\u2019s quarterly  data collection process known as the integrated data collection.", "Accordingly, 18 of the 24 agencies collectively reported achieving an  estimated $2.3 billion in cost savings and avoidances from their data  center consolidation and optimization efforts from the start of fiscal year  2012 through August 2016. The Departments of Commerce, Defense,  Homeland Security, and Treasury accounted for approximately $2.0  billion (or 87 percent) of the total.", "The approximately $2.3 billion in cost savings and avoidances reported to  OMB are about $451 million less than the total amount of achieved cost  savings and avoidances that agencies reported to us in November 2015,  even though agencies had 9 additional months to accrue additional  savings. Figure 2 provides a comparison of the total cost savings and  avoidances agencies reported to us in November 2015 with the achieved  cost savings and avoidances that agencies reported to OMB in August  2016.", "In addition, agencies are planning a total of approximately $656 million in  savings between fiscal years 2016 and 2018, according to their DCOI  strategic plans. However, this is about $3.3 billion less than the  approximately $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2016 through 2018 planned  savings that agencies reported to us in November 2015. This is also  about $2.1 billion less than OMB\u2019s $2.7 billion cost savings goal for  agencies to achieve by the end of fiscal year 2018, as required by OMB\u2019s  August 2016 memorandum. Figure 3 presents a comparison of the  amounts of cost savings and avoidances reported by agencies to OMB  through their DCOI strategic plans and the amounts the agencies  reported to us.", "The reduction in planned savings reflects eight agencies reporting less  planned cost savings and avoidances in their DCOI strategic plans  compared to the savings amounts previously reported to us in November  2015. It also reflects the absence of cost savings information for one  agency that had not submitted its strategic plan in time for our review.", "Further, in March 2016, we reported that 10 agencies had not  established planned cost savings goals for fiscal years 2016 through  2018 even though they had closures planned during that time period. We  concluded that, until agencies complete their savings goals, total planned  savings amounts may be understated and agencies will not be able to  fully satisfy requirements regarding data center consolidation.  Accordingly, we recommended that these agencies complete their  planned data center cost savings targets for fiscal year 2016 through  2018. Most agencies agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments.", "Nonetheless, agencies continue to be challenged in identifying and  reporting their cost savings. In the absence of consistent and full reporting  of fiscal year 2016 through 2018 planned savings in agencies\u2019 DCOI  strategic plans, as required by FITARA and OMB, agencies\u2019 total planned  savings will likely continue to be understated. Therefore, we are re- emphasizing the need for agencies to implement our prior  recommendation to complete their planned data center cost savings  targets.", "Finally, as noted earlier, FITARA required agencies to submit a multi-year  strategy to achieve the consolidation and optimization of their data  centers no later than the end of fiscal year 2016. Among other things, this  strategy was to include such information as data center consolidation and  optimization metrics; and year-by-year calculations of investment and  cost savings through October 1, 2018.", "Further, OMB\u2019s August 2016 guidance contained additional information  for how agencies are to implement the strategic plan requirements of  FITARA. Specifically, the guidance stated that agency DCOI strategic  plans are to include, among other things, planned and achieved  performance levels for each optimization metric; calculations of target and  actual agency-wide spending and cost savings on data centers; and  historical cost savings and cost avoidances due to data center  consolidation and optimization. OMB\u2019s guidance also stated that agencies  were required to publicly post their DCOI strategic plan to their agency- owned digital strategy website by September 30, 2016.", "Of the 23 agencies that submitted their DCOI strategic plans, only 7\u2014 the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Homeland Security, and  Housing and Urban Development, the General Services Administration,  the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Personnel  Management\u2014had addressed all five elements required by the OMB  memorandum implementing FITARA; the remaining 16 either partially met  or did not meet the requirements. For example, most agencies partially  met or did not meet the requirements to provide information related to  data center closures and cost savings metrics. Figure 4 provides an  assessment of the completeness of agencies\u2019 data center optimization  plans, by key element.", "Our analysis of the agencies\u2019 DCOI strategic plans determined that most  of the agencies that submitted a plan met OMB\u2019s requirements for  providing planned data center optimization, closure, and savings goals.  However, agencies\u2019 DCOI strategic plans are also required to include  achieved performance levels for each OMB optimization metric, closures,  and actual cost savings. Our analysis showed that most plans did not  provide information on progress achieved in these areas for fiscal year  2016.", "Agencies provided a variety of reasons for why their plans were  incomplete, including the difficulty of reporting on fiscal year 2016 actual  savings and closures when the data are not yet finalized and the receipt  of incomplete data from some agency components. However, although  the DCOI strategic plans were due to OMB on September 30, 2016  (before the fiscal year ended), agencies could still have reported achieved  progress information in their plans. For example, agencies report data  related to fiscal year 2016 achieved optimization progress, closures, and  cost savings through other OMB reporting mechanisms, such as the  quarterly data submissions, which could have been included in their DCOI  strategic plan. Until agencies address the missing elements in their DCOI  strategic plans, they will be at risk of not realizing anticipated savings,  improved infrastructure utilization, and energy efficiency; they also may  not be able to satisfy requirements regarding data center consolidation  and optimization.", "Since 2013, OMB has required agencies to provide quarterly data  submissions that report on their data center consolidation related cost  savings and avoidances. As noted above, OMB\u2019s August 2016  memorandum also required agencies to report on historical data center- related cost savings in their DCOI plans, which were due in September  2016. In our December 2016 briefing, we reported that, in comparing the  August 2016 quarterly data, which at the time were the most recent data  available, and the historical savings in the DCOI plans, we identified  inconsistencies in the reporting of historical cost savings by agencies  across those two reporting mechanisms. Specifically, we found that of the  24 agencies, 9 consistently reported savings information in their DCOI  strategic plans and their August 2016 quarterly reports to OMB, 11  agencies did not report consistent information, and 4 agencies (the  Departments of Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, and the Office  of Personnel Management) did not submit their DCOI strategic plans.  These inconsistencies resulted in a discrepancy totaling approximately  $1.5 billion between the two mechanisms, and were due, to incomplete  data in the DCOI strategic plans that agencies submitted. Subsequently,  after receiving a draft copy of this report for comment, three of the four  agencies (the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security and the  Office of Personnel Management) provided us with a copy of their  strategic plan.", "According to staff in OMB\u2019s Office of the Federal CIO, the OMB staff who  review agency budget submissions also worked with the agencies to  ensure that they provided complete savings information in their DCOI  strategic plan. However, several agencies\u2019 DCOI strategic plans did not  include the fiscal year 2012 through 2015 savings that were reported in  their August 2016 quarterly cost savings update. Further, we identified  several instances in which agencies\u2019 plans had underreported their  planned cost savings and avoidances. We also found other errors in  agencies\u2019 quarterly data reporting, such as incorrectly categorized data  center savings due to initiatives that were incorrectly marked as being  data center-related. Until OMB improves its oversight of agencies\u2019  reporting of cost savings, and agencies ensure that their savings  information is consistent across all reporting mechanisms, the likelihood  of further reporting errors is increased. Additionally, until OMB improves  its oversight of the information in agencies\u2019 DCOI strategic plans, it may  be challenged in demonstrating that DCOI is meeting its established  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Continuing to build on progress made under FDCCI, agencies have  reported significant data center closures\u2014totaling more than 4,300  through August 2016\u2014and current plans identify more than 1,200  additional centers planned for closure through fiscal year 2019. If  executed as planned, such closures will help agencies continue to  increase their operational efficiency and achieve savings. Agencies have  also reported significant consolidation and optimization cost savings and  avoidances.

However, not all agencies have submitted their plans and only  seven of the plans submitted addressed all the key elements required by  FITARA and OMB. Moreover, significant inconsistencies in agencies\u2019  reported savings raise further questions regarding the accuracy of agency  reporting and OMB\u2019s oversight of this initiative. Addressing these  inconsistencies and expeditiously completing these plans is increasingly  important in order to meet the federal requirements.

Specifically, the staff member stated that OMB was unable to replicate  our totals of the number of data centers closed and remaining. The  staff member also noted that we did not include agency cloud service  providers or data centers with no closing date in our totals, whereas  OMB includes such instances in its counts. In conducting our analysis,  we did not count cloud service providers because OMB\u2019s guidance  specifically states that such providers are not to be considered as  data centers. In regard to data centers identified as planned for  closure, but without a closing date, we did not count such facilities as  closures because the lack of a date suggested only a tentative plan,  rather than a firm commitment.", "The staff member further stated that OMB could not replicate our cost  savings estimates and noted that while OMB relied solely on  information reported by agencies to the IT Dashboard, we also had  access to contextual information about the data, provided to us by the  agencies. The staff member asserted that OMB did not have access  to that same information. However, the contextual information  referenced by the staff member is only amplifying information we  obtained from the agencies through the normal course of our audit  work, as we interviewed agency officials in order to verify the  information reported by the agencies to OMB and to verify the results  of our analyses. On multiple occasions, our work has pointed out the  differences in what agencies are reporting to OMB and what they are  reporting to us, and we have made multiple recommendations for  OMB and agencies to address these discrepancies. For this reason,  we requested and received agencies\u2019 validation of the results of our  analysis of agency closures and cost savings on multiple occasions.  As such, we stand by the results of our analysis and the data center  closures and cost savings estimates that we are reporting.", "Additionally, the staff member stated that grouping together in one  category the agencies that had not fully completed all the required  elements of their DCOI strategic plans ignored significant quality  differences between the plans, as well as shared problems with each  of them.

In recent years, as federal  agencies have modernized their operations, put more of their services online, and improved their information  security profiles, their need for computing power and data storage resources has grown. Accordingly, this growing  demand has led to a dramatic rise in the number of federal data centers and a corresponding increase in operational  costs. In response, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) launched  the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) in 2010 to reduce the growing number of centers.", "More recently, in August 2016, the Federal CIO launched the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) as a  successor effort to FDCCI. According to OMB, this new initiative is intended to improve the performance of federal  data centers in areas such as facility utilization and power usage. Among other things, DCOI requires 24 federal  departments and agencies (agencies) to develop plans and report on strategies (referred to as DCOI strategic  plans) to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture, and achieve cost  savings.", "With Congress recognizing the importance of reforming the government-wide management of IT, Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform provisions (commonly referred to as FITARA) were enacted in  December 2014 as a part of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \u2018Buck\u2019 McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2015. Among other things, the law includes the following requirements related to federal data center  consolidation:", "Agencies shall annually report to OMB about federal data center inventories and strategies to achieve  consolidation, including yearly calculations of investment and cost savings.", "OMB shall develop and make publicly available a goal, broken down by year, for the amount of planned cost  savings and optimization improvements achieved through FDCCI, and, for each year thereafter through  October 1, 2018, compare progress against those goals.", "In addition, the law includes a provision for GAO to annually review and verify the quality and completeness of  agency federal data center inventories and strategies for consolidation.", "Over the past several years, we have reported and testified that, while data center consolidation and optimization  could potentially save the federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses exist in the execution and oversight of  these efforts. For example, in March 2016, we reported that 10 agencies had not developed planned data center  consolidation cost savings and avoidance targets for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, even though they had data  center closures planned during this time period. As a result, we recommended that these agencies complete their  planned cost savings and avoidance targets. Most agencies agreed with our recommendations or had no  comments.", "Our objectives for this study were to  (1) review agencies\u2019 data center closures to date and plans for further closures,  (2) evaluate agencies\u2019 progress in achieving data center consolidation savings and describe plans for future  savings, and  (3) evaluate the extent to which agencies\u2019 annual strategic plans for data center consolidation and optimization are  complete.", "To accomplish the first objective, we obtained and analyzed data center inventory documentation from the 24 DCOI  agencies in our review. To determine data center closures to date, we totaled agency reported closures from fiscal  year 2010 through August 2016 and, to identify future closures, we totaled agency reported planned closures  through fiscal year 2019. We also compared agencies\u2019 completed and planned closures to OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018  consolidation goals, as documented in its August 2016 memorandum (M-16-19).", "To verify the quality, completeness, and reliability of the agencies\u2019 data center inventories, we compared information  on data center closures completed and planned to similar information reported on OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard\u2014a public  website that provides information on federal agencies\u2019 major IT investments. We also checked for missing data  and other errors, such as missing closure status information. Further, we obtained written responses from agency  officials regarding actions taken to ensure the reliability of their inventory data, and discussed any discrepancies or  potential errors identified to determine the causes or request additional information. We determined that the data  were sufficiently complete and reliable to report on agencies\u2019 consolidation progress and planned closures.", "For our second objective, we obtained and analyzed cost savings and avoidance documentation from the 24 DCOI  agencies required by OMB\u2019s March 2013 and August 2016 memorandums. This documentation included the  agencies\u2019 quarterly reports of cost savings and avoidances posted to their digital strategy websites and their DCOI  strategic plans. To determine cost savings achieved, we totaled agencies\u2019 reported savings and avoidances from  the start of fiscal year 2012 through August 2016, as found in the August 2016 quarterly reports posted on their  digital strategy websites. To identify future planned savings, we totaled the agencies\u2019 projected savings and  avoidances from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, as reported in their DCOI strategic plans.", "To assess the reliability of the agencies\u2019 cost savings and avoidance data, we reviewed agency documentation for  missing data or other errors (e.g., incorrect calculations).

In  addition, we obtained written responses from agency officials to confirm our understanding of their reported savings  and avoidances. Finally, we compared agencies\u2019 reported cost savings and avoidances with data from our March  2016 report on agencies\u2019 data center consolidation efforts. As a result of our analyses, we found that certain  agencies were reporting less cost savings and avoidances to OMB in their August 2016 quarterly reports and in their  DCOI strategic plans compared to the amounts reported to us in November 2015. In certain cases, agencies were  able to provide additional explanations for the differences in their savings.

Specifically, as of August 2016, the agencies had identified a total of 9,995 data centers, of which they reported  closing 4,388. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Treasury accounted for 84 percent of these  closures. Further, agencies collectively reported that they are planning to meet OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018 consolidation  targets to close 25 percent of tiered data centers and 60 percent of non-tiered centers. Specifically, as of August  2016, our analysis of agencies\u2019 inventories showed that they were planning to close approximately 25 percent of the  government-wide total of tiered data centers and approximately 66 percent of the government-wide total of non- tiered centers by the end of fiscal year 2018. When accounting for additional closures expected in fiscal year 2019,  agencies have reported that they plan to close a total of 5,597 centers. Figure 1 provides a summary of agencies\u2019  total data centers and completed and planned closures.", "In total, 18 of the 24 agencies reported achieving an estimated $2.3 billion in cost savings and avoidances from their  data center consolidation and optimization efforts from the start of fiscal year 2012 through August 2016. The  Departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, and Treasury accounted for approximately $2.0 billion (or  87 percent) of the total. However, seven agencies are reporting less achieved cost savings and avoidances to OMB  compared to savings amounts they previously reported to us in November 2015. Further, agencies are planning a  total of approximately $378 million in savings between fiscal years 2016 and 2018, according to their DCOI strategic  plans. This is about $3.6 billion less than the approximately $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2016 through 2018 planned  savings that agencies reported to us in November 2015. This is also about $2.3 billion less than OMB\u2019s $2.7 billion  cost savings goal for agencies to achieve by the end of fiscal year 2018, as required by OMB M-16-19. This  reduction in planned savings reflects 7 agencies reporting less planned cost savings and avoidances in their DCOI  strategic plans compared to the savings amounts previously reported to us in November 2015, as well as the  absence of cost savings information for 4 agencies that had not submitted their strategic plan. See figure 2 for a  comparison of the amounts of cost savings and avoidances reported by agencies to OMB through their DCOI  strategic plan and the amounts reported to us.", "Of the 20 agencies that submitted their DCOI strategic plan as of December 2016, only 1\u2014the National Science  Foundation\u2014had addressed all five elements required by the OMB memorandum implementing FITARA, while the  remaining 19 either partially met or did not meet the requirements. For example, most agencies partially met or did  not meet the requirements to provide information related to data center closures and cost savings metrics. See  figure 3 for an assessment of the completeness of agencies\u2019 data center optimization plans, by key element.", "We also identified inconsistencies in the reporting of historical cost savings by 11 agencies across OMB\u2019s two  reporting mechanisms\u2014the DCOI strategic plans and the quarterly data submissions. Specifically, of the 24  agencies, 9 consistently reported savings information in their DCOI strategic plan and their August 2016 quarterly  reports to OMB, 11 agencies did not report consistent information, and 4 agencies did not submit their DCOI  strategic plan. These inconsistencies resulted in a discrepancy totaling approximately $1.5 billion between the two  sources. These inconsistencies were due, in part, to incomplete data in agencies\u2019 DCOI strategic plans.", "Agencies provided a variety of reasons for why their plans were incomplete, including the difficulty of reporting on  fiscal year 2016 actual savings and closures when the data are not yet finalized and the receipt of incomplete data  from some agency components. Completing these plans is increasingly important in light of the enactment of  FITARA, which requires agencies to establish a multi-year strategy to consolidate and optimize their data centers,  including performance metrics and cost savings goals. Moreover, as OMB\u2019s data center consolidation and other  related initiatives have been underway since 2010, agencies should have all the information necessary to complete  their plans. Until agencies address the missing elements in their DCOI strategic plan, they will be at risk of not  realizing anticipated savings, improved infrastructure utilization, and energy efficiency; they also may not be able to  satisfy federal requirements regarding data center consolidation and optimization. Further, until OMB improves its  oversight of agencies\u2019 reporting of cost savings and agencies ensure that their savings information is consistent  across all reporting mechanisms, the likelihood of further reporting errors is increased. Finally, until OMB improves  its oversight of the information in agencies\u2019 DCOI strategic plans, it may be challenged in demonstrating that DCOI  is meeting its established objectives.", "To better ensure that federal data center optimization efforts improve governmental efficiency and achieve cost  savings, we are recommending that the Director of OMB direct the Federal CIO to provide the necessary oversight  to (1) ensure that agencies complete their DCOI strategic plan in accordance with OMB\u2019s guidance implementing  FITARA and (2) ensure that agency reporting of achieved data center consolidation and optimization cost savings  and avoidances is consistent across all reporting mechanisms, including quarterly data submissions and agency  DCOI strategic plans.", "We are also recommending that 23 agencies take action to complete the missing elements in their respective DCOI  strategic plan, including addressing any identified challenges, and submit their completed strategic plan to OMB.

According to OMB, the federal government had 432 data centers in  1998, more than 1,100 in 2009, and 10,584 in November 2015. Operating such a large number of centers has been  and continues to be a significant cost to the federal government, including costs for hardware, software, real estate,  and cooling. For example, in 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the electricity costs to  operate federal servers and data centers across the government were about $450 million annually. According to the  Department of Energy, a typical data center has 100 to 200 times the energy use intensity of a commercial building.  In 2009, OMB reported that server utilization rates as low as 5 percent across the federal government\u2019s estimated  150,000 servers were a factor driving the need to establish a coordinated, government-wide effort to improve the  efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of federal data center activities.", "Background  OMB and the Federal CIO Established FDCCI  Concerned about the size of the federal data center inventory and the potential to improve the efficiency,  performance, and the environmental footprint of federal data center activities, OMB, under the direction of the  Federal CIO, established FDCCI in February 2010. This initiative\u2019s four high-level goals were to reduce the overall  energy and real estate footprint of government data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware, software, and  operations; increase the overall IT security posture of the government; and shift IT investments to more efficient  computing platforms and technologies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Under the first definition, OMB identified 2,094 data centers in July 2010.
