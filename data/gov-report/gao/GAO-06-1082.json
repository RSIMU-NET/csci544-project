At least 120 golf courses in 29 states have been identified as financed, at least in part, with tax-exempt bonds.

Governmental bonds are tax-exempt and can be  issued for a variety of public facilities and projects. Tax exemption lowers  municipalities\u2019 borrowing costs and provides higher after-tax yields to  investors. Private activity bonds, on the other hand, provide financing to  private businesses or individuals and are either tax-exempt or taxable  depending on two tests. Tax exemption is granted to certain qualified  private activity bonds, such as those for certain housing projects and  activities, but the borrowed amounts are limited and the interest earned by  investors can be subject to alternative minimum tax.", "In addition, bonds issued by state and local governments can be structured  as general obligation (G.O.) or revenue bonds. G.O. bonds, also known as  full faith and credit obligations, are secured by revenues obtained from the  issuer\u2019s general taxing powers, including sales taxes, property taxes, and  income taxes. Most G.O. bonds are used to build public infrastructure,  such as school buildings, jails, police stations, and city halls, and are  classified as governmental bonds for tax purposes.
