Temporary housing assistance and expedited assistance accounted for much of the increase in IHP expenditures as compared to prior years. Overall, however, although the number of applications was much higher, the percentage approved for non-housing assistance was notably lower for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita than in 2003 and 2004. The magnitude of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita posed challenges in providing assistance to an unprecedented number of victims many of whom were widely dispersed across the country. To address these challenges, FEMA developed new approaches and adapted existing approaches to quickly provide assistance and improve communication with victims. Despite these efforts, management challenges in staffing and training and program restrictions limited the effectiveness and efficiency of the disaster assistance process. FEMA has proposed a number of initiatives to address these problems, but it is too early to determine whether these efforts will effectively address the problems identified. GAO identified the potential for significant fraud and abuse as a result of FEMA's management of the IHP in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Flaws in the registration process resulted in what GAO estimated to be between $600 million and $1.4 billion in improper and potentially fraudulent payments due to invalid registration data. In addition, duplicate payments were made and FEMA lacked accountability over $2,000 debit cards that were given to disaster victims."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Making landfall in late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was the costliest  hurricane, and one of the deadliest, in U.

In its May 2006 Report,  the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  estimated Hurricane Katrina was responsible for over $150 billion in  damages and over 1,500 deaths, with thousands more reported missing.  Hurricane Katrina devastated much of the Gulf Coast; the storm surge  caused major or catastrophic damage along the coastlines of Alabama,  Mississippi, and Louisiana. About 80 percent of New Orleans, the largest  city affected, was flooded when levees protecting the city broke.  Hurricane Katrina ultimately affected 90,000 square miles, an area almost  as large as the United Kingdom.", "Hurricane Rita caused further devastation, making landfall on the Gulf  Coast in September 2005. The most intense Gulf of Mexico hurricane ever  recorded, Rita caused an estimated $9.4 billion in damages\u2014making it the  ninth costliest storm in the U.S. history. The storm killed 7 people directly,  and at least another 55 during evacuations and from indirect effects, such  as carbon monoxide poisoning.", "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  (\u201cthe Stafford Act\u201d) grants the principal authority for the President to  provide assistance in mitigating, responding to, and preparing for disasters  and emergencies such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and  terrorist acts. The mission of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which  administers the Stafford Act, is to reduce loss of life and property and  protect the nation from all types of hazards, through a comprehensive,  risk-based emergency management program. Section 408 of the Stafford  Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5174, is the general authority for the President to provide  assistance to individuals and households. This section encompasses  housing assistance as well as \u201cother needs\u201d assistance, which includes  medical, dental, funeral, personal property, transportation, and other  financial assistance for certain needs arising from a major disaster. These  two types of assistance are administered by FEMA under the Individuals  and Households Program (IHP). The IHP provides housing and \u201cother  needs\u201d assistance (ONA) in the forms of direct assistance (the provision of  temporary housing units) and financial assistance (grant funding for  temporary housing and other disaster-related needs) to eligible disaster  victims. Before providing assistance, FEMA is to conduct inspections of  disaster victims\u2019 homes to verify damage, ownership, and occupancy. As  part of the application process, FEMA refers disaster victims who apply  for assistance and meet established income levels to the Small Business  Administration (SBA). SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program is intended to be a  primary resource available to aid in disaster victims\u2019 recovery. Applicants  who are denied loan assistance by SBA or have remaining unmet needs are  sent back to FEMA for an assistance determination of their eligibility for  certain types of other needs assistance.", "In light of widespread congressional and public interest in U.S. agencies\u2019  performance in providing assistance to hurricane victims, we prepared  this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct  evaluations on his own initiative to review the events and aftermath  surrounding Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This report discusses (1) how  the types and amounts of assistance provided to victims of Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita through the IHP compare to other recent hurricanes, (2)  the challenges posed by the magnitude of the requests for assistance  following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and FEMA\u2019s response to these  challenges, and (3) the vulnerability of the IHP to fraud, and abuse, in the  wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "To describe the types and amounts of benefits FEMA provided to victims  of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita through IHP in comparison to assistance  provided in other hurricane disasters, we interviewed agency officials and  obtained and analyzed data provided by FEMA\u2019s National Processing  Service Center in Winchester, Virginia.

Our scope and methodology are  discussed in greater detail in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of the Stafford Act is to provide an orderly and continuing  means of assistance by the federal government to state and local  governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering  and damage which results from disasters. The Stafford Act originally was  enacted in 1974 and amended in 1988, 1993, and 2000. The Disaster  Mitigation Act of 2000 established the IHP by combining two previous  disaster grant programs - - the Temporary Housing Assistance and  Individual Family Grant programs. Under the IHP, these programs were  replaced by Housing Assistance and Other Needs Assistance. Looking  specifically at the Housing Assistance component of the IHP, section 408  of the Stafford Act authorizes five types of assistance, of which four are  relevant to disaster victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita: (1) Financial assistance to rent temporary housing. FEMA  may provide financial assistance to individuals or households to  rent alternative housing accommodations, existing rental units,  manufactured housing, recreational vehicles, or other readily  fabricated dwellings.(2) \u201cDirect\u201d temporary housing assistance. FEMA may  provide temporary housing units (e.g., mobile homes and travel  trailers), acquired by purchase or lease, directly to disaster victims,  who, because of a lack of available housing resources, would be  unable to make use of financial assistance to rent alternate housing  accommodations. In other words, direct assistance would be  available in situations where rental accommodations are not  available. By statute, direct assistance is limited to an 18-month  period, after which FEMA may charge fair market rent for the  housing unless it extends the 18-month free-of-charge period due  to extraordinary circumstances.(3) Repair assistance. Under this authority, FEMA may provide  financial assistance for the repair of owner-occupied private  residences, utilities, and residential infrastructure damaged by a  major disaster. However, the maximum amount of repair  assistance provided to a household is limited to $5,000, adjusted  annually to reflect changes in the CPI.(4) Replacement assistance. This form of housing assistance  authorizes funding to replace owner-occupied private residences.  The amount of replacement assistance FEMA may provide to a  household is limited to $10,000, adjusted annually to reflect  changes in the CPI. For a victim to receive this assistance, there  must have been at least $10,000 of damage to the dwelling. The  victim may use the assistance toward replacement housing costs.", "As of September 25, 2006, proposed legislation was pending before  Congress that would, among other things, eliminate the cap on home  repair and replacement assistance.", "FEMA may provide ONA grant funding for public transportation expenses,  medical and dental expenses, and funeral and burial expenses. ONA grant  funding may also be available to replace personal property, repair and  replace vehicles, and reimburse moving and storage expenses under  certain circumstances. The maximum financial amount of housing and  other needs assistance that an individual or household may receive is  capped at $25,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer  Price Index. Eligibility for IHP assistance is determined when an  individual or household applies with FEMA and is based on the amount of  property damage resulting from the disaster.", "For disaster victims with financial resources, SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan  Program is intended to be a primary resource available to aid in their  recovery. FEMA refers disaster victims who apply for assistance and meet  established income levels to SBA. Applicants who are denied loan  assistance by SBA or have remaining unmet needs are sent back to FEMA  for an assistance determination of their eligibility for certain types of ONA  grant funding. (We reported on SBA\u2019s efforts to provide disaster loans in  response to the 2005 hurricanes in July 2006 and expect to issue another  report on SBA\u2019s response later this year.) Table 1 provides an overview of  IHP benefits and identifies the ONA benefits that are subject to SBA  disaster loan eligibility.", "FEMA manages the IHP primarily through a decentralized structure of  permanent and temporary field offices staffed mostly by contract and  temporary employees. The offices include permanent locations at the  FEMA Recovery Division in FEMA Headquarters, regional offices, National  Processing Service Centers, and temporary locations at Joint Field Offices,  Area Field Offices, and Disaster Recovery Centers. Once the President  declares a major disaster that is eligible for federal assistance, victims in  declared counties must first apply for it with FEMA, by phone, over the  Internet, or in person at a disaster recovery center. Figure 1 shows disaster  victims waiting to speak with temporary disaster staff in October 2005 at a  Disaster Recovery Center in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.", "Once a FEMA representative records personal information from a disaster  application and provides the applicant with a FEMA application number,  FEMA\u2019s National Emergency Management Information System  automatically determines potential eligibility for designated categories of  assistance. FEMA refers disaster victims who apply for moving and  storage, personal property repair or replacement, and/or vehicle repair or  replacement related grant funding assistance and meet established income  levels to SBA. Applicants who are denied loan assistance by SBA or have  remaining unmet needs are sent back to FEMA for an assistance  determination of their eligibility for certain types of ONA grant funding. To  confirm that the home and personal property sustained damages as  reported in a disaster assistance application, FEMA is to meet with  disaster victims at their homes to conduct individual inspections to verify,  ownership, occupancy, and damage. Figure 2 shows a FEMA inspection  notice on a home in St. Bernard Parish damaged by Hurricane Katrina.", "Based on the results of the inspection and determinations made by staff at  the National Processing Service Centers, FEMA approves or denies  housing and/or other needs assistance. (Applicants may be eligible for  either or both types of assistance.) If the applicant qualifies for a grant,  FEMA sends the applicant a check by mail or deposits the grant funds in  the applicant\u2019s bank account. If an applicant is denied, he or she may  appeal the decision by contacting a service center and providing additional  information or clarification. Recipients of IHP assistance must recertify  their continuing need for assistance every 30 to 90 days, depending on the  type of assistance.

Two categories of assistance\u2014temporary housing assistance and  expedited assistance---- accounted for much of the significant increase in  IHP expenditures for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as compared to prior  years. FEMA also provided a much greater amount of assistance for  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, than in prior years, for specific types of ONA  benefits that are primarily provided only after applicants apply for and are  denied an SBA disaster loan, indicating that the percentage of lower  income applicants may have been a significant portion of total applicants.

Expedited  assistance is a pre-inspection disbursement of funds to disaster victims  based on specific criteria such as the severity of the damage. (See glossary  for definitions of all housing and other needs assistance categories.)  Transitional housing assistance that was authorized exclusively for  Hurricane Katrina, was estimated at about $1.3 billion while expedited  assistance for both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita totaled an about             $2.3 billion.

Income dependent assistance requires that  eligible applicants initially apply for and be denied assistance from the  SBA Disaster Loan Program and includes expenses for personal property,  moving and storage, and vehicle repair and replacement expenses. For  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, personal property assistance accounted for  the majority of the income dependent assistance, about $1.8 billion. In  comparison, for the hurricanes in 2003 and 2004, the combined total  income-dependent assistance approved was less than $495 million.

As a result, FEMA  was also challenged to conduct an unprecedented number of housing  inspections, often with limited or no access to individuals or, in many  cases, to the affected homes. To provide benefits quickly to eligible  victims, communicate with about 2 million applicants scattered across the  country and conduct inspections, FEMA developed a number of new  approaches, as summarized in table 4.", "In addition, FEMA adapted several of its traditional approaches to respond  to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, according to FEMA, as summarized in  table 5."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite New Approaches, Reported Ongoing Management Challenges Hindered Implementing IHP", "paragraphs": ["Each of the assessments of the federal government\u2019s response to  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita we reviewed identified problems in FEMA\u2019s  implementation of IHP during and after the storms.

A list of these assessments is provided in table 7. In addition, a  summary of Katrina- and Rita-issues related to the IHP addressed in these  reports is identified in appendix IV.", "Regarding planning, the DHS Inspector General reported in March 2006  that FEMA lacked final plans that specifically addressed the types of  challenges the agency could be expected to face in catastrophic  circumstances.  For example, because FEMA was unable to immediately  implement IHP assistance to provide funds to transition victims from  short-term lodging, including shelters, hotels and motels to longer-term  housing alternatives such as mobile homes or apartments, FEMA officials  used Public Assistance funds. Normally, public assistance is provided  (under section 403 of the Stafford Act) only for immediate emergency  sheltering efforts to get assistance to individuals and households quickly.  Under normal circumstances, IHP funds provided under Section 408 of the  Act are intended to accommodate the longer-term housing needs of  evacuees up to 18 months. FEMA officials said that many applicants would  have waited months to receive their initial assistance if FEMA had  followed normal IHP processes and procedures under Section 408 and had  to wait until inspections were completed and IHP information and  assistance could be communicated to disaster victims who were dispersed  to all 50 states. However, this use of Public Assistance funds was  problematic, according to the DHS Inspector General\u2019s report. Because  application for assistance is not a requirement for the provision of Public  Assistance under section 403 of the Stafford Act, FEMA did not know  whether disaster victims were actually eligible for assistance as a direct  result of the disaster. This increased the potential for duplication with  other assistance programs since there was no internal mechanism to  determine whether an evacuee had received assistance from the IHP when  interim housing may have already been provided. The interim housing  assistance funded under section 403 was only phased out after FEMA was  able to identify that an evacuee had received IHP funds.", "FEMA was aware it needed to plan for large disasters but had problems  getting necessary funding, according to the Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee\u2019s Katrina Report. FEMA requests for  $100 million for catastrophic planning and an additional $20 million for  catastrophic housing planning in fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2005,  respectively, were denied by DHS. Our review of FEMA\u2019s implementation  of IHP showed that FEMA\u2019s reactive approach to planning and  implementing the IHP on a disaster-by-disaster basis is inadequate to deal  with the short-term and long-term needs of affected communities,  particularly for catastrophic disasters when the agency\u2019s resources and  staff are strained. For example, FEMA failed to pre-identify workable sites  and land and take advantage of available housing units from other federal  agencies, according to a February 2006 White House report. We have  ongoing work focusing on the federal role in providing housing assistance  in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "In terms of trained staff, FEMA lacked the surge capacity to effectively  manage the disaster assistance process. Specifically, according to the  March 2006 DHS Inspector General report, additional trained staff were  needed to (1) provide initial application services at Disaster Recovery and  Call/Processing Centers, (2) process applications and respond to questions  at the National Processing Service Centers, and (3) conduct inspections.  First, according to the DHS Inspector General, disaster victims  experienced delays when they contacted Call Centers or were not able to  speak with anyone. Second, disaster victims experienced delays in  obtaining their eligibility determination, according to FEMA officials  responsible for managing the IHP. Third, inspections were delayed, in part,  because FEMA lacked enough contract inspectors to perform inspections,  according to FEMA. Our analysis found, for example, that inspection times  for Katrina and Rita took an average of two to five times longer compared  to named hurricanes in 2004. FEMA uses inspectors that have a  construction, real estate, or appraisal background, but it is not required,  according to a FEMA Inspection Services Manager. FEMA requires that  each inspector be trained on FEMA standards and policies regarding  program eligibility and that new inspectors undergo background checks.  In most conventional disasters, experienced inspectors are to accompany  new inspectors in the field to ensure that they are meeting FEMA  standards before they are allowed to complete inspections on their own.  We have work underway assessing trends in FEMA\u2019s resources, including  staffing, and their impact on FEMA\u2019s capacity to conduct operations and  plan to report on FEMA\u2019s workforce management efforts later this year.", "According to the March 2006 DHS Inspector General report, FEMA was  not able to dedicate its full staffing strength to Hurricane Katrina for three  primary reasons. First, at the time of the disaster, FEMA had personnel  assigned to 38 other disasters not related to Hurricane Katrina. For  example, Hurricane Ophelia in the Carolinas, Hurricane Rita in the Gulf  Coast region, and flooding in the Northeast were declared disasters and  required FEMA resources. Second, an average of 30 percent of FEMA  Disaster Assistance Employees reported they were unavailable to respond  to Katrina or any other disaster during the August 24, 2005 \u2013 September 30,  2005 time frame. (Disaster Assistance Employees may be unavailable for  such issues as health or family concerns.) Third, FEMA officials said,  although FEMA was authorized 2,445 staff in August 2005, 389 positions  were vacant and many of these were key leadership positions. The DHS  Inspector\u2019s report included recommendations that FEMA (1) develop a  more comprehensive program to recruit, train, and retain local hires for  use in augmenting FEMA\u2019s Disaster Assistance Employees and permanent  staff, (2) provide training to additional NPSC staff and contractors to  enhance FEMA\u2019s capability to perform evacuee assistance and case  management activities, and (3) develop a disaster workforce plan for  permanent, temporary, and reserve staff that is scalable events regardless  of cause, size, or complexity. FEMA concurred with the  recommendations.", "Throughout our review FEMA officials cited their concerns regarding the  lack of agency and contractor staffing resources needed to effectively  implement the program during a catastrophic event. Concerns regarding  training and staffing for disaster response management are long-standing.  In 2003, in our report on major performance and accountability challenges  for FEMA, we noted that FEMA faced challenges to enhance its disaster  assistance training and resource planning. According to the report, FEMA  developed a program in 1999 for evaluating the knowledge, skills, and  abilities of its staff\u2014both permanent and temporary\u2014who are deployed to  respond to a disaster. FEMA expected the program would ensure its  employees would have basic qualifications to perform their jobs, but,  according to FEMA officials, the program was not implemented because of  budget constraints. We also reported that 48 percent of FEMA\u2019s workforce  would be eligible to retire in the next 5 years and this would pose a  challenge for having staff with the skills needed to perform core functions.", "Finally, FEMA officials cited legislative and regulatory limitations that  restricted FEMA\u2019s flexibility in implementing the IHP in the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina. For example,    FEMA\u2019s Federal Coordinating Officer for Louisiana cited the statutory  program\u2019s maximum of $5,000 for home repair as one limitation, noting  that if the $5,000 is not sufficient to fix the home, then FEMA may have  to provide a trailer for temporary housing. He testified that  manufactured housing is not cost-effective and can cost up to $90,000  to $100,000 per mobile home for a group site (including total costs for  site preparation, hauling and installation, and cost of home). He  suggested that in some situations if FEMA were able to give disaster  victims the maximum amount of IHP financial assistance, it would be  more cost-effective because it would allow many of these families to  find permanent housing. However, the Acting Deputy Director for  FEMA\u2019s Recovery Division told us that FEMA only uses manufactured  housing as a last resort, and in the post-Katrina and Rita environment,  housing and the infrastructure that supports the community was  destroyed. As a result, FEMA did not have any alternative other than to  provide manufactured housing.", "FEMA officials were unable to use a large supply of federally  controlled housing units that could have been made available for  occupancy by disaster victims with only minor repairs because  reimbursement for repairs to existing available housing units are not  authorized under the current program regulations, according to the  White House report on Hurricane Katrina. As a result, FEMA had to  provide alternative temporary housing such as trailers and other  manufactured housing units, at considerably greater cost, while leaving  other potentially available housing vacant.", "A bill, the Natural Disaster Housing Reform Act of 2006, was introduced  May 16, 2006, in the House of Representatives that would provide the  federal government with more flexibility in the provision of short- and  long-term housing after a major disaster.  For example, the bill would  allow the President to offer disaster victims manufactured modular  housing under the IHP if it could be provided at a lower cost than other  readily fabricated dwellings. It would also extend repair assistance under  the IHP, currently available only for owner-occupied residences, so that  renters could repair existing rental units to make them habitable as  alternate housing accommodations. The bill also proposes that the  President may provide financial assistance or direct assistance to  individuals or households to construct permanent or semi-permanent  housing in any area in which the President declared a major disaster or  emergency in connection with Hurricane Katrina of 2005 during the period  beginning on August 28, 2005, and ending on December 31, 2007.

According to FEMA, the improvements related to IHP include plans to  increase the number of trained staff and revise new policies and  procedures. However, at the time of our review, many of these initiatives  were in the planning or at the early implementation stage. As a result, it  was too early to assess their potential impact on future program  implementation. Specifically, FEMA reported plans to:    Hire a training coordinator to develop a more comprehensive training  program to prepare existing and new personnel for Disaster Recovery  Center assignments. According to FEMA\u2019s Acting Deputy Director for  the Recovery Division, they were still searching for qualified applicants  for the training coordinator position as of August 2006.", "Train 3,000 disaster \u201cgeneralist\u201d surge cadre employees for ready  deployment during the height of the 2006 hurricane season and  increase its capacity to deploy and communicate with the increased  number of disaster employees. According to FEMA, these surge  employees are to form a \u201cgeneralist\u201d pool of disaster workers and be  trained in a number of basic functions cutting across traditional  program areas including Community Relations, Individual Assistance,  Public Assistance and Logistics. As of August 2006, FEMA said  approximately 1,836 employees had completed the training.", "Develop greater contract and contingency surge capabilities to expand  application intake capacity of up to 200,000 per day (during the weeks  following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA recorded more than  100,000 applications a day) and expand its Internet-based application  capability by improving accessibility to reduce application wait times  and FEMA Helpline information delays following a major disaster.  According to FEMA officials, the objective of expanding its capabilities  is to have private-sector contracts in place and resources ready to  handle calls within 48 hours of a disaster declaration. In the past,  FEMA had to augment its application intake surge capabilities each  hurricane season especially during 2004 and 2005 a step usually taken  under urgent and compelling needs, through emergency contracts, and  by using Internal Revenue Service personnel. FEMA plans to award the  contract for this initiative in 2007 and, in the interim period, plans to  continue to utilize IRS personnel and redirect existing FEMA staff to  augment application intake capabilities.", "Implement a pilot program in the 2006 hurricane season to use Mobile  Registration Intake Centers that can be deployed to emergency shelter  locations or impacted neighborhoods without power or phone service  and provide on-site capability to quickly apply for FEMA assistance.  These units would be capable of providing the public access to the  FEMA disaster assistance program via phone and the internet. FEMA  currently has five vehicles each equipped with 20 telephones and 20  personal computers. As of August 2006, FEMA was in the planning  stage of upgrading each vehicle\u2019s capacity to support 40 telephones and  40 personal computers and has the ability to expand this effort by using  tents with tables and equipment set up near the vehicles. FEMA\u2019s  intention is to evaluate the pilot program at the end of the 2006  hurricane season to determine if they should expand this capability.", "Increase contractor staffing capacity for housing inspections from  7,500/per day/per contractor to 20,000/per day/per contractor. FEMA  anticipates that this added capacity will increase the speed and  accuracy of home inspections. FEMA intends to implement the related  requirements with the award of its new inspection contracts tentatively  scheduled for the end of December 2006.", "Clarify program policies on the appropriate use and authorization of  emergency sheltering funds (Stafford Act, section 403 assistance) and  individual housing assistance funds (Stafford Act, section 408  assistance) for the disaster victims. As part of this initiative, FEMA  plans to have a draft policy in place for issuing authorization codes to  evacuees for lodging and hotels for the 2006 hurricane season. In  addition, FEMA plans to have a policy for Expedited Assistance that  defines the conditions that must be met before initiating the program.

As we testified in June 2006, an estimated  16 percent, or approximately $1 billion, in FEMA IHP payments were  improper and potentially fraudulent due to invalid application data. (A  copy of our testimony is provided in app. IV.) Additionally, we found that  FEMA made improper or potentially fraudulent IHP payments to  applications containing names and Social Security Numbers of individuals  who were incarcerated at the time of disaster, and paid hotel room  charges for applicants who were also receiving rental assistance  concurrently. We also determined that FEMA had little accountability over  debit card distribution and lacked proper controls over debit card usage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Invalid Applications Provide the Potential for $1 Billion in Potentially Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["An estimated 16 percent of payments totaling approximately $1 billion  were improper and potentially fraudulent due to invalid applications. The  95-percent confidence interval surrounding the estimate of 16 percent  ranges from 12 percent to 21 percent. The 95-percent confidence interval  surrounding the estimate of $1 billion ranges from $600 million to           $1.4 billion. The estimated amount included payments for expedited  assistance, rental assistance, housing and personal property repair and  replacement, and other necessary and emergency expenses. These  payments were made to (1) applications containing Social Security  Numbers (SSN) that were never issued or belonged to other individuals,  (2) applicants who used bogus damaged addresses, and (3) applicants who  had never lived at the declared damaged addresses or did not live at the  declared damaged address at the time of disaster. These payments were  also made to applications containing information that was duplicative of  other applications already recorded in FEMA\u2019s system. The duplicative  payment failures refer to instances where FEMA made payments to more  than one application with the same damaged property and current  addresses, and the payment selected was associated with the second or  later application. For example, one applicant submitted an application for  the same current and damaged address that was used on another  application, and both received payments for $2,358 of rental assistance on  each application in September 2005. Effective preventive controls for  duplicate applications would have detected that the two applications  shared the same damaged and current address and acted to prevent the  duplicate payments.", "Our projection likely understated the total amount of improper and  potentially fraudulent payments because our work was limited to issues  related to misuse and abuse of identity, damaged property address  information, and duplicate payments. Our estimate did not account for  improper and potentially fraudulent payments related to issues such as  identity theft, and whether the applicants received rental assistance they  were not entitled to, received housing and other assistance while incurring  no damage to their property, and/or received FEMA assistance for the  same damages already settled through insurance claims.", "Our forensic audit and investigative work found that improper and  potentially fraudulent payments occurred mainly because FEMA did not  validate the identity of all applicants, the physical location of the declared  damaged address, and ownership and occupancy of all applicants at the  time of application. For example, in one case an applicant received $7,328  for expedited and rental assistance even though the applicant had moved  out of the house a month prior to Hurricane Katrina. Examples of other  improper and potentially fraudulent payments included a FEMA payment  of $2,000 to an individual who provided a damaged address that did not  exist, and payment of $2,358 in rental assistance to another individual who  claimed his damaged property was inside a cemetery. We also found that  FEMA made approximately $5.3 million in payments to applicants who  provided a post office box address as their damaged residence. For  example, FEMA paid an applicant $2,748 who had listed a post office box  in Alabama as the damaged property. Follow-up work with local postal  officials revealed that the post office box listed on the application had  been used by individuals linked to other potential fraud schemes.", "Our undercover work provided further evidence of the weaknesses in  FEMA\u2019s management of the disaster assistance process. For example,  FEMA provided nearly $6,000 in rental assistance to one of GAO\u2019s  undercover applicants who had applications that declared a bogus  property as the damaged address. These payments continued to be  provided even though verification with third-party records indicated that  the GAO undercover applicant did not live at the damaged address, and  after the Small Business Administration had reported that the damaged  property could not be found. In another example, a FEMA inspector  assigned to inspect a bogus property was not able to find the house  despite numerous attempts to verify the address through the phone book,  the post office, and a physical inspection. Nevertheless, in early 2006  FEMA provided GAO a check for $2,000 for presumed losses sustained by  this property.", "Without verifying the identity and primary residence of applicants prior to  IHP payments, it is not surprising that FEMA also made expedited and  rental assistance payments totaling millions of dollars to over 1,000  applications containing information belonging to prison inmates. In other  words, payments were made to applications using the names and SSNs of  individuals who were not displaced as a result of the hurricanes, but rather  were incarcerated at state prisons of the Gulf Coast states (that is,  Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama), or in federal  prisons across the United States when the hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast.  For example, FEMA paid over $20,000 to an inmate who had used a post  office box as his damaged property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duplicative Housing Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Our data mining work also found potentially wasteful and improper rental  assistance payments to individuals who were staying at hotels paid for by  FEMA. In essence, the government paid twice for these individuals\u2019  lodging\u2014first by providing a hotel at no cost and, second, by making  payments to reimburse these individuals for out-of-pocket rent. For  example, FEMA paid an individual $2,358 in rental assistance, while at the  same time paying about $8,000 for the same individual to stay 70 nights\u2014 at more than $100 per night\u2014in a hotel in Hawaii. In this particular case,  the duplicate payments were not only wasteful, but they were improper  because the applicant did not live at the damaged property at the time of  the hurricane. Another applicant stayed more than 5 months\u2014at a cost of  $8,000\u2014in hotels paid for by FEMA in California, while also receiving  three rental assistance payments for the two separate disasters totaling  more than $6,700.", "These instances occurred because FEMA did not require hotels to collect  FEMA application numbers and SSNs from residents staying in FEMA-paid  for rooms. Without this information, FEMA could not verify if the  applicants were staying in government provided hotels before sending  them rental assistance. Without the ability to identify all IHP applicants  who had already received hotel lodging, FEMA provided duplicate housing  benefits to a number of applicants. Because the hotels and FEMA did not  collect application identification numbers, we were unable to quantify the  magnitude of individuals who received these duplicate benefits. However,  the tens of thousands of dollars that were wasted in the previous examples  are illustrative of the wasteful spending we found through data mining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Accountability over Debit Cards", "paragraphs": ["Finally, we found that FEMA did not institute adequate controls to ensure  accountability over the debit cards. Specifically, FEMA initially paid       $1.5 million for over 750 debit cards that the government could not  determine actually went to help disaster victims. Based on our numerous  inquiries, upon identification of several hundred undistributed cards J.P.  Morgan Chase refunded FEMA $770,000 attributable to the undistributed  cards. Further, we continued to find that debit cards were used for items  or services such as a Caribbean vacation, professional football tickets, and  adult entertainment, which do not appear to be necessary to satisfy  disaster-related needs as defined by FEMA regulations. In commenting on  our draft report, FEMA partially concurred with our recommendation to  increase accountability over debit cards, acknowledging the challenges  inherent in the use of debit cards and stating that the agency has no  current plans to use debit cards.  FEMA said the agency will continue to  evaluate the report\u2019s recommendations to determine whether any further  use may be warranted.", "Fraud and error in this program is not new and FEMA has struggled for  some time with the issue of balancing expeditious assistance with  minimizing fraud and improper payments.

These previous reports identified problems  related to a lack of inspections to verify property damage, relaxed  requirements to document whether an applicant was eligible for advance  payment of a grant, increasing the likelihood of fraud for the program.  More recently, in May 2005, DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported  shortcomings in FEMA\u2019s administration of IHP and its oversight of  inspections in response to Hurricane Francis.

The widespread devastation they  wrought presented unprecedented challenges to all levels of government  and voluntary organizations to help the hundreds of thousands of victims  evacuate, relocate, and get food, shelter, medical care, and other  assistance. As we and others have reported, the unprecedented geographic  scope of the damage, the number of victims who had to be relocated, and  the extent of the devastation clearly overwhelmed both government and  nongovernment relief agencies, resulting in widespread dissatisfaction  with the effectiveness of the preparation and response to the disaster.", "FEMA\u2019s processes and systems for registering hurricane victims for  assistance, determining eligibility for IHP assistance, and managing the  IHP were simply overwhelmed, and FEMA was unable to effectively  manage the enormous challenge that the disasters posed for the IHP.  GAO\u2019s audit and that of others found a number of problems with the  program, including a lack of appropriately trained personnel that limited  FEMA\u2019s effective surge capacity, an inability to effectively identify  ineligible and duplicate applications, and consequently the payment of  millions of dollars of assistance to ineligible persons. GAO\u2019s audit and  investigative work found that FEMA did not have an effective fraud  prevention program in place prior to the landfall of Hurricanes Katrina and  Rita. The consequences were that tens of thousands of individuals  received an estimated $600 million to $1.4 billion in potential improper or  fraudulent payments through February 2006. The actual amount may be  higher because our work excluded such issues as identify theft, insurance  fraud, and individuals who had no uninsured losses who may have  received benefits.", "In any major disaster FEMA faces the demand to get assistance to eligible  victims, many of whom may have lost everything, expeditiously while also  ensuring that assistance does not go to those who are ineligible. FEMA  recognizes that the problems it encountered in managing the IHP in the  wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita need to be addressed and has  announced several initiatives to address those problems. The effect of  those efforts cannot yet be determined, and not all of them were  scheduled to be in effect for the 2006 hurricane season. We believe it is  possible to have effective fraud prevention controls in place while also  getting money to eligible victims quickly. Such controls are far more  effective in ensuring that IHP funds are used properly than efforts to  recoup funds paid to those who were ineligible for assistance.

However, FEMA\u2019s reported fraud rate of 1 to 3 percent is  not based on an independent, comprehensive statistical sample of the  entire population of individual assistance payments; instead, the                  1 to 3 percent FEMA estimate is simply the amount of overpayments that it  identifies based on its own internal processes and procedures.", "FEMA fully agreed with 9 of the 13 recommendations, and stated that it  had taken or plans to take actions to specifically respond to these                9 recommendations.  While we did not evaluate the extent to which the  implementation of these changes would address the weaknesses we  identified with FEMA\u2019s oversight of IHP payments, if they are properly  implemented the changes should address our concerns.

Regarding our 3 recommendations on debit cards,  FEMA stated that the agency has no current plans to use debit cards and  will continue to evaluate the report\u2019s recommendations to determine  whether any further use may be warranted.  In response to our  recommendation that FEMA establish procedures requiring that  individuals apply with FEMA prior to receiving no cost disaster lodgings  accommodations from federal agencies or the Red Cross, FEMA stated  that the agency has implemented a protocol to ensure that disaster victims  register and obtain an authorization code as a prerequisite for the use of  hotels/motels as transition shelters.  While FEMA cannot impose this  protocol on the Red Cross, FEMA stated that it planned to affirm eligibility  prior to reimbursing the Red Cross.  Our objective in making this  recommendation is to prevent duplicate housing benefits from being  provided to registrants.  Thus, if FEMA\u2019s new process affirms the eligibility  of registrants prior to reimbursing Red Cross, FEMA\u2019s processes would  address the objective of this recommendation.", "While FEMA substantially agreed with our recommendations, it disagreed  with the methodology we used to conduct our work, which formed the  basis for many of the 13 recommendations.

However, it is important to note that FEMA\u2019s  estimate of 1 to 3 percent fraud is not based on an independent,  comprehensive statistical sample of the entire population of individual  assistance payments; instead, it is based on the historical amount of IHP  payments that FEMA places in its internal recoupment process, which  includes overpayments identified through case reviews, system checks,  and hotline tips.  FEMA officials have acknowledged that their estimate is  not based on an in-depth statistical analysis for eligibility or any other type  of fraud.", "Further, our estimate is likely understated because it only focused on  payments made to invalid registrations.  Our estimate excluded substantial  potential fraudulent and improper payments caused by such actions as  identity theft, insurance fraud, duplicate government payments for  lodging, or payments without evidence of property damage.  In responding  to our draft report, FEMA also commingled the results of our statistical  sampling with other findings of fraudulent and improper payments that  were not included in our estimate.

Specifically, FEMA stated that without a \u201cknowledgeable\u201d case by case  analysis, our estimate was not accurate.  We disagree.  We were aware of  FEMA\u2019s separated household\u2019s policy and did not count any payments as  duplicates if they related to families that were displaced to different  locations.  In addition, for our statistical sample we performed a detailed  case by case analysis on sample items that included using all available  audit and investigative tools, background information, and NEMIS data to  ensure conclusions reached were accurate.  For example, we visited  damaged addresses and spoke with IHP applicants, landlords, neighbors,  and postal officials.", "FEMA also stated that it has been unable to validate our results because  we had not provided evidence related to our estimate for their review.  We  have not provided details of our sample failures to FEMA because the  cases of fraudulent and improper payments are in the process of being  referred to the Katrina Fraud Task Force for investigation and potential  prosecution, as has been the standard process for other fraud cases  identified though data mining.

FEMA commented that such a  determination can only be made after a knowledgeable case by case  analysis determined the appropriateness of payments.

We also reviewed prior audit reports and  assessments related to FEMA\u2019s implementation of the IHP.", "To assess the vulnerability of the IHP to fraud and abuse and management  issues in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and FEMA\u2019s reported  actions to address any identified problems, we estimated the number of  improper and potentially fraudulent payments based on statistical  sampling of payments to examine whether the associated applications  contained invalid Social Security Numbers (SSN), bogus addresses, invalid  primary residence, and duplicate information with another application.  Invalid SSNs refer to instances where the SSNs did not match with the  name provided; the SSNs belonged to deceased individuals; or the SSNs  had never been issued. Bogus addresses refer to instances where audit and  investigative work we performed indicate that the damaged address did  not exist. Invalid primary residences are related to applications where the  applicant had never lived at the damaged address, or did not live at the  damaged address at the time of the hurricanes. Duplicate information  refers to instances where the applications contained information that is  duplicative of another application that received a payment and was earlier  recorded in FEMA\u2019s system. Because we followed a probability procedure  based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of  samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision  of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95-percent confidence interval (e.g.,  plus or minus 5 percentage points). This is the interval that would contain  the actual population value for 95-percent of the samples we could have  drawn. As a result, we are 95-percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals in this report will include the true values in the study  population. Also, the 16 percent of payments that was improper and  potentially fraudulent excluded payments that were returned to the U.S.  government by the time of our review. We also reviewed IHP processes  and procedures for determining applicant eligibility for specific types of  IHP assistance and analyzed prior audit reports and assessments. We also  obtained information from FEMA\u2019s Acting Deputy Director of Recovery on  the status of FEMA\u2019s efforts to address the problems identified. Because  we have not tested all aspects of potential fraud, waste and abuse related  to the IHP, the recommendations in this and our prior report do not  represent a comprehensive fraud prevention program.", "We conducted our audit work between January 2006 and September 2006  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) is one of  these individual assistance programs funded through the Stafford Act\u2019s  Disaster Relief Fund, as illustrated in the conceptual framework for  federal disaster assistance in the figure 7.", "Congress may provide funding for federal disaster assistance to specific  agencies for areas in which they retain expertise. For example, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development administers funds for  economic redevelopment and infrastructure restoration, the Department  of Transportation provides assistance for road restoration, and other  agencies provide assistance for activities such as providing small  businesses disaster assistance loans and public health or medical services  that may be needed in the affected area.", "With respect to Stafford Act activities, FEMA administers the Disaster  Relief Fund, which provides for three major categories of aid under the  Stafford Act\u2014assistance to state and local governments through public  and hazard mitigation assistance programs and assistance to individuals  and households.", "FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program provides grants to eligible state and  local governments and specific types of private nonprofit organizations  that provide services of a governmental nature, such as fire  departments, emergency and medical facilities, and educational  institutions, to help cover the costs of emergency response efforts and  work associated with recovering from the disaster. Public Assistance is  typically the most costly disaster assistance provided.", "FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program provides grants to states,  local governments, and Indian tribes for long-term hazard mitigation  projects after a major disaster declaration.

The purpose of the crisis  counseling program is to help relieve any grieving, stress, or mental  health problems caused or aggravated by the disaster or its aftermath.  FEMA also provides free legal counseling through an agreement with  the Young Lawyers Division of the American Bar Association for low- income individuals regarding cases that will not produce a fee. FEMA  provides direct (temporary housing units) and financial assistance  (grant funding for temporary housing and other disaster-related needs)  to individuals and households through the IHP to meet necessary  expenses and serious needs of eligible disaster victims who, as a direct  result of a major disaster, have uninsured or under insured necessary  expenses and serious needs and are unable to meet such needs through  other means."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s IHP Provides Housing and Other Needs Assistance to Disaster Victims Who Meet Eligibility Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Under the IHP, there are two programs which are referred to as the  Housing Assistance program and the Other Needs Assistance (ONA)  program. The Housing Assistance program provides financial assistance  for such things as rental housing, home repair assistance (up to $5,000),  and home replacement assistance (up to $10,000). In addition, for disaster  victims for whom rental accommodations are not available under the  Housing Assistance program, FEMA may provide \u201cdirect assistance\u201d in the  form of temporary housing units (e.g., mobile homes and travel trailers),  that FEMA has acquired by purchase or lease. The ONA program also  includes financial assistance for medical, dental, funeral, personal  property, transportation, and other disaster-related expenses that are not  compensated by other means. The IHP is not intended to fully compensate  disaster victims for all losses from damage to real and personal property  that resulted from the disaster or to provide sufficient funds to restore  damaged property to its condition before the disaster. Rather, IHP is  intended to provide assistance in covering expenses not covered by other  means, such as insurance claims and payments or the victim\u2019s own savings  and resources. The maximum amount that an individual or household may  receive is statutorily capped at $25,000, adjusted annually to reflect  changes in the Consumer Price Index. In addition to the financial cap, IHP  assistance is also limited to 18 months beginning on the date the President  declares a major disaster. However, the President may extend this 18- month period if the President determines that due to extraordinary  circumstances an extension would be in the public interest.", "Eligibility for IHP assistance is determined when an individual or  household applies with FEMA and is based on the amount of property  damage. To qualify for Housing Assistance, a disaster victim must:    have experienced losses in an area that has been declared a disaster by    have uninsured (or underinsured) needs that cannot be met through    be a citizen of the United States, a non-citizen national, or a qualified  alien, or have a qualifying individual who lives with the disaster victim;    have been living or usually live in the home in the disaster area at the  time of the disaster; and    be unable to live in the home, cannot get to their home due to the  disaster, or the home requires repairs because of damage from the  disaster.", "If a disaster victim is eligible for housing assistance from FEMA based  upon the above criteria, grant funds can be used for housing assistance  purposes. Individuals or households who receive the assistance may be  asked to show receipts to prove that it was used for eligible housing  expenses. If an individual is unable to find a rental house or apartment  within a reasonable commuting distance of their damaged home, FEMA  may provide direct assistance in the form of a travel trailer or mobile  home. Direct or financial housing assistance from FEMA does not require  that an applicant file for an Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster  loan and is 100 percent federally funded and administered by the federal  government. While the financial housing assistance is subject to the  $25,000 cap, the cost of direct housing assistance is not subject to the cap.", "In contrast, ONA grants are provided in a cost-shared partnership between  FEMA and the state. As part of this partnership, FEMA and the state  engage in annual coordination efforts to determine how the ONA will be  administered in any presidentially-declared disaster in the coming year.", "For example, the state establishes award levels related to vehicle repairs,  vehicle replacement, and funeral grants. States may choose the level of  involvement of state officials in administering the program and assume  complete, partial, or no responsibility for administering the program.  Whichever option a state chooses, FEMA provides 75 percent of the grant  funds, and the state is obligated to provide the balance of ONA grant  funds.", "To receive ONA grant funds, an applicant must generally meet the  eligibility requirements for housing assistance, must have necessary  expenses or serious needs because of the disaster, and must first apply to  the SBA Disaster Loan Program and either be declined for assistance, or  demonstrate that SBA disaster assistance is insufficient to meet all  disaster-related necessary expenses and serious needs. Applicants who do  not meet a certain income threshold may be excused from the requirement  to complete the SBA disaster loan application. For example, in 2005, a  household of four with an income less than $24,188 would not be required  to complete the SBA loan application.", "The types of assistance that may be provided depending on the level of the  applicant\u2019s income are for personal property, transportation, and  moving/storage expenses. Eligibility for medical, dental, funeral and  other/miscellaneous expenses is not dependent on an applicant\u2019s income;  for these categories applicants are referred directly to ONA for assistance.  Specifically, FEMA may provide ONA grant funding to replace personal  property, repair and replace vehicles, and reimburse moving and storage  expenses if an applicant is ineligible for an SBA disaster loan. To receive  ONA grants, for public transportation, medical and dental, and funeral and  burial expenses, disaster victims are not required to apply for an SBA loan  to be eligible and income levels are not subject in determining eligibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Decentralized Structure for Implementing the IHP Relies Primarily on Contract and Temporary Employees", "paragraphs": ["FEMA manages the IHP primarily through a de-centralized structure of  permanent and temporary field offices staffed primarily by contract and  temporary employees.

The Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to draw upon temporary  personnel for disaster operations.", "FEMA\u2019s Recovery Division in Washington, D.C., manages the IHP and as of  August 2006 had about 15 people to develop and issue policies and  procedures for implementing the individual assistance programs. Eight  members of that staff are specifically responsible for managing the IHP. In  FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices, one or two full-time employees manage  individual assistance programs.

The NPSCs are also to assist with  referrals to other assistance programs, process appeals, recertify existing  rental assistance, assist with recovering funds, and respond to  congressional inquiries. As of August 2006, a total of 13 permanent FEMA  employees were working at the NPSCs in the United States and were  supported by several hundred temporary employees (whose numbers can  be increased by 2,000 to 3,000 additional temporary employees for  application processing after a disaster), as well as contract employees.

The joint office houses FEMA, state partners, other federal  agencies, and voluntary agencies. Two key FEMA joint field office  officials direct and coordinate disaster response and recovery  operations for program implementation at the local level. The Federal  Coordinating Officer is responsible for assessing disaster needs,  establishing the joint office and Disaster Recovery Centers and other  possible disaster facilities, and coordinating the administration of  disaster relief. The FEMA operations section chief\u2019s responsibilities  include managing the Human Services Branch that oversees provision  of mass care and food, individual assistance, the coordination of  voluntary agency contributions, and donations. The role of regional  coordinating structures varies depending on the situation. Many  incidents may be coordinated by regional structures primarily using  regional assets. Larger, more complex incidents may require direct  coordination between the joint office and the national level, with  regional structures continuing to play a supporting role. The focal point  for coordination of federal support is the joint field office.", "FEMA may also establish Area Field Offices whose staff and  organization is to mirror the joint field office and provide similar  coordination and oversight in support of the joint office at the local  level. The area office reports to the joint office. The area office\u2019s  operational responsibilities are to be delineated by the joint office  which may establish as many area filed offices as deemed necessary  and efficient to the response.", "FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers are offices where applicants may go  for information about FEMA and other disaster assistance programs.  Recovery center locations are usually announced in local newspapers  and on local television and radio stations and are established close to  the disaster area, often in schools or armories to be readily accessible  to those in need of assistance. The centers are temporary facilities  jointly operated by the state and FEMA where representatives of  federal agencies, local and state governments, and voluntary relief  organizations provide guidance regarding disaster recovery and  literature on services available, including housing assistance and  individual and household grants information, educational materials,  crisis counseling, assistance in completing applications and answers to  questions, resolution to problems, and referrals to agencies that may  provide further assistance.

Teams are assembled from individuals  from FEMA, the Small Business Administration, state emergency  management, and the local jurisdiction who are to (1) assess the types of  dwellings affected, (2) assess the probable insurance and income levels of  residents, and (3) estimate the number of individuals affected to determine  potential funding requirements. After the assessment is complete, the  Governor is to determine if federal disaster assistance is needed and, if it  is, he or she is to submit a request to the President through the FEMA  Regional Director who reviews and communicates the request to FEMA\u2019s  Headquarters within the Emergency Preparedness and Response  Directorate.

During the application  process, an individual provides personal information including Social  Security number, current and pre-disaster address, a telephone number,  insurance information, total household annual income, and a description  of losses caused by the disaster. After the submission of an application,  FEMA provides applicants with a copy of their application and a program  guide, \u201cHelp After a Disaster: Applicant\u2019s Guide to the Individuals and  Households Program.\u201d The document, whose cover is shown in figure 9, is  also available on the Internet.", "Once a FEMA representative records personal information from a disaster  application and provides the applicant with a FEMA application number,  FEMA\u2019s National Emergency Management Information System  automatically determines potential eligibility for designated categories of  assistance.", "To confirm that damages occurred to the home and personal property as  reported in disaster assistance applications, FEMA is to conduct individual  inspections to verify damage, ownership, and occupancy. Contract  inspectors are to schedule damage inspection appointments with  applicants. The inspections usually take about 30 to 60 minutes, according  to FEMA. Homeowners are not required to be at home at the time of the  inspection, but a designated representative generally must be present and  the applicant must be able to provide proof of ownership and occupancy  to the inspector. This assessment provides a basis to determine how much  assistance an individual/household should receive for housing repair and  replacement and for other needs. If an applicant\u2019s home or its contents  were damaged and the applicant has insurance, they must provide FEMA  with a letter from the insurance company regarding the settlement of the  claim before FEMA issues its inspection report. (If the damages are caused  by flooding and the applicant has flood insurance, FEMA will issue an  inspection report before receiving a copy of the applicant\u2019s flood  insurance decision letter because temporary living expenses are not  covered by flood insurance.)", "According to FEMA, the system reportedly determines eligibility for about  90 percent of applicants requesting housing assistance, usually within        10 days of application. FEMA caseworkers are to process the remaining  applications that cannot be automatically processed, to determine an  applicant\u2019s eligibility for disaster assistance based on additional  documentation, for example, documentation of insurance payment; these  applications may take longer to process. If the applicant qualifies for a  grant, FEMA sends the applicant a check by mail or deposits the funds  granted in the applicant\u2019s bank account. FEMA will also send a letter  describing how the applicant is to use the money (for example; repairs to  their home or to rent another house while the applicant makes repairs).  Recipients of IHP assistance must recertify their continuing need for  assistance every 30 to 90 days, depending on the individual circumstances.  FEMA uses three criteria to recertify the applicant.", "First, FEMA may provide continued housing assistance (travel trailers  or rental assistance) during the period of assistance, based on need,  and generally only when adequate, alternate housing is not available.", "Second, for rental assistance, the applicant must show that he or she  used the previous rental assistance to pay rent by sending copies of  receipts.", "Third, the applicant must show he or she is working to find permanent  housing that the applicant can afford. For example, FEMA is to require  applicants to show they are actively seeking affordable housing,  maintain a list of addresses they looked at, including the landlord\u2019s  name and phone number, and specify the reason(s) for not renting the  units. A FEMA Housing Adviser may verify with landlords that a  contact was made by an applicant seeking a rental unit.", "Conversely, if FEMA determines that the applicant does not qualify for an  IHP grant, it is to send the applicant a letter explaining why the applicant  was turned down and gives the applicant a chance to appeal the decision.  Applicants who are denied housing and other needs assistance under IHP  have 60 days from the date that FEMA notifies the applicant to appeal the  decision. According to FEMA, common reasons for denial include:    Adequate insurance coverage.    Damage to secondary home, not a primary residence.    Duplicate applications made from the same address.
