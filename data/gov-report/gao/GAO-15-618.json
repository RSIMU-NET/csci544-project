In 2006, GAO identified weaknesses in EPA's grants management program, including the absence of goals, and made recommendations to address them. As part of its response to GAO's 2006 recommendations, EPA issued a 2009-2013 grants management plan.", "GAO was asked to follow up on its 2006 review.

EPA did not measure its progress for the other 8 goals. EPA officials provided several reasons for meeting relatively few of the performance goals and not measuring the others. For example, according to officials, EPA did not measure progress for some goals because it redirected resources from achieving grants management goals to managing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 grants, under which EPA more than doubled its grants in 2009. For 5 goals where EPA either did not meet the goal or did not measure performance, officials reported that there was no impact on the grants management program because EPA took mitigating actions or the negative effect of missing the goal was minimal. However, for 10 goals, GAO found a negative effect of EPA not measuring or partially meeting the goals, including an absence of data on compliance with policies, inefficient processes that increased workload, delayed processes for awarding grants, and delayed training and policy implementation.", "As of May 2015, EPA's draft 2016\u20132020 grants management plan partially follows four relevant leading practices for federal strategic planning that GAO identified from prior work and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance.

For instance, EPA electronically tracks unspent grant funds and the timely submission of grantee reports. However, two key challenges hamper EPA's efforts to monitor such directives. First, 8 out of 10 regional offices use paper files to document compliance with grants management directives, so monitoring these offices' compliance requires resource-intensive manual file reviews. Second, the limited reporting and analysis capabilities of its IT systems leave EPA without agencywide information for most of the 212 directive requirements GAO reviewed. Although EPA deployed two web-based reporting tools to pull data from its IT system, it uses them to track 8 percent, or 17, of the 212 grants directive requirements GAO reviewed, making it difficult for managers to compare actual performance to expected results agencywide. EPA plans to fully implement an updated IT system by 2017, but it has had similar plans since 2009 and has not yet done so. By developing ways to more effectively use existing web-based tools until it implements its new IT system, EPA could better monitor compliance with grants management directives agencywide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that EPA fully follow leading strategic planning practices in its draft 2016\u20132020 plan and develop ways to more effectively use its web-based tools for monitoring compliance with directives.

In 2003, we found that  EPA faced challenges effectively overseeing grant recipients and  measuring the results of grants. We recommended that EPA meet the  goals, targets, and time frames in its 2003\u20132008 grants management  plan, and take specific actions to strengthen its grants management  efforts. In May 2006, we assessed EPA\u2019s progress in implementing its  grant reforms and found weaknesses in four areas: (1) documenting  ongoing grants monitoring efforts, (2) timely grant closeouts, (3)  establishing performance measures for environmental results, and (4)   We concluded that  holding staff accountable for grants management.EPA could not be fully assured that grant recipients were on track to fulfill  the terms and conditions of their grants, among other things, and made  several recommendations to address these weaknesses.

We have previously  reported that these strategic planning requirements at the federal  department/agency level and practices identified by GAO can also serve  as leading practices for planning at lower levels within federal agencies,  such as individual programs or initiatives. We selected four leading  practices based on their applicability to (1) program-level strategic  planning, (2) the content of the plan rather than the planning process, and  (3) grants management.

We excluded the other 2 directives because they applied to either  nonprofit or tribal grant recipients and, therefore, did not apply to most  grant recipients. From these 7 directives, we selected 212 requirements  that involved (1) the completion of tasks, (2) the content of tasks, (3)  documentation of tasks, and (4) EPA review of tasks. We excluded the  remaining directive requirements because they are not the primary  responsibility of OGD and exist outside of EPA\u2019s grants management  databases or official grant files.

These five reasons included redirected resources,  process delays, IT constraints, budget constraints, and errors requiring  rework (see app. II for more detail).", "Redirected resources. According to OGD responses to our standard  set of questions, of the 8 performance goals not measured, EPA did  not measure 5 because it redirected some of its grants management  resources to managing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 (ARRA) funds. Under ARRA, EPA more than doubled its  grants awards from $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2008 to $9.8 billion in  2009. Although ARRA provided EPA with additional funds to manage  these grants, the EPA OIG found that the additional workload for  ARRA activities impacted non-ARRA work. According to OGD  responses to a standard set of questions, for all 5 performance goals,  EPA had to redirect resources from implementing its grants  management plan to meet additional requirements under ARRA. For  example, EPA typically monitors key aspects of grants annually, but  for ARRA grants, EPA required routine monitoring every 90 days to  support ARRA quarterly reporting requirements and required more in- depth monitoring twice a year, according to an agency assessment of  EPA\u2019s ARRA activities.", "Of the 5 performance goals that EPA did not measure, 2 addressed  increasing the share of state workplans and progress reports  consistent with EPA\u2019s environmental results directives (OGD  responses show that budget constraints were also a factor); 2  addressed increasing staff satisfaction with EPA\u2019s performance  appraisal system and available IT tools; and 1 addressed increasing  the share of grants management staff with performance plans that  include grants management (OGD responses show that budget  constraints were also a factor).", "Process delays. For 4 performance goals that EPA either partially  met (3) or did not measure (1), OGD responses to our standard set of  questions and supporting documents indicate that it was because the  activities took longer than expected. For example, 1 performance goal  was for EPA to migrate its IT system to a governmentwide grants  management system by March 31, 2012. OGD responses and  documented analysis of EPA\u2019s IT systems show that the agency  partially met this performance goal because the systems EPA initially  identified either did not meet its needs or were too expensive. As a  result, the agency had to identify and analyze alternative systems,  which led to EPA missing its 2012 deadline. Delays in approving  and revising policies also caused EPA to partially meet 2 performance  goals related to its strategic goal of enhancing the management  process for grants policies and procedures, according to OGD  responses to our standard set of questions. For the performance goal  that EPA did not measure, OGD responses state that the agency did  not measure its performance goal for improving training timeliness  because approving policies took longer than expected.", "IT constraints. According to OGD responses to our standard set of  questions, EPA did not measure (2) and partially met (1) of its  performance goals because of IT constraints. Specifically, EPA did  not measure the share of grants that receive routine monitoring  annually because its IT system could not sufficiently track the  variation in due dates for individual awards. In addition, EPA did not  measure its performance goal to increase the share of certain state  and tribal grants offered via Grants.gov because the website could not  handle the increased demand during ARRA implementation,  according to OGD responses and supporting documents.  EPA  partially met its performance goal to reduce unexpended expired  funds because EPA officials said that their IT system could not  produce accurate data for the end of the fiscal year in 2013.", "Budget constraints. EPA partially met 1 performance goal and did  not meet 1 goal due to budget constraints, according to OGD  responses to our standard set of questions and supporting  documents. Specifically, EPA partially met its goal to improve the  share of expired grants closed in a timely manner because it  redirected resources from closing grants due to furloughs associated  with sequestration, according to OGD responses and supporting  documents. EPA did not meet its performance goal to develop a long- term training plan because the agency determined that it did not have  the resources to do so, according to OGD responses and budget  data. For example, OGD\u2019s workforce decreased from 79 full-time  equivalent staff in 2009 to 71 full-time equivalent staff in 2013.", "Errors requiring rework. EPA officials said that EPA partially met its  performance goal to increase the share of applications processed in a  timely manner, because errors in processing application packages  required the agency to rework several packages. According to EPA  officials and agency workload analyses, in some cases, these errors  resulted from a large workload for staff who also managed ARRA  grants. In other cases, staff that had a small grants management  workload made errors because they were not familiar with policy and  IT requirements. These officials said that the complexity of some grant  projects was also a factor.", "For five performance goals, EPA and OGD reported that not meeting or  not measuring the goals did not affect EPA\u2019s grants management  activities because the agency either mitigated the potential negative effect  of missing the performance goal, or the negative effect was minimal,  according to our analysis of OGD responses and supporting documents  (see app. II). For example, EPA reported that it mitigated the potential  effect of missing EPA\u2019s performance goal to increase the share of grants  management staff whose performance plans include grants management.  Specifically, EPA determined that it could build staff\u2019s grants management  activities into their performance by providing staff managers with (1)  additional performance guidance and (2) individual and agency-level  grants management performance data for comparison, according to OGD  responses and EPA performance guidance documents.", "For another performance goal, to mitigate the effect of not measuring staff  satisfaction with an IT application, EPA addressed the low ratings of the  IT application\u2019s operation in its 2010 baseline survey by adding more  user-friendly features, such as a web-based reporting tool, according to  OGD responses to our standard set of questions, and an internal  memorandum. For its performance goal of developing a long-term training  plan, EPA mitigated negative effects of missing its goal by implementing  new training tools such as webinars, online training, and lectures to meet  the agency\u2019s training needs and provide more efficient and flexible  methods for a changing training environment, according to OGD  responses and training documents. EPA\u2019s actions are consistent with our  March 2004 guidance for assessing training, which states that agencies  should modify their efforts to fit their unique circumstances and  conditions.", "For the other two performance goals, the effect of not measuring them  was minimal, according to our review of OGD responses to our standard  set of questions. Specifically, EPA did not measure employee satisfaction  with its performance appraisal system, which likely had a minimal effect  on grants management activities. Similarly, for its performance goal to  increase the share of expired grants closed out in a timely manner, EPA  missed the target in 2013 by less than 1 percent, which also likely had a  minimal effect on grants management.", "However, for 10 performance goals, our review of OGD responses to our  standard set of questions and supporting documents found negative  effects of the agency not measuring or partially meeting them, as follows:", "Limited the agency\u2019s data on compliance. For three performance  goals, not measuring them led to the absence of agencywide data on  compliance with directives intended to ensure that grant funds  achieve the desired results of protecting human health and the  environment, according to OGD responses to our standard set of  questions and supporting documents. Specifically, because of ARRA  demands and budget constraints, EPA did not measure its two  performance goals to increase grant recipients\u2019 workplans and  progress reports consistent with EPA\u2019s environmental results  directive, according to OGD responses and agency planning  documents. Additionally, although EPA collects real-time data on  compliance with routine monitoring requirements, because of IT  constraints, EPA did not measure its performance goal on the share  of grants that receive routine monitoring annually on a cumulative  basis, according to OGD responses. As a result, EPA does not have a  complete picture of its compliance with certain directives\u2014directives  that are designed to ensure that funds are used appropriately and  achieve the desired results. EPA planning documents indicate the  agency plans to review state workplans and progress reports in fiscal  year 2017, and EPA officials said that they are looking into capturing  annual data on compliance with routine monitoring requirements.", "Inefficient processes. For two performance goals, not measuring or  partially meeting them led to less efficient processes remaining in  place, according to OGD responses to our standard set of questions  and supporting documents. For example, EPA did not establish a  baseline or measure its performance goal on the share of certain state  and tribal grants offered via Grants.gov, according to OGD responses.  Consequently, some applicants continued to apply for these grants by  e-mail or on paper, according to OGD responses and policy  documents. Additionally, EPA partially met its performance goal to  migrate its IT system to a governmentwide grants management  system, which led to EPA\u2019s continued use of an IT system that EPA IT  analyses state is aging, inefficient and, in some cases, requires data  entry in multiple databases to document a single action. According to  these analyses, these inefficient processes result in a greater  workload for a grants management workforce that is already strained.", "Limited access to information. For two performance goals, partially  meeting them led to limited access for grants managers to accurate  information on grants management directives, according to OGD  responses to our standard set of questions. First, EPA partially met  its performance goal to develop comprehensive guidance (i.e., a  single manual containing all current guidance on grants management  policies) but not by 2009. Specifically, agency documents show that  EPA\u2019s comprehensive guidance manual was last substantially  updated in 1988, and sections of the manual were out of date.  Although EPA issued a series of policy updates on EPA\u2019s website,  these updates were not part of the manual.they communicated changes as they happened through EPA\u2019s  internal website; however, OGD responses recognize that not having  comprehensive guidance negatively affected grants managers\u2019   Agency officials said that  timeliness in processing grants. In 2013, EPA integrated and updated  all of its guidance online, providing grants managers access to up-to- date information on changing grants requirements, according to OGD  responses and an internal memorandum. Second, EPA partially met  its performance goal to review all of its guidance for consistency by  2011 and 2012, because it did not complete its review until 2013. As  part of its review, EPA policy documents show that the agency  identified 25 cases in which its policy updates were incorrect and  included obsolete or redundant policies. Therefore, because EPA did  not meet this goal in a timely manner and, until it completed its review,  identified errors, and corrected its guidance, grants managers did not  have readily available, accurate information.", "Delayed process for awarding grants. In another instance, partially  meeting its performance goal for increasing the share of applications  processed in a timely manner increased the amount of time it took for  EPA to provide funding to recipients, according to OGD responses to  our standard set of questions and performance data. As a result, from  2010 to 2013, EPA did not process grant application packages  (commitment notices) within its 60-day target for an additional 10  percent of EPA applications, according to EPA performance data.", "Delayed training and policy implementation. According to OGD  responses to our standard set of questions and EPA policy and  training documents, EPA did not measure its performance for  improving the timeliness of training and, in some instances, EPA  provided training to grants management officials for a new policy after  the policy was already in effect. This was not consistent with EPA\u2019s  grants management plan that called for EPA to offer training on new  policies at least 4 weeks prior to implementing them. Although EPA  officials said that the negative effect in these cases was minimal  because the grant workload in October was low, without training prior  to these policies\u2019 effective dates, EPA does not have reasonable  assurance that grants management officials applied the policies  consistently from the dates that they went into effect. In addition, EPA  policy documents show that, in some cases, EPA delayed the  implementation of new policies designed to simplify and streamline  the grants process for recipients to accommodate the training  schedule. Because of these delays, recipients could not immediately  benefit from these policy improvements as originally planned,  according to OGD responses to our standard set of questions and  supporting documents.", "Inefficient use of grant funds. EPA could not confirm whether it met  its performance goal for reducing unexpended expired funds in 2013  and was $900,000 from meeting its goal in early September 2013.  According to EPA\u2019s OIG, unexpended expired funds are missed  opportunities for EPA and grant recipients to efficiently fund projects  and efforts that meet EPA\u2019s mission of protecting human health and  the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s 2016\u20132020 Draft Grants Management Plan Partially Follows Selected Leading Practices for Federal Strategic Planning but Omits Key Information", "paragraphs": ["As of May 2015, EPA\u2019s November 2014 version of its draft 2016\u20132020  grants management plan partially follows four selected leading practices  for federal strategic planning that we identified from prior GAO work and  OMB guidance (see table 4). EPA officials said that they designed their  2016\u20132020 plan to be more high-level than the 2009\u20132013 plan so that it  would be more flexible and adaptive to changing circumstances, such as  legislation that changes EPA priorities. For example, unlike some of the  objectives in the 2009\u20132013 plan, EPA does not prescribe how the  agency should meet the objectives in its draft 2016\u20132020 plan, to give the  agency discretion in choosing the most efficient implementation method,  according to EPA officials and our analysis of the draft plan.", "As shown in table 4, our analysis of EPA\u2019s draft plan indicates that, as of  May 2015, it partially incorporated four leading planning practices relevant  to grants management:", "Define the mission and goals.

However, as of May 2015, the agency  does not yet link these goals to an overarching mission statement.  According to leading strategic management practices, a mission  statement explains why the program exists, what it does, and how.  We have previously found that a mission statement forms the  foundation for a coordinated, balanced set of strategic goals and  performance measures. Agency officials said that EPA has not yet  incorporated a mission statement into its draft plan because the  agency is awaiting stakeholder agreement on the underlying  framework but that it plans to do so. Ensuring that its plan has a  mission statement could help EPA better establish a framework to  guide effectively the agency\u2019s overall vision for grants management.", "Define strategies and identify resources needed to achieve  goals. EPA\u2019s draft plan partially follows this leading practice because  it includes strategic objectives, but as of May 2015, the plan does not  yet define strategies that address management challenges, include  milestones for significant activities, or identify the resources  necessary for the agency to achieve its strategic goals. We have  previously found in leading federal strategic planning practices that it  is particularly important for agencies to define strategies that address  management challenges that may threaten their ability to meet long- term goals and include a description of the budgetary and human  resources, actions, and time frames needed to meet these goals.  EPA officials said that they would discuss the resources needed to  achieve their goals but had not considered including a discussion of  resources in their draft plan. By also including in its draft plan  strategies for addressing the management challenges facing the  agency and the resources needed to achieve its goals, EPA could  better ensure that its staffing and funding are sufficient to achieve  those goals. The agency could also better prepare for future changes  in workload or funding\u2014problems that we found had constrained the  agency in the past.", "Ensure leadership accountability. EPA\u2019s draft plan partially follows  this leading practice in that one of the strategic goals is dedicated to  evaluating the agency\u2019s performance at managing its grants, which  incorporates a degree of accountability into the plan. According to  leading federal strategic planning practices, successful organizations  use formal and informal practices to hold managers accountable and  create incentives for working to achieve the agency\u2019s goals. However,  as of May 2015, the other four goals in the draft plan do not yet  include mechanisms to hold EPA managers accountable for achieving  the agency\u2019s goals. For example, in 2012, we found that EPA had  ensured leadership accountability for its environmental justice  strategic plan by giving senior administrators lead responsibility for  implementing the plan, and incorporating relevant environmental  justice measures in its annual national program guidance. By including mechanisms to hold managers accountable for the other  four strategic goals, EPA will be better positioned to ensure that the  grants program achieves its goals.", "Develop and use performance measures. EPA\u2019s draft plan partially  follows the leading practice to develop and use performance  measures in that it has 11 performance measures but, as of May  2015, only one performance measure has a measurable or numeric  target associated with it. According to leading practices, performance  measures gauge the agency\u2019s progress toward its mission and  strategic goals. They provide information on which the agency can  base decisions and create incentives that influence organizational and  individual behavior. We have previously found that one of the key  attributes for successful performance measures is a measurable  target and that such measurable targets could challenge the agency  to improve its results. According to agency officials, EPA is planning  to develop more measurable targets as part of an annual priority  planning process but, at the time of this report, that effort was not yet  complete.", "As of May 2015, the draft 2016\u20132020 plan provides a road map that  builds on EPA\u2019s progress standardizing and streamlining the grants  management process since 2009 and may help the agency continue to  work toward the goals set out in the 2009\u20132013 plan. We have previously  found that a primary purpose of federal strategic planning is to improve  federal agency management.practices for federal strategic planning, EPA could have better assurance  that it has established a framework to effectively manage and assess  efforts to accomplish its grants management strategic and performance  goals, without reducing the plan\u2019s flexibility, and that may help the agency  address its long-standing grants management weaknesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Made Some Progress Monitoring Its Compliance with Grants Management Directives Agencywide but Faces Two Key Challenges", "paragraphs": ["EPA has made some progress monitoring its compliance with seven  selected postaward grants management directives\u2014such as those  dealing with compliance, review, and monitoring, and achieving  environmental results from EPA grants\u2014agencywide, but it continues to  face two key challenges. Specifically, since our 2006 report, OGD has  begun monitoring more grants management directives agencywide  through its IT systems, such as tracking unexpended grant funds and  grantees\u2019 timely submission of reports. However, two key challenges  hamper EPA\u2019s efforts to monitor directives agencywide: (1) most of its  regional offices rely on paper files and (2) its IT systems have limited  reporting and analytical capabilities.", "Since 2006, OGD has developed the ability to monitor EPA\u2019s compliance  with certain requirements in its grants management directives  electronically. For example, EPA has been monitoring administrative  activities of grant recipients, unexpended grant funds, and whether grant  recipients have submitted their final reports on time. As part of this  monitoring, OGD tracks the number of grants for which program officers  and grants specialists completed routine annual monitoring, as well as the  percentage of grants that received such monitoring against the agency\u2019s  performance goal. OGD tracks this information in real time, which  provides a snapshot of routine annual monitoring activities. Additionally,  OGD monitors the number, dollar amount, and percentage of total  unspent grant funds for headquarters and all EPA regions. OGD tracks  the percentage of grantees\u2019 final technical reports received in a given  fiscal year and compares it to the agency\u2019s performance goal. OGD  officials also electronically review and verify certain administrative  monitoring actions, such as the percentage of closed-out grants for a  given calendar year.", "However, EPA faces two key challenges in its agencywide monitoring  efforts. First, 8 of its 10 regional offices document their compliance with  grants management directives in paper files, according to EPA officials.", "One additional regional office uses electronic record-keeping for interagency  agreements, but not for grants. with grants management directives generally requires paper file reviews,  which agency officials described as resource-intensive. As a result, EPA  officials told us that they deferred some planned compliance reviews due  to budget constraints. According to EPA officials, the agency recognizes  that paper records are outmoded and plans to transition to electronic  records management, but the officials did not provide a timetable for  completing this transition. EPA officials stated that EPA headquarters is  currently using an electronic grant records system, three regions have  agreed to develop electronic grant records systems, and EPA is  encouraging the remaining regions to adopt such systems; however,  according to OGD officials, the remaining regions are unable to do so due  to budget constraints. Second, we found that limitations in OGD\u2019s IT  systems\u2019 reporting and analysis capabilities mean that the systems do not  produce comprehensive, agencywide summary information for most of  the directive requirements we reviewed. This prevents managers from  comparing actual performance to expected results agencywide and  analyzing significant differences consistent with the federal standards for  internal control.", "In 2009 and 2011, EPA deployed two web-based reporting systems to  pull certain information from its databases for analysis; however, as of  June 2015, EPA used these tools to monitor 8 percent (17 of 212) of its  requirements. OGD officials stated that they have the capability to use  their current web-based tools more broadly. However, they have not done  so. According to OGD officials, their process for determining which  requirements to track agencywide using these web-based tools is to  follow the measures in their grants management plan, as well as to take  into account the results of OIG and GAO audits. In addition to the limited  agencywide information, OGD\u2019s IT systems require staff to manually  review information entered into the database to ensure its accuracy and  completeness for most of the requirements (117 of 212) in the seven  management directives we reviewed. However, such manual reviews are  not consistent with federal standards for internal control, which call for  control activities specific for information systems, including computerized  edit checks built into the system to review the format, existence, and  reasonableness of data (e.g., accuracy and completeness).", "According to EPA officials, the agency currently plans to adopt an  updated grants management system by 2017, and it is transitioning to the  new system in phases that correspond to the grants lifecycle. The  agency\u2019s 2016 draft grants management plan incorporates IT system  improvements suggested in a 2014 study of EPA\u2019s grants management  process. As part of its plans for an updated grants management system,  EPA has included establishing a single official electronic file to house all  grant information for each individual grant. However, EPA has planned to  update its grants management IT system since its 2009 plan but has not  yet done so. According to EPA officials, analyzing IT alternatives took  longer than they expected and they had to reprioritize their grants  management activities due to the additional workload required under  ARRA. Nonetheless, agency officials said that the IT system that they  plan to implement will save the agency $27 million.", "In the meantime, however, EPA has limited information on its agencywide  compliance with certain grants management directives intended to  provide internal controls over how funds are used and how results are  obtained. Better monitoring of agencywide compliance with these  directives through electronic record-keeping and using its existing web- based tools more effectively could help EPA better meet federal  standards for internal control and help ensure that funds reach grantees  quickly, are used appropriately, and achieve the desired results of  protecting human health and the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["EPA has developed several strategies for addressing its past challenges  managing the roughly several billion dollars it distributes each year in  grants to help protect human health and the environment. EPA  incorporated these strategies into its 2009\u20132013 plan and made some  progress toward achieving its strategic goals. To build on its progress,  EPA has developed a draft 2016\u20132020 grants management plan which,  as of May 2015, partially follows several leading strategic planning  practices but has not yet included certain key elements, such as defining  strategies that address management challenges that may threaten EPA\u2019s  ability to meet long-term goals and identifying the resources, actions, and  time frames needed to meet these goals. We recognize that EPA is  designing its draft 2016\u20132020 plan to be more flexible and adaptable to  changing circumstances to address some of the constraints that  prevented the agency from meeting all of its 2009\u20132013 plan goals.  Nonetheless, our past work shows that incorporating more leading  practices into the final plan could provide EPA with reasonable assurance  that it has established a framework to effectively guide and assess efforts  to accomplish its grants management goals, without reducing its flexibility.  Doing so could also help EPA address long-standing grants management  weaknesses, such as tracking environmental results. Since the draft plan  is still under development, EPA has the opportunity to incorporate more of  these selected leading practices into the final plan.", "EPA has made progress monitoring its compliance with certain grants  management directives agencywide, yet the two key challenges it faces\u2014 dependence on paper files and limitations in its IT systems\u2014continue to  hamper its ability to monitor certain requirements agencywide. EPA plans  to transition to electronic records management for all 10 of its regional  offices, but it does not have a timetable for doing so, and some regional  offices have not implemented electronic records management due to  budget constraints. EPA also currently plans to adopt an updated grants  management system by 2017, and it has incorporated addressing  potential IT improvements as part of its draft 2016\u20132020 plan. However,  EPA has had similar plans to improve its IT system since 2009 but has  not done so because the systems the agency initially identified either did  not meet its needs or were too expensive, resulting in a need to identify  and analyze alternative systems. In the meantime, EPA has made limited  use of its existing web-based tools for analyzing and reporting  agencywide compliance, in part because it has focused its analytical  efforts on the measures in its grants management plan. By using existing  web-based tools more effectively until it implements its new IT system,  EPA can better monitor agencywide compliance with grants management  directives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the EPA Administrator direct OGD to take the  following four actions:   Incorporate all leading practices in federal strategic planning relevant  to grants management as it finalizes its draft 2016\u20132020 grants  management plan, such as defining strategies that address  management challenges that may threaten the agency\u2019s ability to  meet long-term goals and identifying the resources, actions, and time  frames needed to meet these goals.", "Develop a timetable with milestones and identify and allocate  resources for adopting electronic records management for all 10  regional offices.", "Implement plans for adopting an up-to-date and comprehensive IT  system by 2017 that will provide accurate and timely data on  agencywide compliance with grants management directives.", "Until the new IT system is implemented, develop ways to more  effectively use existing web-based tools to better monitor agencywide  compliance with grants management directives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to EPA for comment.

EPA said that the agency will need time to  prioritize which grants management directives requirements to include in  the system, which IT approaches to take, and to identify resources  through the budget process. EPA said that implementation is therefore  likely to extend beyond 2017. The 2017 completion date is based on an  EPA internal planning document, which stated that the agency currently  plans to adopt an updated grants management system by 2017. We also  note that EPA had difficulty meeting its deadlines from its 2009\u20132013  Grants Management Plan. We continue to believe that EPA should  implement an up-to-date and comprehensive IT system as expeditiously  as possible to improve agencywide oversight of the several billions of  dollars the agency distributes each year.", "EPA also disagreed with our conclusion that long-standing grants  management weaknesses continue to exist, such as tracking  environmental results, and that EPA, with the concurrence of the OIG,  eliminated long-standing grants management as a material or agency  weakness in 2007.

We have previously reported that strategic planning requirements at the  federal department/agency level and practices identified by GAO can also  serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels within federal  agencies, such as individual programs or initiatives.  We identified 17  leading practices related to strategic planning and selected 4 based on  their applicability to (1) program-level strategic planning, (2) the content of  the plan rather than the planning process, and (3) grants management.  Based on these selection criteria, we excluded 9 practices because they  overlapped with other practices, excluded 2 practices because they  focused on process rather than the plan\u2019s content, and excluded 2 others  because they were not relevant to grants management or program-level  strategic planning.

Nine of these directives were relevant to  the areas where we had previously identified weaknesses, such as  ongoing monitoring of grant activities, tracking environmental results, and  timely grant closeouts. We selected 7 of those 9 grants management  directives.
