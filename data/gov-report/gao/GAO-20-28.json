The 34 VR&E plans GAO reviewed showed that counselors' generally considered and documented these factors (see table). Counselors in each of the three regional offices GAO visited said that plans are individualized to suit the veteran's needs and as a result will differ because each veteran's case is unique.

In designing training for counselors, VA followed principles identified by GAO for strategically developing training. VA monitors the completeness of VR&E plans through national and regional quality reviews that check, among other elements, whether plans have an employment focus and include needed services. However, these quality reviews do not assess the consistency of plans developed by different counselors. VR&E officials explained that the agency has not yet conducted such an analysis because of other priorities, but agreed that it could do so.

Specifically, we reviewed all 34 case files randomly  selected by VA for its February 2019 quality review of VR&E plan  development. We assessed VA\u2019s selection methodology by reviewing  documentation and interviewing knowledgeable officials and found it to be  reliable for our purposes. VR&E\u2019s quality reviews cover all phases of  counselors\u2019 casework, whereas our review focused on plan development.

To develop an employment plan, the  counselor and veteran review labor market information for jobs within the  veteran\u2019s identified abilities, aptitudes, and interests that will not  aggravate his or her service-connected disability or disabilities.

VR&E  field positions include (1) VR&E officers who manage the program and its  staff in each region; (2) vocational rehabilitation counselors who work  directly with veterans to assess their entitlement, develop their  employment plans, and manage their progress; and (3) staff to support  the administration of the program.", "As of June 2019, 1,394 field staff members were administering the VR&E  program, of which nearly 75 percent (1,026) were counselors.

In 2019, the number increased after VA hired an additional 88 counselors  in response to a provision in an appropriations law suggesting that the  agency aim to serve 125 veterans or fewer per full-time equivalent  counselor.

Program regulations require an assessment of some of these factors  when the veteran is initially evaluated. VR&E quality review data from  fiscal years 2016 through 2018 suggest that counselors generally  documented certain plan considerations during the evaluation. For  example, in 98 percent of the 1,080 cases VA reviewed for accuracy in  fiscal year 2018, counselors documented the veteran\u2019s service needs  based on their functional limitations. In 95 percent of cases, counselors  documented that they assessed the veteran\u2019s abilities, aptitudes, and  interests. Lastly, in nearly 99 percent of cases, counselors documented  that the veteran was involved in vocational exploration activities such as  career searches and labor market research.", "During our more focused review of how counselors developed plans for a  non-generalizable sample of 34 VR&E case files, we found that  counselors generally documented a set of common factors. Consistent  with program guidance stipulating that counselors are to consider a  veteran\u2019s service needs, abilities, aptitudes, and interests, we identified  common consideration factors including one\u2019s functional limitation from  disability, prior education, aptitude results, and career interests. Table 1  presents these factors and the number of files in which the factors were  documented.", "Our case file review found that 30 of the 34 counselors also documented  the estimated cost of VR&E employment plans. According to testimony  from a veteran service organization, many VR&E participants are  dissuaded by their counselor from pursuing education at a top tier  university because of cost. VA\u2019s VR&E operations manual states that if  more than one local training or educational facility will meet a veteran\u2019s  needs, counselors must justify their decision to select a school that is  more expensive than the least costly one. Counselors are not required to  document all of the educational facilities that would serve a veteran\u2019s  needs; therefore, we could not determine the extent to which counselors chose the lowest cost facility. Counselors we interviewed in each of the  three regional offices we visited said that while mindful of cost, they strive  to develop employment plans that best meet the needs of the veteran.  For example, counselors at one regional office described a situation in  which a higher priced school was chosen because the school offered  smaller class sizes that better suited the veteran\u2019s particular mental  health conditions. Of the 34 files we reviewed, the annual plan cost  exceeded $25,000 in 3 cases.", "Counselors we interviewed said that they considered the veteran\u2019s career  interests but weighed these interests against other factors, such as the  veteran\u2019s functional limitations and information about the local labor  market. All 34 plans we reviewed aligned with the veteran\u2019s stated career  goals, though in some cases the veteran\u2019s goals evolved after talking with  the counselor about alternative occupations. In a few instances among  these cases, the final plan\u2019s career goal was notably different from the  initial goal that the veteran had stated on the program intake form. Table  2 presents examples of how a plan can evolve as a result of career  exploration activities and conversations between the veteran and their  counselor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Counselors in Our Review Stated They Strive to Develop Individualized Plans but Acknowledged That Some Unintended Differences in Plans for Similarly-Situated Veterans Likely Occurs", "paragraphs": ["Counselors we interviewed described how veterans\u2019 employment plans  are individually designed to suit a veteran\u2019s needs and, as a result, may  differ from one another even when veterans have similar goals,  characteristics, and circumstances. In some instances two veterans may  appear to be similar, but may actually differ in some critical respect that  results in appropriate variation across plans. A common difference among  veterans is the geographical location where they are seeking  employment. Counselors described how a veteran may be encouraged to  explore an occupation with many job opportunities within a specific  region, while a veteran with similar characteristics and interests living in a  different area may be dissuaded from pursuing the same occupation for a  lack of job opportunities in the area for that occupation. Local labor  markets may also drive the need for a certain type of educational  credential. For example, counselors said that some veterans will be  competitive in certain labor markets with a bachelor\u2019s degree, while  others living in a different region with a more educated population may  need a master\u2019s degree. Likewise, they said that certain occupations,  such as certified public accountants or school teachers, may require  different forms of credentialing in different states.", "Other characteristics of individual veterans may also cause counselors to  develop different plans for veterans who appear to have similar  circumstances. One counselor we interviewed described a scenario in  which one veteran who received a high score on an aptitude test for  reading comprehension skills might obtain a certain employment plan  while another veteran who received a much lower score would be steered  toward a different plan. If the veterans were to compare their final plans,  but were unaware of the differences in their aptitude test scores, they  could perceive inconsistent treatment. Counselors also described how  conversations they have with veterans as they work to develop  employment plans can reveal other character traits, such as interpersonal  skills, which can lead them to suggest different plans to two otherwise  similar veterans. The counselors said that such conversations play an  important role towards the development of successful plans.", "However, counselors we interviewed in each of the three regional offices  we visited acknowledged that unintended variation likely occurs across  plans developed for similarly-situated veterans. They explained that the  reasons for such potential inconsistency can include (1) the prominent  role professional judgment plays in the program and the potential for  unintended bias, (2) counselors\u2019 different VR&E experience levels, and  (3) variations in regional offices\u2019 policies.", "Judgment and bias. The counseling role is inherently subjective and  requires counselors to use their professional judgment in each case.  The VR&E operations manual describes counselors\u2019 responsibilities in  broad terms, stating that counselors are to guide and assist the  veteran in making an informed decision on an appropriate plan based  on the veteran\u2019s abilities, aptitudes, and interests. According to  counselors we interviewed, professional judgment enables them to  develop a plan that is best suited for the veteran\u2019s unique needs,  although it also introduces the potential for personal bias and  inconsistent plans for veterans with similar circumstances. For  example, a counselor we interviewed cited a case in which he saw the  need to develop a plan that allowed for a school that was closer to a  veteran\u2019s home over other, less costly options because of his  sensitivity to the veteran\u2019s childcare responsibilities. Another  counselor in the same office may not have seen the need for that  accommodation. Further, counselors we interviewed said that some of  their colleagues may be more comfortable suggesting that a veteran  reconsider his or her career goal given circumstances such as the  veteran\u2019s disabling conditions or the local labor market. They  explained that while some counselors would be hesitant to make the  veteran unhappy, and possibly angry, other counselors would be  more inclined to work through the conflict. Counselors said that they  try to mitigate inconsistency by asking their fellow counselors to weigh  in on these sorts of judgments, either informally, or at periodic  information-sharing meetings.", "Counselor experience. Although all counselors have at least a  master\u2019s degree in rehabilitation counseling or a related field,  differences in counselors\u2019 levels of VR&E experience may affect their  approach to plan development. Counselors at two regional offices  noted that the focus of the VR&E program has oscillated between  education and employment, with employment being the current  primary focus. They said, as a result, a counselor\u2019s general approach  to plan development could be influenced by the prevailing focus that  existed at the time he or she was hired. Counselors also said that, in  general, counselors with more experience will tend to approach plan  development differently than a less seasoned counselor because they  will apply lessons learned from serving many other veterans. For  example, one counselor said that, based on years of prior experience  and observation, he has developed a better understanding of which  local educational programs offer veterans the best chance for success  and which do not. He said while he is able to apply his institutional  knowledge and experience to do what is best for veterans, a less  experienced counselor may not have the same level of knowledge,  which could lead to inconsistent plans for veterans with similar  circumstances. According to counselors we interviewed, because of  the recent hiring of new counselors to meet caseload targets,  differences in VR&E experience among counselors may be more  pronounced at this time.", "Regional office variation. Differences in administrative policies  specific to individual regional offices may also contribute to  inconsistent plan development. For example, according to program  officials, to ensure the soundness of employment plans in the local  labor market, some regional offices require management to approve  plans involving a master\u2019s degree, while others do not. Counselors in  one region told us that requiring management approval might  dissuade a counselor from developing a plan focused on a master\u2019s  degree because of the time the extra step would require. They  acknowledged that this sort of approval policy could cause  inconsistency across counselors\u2019 plans and also cause a discrepancy  in the number of master\u2019s degree programs being approved at one  regional office versus another.", "In general, the large number of variables involved in the development of  employment plans may complicate the ability to determine the extent to  which differences among counselors lead to inconsistent plans among  veterans. Counselors we interviewed said that given the subjective nature  of the program, such inconsistency is likely. However, counselors  cautioned against making the plan development process overly structured  and formulaic. In their view, a more restrictive approach would eliminate  the flexibility that they need to generate plans that suit each veteran\u2019s  unique needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Trains Counselors and Monitors Their Performance but Does Not Monitor the Consistency of Employment Plans", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Trains Counselors to Develop Sound Employment Plans for Veterans", "paragraphs": ["VA trains counselors on developing sound and complete employment  plans for veterans.

The formal training emphasizes that  plans should be individualized to accommodate the veteran\u2019s  rehabilitation needs, abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

For instance, VA obtained and considered input  from multiple sources\u2014including field advisory committees, quality  assurance reviewers, and internal site visit auditors\u2014to identify needs for  counselor training. For example, questions and input from the field about  a policy clarification led to a training about veterans\u2019 entitlement to VR&E  services. In addition, VA built flexibility into its training curricula for  counselors so they could receive training on emerging topics such as  implementing new policies throughout the year as needed.

Nationally, a centralized quality assurance team  monitors the completeness of regional offices\u2019 VR&E entitlement  decisions, employment plans, and service delivery by reviewing a  randomly-selected subset of case files from each regional office on a  monthly basis. Among other criteria, reviewers check whether a veteran\u2019s  plan identified goals and objectives, included an employment focus, and  incorporated the veteran\u2019s need for various services. Locally, VR&E  officers or their designees are to review plans using the same criteria.  Officers are supposed to review at least three cases per counselor per  quality category (e.g., accuracy of evaluation, planning and rehabilitation  services) per quarter. Reviewers do not check for consistency among  counselors for similarly-situated veterans, at either the national or local  levels.", "VR&E officials we interviewed identified challenges to completing and  monitoring local reviews, but VA is addressing these challenges.  According to the VR&E officer in each of the three regional offices we  visited, it is difficult to complete local reviews given system limitations and  their other job responsibilities such as implementing case management  initiatives. They said that it is likely that some officers are not completing  the required reviews while others are conducting them with varying  degrees of thoroughness. Historically, VA has not identified the specific  cases VR&E officers are supposed to review locally. Consequently, VA  could not determine if VR&E officers conducted the requisite number of  reviews or whether officers were selecting cases for quality review  uniformly and fairly. In June 2019, during the course of our review, VA  began a pilot in five regional offices to centrally and systematically identify  the cases officers are to review to gauge individual counselors\u2019  performance. The new process and system are intended to help officers  conduct and track local reviews as well as to help VA monitor the  completion of local reviews. VA plans to expand this process to all  regional offices in fiscal year 2020.", "Although VA trains counselors to develop complete employment plans  and reviews the completeness of some plans, it does not monitor the  consistency of plans among different counselors. The code of  professional ethics for rehabilitation counselors calls for counselors to be  fair in the treatment of all clients and to provide appropriate services to  all. In addition, one of the objectives of VR&E\u2019s central office is to  provide training and guidance to ensure high performance and  consistency among field staff. Several veteran service organizations have  testified at congressional hearings that VR&E is marked by inconsistent  treatment of similarly-situated veterans. For example, one testimony cited  veterans who allegedly received different plan approvals, such as access  to graduate level education, merely on the basis of their counselor.  Unlike for VA staff members who work on disability claim decisions, VA  does not compare the output of VR&E counselors by, for example,  analyzing responses to identical hypothetical cases for training or  monitoring purposes. As a result, in addition to missing a training  opportunity for counselors about employment plan development, VA does  not know the degree to which inconsistency among counselors occurs.  For example, the agency does not know the extent to which counselors  would agree to a particular veteran\u2019s pursuit of a master\u2019s degree through  VR&E. Moreover, VA cannot respond in an informed way\u2014and take  mitigating steps if warranted\u2014to criticisms of subjectivity in the program.
