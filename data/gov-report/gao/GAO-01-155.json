This  dedicated trust fund is required to include amounts equivalent to receipts  from motor fuel taxes and to be separate from the District\u2019s General Fund.  For fiscal year 1999, motor fuel tax revenues were reported to be almost  $31 million.", "The Fund is used to reimburse the District for local capital appropriated  expenditures, which are (1) the District\u2019s share (normally 20 percent) of  federal aid highway project costs, (2) the salaries of District personnel  working directly on transportation capital projects, (3) overhead costs  associated with federal aid projects, and (4) other nonparticipating costs.  All federal and local capital appropriated expenditures are paid out of  DPW\u2019s Capital Operating account and then reimbursed by either the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  or the Fund.", "DPW is responsible for processing, accounting for, and reporting on the  Fund\u2019s financial activities. To accomplish these functions, DPW relies on  the System of Accounting and Reporting (SOAR), which is developed and  maintained by OCFO. The District also uses SOAR to manage certain  District-wide purchasing and financial reporting activities.", "OCFO maintains SOAR, along with other District payroll, personnel, and  tax information, on a computer system at its SHARE computer center. In  fiscal year 1999, the District\u2019s two payroll and personnel applications\u2014the  Unified Pay and Personnel System and the Centralized Automated Payroll  and Personnel System\u2014accounted for more than $1.5 billion in reported  expenditures relating to the District payroll and employee benefits. In  addition, tax applications residing on this computer system controlled  District sales and use, employer withholding, corporate franchise,  unincorporated franchise and hotel, personal property, and individual  income tax revenues for fiscal year 1999.", "DPW also relies on its own local area network (LAN), the District\u2019s wide  area network (WAN)\u2014which is managed by OCTO\u2014and the Internet to  transfer Fund information to and from the SHARE computer center. The  District\u2019s WAN not only allows DPW staff to access systems maintained at  the SHARE computer center, but also connects other District  organizations\u2014such as the Metropolitan Police Department, the District  General Hospital, and the District public school system\u2014to these systems  and systems at the District\u2019s other five data centers. In addition, some  District financial information is maintained on the network. For example,  the network-based Real Property Tax 2000 system contains land records,  facilitates data analysis for property valuation and tax administration,  maintains all District real property tax roll and levy entries, and supports  automated management of real property tax accounts receivable  adjustments, payment posting, and billing information. Altogether, the  District\u2019s WAN serves about 30 sites, which support approximately  60 District agencies and offices.", "To secure, protect, and preserve District information systems, such as  those relied on to account for Fund and other District financial activities,  District law requires the Mayor to establish, maintain, and provide  consistent computer security policies, principles, and standards for all  District departments and agencies.

Specifically, the District had not adequately  limited access granted to authorized users, properly managed user IDs and  passwords, effectively maintained system software controls, or sufficiently  protected its networks and other computer systems from unauthorized  users. In addition, the risks created by these access control weaknesses  were compounded because the District was not routinely monitoring  access activity to identify and investigate unusual or suspicious access  patterns that could indicate unauthorized access.

Organizations can protect  information from unauthorized changes or disclosures by granting  employees authority to read or modify only those programs and data  necessary to perform their duties. However, we found several examples  where the District had not adequately restricted the access of legitimate  users on the computer system that maintains Fund and other District  financial, payroll, personnel, and tax information.", "The District allowed all of the more than 4,300 active user IDs full access  to 20 system software libraries that are used to perform sensitive system  functions that can be used to circumvent all security controls. Such  access increased the risk that users could bypass security controls to  alter or delete any computer data or programs on this system.", "Security software on the system that maintains Fund and other District  financial, payroll, personnel, and tax information was not implemented  to automatically deny unauthorized access attempts. We determined  that 689 access rules controlling access to data and program files,  including a system software library that could be used to bypass other  security controls and a payroll library that contained check processing  data, were set to generate a warning message when access violations  occurred, but permit the unauthorized access to proceed. Consequently,  risk of improper access and changes to critical data files and programs  occurring without detection is heightened.", "More than 265 user IDs on the system used to process Fund and other  District financial information were granted the tape bypass label  processing privilege that allows users to read and alter any tape  regardless of other security software controls. These users included  network support staff, database administrators, SOAR application  programmers, payroll staff, Department of Human Services staff, and  certain application users. As a result, these users have unlimited access  to all tape files, including system audit logs and backup copies of  sensitive financial and tax information.", "One reason for the District\u2019s user access problems was that access  authority was not being reviewed. Such reviews would have allowed the  District to identify and correct inappropriate access.", "OCFO officials told us that SHARE computer center staff had changed the  security software configuration so that all unauthorized attempts are  denied and restricted the tape bypass label processing privilege to only  those users with a specific business need. OCFO officials also told us that  SHARE computer center staff would complete reviewing and limiting  access to sensitive system libraries by March 31, 2001.

To accomplish this objective, organizations  should establish controls to maintain and protect the confidentiality of  passwords. These controls should include requirements to ensure that IDs  uniquely identify users; passwords are changed periodically, contain a  specified number of characters, and are not common words; default IDs  and passwords are changed to prevent their use; and the number of invalid  password attempts is limited to preclude password guessing. Organizations  should also evaluate the effectiveness of these controls periodically to  ensure that they are operating effectively.", "At the District, however, user IDs and passwords were not being managed  to sufficiently reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the computer  system that maintains Fund and other District financial, payroll, personnel,  and tax information. For instance, the system was configured in a manner  that did not always require passwords for user authentication. In addition,  passwords that existed were not prevented from being (1) fewer than six  characters, (2) the same as the user ID, or (3) other easily guessed words.  Further, users were allowed the opportunity to circumvent password  change requirements by reusing the same password over and over.  Consequently, the District faced increased risks that passwords could be  compromised to gain unauthorized access to financial and other sensitive  information maintained on this computer system.

The system software control weaknesses we identified diminish the  reliability of financial and other sensitive information maintained on this  computer system and increase the risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse,  fraudulent use, improper disclosure, and disruption.", "In addition, we identified system software configuration weaknesses that  could allow users to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access  to Fund and other District financial, payroll, personnel, and tax  information. For example, the operating system was set up in a manner that  allowed programs in any of the 74 libraries included in the normal search  sequence to perform sensitive system functions and operate outside of  security software controls. Because users generally have access to such  libraries, this greatly increases the risk that unauthorized programs could  be introduced to bypass other access controls and improperly access or  modify financial, audit trail, or other sensitive information maintained on  this computer system.", "Further, the District had not instituted processes to control changes to  system software on this computer system. In the past 2 years, OCFO had  implemented several major system software changes, such as installing  new versions of database management, communication, access control,  and operating system software. However, it was not maintaining a  comprehensive log of system software changes, consistently documenting  these changes and related test results, or independently testing system  software changes before implementation. Consequently, the District faces  increased risks of unintended operational problems caused by  programming errors or the deliberate execution of unauthorized programs  that could compromise security controls.", "The District was also not adequately reviewing programs in sensitive  system libraries to identify and correct weaknesses that could be used to  circumvent security controls. Consequently, we found potential problems  that, at a minimum, diminish the reliability of system software, but could  also be exploited to introduce malicious code or circumvent other access  controls. For example, 13 files capable of performing sensitive system  privileges did not exist on the volume specified in the table used to manage  such files. This increases the risk that unauthorized programs could be  substituted for these files without management approval and used to  bypass other security controls or inappropriately modify audit trails or  sensitive data.

For  example, a common default account was available on one DPW network  server. In addition, certain network systems on the DPW LAN and/or  District WAN were not set up to require password authentication, ensure  that passwords were changed periodically, or disable user IDs after a  specified number of invalid password attempts.", "In addition, network system software configuration weaknesses could  allow users to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to  District networks or cause network system failures. For instance, certain  network servers and routers were set up in a manner that permitted  unauthorized users to connect to the network without entering valid user  IDs and password combinations.

Without these controls, the District has little assurance that  improper attempts to access sensitive information would be detected in  time to prevent or minimize damage.", "The District organizations we visited had not implemented proactive  network monitoring programs. Such a program would require the District  to   identify suspicious access patterns, such as repeated failed attempts to  log-on to the network, attempts to identify systems and services on the  network, connections to the network from unauthorized locations, and  efforts to overload the network to disrupt operations, and  implement intrusion detection systems to automatically log unusual  activity, provide necessary alerts, and terminate sessions when  necessary.", "The District had not installed intrusion detection software on its WAN.

Once policies and job descriptions that  support segregation of duties principles have been developed, it is also  important to implement access controls to ensure that employees perform  only compatible functions.", "The District had assigned incompatible duties to certain application and  system programmers. For example, some of the 24 application  programmers that developed computer programs for the District\u2019s main  financial system, SOAR, were also responsible for supporting its operation.  To perform these incompatible functions, certain application programmers  were granted access to SOAR production programs and data. Further, the  District had implemented access controls in a manner that permitted the  remaining application programmers, who were not responsible for  supporting SOAR operations, to also access SOAR production programs  and data\u2014a practice that violates basic segregation of duties principles.

Due to the interconnectivity of the District\u2019s networks,  coordination and guidance provided by a central focal point becomes even  more important, since a compromise in a single system could impact all  District agencies. According to District law, OCTO was created to (1) centralize responsibility for the District\u2019s information technology  investments and (2) develop and enforce policy directives and standards  regarding information technology throughout the District government.  However, no single District office was overseeing the architecture,  operations, configuration, or security of the District\u2019s networks and  systems. For example, each of the District\u2019s five data centers remains  responsible for operating and securing its own computer environment  without sufficient District-wide guidance or oversight. In addition, while  OCTO manages and secures the District WAN, other functional units, such  as DPW, still manage their own networks. Consequently, security roles and  responsibilities were not clearly assigned, security management was not  given adequate attention, and no organization was held accountable for  security throughout the District.", "A second key area of computer security management is assessing risk to  determine computer security needs. Risk assessments not only help  management to determine which controls will most effectively mitigate  risks, but also increase the awareness of risks and, thus, generate support  for adopted policies and controls. In this regard, it is important for  organizations to define a process, which can be adapted to different  organizational units, to continually manage computer security risk.  However, District policy did not require risk assessments or provide  guidance for managing computer security risk on a continuing basis.", "Consequently, none of the District organizations we visited were  adequately managing risk relating to computer security, as evidenced by  the serious weaknesses described above. For example, DPW had not  performed a risk assessment for its network. In addition, OCTO had not  formally assessed computer security risks relating to the District WAN,  which could affect all District agencies connected to this network. Further,  OCFO was not routinely assessing and managing information security risks  associated with its SHARE computer center, which processes Fund and  other District financial, payroll, personnel, and tax systems. During the past  year, the SHARE computer center had updated its computer hardware,  upgraded its operating system software, and installed a new financial  management system for the District. Although all of these events should  have warranted a risk assessment, OCFO only performed an initial risk  assessment for the new financial management system.", "A third key element of effective security program management is  implementing computer security policies and controls that cover all  aspects of an organization\u2019s interconnected environment. Our study of  security management practices at leading organizations found that current,  comprehensive security policies, which cover all aspects of an  organization\u2019s interconnected environment, are important because written  policies are the primary mechanism by which management communicates  its views and requirements. We also reported that organizations should  develop both high-level organizational policies, which emphasize  fundamental requirements, and more detailed guidance or standards,  which describe an approach for implementing policy.", "Although District law tasks OCTO with coordinating the development of  information management plans, standards, systems, and procedures  throughout the District government, OCTO had not yet established  District-wide guidance for developing and implementing comprehensive  computer security policies and controls. This, along with the fact that a  central focal point had not been established to oversee computer security  throughout the District, has contributed to unclear security roles and  responsibilities. In one case, access to the District financial application had  been removed for three terminated District employees, but access to the  computer system that processes this and other District financial  applications, which is maintained by another District organization, had not  been disabled. Consequently these terminated employees still had the  opportunity to sabotage or impair other District financial operations.", "In addition, the District had not developed technical standards for  implementing security software, maintaining operating system integrity, or  controlling sensitive utilities. Such standards would not only help ensure  that appropriate information system controls were established consistently  throughout the District, but also facilitate periodic reviews of these  controls. The establishment of appropriate information system controls  was also hindered because security administration and system  programming staff were not provided with adequate technical training.  Specifically, OCFO security administration staff at the SHARE computer  center had not received security awareness training and had only been  provided minimal training on the security software used by the District. In  addition, OCFO system programmers at the SHARE computer center had  not received technical training on important types of system software, such  as the tape management system.", "A fourth key area of security program management is promoting security  awareness. Computer attacks and security breakdowns often occur  because computer users fail to take appropriate security measures. For this  reason, it is vital that employees who use computer systems in their day-to- day operations be aware of the importance and sensitivity of the  information they handle as well as the business and legal reasons for  maintaining its confidentiality and integrity. In accepting responsibility for  security, employees should, for example, devise effective passwords,  change them frequently, and protect them from disclosure. In addition,  employees should help maintain physical security over their assigned  areas.", "However, none of the District organizations we visited were adequately  promoting security awareness to ensure that such risks and responsibilities  were understood. Several of the computer security weaknesses we discuss  in this report indicate that users were either unaware of or insensitive to  the need for important information system controls, such as secure  passwords. We also found little evidence that the District had convinced its  employees that it was important to prevent unauthorized access to the  SHARE computer center and other sensitive computer areas. As discussed  above, we were able to bypass physical security measures and enter and  move freely about both OCFO\u2019s SHARE computer center and a DPW  telecommunications room without detection or challenge.", "A fifth key element of effective security management is an ongoing  program of tests and evaluations to ensure that computer security policies  and controls continue to be appropriate and effective. This type of  oversight is an essential aspect of security management because it (1) helps  the organization take responsibility for its own security program and  (2) can help identify and correct problems before they become major  concerns. In addition, periodic assessments or reports on security activities  can be a valuable means of identifying areas of noncompliance, reminding  employees of their responsibilities, and demonstrating management\u2019s  commitment to the security program.", "Our study of security management best practices at leading organizations  found that an effective control evaluation program includes processes for  (1) monitoring compliance with established information system control  policies and guidelines, (2) testing the effectiveness of information system  controls, and (3) improving information system controls based on the  results of these activities.", "None of the District organizations we visited had established such a  program, which could have allowed the District to identify and correct the  types of weaknesses discussed in this report. Until the District establishes  a program to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of information system  controls, it will not be able to ensure that its computer systems and data  are adequately protected from unauthorized access.", "OCTO officials told us that they recognize the need for enhanced security  and to this end, plan to implement a formal security management program  by October 1, 2001.

However, the District\u2019s information system control problems placed  sensitive personnel and tax information at risk of disclosure, critical  financial operations at risk of disruption, and assets at risk of loss.", "A primary reason for the District\u2019s information system control problems is  that it did not have a comprehensive security management program.  Comprehensive computer security management programs are appropriate  for achieving an effective information system general control environment.  Effective implementation of such a program provides for periodically  assessing risks, implementing effective controls for restricting access  based on job requirements and proactively reviewing access activities,  communicating the established policies and controls to those who are  responsible for their implementation, and, perhaps most important,  evaluating the effectiveness of policies and controls to ensure that they  remain appropriate and accomplish their intended purpose.", "District management stated that it has recognized the seriousness of the  weaknesses we identified and expressed its commitment to improving  information system controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that you direct the Chief Financial Officer, Chief  Technology Officer, and the Director of DPW, as appropriate, to take the  following actions.", "Correct the specific access control weaknesses which are summarized  in this report and detailed, along with our corresponding  recommendations and the District\u2019s corrective action plans, in a  separate report designated for \u201cLimited Official Use,\u201d also issued today.", "Report to you, or your designee, periodically on progress in  implementing the corrective action plans described in the separate  report designated for \u201cLimited Official Use.\u201d", "We also recommend that you direct the Chief Technology Officer to ensure  that an effective entitywide security management program, as described in  this report and in our study of security management best practices at  leading organizations, is developed and implemented.
