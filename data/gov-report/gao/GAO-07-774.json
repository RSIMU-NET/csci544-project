The Department of Defense (DOD) and others have reported that absentee voting, which relies primarily on mail, can be slow and may, in certain circumstances, serve to disenfranchise these voters. In 2004, Congress required DOD to develop an Internet-based absentee voting demonstration project and required the Election Assistance Commission--which reviews election procedures--to develop guidelines for DOD's project. In 2006, Congress required DOD to report, by May 15, 2007, on plans for expanding its use of electronic voting technologies and required GAO to assess efforts by (1) DOD to facilitate electronic absentee voting and (2) the Commission to develop Internet voting guidelines and DOD to develop an Internet-based demonstration project. GAO also assessed DOD's efforts to develop plans to expand its use of electronic voting technologies. GAO interviewed officials and reviewed and analyzed documents related to these efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2000, DOD has developed several initiatives to facilitate absentee voting by electronic means such as fax or e-mail; however, some of these initiatives exhibited weaknesses or had low participation rates that might hinder their effectiveness. For example, the 2003 Electronic Transmission Service's fax to e-mail conversion feature allows UOCAVA voters who do not have access to a fax machine to request ballots by e-mail and then converts the e-mails to faxes to send to local election officials. DOD officials told us, however, they have not performed, among other things, certification tests and thus are not in compliance with information security requirements. The 2004 Interim Voting Assistance System (IVAS)--which, DOD reported, enabled UOCAVA voters to request and receive ballots securely--cost $576,000, and 17 citizens received ballots through it. The 2006 Integrated Voting Alternative Site (also called IVAS)--which enabled voters to request ballots using one tool, by mail, fax, or unsecured e-mail--raised concerns, from Congress and others, that using unsecured e-mail could expose voters to identity theft if they transmit personal data. While this IVAS displayed a warning that voters had to read to proceed, it did not advise them to delete personal voting information from the computers they used. DOD spent $1.1 million, and at least eight voted ballots were linked to this 2006 IVAS. Both the 2004 and 2006 IVAS were each implemented just 2 months before an election. DOD also has a Web site with links to guidance on electronic transmission options, but some of this guidance was inconsistent and could be misleading. DOD officials acknowledged the discrepancies and addressed them during GAO's review. The Election Assistance Commission has not developed the Internet absentee voting guidelines for DOD's use, and thus DOD has not proceeded with its Internet-based absentee voting demonstration project. Commission officials told GAO that they had not developed the guidelines because they had been devoting constrained resources to other priorities, including challenges associated with electronic voting machines. Furthermore, they have not established--in conjunction with major stakeholders like DOD--tasks, milestones, and time frames for completing the guidelines. The absence of such guidelines has hindered DOD's development of its Internet-based demonstration project. To assist the Commission, however, DOD has shared information on the challenges it faced in implementing prior Internet projects--including security threats. GAO observed that DOD was developing, but had not yet completed, plans for expanding the future use of electronic voting technologies. Because electronic voting in federal elections involves numerous federal, state, and local-level stakeholders; emerging technology; and time to establish the initiatives, developing results-oriented plans that identify goals, time frames, and tasks--including addressing security issues--is key. Without such plans, DOD is not in a position to address congressional expectations to establish secure and private electronic and Internet-based voting initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A citizen\u2019s right to vote is one of the hallmarks of a democratic society; yet  exercising this right can be a challenge for millions of military personnel  and their dependents of voting age who live away from their legal  residences (in or outside the United States) and for overseas citizens.  These individuals are eligible to vote by absentee ballots in federal  elections. This eligibility is established by the Uniformed and Overseas  Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which is administered by the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Federal Voting Assistance Program  (FVAP). Through this program, DOD provides assistance to UOCAVA  voters to facilitate opportunities for them to exercise their right to vote.  The absentee voting process requires the potential voter to register to  vote, request an absentee ballot, receive the ballot, correctly complete the  ballot, and return it to the appropriate local election official. However,  DOD and groups that represent voters covered under the act have  reported that, because the multistep process of absentee voting relies  primarily on mail, in some instances it can take so long to complete that  these voters may, in effect, be disenfranchised.", "To address concerns about mail-based absentee voting, Congress has  enacted several laws to promote electronic means for voters to register,  request and receive ballots, and transmit voted ballots to local election  officials. These laws include (1) the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which  established the Election Assistance Commission to serve as a national  clearinghouse for election information and to review election procedures;  develop voluntary voting system guidelines; and study, among other  things, electronic voting\u2014particularly Internet voting technology;   (2) section 1604 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for  Fiscal Year 2002, which required DOD to carry out a secure Internet-based  electronic demonstration project in the general election for federal office  in 2002 or 2004; and (3) section 567 of the Ronald W. Reagan NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2005, which amended Congress\u2019s mandate for DOD to develop  a secure, Internet-based, absentee voting demonstration project\u2014by  requiring DOD to implement the project during the first general election  for federal office that occurs after the Election Assistance Commission  establishes Internet voting guidelines for the absentee voting process.

The report  also discusses DOD\u2019s efforts to develop plans to expand the use of  electronic voting technology in the future.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed and analyzed laws, directives,  reports, and plans related to DOD\u2019s efforts to provide electronic voting  capabilities for UOCAVA voters. We also examined the Election Assistance  Commission\u2019s efforts to develop Internet absentee voting guidelines. We  reviewed and analyzed information regarding any benefits and challenges  that we, DOD, and others had identified related to DOD\u2019s Internet-based  electronic demonstration project and new electronic voting initiatives,  along with the steps DOD had taken to mitigate those challenges.  Additionally, we interviewed and obtained documentation from officials in  several offices within DOD, the Election Assistance Commission, selected  state and local election jurisdictions, and some independent groups  concerned with the interests of UOCAVA voters.

Voters, local election  jurisdictions (which number over 10,000), states and territories, and the  federal government all play important roles in the election process. The  process, however, is primarily the responsibility of the individual states  and territories and their election jurisdictions. As we reported in our 2006  testimony, states and territories have considerable discretion in how they  organize the elections process; this is reflected in the diversity of  procedures and deadlines that states and jurisdictions establish for voter  registration and absentee voting. Furthermore, these states and  jurisdictions use a variety of voting techniques, from paper ballots to faxes  and e-mails. We also reported that the voter is ultimately responsible for  being aware of and understanding the absentee voting process and taking  the actions necessary to participate in it.", "The UOCAVA established that members of the military and their  dependents of voting age living away from their legal residences (in or  outside the United States) and American citizens who no longer maintain a  permanent residence in the United States are eligible to participate by  absentee ballot in all federal elections. According to DOD, the act covers  more than 6 million people. Executive Order and DOD guidance related to  the act include the following:    Executive Order 12642, dated June 8, 1988, made the Secretary of Defense,  or his designee, responsible for carrying out the federal functions under  UOCAVA, including (1) compiling and distributing information on state  absentee voting procedures, (2) designing absentee registration and voting  materials, (3) working with state and local election officials, and   (4) reporting to Congress and the President after each presidential  election on the effectiveness of the program\u2019s activities (including a  statistical analysis of UOCAVA voters\u2019 participation).", "DOD Directive 1000.4, updated April 14, 2004, assigned the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness responsibility for  administering and overseeing the program, and it established the FVAP to  manage the program. In 2006, FVAP officials told us that they were  authorized a full-time staff of 13 and had a fiscal year budget of  approximately $3.8 million.", "FVAP facilitates the absentee voting process for UOCAVA voters; its  mission is to (1) inform and educate U.S. citizens worldwide about their  right to vote, (2) foster voter participation, and (3) enhance and protect  the integrity of the electoral process at the federal, state, and local levels.  FVAP also, among other things, provides training opportunities for Voting  Assistance Officers (service, State Department, and overseas citizen  organization officials who carry out the implementation of their respective  voting assistance programs); prescribes, coordinates, and distributes  voting materials, such as the Federal Post Card Application (the  registration and absentee ballot request form for UOCAVA voters); and  provides for alternatives to regular mail, including Express Mail and the  use of electronic solutions.", "The Election Assistance Commission, which was established by the Help  America Vote Act of 2002, also contributes to the absentee voting process.  The act specifically established the Commission as a national  clearinghouse for election information and procedures and assigned it  responsibility for developing voting system guidelines for the entire  election process. The act also specifies that the development of voluntary  voting system guidelines should be informed by research and development  in remote access voting, including voting through the Internet, and the  security of computers, networks and data storage. In 2005, the  Commission issued guidelines that, among other things, addressed gaps in  the security measures of prior standards. However, these guidelines do not  comprehensively address telecommunications and networking services or  their related security weaknesses, such as those related to the Internet.  The act also amended UOCAVA to require states to report to the  Commission, after each regularly scheduled general election for federal  office, on the aggregate number of (1) absentee ballots transmitted to  absentee uniformed services voters and overseas voters for the election  and (2) ballots returned by those voters and cast in the election. The  Commission collects this information through its biennial state surveys of  election data.", "DOD, the Commission, and organizations representing UOCAVA voters  have noted that these voters may effectively become disenfranchised  because the multistep process for voting by absentee ballot\u2014which relies  primarily on mail\u2014can take too long, especially for mobile  servicemembers and overseas citizens or those deployed to or living in  remote areas. Congress and DOD have taken action to facilitate the use of  alternatives to mail, including electronic means such as fax, e-mail, and the  Internet. Figure 1 shows (1) the laws designed to facilitate the use of  electronic capabilities for UOCAVA voters and (2) some of DOD\u2019s efforts,  either voluntary or in response to a statute, to provide electronic  capabilities to these voters during fiscal years 2000 through 2007.", "FVAP stated that it implemented the Voting Over the Internet project in  2000 as a small-scale pilot project to provide military personnel and their  dependents and overseas citizens covered under UOCAVA the ability to  securely register to vote, request and receive ballots from local election  officials, and vote via the Internet. DOD voluntarily developed the project  as a small-scale proof-of-concept Internet voting project. This project  enabled 84 voters to vote over the Internet\u2014the first time that binding  votes were cast in this manner. While the project demonstrated that it  was possible for a limited number of voters to cast ballots online, DOD\u2019s  report concluded that security concerns needed to be addressed before it  could expand remote (i.e., Internet) voting to a larger population.", "In 2001, Congress noted that the Voting Over the Internet project had  demonstrated that the Internet could be used to enhance absentee voting.  To continue the examination of a secure, easy-to-use Internet voting  system as an alternative to the regular mail process, Congress mandated,  in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2002, that DOD conduct a large-scale Internet- based absentee voting demonstration project to be used for the 2002 or  2004 federal election. DOD responded to this mandate by creating the  Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE) for  Internet-based absentee registration and voting; SERVE used a system  architecture similar to the one used for the Voting Over the Internet  project. However, as we previously reported, a minority report published  by four members of the Security Peer Review Group\u2014a group of 10  computer election security experts that FVAP assembled to evaluate  SERVE\u2014publicly raised concerns about the security of the system  because of its use of the Internet. The four members suggested that  SERVE be terminated because potential security problems left the  information in the system vulnerable to cyber attacks that could disclose  votes or personal voter information. Furthermore, they cautioned against  the development of future electronic voting systems until the security of  both the Internet and the world\u2019s home computer infrastructure had been  improved. Because DOD did not want to call into question the integrity of  votes that would have been cast via SERVE, the Deputy Secretary of  Defense terminated the project in early 2004, and DOD did not use it in the  November 2004 election.", "The points raised in these security reviews are consistent with concerns  we raised in our 2001 reports. We found that broad application of Internet  voting presented formidable social and technological challenges. In  particular, we noted that challenges to remote Internet voting involve  securing voter identification information and ensuring that voters secure  the computer on which they vote. We also reported that because voting  requires more stringent controls than other electronic transactions, such  as online banking, Internet voting systems face greater security challenges  than other Internet systems. Furthermore, we found that remote Internet  voting was recognized as the least protective of ballot secrecy and voter  privacy and was most at risk from denial of service and malicious  software, such as computer viruses. While opinions of groups considering  the pros and cons of Internet voting were not unanimous, we found that  they agreed in principle on major issues, including considering security to  be the primary technical challenge for Internet voting. Because of serious  concerns about protecting the security and privacy of the voted ballot, we  concluded that Internet-based registration and voting would not likely be  implemented on a large scale in the near future.", "In the Ronald W. Reagan NDAA for Fiscal Year 2005, Congress amended  the requirement for the Internet-based absentee voting demonstration  project by permitting DOD to delay its implementation until the first  federal election after the Election Assistance Commission developed  guidelines for the project.

These include the  Electronic Transmission Service\u2019s fax to e-mail and e-mail to fax  conversion enhancement (hereafter referred to as the e-mail to fax  conversion feature); the 2004 Interim Voting Assistance System (IVAS); the  2006 Integrated Voting Alternative Site (also called IVAS); DOD\u2019s online  voting assistance guidance; and online forms to register, request, receive,  or submit ballots. While these efforts provide valuable guidance, services,  and information to UOCAVA voters, some of them had limited  participation rates or exhibited weaknesses in security, consistency, and  accuracy that might hinder their use and effectiveness.

These voters and election officials can use this service and do not have to  pay long distance fees for faxing out of state, because DOD provides the  service through a toll-free line. In 2003, after discussions with Mississippi  state officials and a Mississippi National Guard unit, FVAP added the   e-mail to fax conversion capability to its electronic transmission service.  These officials asked FVAP for help in transmitting voting materials  because, by state law, Mississippi allowed only faxing as an electronic  means of transmission\u2014a capability that the Guard unit would not have  while it was deployed to Iraq. The e-mail to fax conversion feature allows  UOCAVA voters who do not have access to a facsimile machine to send  ballot requests, via e-mail, to DOD\u2019s Electronic Transmission Service,  which converts e-mail attachments to faxes and sends them to local  election officials. In return, local election officials can send ballots to the  Electronic Transmission Service conversion feature by fax; the conversion  feature then converts the fax to an e-mail attachment and sends it to the  voter.", "FVAP stated that it notifies states and territories whenever it converts an  e-mail containing voting materials to a fax, or vice versa, so that the state  or territory can decide whether or not to accept it. Table 1 shows  Electronic Transmission Service activity for the conversion feature for  2004 and 2006.", "Although FVAP has made progress in assisting servicemembers to  transmit voting materials with the e-mail to fax conversion enhancement,  FVAP officials told us they have not fully complied with certain  information security requirements in the Interim DOD Information  Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process. This guidance  requires DOD components, among other things, to implement controls and  to certify and accredit such e-mail systems.", "FVAP officials initially stated that the information security guidance did  not apply to the conversion feature; they saw it as an enhancement to the  original Electronic Transmission Service\u2019s fax system. During the course  of our review, however, FVAP officials said they consulted with officials  responsible for DOD\u2019s information assurance certification and  accreditation and concluded that the requirements did, in fact, apply.  These officials stated that, by the end of fiscal year 2007, they plan to  award a contract to obtain services to meet the information security  requirements. The FVAP officials further stated that, while they do not  have the required documentation\u2014such as risk assessments or  certification tests and accreditations\u2014they have taken some measures to  ensure security. We note that the statement of work for FVAP\u2019s April 29,  2005, contract for the Electronic Transmission Service recognizes the  sensitivity of the data associated with election materials and includes  provisions for certain security functions, such as ensuring that adequate  steps are taken to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the  data. Until FVAP performs and documents the security assessments and  certifications, however, it has not taken all the necessary measures to  secure its system and comply with DOD\u2019s information security  requirements.", "Federal law includes a number of separate statutes that provide privacy  protections for certain information. The major requirements for the  protection of personal privacy by federal agencies come from two laws:  the Privacy Act of 1974 and the privacy provisions of the E-Government  Act of 2002. Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 requires  agencies, among other things, to conduct privacy impact assessments  before developing, upgrading, or procuring information technology that  collects, maintains, or disseminates personally identifiable information.  DOD developed departmentwide guidance\u2014the DOD Privacy Impact  Assessment Guidance\u2014for implementing the privacy impact assessment  requirements mandated in the E-Government Act of 2002. In this guidance,  DOD directs the components to adhere to the requirements prescribed by  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\u2014Guidance for  Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002.  FVAP officials stated that they had not conducted a privacy impact  assessment for the Electronic Transmission Service\u2019s e-mail to fax  conversion enhancement, but they told us that a privacy impact  assessment will be done as part of the previously mentioned contract to  meet information security requirements. A privacy impact assessment  would identify specific privacy risks to help determine what controls are  needed to mitigate those risks associated with the Electronic  Transmission Service. Furthermore, building in controls to mitigate risks  could ensure that personal information that is transmitted is only used for  a specified purpose. FVAP noted that when information is sent by e-mail,  the conversion feature retains the following information: full name, fax  number, city, state, zip code, and e-mail addresses. FVAP\u2019s Electronic  Transmission Service retains this personally identifiable information both  to provide transmission verification or confirmation to users and to  comply with election document retention requirements under the Civil  Rights Act of 1960."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Electronic Ballot Request and Receipt Initiatives Had Limitations in Participation and Security", "paragraphs": ["In September 2004, just 2 months prior to the election, DOD voluntarily  implemented what it reported as a secure electronic system for voters to  request and receive ballots\u2014the Interim Voting Assistance System  (IVAS)\u2014as an alternative to the traditional mail process. IVAS was open to  active duty servicemembers, their voting age dependents, and DOD  overseas personnel who were registered in a state or territory participating  in the project and enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility  Reporting System\u2014a DOD-managed database that includes over 23 million  records pertaining to active duty and reserve military and their family  members, retired military, DOD civil service personnel, and DOD  contractors. DOD had limited IVAS participation to UOCAVA voters who  were affiliated with DOD because their identities could be verified in the  Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Voters obtained their  state or territory ballots through IVAS by logging on to a special Web site  and then requesting ballots from their participating local election  jurisdictions. After the local election officials approved the requests and  the ballots were finalized, IVAS notified voters via e-mail that the ballots  were available to download and print. DOD reported that 108 counties in  eight states and one territory agreed to participate in this 2004 IVAS;  however, only 17 citizens downloaded their ballots from the site during the  2004 election. FVAP officials noted that participation was low, in part  because this IVAS was implemented just 2 months before the election.  FVAP further reported that many states did not participate\u2014for a variety  of reasons, including state legislative restrictions, workload surrounding  regular election responsibilities, and lack of Internet access. FVAP  officials noted that this system, which was maintained through the  conclusion of the election, cost $576,000.", "In September 2006\u2014again, just 2 months before the next general  election\u2014FVAP launched a follow-on Integrated Voting Alternative Site,  also called IVAS, in response to a June 2006 legislative mandate to  reestablish the 2004 IVAS. This 2006 IVAS expanded on the 2004 effort, by  providing information on electronic ballot request and receipt options for  all UOCAVA citizens in all 55 states and territories.  It also provided two  tools that registered voters could access through the FVAP Web site, using  DOD or military identification, to request or receive ballots from local  election officials. As with the 2004 IVAS, local election officials used  information in these tools to verify the identity of UOCAVA voters who  used them. The first tool\u2014called Tool 1\u2014contained a ballot request form  only, accessed through DOD\u2019s Web site, which voters could fill out and  download to their computers. Voters could then send the downloaded  form to the local election officials either by regular mail, fax, or unsecured  e-mail, per state or territory requirements. FVAP officials reported to  Congress that no information on the number of users was available on the  use of Tool 1 because the department was no longer involved in the  process once the voter downloaded the ballot request and they,  essentially, had no visibility into what transpired directly between the  voter and the election officials.", "The second tool\u2014called Tool 2\u2014provided a ballot request and receipt  capability for voters, similar to the 2004 IVAS, which also allowed voters to  fill out ballot request forms online, send them to local election officials  through a secure line, and receive their state or territory ballots from the  local election officials through a secured server. Again, no voted ballots  were transmitted through this IVAS system given that it was not designed  for that purpose. Absentee voters, instead, would return voted ballots,  outside of IVAS, in accordance with state law. Tool 2 had a tracking  feature which showed that 63 voters had requested ballots through the  system. Of these, local election officials approved and made their state or  territory ballots available to 35 UOCAVA voters. However, of the 35 sent  out, local election officials reported that only 8 voted ballots were traced  back to the IVAS Tool 2, in part because this IVAS was implemented just   2 months before the election. DOD reported that the total cost for the 2006  IVAS was about $1.1 million, and given that the tools were used only to  request or receive ballots for the November 2006 elections, DOD removed  the tools from FVAP\u2019s Web site in January 2007. Table 2 compares and  provides additional details on the two tools.", "Officials within Congress, and others, have expressed concerns that voters  could be exposed to a heightened risk of identity theft if they used Tool 1  to send voting materials that contain personally identifiable information  (including Social Security number, date of birth, and address), by  unsecured e-mail. FVAP officials acknowledged in their December 2006  report to Congress that Tool 1 was less secure, but said (1) DOD was  providing access to a capability that states already provide, (2) most  states and territories only required the last four digits of the Social  Security number on the ballot requests, and (3) Tool 1 displayed a  cautionary statement that voters had to read to go on with the request  process; this cautionary statement explained the risk associated with   e-mailing ballot requests and that the government assumed no liability if  voters did so. While we confirmed a cautionary statement related to the  transmission of personal data did exist for Tool 1, it did not advise voters,  after submitting their ballot request, to remove voting materials that they  have stored on their computers. For example, voters using Internet cafes  overseas could have been subject to identity theft if they did not delete  their personal information from the computer and a subsequent user  gained access to the stored file. FVAP officials acknowledged that users  were not advised of the risks of storing personal voting information on  their computers, and these officials stated that they will incorporate  lessons learned, such as adding a cautionary statement in any future ballot  request system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Online Voting Guidance Is Useful but Some Inconsistencies Exist in the Links", "paragraphs": ["In addition to these initiatives, DOD also has established the FVAP Web  site, which contains information on FVAP programs and links to assist  UOCAVA voters in the voting process.

Our analysis  specifically showed that, while not widespread, for 14 of the 55 states or  territories, some of the guidance regarding requirements for electronic  transmission was inconsistent and could be misleading, as the following  examples illustrate:    For the state of California, we found that three of the FVAP links correctly  stated that only overseas military and overseas civilian voters were eligible  to receive or return a ballot by fax; a fourth link, however, did not include  this restriction. As a result, military personnel stationed in the United  States, but away from their state of residence, might conclude\u2014 incorrectly\u2014that they were eligible to vote by fax. FVAP officials  acknowledged this discrepancy and updated the information reached from  the fourth link on January 25, 2007, to reflect the fact that uniformed  servicemembers must be residing or deployed overseas to be able to  receive and send ballots by fax.", "For the state of Colorado, we identified a news release that was issued on  October 18, 2006, announcing a new initiative to allow uniformed  servicemembers deployed outside the United States to request, receive,  and return absentee ballots via e-mail. One other FVAP link reflected this  change; however, four other links did not capture this change. FVAP  officials acknowledged this discrepancy, updated two of the links, and  issued an errata sheet on January 22, 2007. FVAP officials did not update  the third link\u2014the 2006-2007 Voting Assistance Guide accessed through  the publications link on their Web site\u2014stating that it was considered an  archive document and was not intended for update. However, DOD did not  clearly identify this link as an archived document; as a result, this link  could mislead voters who relied on it.

The fact that time is an issue with absentee voting by  regular mail has led many to look toward electronic and Internet voting,  which represent the next generation of voting technology, as alternatives.  While these alternatives may expedite the absentee voting process, they  are more vulnerable to privacy and security compromises than the  conventional methods now in use. Electronic and Internet voting require  safeguards to limit such vulnerabilities and prevent compromises to votes  from intentional actions or inadvertent errors. However, available  safeguards may not adequately reduce the risks of compromise. To date,  the Election Assistance Commission has not assessed the risks or possible  safeguards for Internet voting, nor has it developed corresponding  guidelines that define minimum Internet voting capabilities and safeguards  to be considered by the election community. Furthermore, electronic and  Internet-based absentee voting can be challenging for UOCAVA voters,  who reside at multiple locations across the globe. These voters are also  registered to vote in thousands of local jurisdictions across 55 states and  territories that employ varying levels of technology\u2014from paper ballots to  faxes and e-mail. DOD faces significant challenges in leveraging electronic  and Internet technology to facilitate this complex, global absentee voting  process. Delays in developing guidelines and a demonstration project have  resulted in two presidential elections passing without significant progress  in moving toward expanded use of electronic and Internet absentee voting.

The challenges of  coordinating among numerous stakeholders\u2014including DOD, the  Commission, and state and local election officials, as well as organizations  representing UOCAVA voters\u2014are substantial, and, to date, efforts to  involve stakeholders in the planning stage of DOD\u2019s recent initiatives have  fallen short. This delay has left an expectation gap between what Congress  required and what has been accomplished so far. Several steps would have  to be taken to overcome these challenges, including better coordination  between the Commission and DOD regarding their complementary roles in  developing Internet voting guidelines and the mandated demonstration  project. Unless the Commission and DOD move in a timely manner to  assess the technology risks, develop guidelines that address the risks,  coordinate among election stakeholders, and establish and execute  prudent plans, they are unlikely to meet the expectations of Congress and  military and overseas voters to establish a secure and private electronic  and Internet-based UOCAVA voting environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for DOD", "paragraphs": ["To improve the security and accuracy of DOD\u2019s electronic and Internet  initiatives, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to take the following  four actions:    Comply with the information security requirements in the DOD  Certification and Accreditation Process guidance.
