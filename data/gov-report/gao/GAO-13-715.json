In doing so, VA improved both the clarity and  usefulness of the information included in its budget justification.", "Reliability of estimates for non-NRM facility-related activities. VA  improved the reliability of its estimates for non-NRM facility-related  activities. In a February 2013 report, we found that lower than  estimated spending for non-NRM facility-related activities, such as  utilities and janitorial services, allowed VA to spend significantly more  on NRM than it originally estimated in recent years. We recommended  that VA determine why it has overestimated spending for non-NRM  and use the results to improve future, non-NRM budget estimates. VA  concurred with this recommendation. According to VA officials, the  agency updated assumptions it used to predict growth for non-NRM  facility-related activities in order to better reflect VA\u2019s experience  during the last 3 to 5 fiscal years. For example, in prior years, VA has  estimated spending between $700 and $900 million on \u201cAdministrative  Contract Services,\u201d which was at least $360 million more than VA\u2019s  actual spending for this category. VA\u2019s fiscal year 2014 estimate of  $395 million for \u201cAdministrative Contract Services\u201d appears to be a  more reliable estimate of spending based on recent experience. By  improving the reliability of information presented in its congressional  budget justification regarding non-NRM facility-related activities, as we  previously recommended, VA improved the usefulness of such  information.", "Reliability of estimates for NRM. According to VA officials, the  agency also has taken steps to improve the reliability of its fiscal year  2014 NRM estimate. In June 2012, we reported that VA\u2019s NRM  spending has historically exceeded NRM estimates because these  estimates have not consistently accounted for additional NRM  spending by VA medical facilities. According to officials, VA\u2019s  estimate for NRM was based on a policy decision. We recommended  that VA improve the reliability of its estimates for NRM by accounting  for resources that VA medical facilities have consistently spent for this  purpose. VA concurred with our recommendation. According to VA  officials, the agency revised its method for estimating NRM and  reduced its overall estimate of spending for the Medical Facilities  account, which includes NRM. Specifically, VA officials indicated that  the agency revised its method for estimating NRM to better account  for expected spending. The resulting NRM estimate, combined with  the previously discussed reduction in its non-NRM estimate, resulted  in a decrease in estimated spending for VA\u2019s Medical Facilities  account. In prior years, additional NRM spending was the result of VA  medical facilities using funds from the Medical Facilities account on  NRM that were originally expected to be spent on other activities\u2014 such as utilities, grounds maintenance, and janitorial services.  Reductions in the overall amount available from the Medical Facilities  account would reduce the amount available for additional spending for  NRM, so a decrease in VA\u2019s overall estimate for its Medical Facilities  account could potentially reduce the availability of additional  resources for NRM beyond its fiscal year 2014 estimate.", "Reliability of estimates for proposed savings. VA has taken steps  to address some, but not all, of our prior concerns regarding the  reliability of its estimates for proposed savings, which included  savings from operational improvements and management initiatives.  In a February 2012 report, we determined that some of the estimates  for operational improvements included in VA\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget  justification may not have been reliable estimates of future savings.  We concluded that without a sound methodology VA ran the risk of  falling short of its estimated savings, which may ultimately require VA  to make difficult trade-offs to provide health care services with the  available resources. We recommended that VA develop a sound  methodology for estimating proposed savings from its operational  improvements. VA concurred with the recommendation and officials  told us during our prior review that the agency was working to address  deficiencies in its methodology for estimating these savings. The  information that we reviewed on VA\u2019s methodology for estimating  proposed savings for fiscal year 2014 to date confirmed that VA has  taken some steps to address our prior concerns. For example, VA  provided a basis for the assumptions used to calculate some of its  proposed savings from acquisitions and employee travel. However,  the information did not indicate that VA had fully implemented our  recommendation for all operational improvements and management  initiatives included in the estimates for proposed savings.", "In regard to the sixth problem we identified, VA did not address a lack of  transparency we previously found regarding its estimates for initiatives  and ongoing health care services. In June 2012, we reported that VA did  not disclose that it used a new reporting approach that combined both  funding for initiatives and funding for certain ongoing health care services  in its initiatives estimate. We recommended that VA improve the  transparency of its estimates for initiatives and ongoing health care  services by stating whether the estimates for initiatives included funding  for ongoing health care services. VA concurred with our recommendation.  According to officials, VA used the same reporting approach for initiatives  in its fiscal year 2014 budget justification as the agency used in its fiscal  year 2013 budget justification. However, we found no statement in the  budget justification indicating this or more specifically whether the  estimates for initiatives included funding for ongoing health care services.  By not stating in its budget justification whether the estimates for  initiatives included funding for ongoing health care services, VA was not  transparent about the total amount of funding the agency may need in  fiscal year 2014 for ongoing health care services that would require  funding regardless of whether funding for certain initiatives continued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In its congressional budget justification, VA provides Congress and other  users with information on the agency\u2019s health care budget estimate and  other information that supports the policies and spending decisions  represented in the President\u2019s budget request. In response to our prior  work, VA has taken steps to improve the consistency, reliability, and  transparency of its estimates and information supporting the President\u2019s  budget request for VA health care. In particular, VA has taken steps to  improve (1) the transparency of its estimates for initiatives in support of  the advance appropriations request, (2) the consistency of its language  used to label health care services, (3) the reliability of the estimates for  other facility-related activities funded through the Medical Facilities  account, (4) the reliability of its estimates for NRM, and (5) the reliability  of proposed savings from operational improvements and management  initiatives. However, VA did not indicate whether the estimates it reports  for initiatives included funding needed for ongoing health care services,  as we previously recommended. While VA has addressed to varying  degrees the problems we previously identified, it is important that VA  ensure that the recommendations from our prior work regarding the  information and estimates in VA\u2019s budget justification are fully  implemented. Until these recommendations are fully implemented, the  problems we previously identified will continue to limit the usefulness of  related information to Congress and other users of VA\u2019s budget  justification.", "In addition, our work shows that VA made key changes to its budget  methodology\u2014namely, VA used the EHCPM, in part, to develop  estimates for most long-term care services. VA also changed how the  agency reported its estimates for administrative costs, although VA did  not do so consistently and comprehensively throughout its fiscal year  2014 budget justification. VA introduced a new budget category label  \u201cAdministrative Personnel\u201d for reporting its total estimate for  administrative personnel costs, but used the old \u201cAdministration\u201d label  when reporting estimates for the same costs in each of VA\u2019s three health  care appropriations accounts. Additionally, VA defined some of the costs  included in the \u201cAdministrative Personnel\u201d label, but did not do so for  \u201cAdministration\u201d or \u201cAdministrative Contract Services\u201d in its budget  justification.
