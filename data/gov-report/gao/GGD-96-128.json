For employees retiring in 1995, the integration level was $24,312). In the FERS plan, the formula for each year of service is 1.1 percent of average salary for retirees who are at least age 62 with 20 years of service. For retirees who are younger than age 62, the FERS benefit formula is 1 percent of average salary for each year of service.", "The Reserve Bank plan allows employees as young as age 50 to voluntarily retire early with reduced benefits.

Under FERS, employees cannot voluntarily retire before age 55 unless they or their agencies are facing involuntary employee separations.", "FERS also includes a thrift plan to which covered employees and their agencies can contribute to increase retirement income. The FERS thrift plan is designed somewhat differently from the Federal Reserve thrift plan; overall, it provides slightly greater benefits to participating employees. Unlike the Federal Reserve thrift plan, all employees in FERS receive agency contributions equal to 1 percent of their salaries regardless of whether the employees make any contributions. The agencies then match, dollar-for-dollar, employee pretax contributions of up to 3 percent of salary and 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2 percent of salary that employees contribute to the thrift plan.

The UAGs were developed by the Reserve Banks in conference committees. They were designed to provide minimum requirements for Reserve Bank procurement activities. By providing opportunities for all interested bidders to become a selected source, the guidelines attempt to ensure that Reserve Banks treat sources fairly and impartially. By fostering competition in the procurement process, Reserve Banks will also have a greater opportunity to realize cost savings through lower competitive pricing.", "Despite the UAGs, we observed the following:", "Practices at individual Reserve Banks differed significantly and some practices favored certain sources over others. For instance, some Reserve Banks did not allow an equal opportunity for new bidders to bid for large procurements and limited bidders lists to sources with which the Reserve Banks had traditionally done business. This practice existed even though other equally qualified sources were both available and interested. Furthermore, some Reserve Banks retained incumbent contractors for certain services for years without recompeting the award, thus precluding other firms from competing for those services. At one of the four Reserve Banks we visited, the records indicated that the cafeteria contract was last competed over 9 years ago. At another Reserve Bank we visited, personnel could not locate documentation of their last cafeteria contract negotiations, which they believed occurred in the late 1980s.

For instance, the UAGs prohibit disclosure of specific information contained in bids or proposals to anyone except Reserve Bank personnel before awarding the contract. However, two of the four Reserve Banks we visited transferred almost all functions leading up to the award of major building contracts to architecture and engineering (A&E) firms. A&E firms receive and evaluate bids and recommend the source that should receive the award.

The Reserve Banks then contribute, out of Federal Reserve earnings, amounts to their surplus accounts so that the surplus balances are equal to the amount of paid-in capital. During 1988 to 1994, the total of the surplus accounts systemwide increased 79 percent, from $2.1 billion in 1988 to $3.7 billion in 1994.", "The Federal Reserve has stated in its publications that the purpose of the surplus accounts is to ensure that adequate capital is available to absorb possible losses. In its monetary policy, lender of last resort, and payment system activities, the Federal Reserve is exposed to risks that could potentially generate large losses. However, because the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest income so far exceeds its expenses, we believe it is highly unlikely the Federal Reserve will ever incur sufficient annual losses such that it would be required to use any funds in the surplus account. In the years 1914 and 1915, the first 2 years of its operations, the Federal Reserve experienced net losses. However, every year since then, for 79 years, the Federal Reserve has recorded substantial net profits. The profits for 1994 were $20 billion and expenses, including losses, were about $3 billion.", "We could find no criteria to use in assessing the amount held in surplus. According to Federal Reserve officials, the methodology for deciding that amount has changed and is somewhat arbitrary. Currently, and in the past, the levels of the surplus account have been discretionary because the requirement to have the surplus account equal to paid-in capital has been a matter of Federal Reserve policy; it was not required by law. However, in a provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress required the Federal Reserve, in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 only, to calculate the surplus account using the current formula and then to reduce the account by $106 million in fiscal year 1997 and $107 million in fiscal year 1998. Although the law did not specifically state the purpose of those transfers, its effect was to reduce the federal government\u2019s projected deficit in those years. Considering that this provision only applies to fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and the general lack of criteria for assessing surplus amounts, Congress may wish to determine whether these surplus accounts are necessary and, if so, set permanently in law an appropriate amount for these accounts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Because the Federal Reserve\u2019s spending represents a cost to U.S. taxpayers, the Federal Reserve should operate as efficiently as possible.

Furthermore, we believe travel expenses could be reduced by adopting the most cost-effective \u201cbest practices\u201d in travel reimbursement policies. Although instituting uniform, cost-conscious practices at all Reserve Banks may appear contrary to the tradition of independently managed Reserve Banks, the Reserve Banks have adopted uniform policies and procedures in many areas of operation.", "Our review of contracting and procurement practices at some Reserve Banks also indicate opportunities to reduce discretionary spending for goods and services.

Thus, the number of banks that would be affected is relatively small. If the FDIC also adopted examination fees, incentives for banks to become state-nonmember banks to avoid such fees would be eliminated. With respect to double-charges for bank examinations, we believe an equitable fee-sharing arrangement with state agencies that is based on the division of supervisory responsibility seems possible.

A total of 281 individuals, many of whom are prominent leaders of industry, the financial services community, labor groups, and consumer interests, serve as directors of the Reserve Banks and their branches. These directors provide both a sounding board for Federal Reserve policies as well as an established \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d to support the Federal Reserve when challenges to its independence arise, as they have from time to time in the past.

As to the benefit of having diversity of economic information for monetary policy purposes, in today\u2019s information age, it is likely that sufficient quality economic information could be gathered in some manner, even if the number of Reserve Banks were reduced. As to the benefits of its directors\u2019 network of support, the effects of a reduction in the numbers of Reserve Banks or a diminution of their responsibilities is less clear. If some Reserve Banks were to become, in effect, merely payments system processing centers, for example, the ability of these banks to attract prominent directors might be jeopardized.

The General Auditor was to report the audit findings to that Reserve Bank\u2019s Audit Committee even though this review was conducted for the Federal Reserve as a whole.

The Federal Reserve could accomplish this by taking steps to better ensure the independence of its internal audit function and to expand the scope of the OIG\u2019s authority to include responsibility for auditing the Reserve Banks and systemwide projects. As Reserve Banks are moving toward more systemwide projects and more centralized decisionmaking, the Federal Reserve\u2019s fragmented oversight structure is increasingly inappropriate to provide adequate oversight of centralized Reserve Bank operations. If the OIG\u2019s authority was expanded, the problems of redundant audits would be addressed.

Such an assessment should also include a review of the Federal Reserve strategic management processes. We believe that the Federal Reserve faces some difficult constraints in conducting such an effort. For example, the Board will need to work with the Reserve Banks to rethink their mutual roles in the shared leadership of the system. Furthermore, they will face profound challenges in planning and confronting possible changes. Planning deliberations related to redefining core missions and business lines and realigning the Federal Reserve\u2019s structure and governance would require strategic planners to \u201cthink beyond\u201d the statutory powers of the Board and Reserve Banks. The essential missions as well as the locations of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Reserve Banks are set by law, and the autonomy of the Reserve Banks generally necessitates consensus-oriented decisionmaking in systemwide planning. For example, the Federal Reserve is required by law to develop and implement monetary policy, supervise and regulate banks, regulate and provide payments system services, and provide fiscal agency services to government agencies upon request.", "In rethinking its mission and business lines, the Federal Reserve may face conflicts and difficult policy choices, which may require that it consult with Congress for help in resolving them. For example, the Federal Reserve is required to base check-clearing fees on the recovery of its costs; at the same time, it must also function as the \u201cclearer of last resort\u201d and promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions. In addition, neither the Board nor the Reserve Banks is authorized to change the numbers or locations of Reserve Banks or essential elements of Federal Reserve governance. Changes that might be considered in the context of a fundamental assessment of Federal Reserve operations could require legislative action to accomplish.", "Because it lacks the cost minimization pressures common to most public and private entities, the Federal Reserve must work extra hard to overcome internal pressures for budgetary increases. As discussed in chapter 1, the Board is a government agency and provides Congress with an annual report of the Federal Reserve\u2019s operations; however, the Federal Reserve is not subject to the congressional appropriations process that serves as a constraint on spending by federal entities. Furthermore, because the Federal Reserve Act sets dividends to member banks at 6 percent and prohibits them from selling their shares, shareholders, who are member banks, do not have the usual financial incentives to encourage cost-efficient operations. Additionally, the amount of interest the Federal Reserve receives on securities acquired through the issue of Federal Reserve notes is so great that it tends to mask the net decline of all other revenue sources that occurred over the 1988 to 1994 period. Therefore, it is especially important for the Federal Reserve to have management processes that support top management in constraining costs and that instill a high level of internal self-discipline that would allow the Federal Reserve to overcome institutional resistance to major management reform.", "However, despite its unique structure, the Federal Reserve has begun to show that it can address operational issues strategically and work in a systemwide manner when necessary, as evidenced by the recent establishment of a new Financial Services Committee to examine priced services and by the consolidation of its data-processing facilities.

Many of the functions performed by the Federal Reserve have little direct relation to monetary policy, and the Board, working with the Reserve Banks, has the authority and ability to take many cost-saving actions without jeopardizing its mission effectiveness.

The Board did not agree to undertake a fundamental review of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s operations, because it believes such reviews are an ongoing and integral part of the Board\u2019s oversight of the System. The Board stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s role in providing financial services to depository institutions is constantly being tested in the marketplace, and the Board noted that the System is consolidating the management of some financial services. The Board stated its belief that most savings from such consolidation efforts would be possible in electronic payment functions, such as Fedwire, with lesser savings possible in paper-based financial services, such as check clearing. The Board also did not agree to consider alternatives to the current way the System provides priced services.", "Concerning merging or closing any of its 12 Reserve Banks or 25 branches, the Board stated that, while the Federal Reserve\u2019s structure would likely be different if established today, any such realignments or relocations would have to yield substantial long-term savings to offset the transition costs. Concerning the potential for technology to support streamlined work processes in the Reserve Banks, the Board stated that the Federal Reserve routinely assesses technologies for their ability to reduce costs and improve the quality of its services.", "Concerning our recommendations to improve the Federal Reserve\u2019s control and oversight mechanisms, the Board did not agree with our characterization of the System\u2019s budget process as one that assumed continuous growth. The Board also did not agree that the independence of its internal oversight would be strengthened by expanding the authority of the Board\u2019s OIG to the Reserve Banks. The Board believed that the current audit process ensured adequate independence and that expanding the OIG\u2019s authority could integrally involve the inspector general in the Board\u2019s oversight process and raise questions about the inspector general\u2019s \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d ability to audit such processes. The Board did not comment on our recommendation to institutionalize an annual external audit of the combined financial statements of the Reserve Banks.", "Finally, the Board did not agree with our suggestion that Congress may want to consider requiring the Federal Reserve to charge for bank examinations. The Board noted that, currently, the states charge examination fees that, on average, are approximately half of those charged by OCC for national bank examinations. The Board believed that if the Federal Reserve and FDIC were to charge for their examinations of state-chartered banks, such fees could tip the scales toward national charters and call into question the long-term viability of a valuable dual banking system.", "We continue to believe that the major technological and marketplace developments that are currently affecting the financial services industry have profound implications for the activities and operations of the Federal Reserve and require the System to have a strong, systemwide strategic management process. We acknowledge that the Federal Reserve has a range of strategic planning processes and programs in place or under development. And we recognize and commend the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to provide a more systemwide focus for its strategic planning efforts through the recent creation of the Federal Reserve System Strategic Planning Coordination Group. However, we are concerned that these strategic planning efforts are not sufficiently integrated and thus may be too limited and insufficient to effectively address the major challenges the Federal Reserve is facing, given the potential implications of these developments for the Federal Reserve\u2019s business lines and organizational structure.", "Leading private and public institutions have found that truly significant savings often come only when, as a part of a comprehensive strategic planning process, they have rethought their basic missions and lines of business and reengineered their work processes to streamline operations. The Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to consolidate some of its operations in financial services, while commendable, fall far short of the broad rethinking that we believe is necessary if the Federal Reserve is to be as efficient and cost effective as it can be in fulfilling its critical role as our nation\u2019s central bank.", "As a part of this broad rethinking, we also believe the Federal Reserve should consider consolidating some Reserve Banks and branches. We agree with the Board that such consolidation would result in transition costs but we believe that these costs could be offset by longer-term savings. We also note that consolidating banks and branches is not without precedent among central banks. For example, before the reunification of the former East and West Germany, the German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank (which was established by the Allies after World War II and modeled on the Federal Reserve System), had a presence in the form of Landesbanks in each of the 11 West German states. If it chose to keep intact the same structure after reunification, the Bundesbank was faced with the possibility of establishing five additional Landesbanks, one in each of the states of the former East Germany. Instead, the German government reduced the total number of Landesbanks serving the reunified 16 states to 9 Landesbanks and significantly reduced the number of central bank branches as well. The chief reasons given for these consolidation efforts were to promote efficiency and cost savings. Between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996, the Bundesbank reported that it was able to reduce its staff by 6 percent.", "Our recommendation that the Federal Reserve consider alternatives to the current way it delivers priced services to depository institutions is another example of the broad rethinking of mission and lines of business that we believe the Federal Reserve should undertake. When institutions carefully reexamine their missions and lines of business, they often determine that some lines of business are no longer profitable or no longer fit with the strategic direction they wish to take. For example, observers in the private sector have questioned whether it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to be both a provider and regulator of priced services, particularly in light of the growth of private-sector service providers. Some top officials within the Federal Reserve have, in the past, also suggested alternative ways to provide these services, such as by establishing a separate corporation.", "Regarding the use of technology to streamline work processes, our reviews of leading organizations that have sought to improve performance through strategic information management and technology have shown that accomplishing order-of-magnitude improvements in performance nearly always requires streamlining or redesigning critical work processes.Consequently, we believe information systems initiatives must be focused on process improvement. Using business process reengineering to drive information systems initiatives can lead to these order-of-magnitude savings, rather than the marginal efficiency gains normally associated with initiatives that use technology to do the same work, the same way, only faster. We acknowledged in several sections in this report that the Federal Reserve\u2019s automation consolidation efforts (under the FRAS system) were designed to promote more efficient operations and to ensure increased security in the nation\u2019s payments system. However, we are concerned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s automation consolidation efforts may not have involved sufficient reengineering of existing work processes. Because of the size of the information technology investment and the potential that such technology holds for providing higher quality services faster and at lower cost, we believe that it is critical that the Federal Reserve ensures that its strategic information technology planning is an integral part of its strategic and business planning processes.", "We continue to believe that the concerns we raised about the Federal Reserve\u2019s oversight and control mechanisms are valid. Although the Federal Reserve does not view its budget process as having a built-in assumption of annual growth, we note that, for each year from 1988 to 1994 and for each Reserve Bank, annual budget targets have been expressed as percentage increases from the previous year\u2019s budgets. The budget did not reflect a decrease in budget authority in any year for any Reserve Bank despite the fact that during this period many Reserve Banks consolidated their savings bonds programs and mainframe computer operations.", "With regard to expanding the OIG\u2019s authority to directly audit the Reserve Banks, we believe the inspector general can perform these functions while also retaining the ability to provide arm\u2019s length reviews of the Board\u2019s oversight processes. In an increasingly consolidated Federal Reserve System, retaining the Reserve Banks\u2019 general auditors to do systemwide reviews seems increasingly inappropriate. And reliance on DRBOPS to do such reviews leads to questions about the independent nature of such reviews, particularly since this division also sets policy for the Reserve Banks and has approval authority over certain Reserve Bank purchases and decisions. Such problems and questions could be resolved by expanding the OIG\u2019s authority and by taking steps to better ensure the independence of the Federal Reserve\u2019s internal audit function. In addition, centralizing reviews of Reserve Bank programs would make more apparent any overlapping and redundant reviews and would more clearly highlight areas receiving insufficient audit attention.", "Finally, we found no reason to suggest that having the Federal Reserve charge for its bank examinations would threaten our valuable dual banking system. Currently, the Federal Reserve is the only one of five federal regulators of depository institutions where taxpayers, and not the industry, bear the cost of supervision. As we noted in this report, the Federal Reserve supervises less than 1,000 state-member banks, or about 9 percent of all banks, and evidence from recent mergers indicates that state charters are being considered more desirable than national charters. The Federal Reserve could also take steps through arrangements with state banking regulators to reduce any undue competitive effects of charging for bank examinations. In addition, our recommendation is not meant to be limited to charging state-member banks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s response does not address charging for its other examinations\u2014those for foreign banks and bank-holding companies\u2014where the possibility of charter switching is not an issue."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
