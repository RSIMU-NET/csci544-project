The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002 (BPCA) expanded this provision to require FDA to take into account the adequacy of minority representation in pediatric exclusivity studies. BPCA also directed GAO to evaluate the representation of minorities in such studies. GAO examined the extent to which minority children are represented, whether drugs that treat diseases disproportionately affecting minority groups are studied under the provision, and FDA's monitoring of the representation of minority children in the studies. GAO reviewed related FDA documents, FDA requests for pediatric studies and final study results, and interviewed FDA officials and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Compared with the proportions of children from racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. population, smaller proportions of children from minority groups were included in the pediatric clinical drug studies requested by FDA before the enactment of BPCA that GAO reviewed. However, FDA required, and drug sponsors included, larger proportions of African American children in clinical studies for hypertension drugs because there is evidence that hypertension is more prevalent and more severe among African Americans. Furthermore, FDA has requested that forthcoming studies for certain drugs include larger proportions of minority children. Studies of some drugs that may be used to treat diseases or conditions that disproportionately affect minorities have been completed and additional such studies have been requested by FDA. From January 4, 2002, through March 6, 2003, FDA granted additional exclusive marketing rights to four drugs that may be used to treat conditions such as hypertension, type II diabetes, and sickle cell anemia--conditions or diseases that disproportionately affect minority children. During that time, FDA also issued written requests for studies of six drugs for these conditions. FDA does not have a system in place to serve as a single source of data to allow the agency to efficiently determine the extent of participation of children by racial and ethnic group under the pediatric exclusivity provision. GAO found that some study reports submitted to FDA from drug sponsors did not specify the race and ethnicity of all study participants. Across all the studies for drugs granted additional exclusive marketing rights that GAO reviewed, 86 percent of study participants were identifiable by race or ethnicity, but the race or ethnicity of 14 percent of study participants was unknown. In January 2003, FDA issued draft guidance recommending that drug sponsors use standard definitions for race and ethnicity in drug studies. However, drug sponsors are not required to use these definitions. FDA has also begun to develop an agency-wide system to monitor demographic characteristics of study participants, such as age, sex, and race. FDA agreed with the GAO recommendation to specify the categories that sponsors should use to report minority representation as well as GAO's findings regarding the efficiency of its data collection systems. FDA expressed concerns about the GAO comparison of the proportion of minorities in drug studies to their proportion in the U.S. population. However, FDA had previously used the methodology GAO employed in its analyses of adult study participants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["While children can be stricken with many of the same diseases afflicting  adults and are often treated with the same drugs, only about one-third of  drugs in use today have been studied and labeled for pediatric use. A drug  used to treat children that has not been tested or labeled for pediatric use  may place children at risk of under- or overdosing, and when age- appropriate formulations of the drugs do not exist, such as liquids or  chewable tablets, the drug may be improperly administered to children. To  help address these concerns, in 1997 Congress passed a law that gives  sponsors 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights for their  products in return for conducting clinical drug studies in children,  commonly known as the pediatric exclusivity provision. The Food and  Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency that approves drugs for  marketing, is responsible for administering the law and has procedures for  ensuring the study of drugs in pediatric patients. Specifically, if FDA  officials believe that studying a drug may lead to health benefits for  children, FDA issues a formal \u201cwritten request\u201d for clinical drug studies in  pediatric patients to the drug sponsor. If the sponsor agrees to comply  with the terms of the written request and submits final study results to  FDA that meet the terms of the request, FDA will grant the sponsor 6  months of additional exclusive marketing rights.

Although  FDA has requested race and ethnicity data on subjects in clinical drug  trials, no formal evaluations have assessed the extent to which children of  different racial and ethnic groups are represented in clinical studies of  new drugs, thus the extent to which these drugs have been tested on  children in minority groups is unknown. Concern exists that if children  from racial and ethnic minority groups are not included in adequate  numbers in clinical studies of drugs, the administration of the drugs to  children in these groups may result in atypical responses or unexpected  side effects. In addition, no formal evaluations have assessed the extent to  which drugs that were studied under the pediatric exclusivity provision  may be used to treat diseases or conditions that disproportionately affect  minority children.", "To ensure that children of racial and ethnic minority groups are included  in clinical studies for new drugs, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children  Act of 2002 (BPCA) expanded the pediatric exclusivity provision to  require, among other things, that FDA \u201ctake into account adequate  representation\u201d of children from racial and ethnic minority groups when  negotiating written protocols with the study sponsors of pediatric drugs.  In addition, the act required that we study the adequacy of minority  representation in studies covered by the pediatric exclusivity provision. As  agreed with the committees of jurisdiction, we addressed the following  questions: (1) to what extent are children of racial and ethnic minority  groups represented in clinical studies for drugs granted exclusive  marketing rights, (2) are drugs that are used to treat diseases that  disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups being studied  for safety and effectiveness in children under the pediatric exclusivity  provision, and (3) does FDA have appropriate management systems to  monitor the representation of children of racial and ethnic groups in  studies submitted for additional exclusive marketing rights?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed recently completed and requested  pediatric studies for inclusion of children from racial and ethnic minority  groups and FDA\u2019s data systems, regulations, and guidance used to  implement the pediatric exclusivity provision. To quantify the  participation of racial and ethnic groups in completed pediatric clinical  studies, we reviewed FDA pediatric study documents and collected data  about racial and ethnic group representation in study participants for the  23 drugs that were granted additional exclusive marketing rights during  the period January 4, 2002, through March 6, 2003. All of the studies for  these drugs had been requested by FDA before BPCA took effect on  January 4, 2002, and thus were not subject to the expanded pediatric  exclusivity provisions under the law. The time lag between an FDA written  request and a sponsor\u2019s submission of final study results ranges from 1 to  4 years. To determine the representation and reporting requirements that  FDA required drug sponsors to follow concerning the participation of  racial and ethnic minorities in pediatric studies since BPCA took effect,  we reviewed the 22 written requests for pediatric drug studies that FDA  issued from January 4, 2002, through March 6, 2003. To determine if drugs  used to treat conditions disproportionately affecting minorities are being  studied, we obtained data on the prevalence of selected diseases or  conditions that disproportionately affect minorities. We then examined the  list of drugs for which FDA had either issued study requests or granted  additional exclusive marketing rights from January 4, 2002, through   March 6, 2003, to determine if any of the drugs may be used to treat these  diseases or conditions. To evaluate FDA\u2019s monitoring of data on  demographic traits, such as race, in drug studies, we reviewed relevant  documents and interviewed FDA officials. We also interviewed  pharmacology experts and pediatric clinicians, including members of the  American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pharmaceutical Research and  Manufacturers of America.

A sponsor may submit a proposal to  FDA to conduct drug studies. If FDA officials believe that studying a drug  may produce health benefits for children, FDA issues a formal written  request to the drug sponsor that includes, among other things, the type of  studies to be conducted, the study design and goals, and the formulations  and age groups to be studied. As of March 31, 2003, FDA had issued 272  written requests for pediatric studies. Of these, 220 were issued in  response to sponsors\u2019 proposals. FDA may issue a written request without  the sponsor\u2019s proposal if FDA identifies a need for pediatric data. FDA has  issued 52 written requests without sponsors\u2019 proposals. A written request  may require more than 1 study of a drug; the 272 requests covered 631  studies, and could involve more than 37,150 pediatric patient participants  if they were all completed. Regardless of the final study results, if FDA  determines that the data submitted fairly responds to the written request  and the studies were conducted properly, it will grant the sponsor 6  months of additional exclusive marketing rights. From enactment of the  pediatric exclusivity provision in 1997 through April 30, 2003, FDA granted  an additional 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights for 74  drugs. Sponsors are not required to include minority children in studies for  pediatric exclusivity.", "Findings from these studies have led to labeling changes for pediatric use  for 50 drugs. For example, a study of fluoxetine (an antidepressant)  confirmed its effectiveness to treat major depressive disorders in children  8 to 17 years of age and obsessive-compulsive disorder in children 7 to 17  years of age. In addition, studies for a new asthma drug\u2014montelukast\u2014 led to new information on dosing and a new oral formulation permitting its  use in children from the ages of 12 months to 5 years.", "FDA also has a process in place to encourage pediatric studies of drugs  that manufacturers choose not to conduct. For drugs on which the patent  or exclusive marketing rights have expired, commonly referred to as off- patent drugs, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in collaboration with  FDA annually develop a list of drugs for which pediatric studies are  needed and publish it in the Federal Register. FDA may select a drug from  this list, issue a written request to the manufacturer that holds the  approved application for the drug, and, if the manufacturer does not  respond within 30 days, forward the written request to NIH to issue a  contract to conduct the study. In fiscal year 2003, HHS announced that  NIH would set aside $25 million from its budget to conduct pediatric  studies of off-patent drugs from this list. Similarly, if FDA issues a written  request for a drug that is on-patent but the drug sponsor declines to test  the drug in children, FDA can ask the Foundation for the National  Institutes of Health, which supports the mission of NIH, to test the drug  with funds raised from the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence Shows That Drug Effectiveness and Toxicity Can Vary among Racial and Ethnic Groups", "paragraphs": ["An important reason to include minorities in pediatric drug studies is to  examine the effect of race or ethnicity on the disposition and effects of  drugs in children. In adults, the activity of some drug-metabolizing  enzymes varies with race or ethnicity. For example, one commonly  prescribed drug used to treat gastric conditions, esomeprazole (Nexium),  is partly metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme. Studies have shown that  from 15 to 20 percent of Asians lack the enzyme CYP2C19. As a result,  some Asians metabolize the drug poorly and require lower doses because  their bodies do not clear the drug as rapidly as individuals with this  enzyme. Also, compared with Caucasians, certain Asian groups are more  likely to require lower dosages of a variety of different antipsychotic drugs  used to treat mental illness.", "Research in adults over the past several decades has further characterized  significant differences among racial and ethnic groups in the metabolism,  clinical effectiveness, and side-effect profiles of many clinically important  drugs. These differences in response to drug therapy can be traced to  differences in the distribution of genetic traits that produce these  differences among racial and ethnic groups. These naturally occurring  variations in the structures of genes, drug metabolism enzymes, receptor  proteins, and other proteins that are involved in drug response affect how  the body metabolizes certain drugs, including cardiovascular agents (beta- blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin coverting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and central nervous system agents  (antidepressants and antipsychotics)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Efforts to Account for Minority Children in Clinical Drug Studies", "paragraphs": ["BPCA requires that FDA take into account adequate representation of  children from ethnic and racial minority groups when issuing written  requests to drug sponsors.

However, the clinical  studies included in the NDAs or sNDAs submitted during this period were  conducted before the effective date for the Best Pharmaceuticals for  Children Act of 2002 because the time lag between when FDA issues a  written request for a pediatric study and when sponsors submit final study  results ranged from 1 to 4 years. To assess the extent to which FDA  required drug sponsors to take into account the adequate representation  of children of racial and ethnic groups in clinical studies for drugs for  which written requests have been issued since BPCA took effect, we  reviewed the 22 written requests issued for pediatric drug studies by FDA  from January 4, 2002, through March 6, 2003.", "To determine whether drugs used to treat conditions or diseases  disproportionately affecting minorities are being studied under the  pediatric exclusivity provision, we obtained data on the prevalence of  selected diseases or conditions that disproportionately affect minorities  and examined the list of drugs for which FDA has either granted exclusive  marketing rights or issued study requests from January 4, 2002, through  March 6, 2003, to determine if any of these drugs may be used to treat  these diseases or conditions. We compiled data on the estimated  prevalence of the diseases and conditions by race and ethnicity from the  National Centers for Health Statistics, National Center of HIV, STD, and  Tuberculosis Prevention, and research in scientific journals reporting the  prevalence of these diseases and conditions in minority children. We  interviewed National Institutes of Health officials, pharmacology experts,  and pediatric clinicians, including members of the American Academy of  Pediatrics and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of  America to gain their perspectives on the representation of minorities in  drug studies and the study of drugs of importance to these populations.", "To evaluate FDA\u2019s management of pediatric clinical study data on minority  representation and its guidance to sponsors on reporting such data, we  reviewed FDA\u2019s policies, guidance, and rules for inclusion and reporting of  minority representation in drug studies. We interviewed FDA officials  within the Office of Counter-Terrorism and Pediatric Drug Development to  determine how they interpret and implement these policies for the  pediatric exclusivity program. We spoke with officials in the Office of  Women\u2019s Health who were responsible for establishing a database to  monitor demographic variables to determine how an agencywide  demographic database might affect the monitoring of minority  participation in drug studies. We also reviewed FDA\u2019s response to a  congressional request to develop an agencywide demographic database.", "We conducted our work from October 2002 through September 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The Number of Children by Racial and Ethnic Group in Studies for Drugs Granted Exclusive Marketing Rights", "paragraphs": ["We obtained the number of children by race or ethnic group who  participated in the clinical drug studies for the 23 NDAs or sNDAs for  exclusive marketing rights in our sample by reviewing the portions of final  study reports that provide information on the demographic representation  in the study.
