Most of these children were from Central America. GAO found that ORR was initially unprepared to care for that many children; however, the agency increased its bed capacity to accommodate up to 10,000 children at a time. Given the unprecedented demand for capacity in 2014, ORR developed a plan to help prepare it to meet fiscal year 2015 needs. The number of children needing ORR's care declined significantly through most of fiscal year 2015, but began increasing again toward the end of the summer. Given the inherent uncertainties associated with planning for capacity needs, ORR's lack of a process for annually updating and documenting its plan inhibits its ability to balance preparations for anticipated needs while minimizing excess capacity.", "ORR relies on grantees to provide care for unaccompanied children, including housing and educational, medical, and therapeutic services. GAO's review of a sample of children's case files found that they often did not contain required documents, making it difficult to verify that all required services were provided. ORR revised its on-site monitoring program in 2014 to ensure better coverage of grantees. However, ORR was not able to complete all the visits it planned for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, citing lack of resources. By not monitoring its grantees consistently, ORR may not be able to identify areas where children's care is not provided in accordance with ORR policies and the agreements with grantees.", "ORR grantees conduct various background checks on potential sponsors prior to releasing children to them. These potential sponsors are identified and screened by the grantees as part of their responsibilities for the unaccompanied children in their care. The extent of the checks conducted depends on the relationship of the sponsor to the child. Between January 2014 and April 2015, ORR released about 50,000 children from Central America to sponsors to await their immigration hearings. In nearly 90 percent of these cases, the sponsors were a parent or other close relative already residing in the United States. Sponsors do not need to have legal U.S. residency status.", "There is limited information available on post-release services provided to children after they leave ORR care. In part, this is because ORR is only required to provide services to a small percentage of children, such as those who were victims of trafficking. In May 2015, ORR established a National Call Center to assist children who may be facing placement disruptions, making post-release services available to some of them. Also, in August 2015, ORR began requiring well-being follow-up calls to all children 30 days after their release. ORR is collecting information through these new initiatives, but does not currently have a process to ensure that the data are reliable, systematically collected, or compiled in summary form. Service providers GAO spoke with also noted that some of these children may have difficultly accessing services due to the lack of bilingual services in the community, lack of health insurance, or other barriers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS (1) develop a process to regularly update its capacity plan, (2) improve its monitoring of grantees, and (3) develop processes to ensure its post-release activities provide reliable and useful summary data.

In particular, the number of unaccompanied children from three  Central American countries\u2014El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras\u2014 has increased dramatically. Many traveled hundreds or thousands of  miles under dangerous conditions, such as atop trains or on foot through  deserts, to reach the U.S. border.

There are reports that the increase has also created challenges  for the communities in which these children are eventually placed. You  asked us to review ORR\u2019s response to the increasing number of  unaccompanied children. This report addresses the following questions:  (1) how ORR has responded to the increased number of unaccompanied  children, (2) how these children are cared for while in ORR custody and  how ORR monitors their care, (3) how ORR identifies and screens  sponsors before children are transferred to their care, and (4) what is  known about services, challenges, and the status of removal proceedings  for children after they leave ORR custody?", "To address these questions, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations, annual reports to Congress, budget justifications, and other  ORR policy documents. In addition, we interviewed ORR and HHS  officials. To address how ORR responded to the increased number of  unaccompanied children, we reviewed ORR\u2019s funding opportunity  announcements and relevant planning documents. We also reviewed a  plan that was developed by an interagency group, called the Unified  Coordination Group, led by DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management  Agency and established to coordinate the federal response to the  increase of unaccompanied children apprehended at the southwest  border. To gather information about how children were cared for while in  ORR custody, we analyzed information from ORR\u2019s web-based portal, a  database that contains intake, placement, and sponsor information, as  well as individual service plans for these children. We analyzed  information for children admitted to and discharged from ORR\u2019s care  between January 7, 2014, when ORR began using the portal, and April  17, 2015. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the data for  erroneous dates, reviewed ORR business rules to ensure data reliability,  and interviewed ORR officials and contractors knowledgeable about the  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We also visited nine ORR facilities in three  states\u2014New York, Texas, and Virginia\u2014to observe areas where children  are housed and receive educational, medical, and recreational services,  and while at these sites we interviewed ORR grantee staff. These states  were selected for variation in the types of care provided by ORR  grantees, shelter size, and location.

We also  discussed monitoring with grantees\u2019 staff during site visits. Lastly, to learn  what is known about these children once they leave ORR\u2019s custody, we  conducted phone interviews with individuals representing local entities  such as school districts and human services agencies and organizations  in six counties where 50 or more children have been released to sponsors  in fiscal year 2014. The counties include Fairfax County, Virginia; Harris  County, Texas; Nobles County, Minnesota; Pulaski County, Arkansas;  San Mateo County, California; and Scott County, Mississippi. These  counties were selected to represent a diversity of size, geographic  location, and demographics. Additionally, we analyzed Department of  Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) data and  interviewed relevant officials from that office as well. To assess the  reliability of EOIR data we reviewed related documentation and  interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data. We also spoke with  DHS officials.

In  particular, the decision to migrate to the United States is also influenced  by a desire for family reunification, educational opportunities, perception  of U.S. immigration policy, and the role of smuggling networks that  encourage migration.

The children remain in the custody of the federal government throughout  their stay in ORR care, but are in the physical custody of ORR residential  care providers (see fig. 1). ORR solicits residential care providers,  referred to as grantees in this report, through funding opportunity  announcements, and funds these grantees through 3-year cooperative  agreements. When making funding decisions, ORR evaluates  applications against a set of established criteria.

Transitional foster care is short term care that is designed  for children under the age of 13, sibling groups with one sibling under  the age of 13, pregnant and parenting teens, and children with special  needs. Long-term foster care is designed for children who ORR  expects to be eligible for immigration relief and who are expected to  have an extended stay within the ORR system, for example trafficking  victims or orphaned children. Therapeutic foster care is for  unaccompanied children whose exceptional needs cannot be met in  regular family foster care homes and consists of intensive supportive and  clinical services in the homes of specially trained foster parents. Foster  family homes must be licensed according to their state\u2019s licensing  regulations. Foster care placements are the least restrictive  placement option in the ORR continuum.", "Staff-secure shelters.

ORR officials said that prior to 2014, ORR\u2019s shelter  capacity was based on the number of children referred to its care in  previous years. The new capacity framework provides bed capacity  based on two possible scenarios: (1) a baseline scenario similar to fiscal  year 2014 in which about 58,000 children would be served during fiscal  year 2015, and (2) a surge scenario that can serve 104,000 children over  the fiscal year.

In mid-August 2015, ORR had  5,500 children in its care and approximately 7,800 available beds. ORR  officials told us that information it received from DHS and the Department  of State through its work with the Unified Coordination Group suggest that  the rate of referrals will remain steady or increase in fiscal year 2016.

The  bed capacity framework it developed for fiscal year 2015 included plans  and steps to manage its capacity and ORR officials said they continue to  use it as a roadmap. However, they have not updated this framework for  fiscal year 2016 and have not established a systematic approach to  update their framework on an annual basis to account for new information  so that it remains current and relevant to changing conditions. For  example, adjustments may be warranted for baseline and alternative  scenarios that influence plans for bed capacity. According to federal  standards for internal control, an agency\u2019s processes for decision making  should be relevant to changing conditions and completely and accurately  documented.

According to ORR documents, during on-site  monitoring visits, ORR project officers spend a week at facilities touring,  reviewing children\u2019s case files and personnel files, and interviewing  children and staff. Additionally, prior to visiting the facilities, ORR  guidance directs project officers to review quarterly reports, recent audit  reports, organization charts, grant applications and agreements, facility  leases, safety and sanitation certificates, and other items. They are also  to consult with other ORR staff who work with grantees. Also, according  to ORR, on-site monitoring typically includes a review of a random  sample of case files for children cared for at a facility. ORR officials noted  that, in addition to on-site monitoring, they monitor grantees in other  ways, such as desk monitoring where project officers, review, among  other things, significant incident, quarterly reports, and obtain feedback  from facility staff. Additionally, according to ORR officials, ORR field  staff\u2014contract field specialists and federal field specialists\u2014provide  oversight and work directly with facility staff.

However, our review of  data provided by the agency found that many facilities went several years  without receiving a monitoring visit. For example, ORR did not visit 15  facilities for as many as 7 years. ORR officials acknowledged that some  facilities went many years without on-site monitoring and attributed it to  lack of staff resources. The officials noted that in 2009, four project  officers were responsible for 45 facilities, as well as other tasks. By 2013,  although the number of facilities had increased, there were two project  officers responsible for on-site monitoring.", "In 2014, ORR implemented a biennial on-site monitoring program, hiring  new project officers whose sole responsibility is to provide on-site  monitoring of all of its facilities. Nevertheless, ORR did not meet its goal  to visit all of its facilities by the end of fiscal year 2015. ORR officials said  they rescheduled some monitoring visits because of limited resources  and administrative challenges, such as limited travel funds. In fiscal year  2014, project officers visited 12 of 133 facilities, and by August of fiscal  year 2015, they completed 22 of 29 scheduled visits to 140 facilities. ORR  rescheduled 11 other monitoring visits from fiscal 2015 to 2016, bringing  the total number of visits scheduled for 2016 to 70. Given ORR\u2019s recent  history, its ability to visit 70 facilities in a single year is uncertain.  According to standards for internal control, management should establish  and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system  and evaluate the results. Monitoring generally should be designed to  assure that it is ongoing and occurs in the course of normal operations, is  performed continually, and is ingrained in the agency\u2019s operations.", "In addition to ORR\u2019s scheduled onsite monitoring, officials said that  project officers occasionally visited facilities out of cycle. However, they  did not use specific criteria to determine when out-of-cycle visits were  warranted. Instead, they assessed facility risks on a case-by-case basis.  According to ORR officials, as part of ORR\u2019s desk monitoring of facilities,  project officers looked for patterns that indicated a possible lack of  oversight by facility staff, such as an increase in significant incident  reports, and the need for a monitoring visit. Officials said that staff were  more likely to provide technical assistance or schedule a 1-day site visit,  rather than a week-long on-site monitoring visit. During fiscal year 2015,  ORR officials said that they scheduled one out-of-cycle visit after an  unaccompanied child ran away from a facility under unclear  circumstances.", "Monitoring visits are intended to provide an opportunity to identify  program deficiencies or areas where programs are failing to comply with  ORR policies. For example, according to ORR site visit monitoring reports  that we reviewed, during two separate visits to one facility project officers  found that facility staff had failed to medicate children properly, including,  in one instance, accidental overdoses of medicine. At another facility,  children informed ORR staff that they were not meeting regularly with  their case managers. All of the monitoring reports that we reviewed  included findings that were gleaned from case file reviews about grantees  failing to document services. Project officers prepare monitoring reports,  citing remedial steps or corrective actions that programs must take to  comply with ORR policies. According to ORR officials, in 2014, grantees  typically implemented corrective actions within 30 days of receiving notice  of a program deficiency.

In addition to the day-to-day care that grantees  provided to children, facilities\u2019 staff are responsible for identifying and  screening potential sponsors. During the initial intake process, case  managers ask children about potential sponsors with whom they hope to  reunite. Within 24 hours of identifying potential sponsors, case managers  are required to send them a Family Reunification Application to complete.  The application includes questions about the sponsor and other people  living in the sponsor\u2019s home, including whether anyone in the household  has a contagious disease or criminal history. Additionally, the application  asks for information about who will care for the child if the sponsor is  required to leave the United States or becomes unable to provide care.  Sponsors also are asked to provide documents to establish their identity  and relationship to a child. The manner in which grantees screen the  sponsor varies based on the sponsor\u2019s relationship to the child (see table  5). The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act requires home  studies in cases in which it is determined that the child is a victim of a  trafficking; the child has a disability as defined by the Americans with  Disabilities Act; the child has been a victim of physical or sexual abuse  significantly affecting their health or welfare; or the child\u2019s sponsor clearly  presents a risk of abuse, maltreatment, exploitation or trafficking to the  child. In addition, ORR policy requires home studies in cases where the  sponsor is a non-relative and a child is 12 years old or younger, the  individual is seeking to sponsor multiple children to whom he or she is not  related, or as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act.

According to ORR, in these cases, post- release services last, on average, a year to a year and a half.", "Although ORR provides post-release services to a small percentage of  children after they leave its care, the office has recently taken several  steps to expand access to services to children. For example, according to  ORR officials, the agency recently expanded the eligibility criteria for post- release services to include all children released to a non-relative or  distant relative. In addition, on May 15, 2015, ORR began operating a  National Call Center help-line. Children who contact ORR\u2019s National  Call Center within 180 days of release who have experienced or are at  risk of experiencing a placement disruption are also now eligible for post- release services according to ORR officials. In its first month of operation,  ORR officials stated that the call center received 25 calls from children  and sponsors related to placements that had been disrupted or were in  danger of becoming disrupted. Lastly, in August 2015, ORR instituted a  new policy requiring facility staff to place follow-up calls to all children and  their sponsors after the children are released. The purpose of these calls  is to determine whether the children are still living with their sponsors,  enrolled in or attending school, aware of upcoming removal proceedings,  and safe. ORR guidance requires the \u201cSafety and Well Being\u201d calls to  occur 30 days after the children are released from ORR care to sponsors.  Staff are required to make a \u201creasonable effort\u201d to contact the children  and document the results of the call in the children\u2019s case files. Facilities  are also required to submit a tracking report to ORR monthly to document  these follow-up calls. In cases in which additional services are needed,  the case manager will refer the child and sponsor to ORR\u2019s National Call  Center. In cases in which the child is believed to be unsafe, ORR\u2019s policy  requires that the case manager comply with mandatory reporting laws,  state licensing requirements, and federal laws and regulations regarding  reporting to child protective agencies and law enforcement.", "ORR officials told us these policy changes were made as a result of an  overall review of ORR policies, including those related to post-release  services.

However, ORR does not have  processes to ensure that all of these data are reliable, systematically  collected, and compiled in summary form to provide useful information  about this population for its use and for other government agencies.  Regarding post-release services, as noted previously, ORR officials had  not confirmed that data provided on the number of children served by  their grantees were reliable and had not compiled or summarized  information on post-release services. In addition, ORR officials told us  that reports on post-release services are not currently entered in ORR\u2019s  web-based database; although they said they had plans to incorporate  this information into the database in the future. Because post-release  information is currently stored in grantees\u2019 individual quarterly program  performance reports, it is difficult to compile and summarize. Regarding  the National Call Center, ORR officials said they did not have a process in  place for systematically summarizing information collected from these  calls. According to ORR officials, for the National Call Center that began  operation in May 2015, ORR receives weekly and monthly reports from  the contractor operating the call center with information on calls related to  child abuse and neglect; placement disruptions; domestic violence; and  children who have run away from their sponsors. ORR officials told us  that they plan to analyze the call center data for trends, but as of October  2015, they had not yet begun to do so.

Local service providers we spoke with in six counties told us  that the children\u2019s status would have no effect on eligibility for many of the  services they provide. For example, school districts are required to  educate students regardless of their immigration status. Similarly  unaccompanied children were not precluded from receiving services at  health clinics we spoke with.", "Overall, the level of awareness about, and services available to,  unaccompanied children varied across the jurisdictions we spoke with.  For example, in two of the counties in which we conducted phone  interviews, representatives from mayors\u2019 offices told us that they were  unaware that unaccompanied children were living in their city or had  limited knowledge about the issue. However, in another jurisdiction we  visited, the mayor\u2019s office had established a working group related to  unaccompanied children that included representatives from several city  departments and nonprofits. In this city, representatives from the health  and education departments regularly attended immigration court to  screen and enroll children in the state\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program and to help with school enrollment.", "In some locations, non-profit organizations work specifically with  unaccompanied children, providing legal, medical, or other services. In  one community, we spoke with a staff member at a nonprofit organization  that provides services to unaccompanied children from Central America,  such as case management, individual and family counseling, support  group services, and educational services. This organization also has  other programs that serve unaccompanied children, along with other at- risk children, that focus on gang prevention and intervention services.  Program staff told us they receive the bulk of their referrals from gang  prevention coordinators and school social workers, but also receive  referrals from courts, mental health counselors, and parents. Program  staff told us the program is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the number of recently  immigrated youth referred to it. Unaccompanied children may also receive  some services through local or national nonprofit organizations that other  children without lawful immigration status do not.

For example, representatives we  spoke with in four of the six school districts, as well as representatives  from a County Office of Education, discussed the mental and behavioral  health needs of these children and several noted barriers to meeting  these children\u2019s needs. We were also told by seven local service  providers who worked with these children that they had previous  exposure to violence and trauma. Four local service providers noted that  in some cases children have experienced challenges related to  reunification with parents they had not seen for many years. Six service  providers said that these factors could contribute to behavioral and  mental health needs or make them more susceptible to gang recruitment  and trafficking.", "A staff member in a local health clinic and a school district official told us  that some children disclosed harrowing stories of their journeys to the  United States, including incidents such as being tied to a tree for several  days, experiencing a sexual assault, and watching a fellow train rider\u2019s  execution by beheading. One health care provider estimated that about  50 percent of unaccompanied children he served required mental health  services. Some counties reported challenges attracting bilingual  professionals, such as mental health providers, making it difficult for these  children to obtain needed services. Officials we spoke with in five of the  six school districts also noted that newly arrived children from Central  America\u2014many of whom may have been unaccompanied\u2014often have  limited or disrupted educational histories and face language barriers.  Officials from four of these school districts said that these issues can  make academic achievement or graduation challenging. According to  officials we spoke with, state and local requirements may also create  barriers for unaccompanied children. Officials we spoke with in one  county told us that non-parental sponsors lack the rights of a parent or  legal custodian under state law. In this county, such sponsors must apply  for legal custodianship in court. However, until they have obtained  custodianship, it can be difficult to enroll children in school or access  health services for them, according to court and social service agency  officials in this county.", "Unaccompanied children also face barriers similar to those faced by other  children without lawful immigration status. Staff we spoke with at all three  of the clinics, as well as other local agency officials told us that lack of  health insurance, lack of knowledge about where to seek services, and/or  fear of disclosing their immigration status made it challenging to access  certain health care services and other services. Staff at the three clinics  and local agency officials in one county told us that lack of health  insurance made obtaining some health care services especially difficult,  such as dental care and care for more specialized health needs, which  tend to be more expensive and not available through local clinics.  Officials in two school districts told us that finding teachers who are  bilingual or teach English as a second language was a challenge for them  and ensuring that they had appropriate personnel to serve these children  was therefore difficult. However, officials in some school districts we  spoke with appeared to have more resources available to serve these  students. Specifically, one official we spoke with said the school district  was establishing a \u201cnewcomers division\u201d within its Multilingual Education  Department, which would serve newly arrived immigrant students\u2014 including formerly unaccompanied children.

Upon apprehension by DHS,  unaccompanied children are given a Notice to Appear before EOIR for  removal proceedings. During these proceedings, EOIR\u2019s immigration  judges, who are located in courts around the country, decide whether the  child is removable from the United States and, if so, whether he or she is  eligible for relief or protection from removal. In 2007, EOIR issued  guidance for immigration judges concerning cases involving  unaccompanied children, which sets out basic principles that immigration  judges should use in court proceedings. These include employing child- sensitive procedures and how the best interest of the child should be  taken into account in the context of the judge\u2019s discretion. In addition,  ORR requires sponsors to ensure that children attend their removal  proceedings.", "An unaccompanied child who is in removal proceedings could apply for  various types of lawful immigration status with DHS\u2019s U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services (USCIS), including asylum and Special  Immigration Juvenile (SIJ) status. USCIS\u2019s asylum officers have initial  jurisdiction of any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied child,  even where such child is in removal proceedings. If, for example, an  unaccompanied child intends to apply for asylum with USCIS, an  immigration judge may administratively close (i.e., temporarily remove the  case from the immigration judge\u2019s calendar) or continue the removal  proceeding pending the adjudication of the asylum application with  USCIS. According to EOIR officials, administrative closure does not grant  the child lawful immigration status, but the child is not at risk of removal  while the proceeding is closed. In general, an individual is eligible for  asylum if he or she (1) applies from within the United States; (2) suffered  past persecution, or has a well-founded fear of future persecution, based  on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or  political opinion; and (3) is not statutorily barred from applying for or being  granted asylum. If USCIS determines that the unaccompanied child is  ineligible for asylum and does not otherwise have lawful immigration  status in the United States, USCIS asylum officers refer the asylum  application for review by an immigration judge, who will reopen the case  and reinitiate the child\u2019s removal proceedings. In addition to asylum,  unaccompanied children may seek to apply for SIJ status through USCIS,  which is designed to help immigrant children who have been abused,  abandoned, or neglected. According to USCIS, certain children who are  unable to be reunited with a parent can obtain lawful permanent resident  (or green card) status as a SIJ, and children who obtain a green card  through the SIJ program can live and work permanently in the United  States. To be eligible for SIJ status, among other things, a child must be  declared dependent on a state court or such court must decide to legally  place the child with a state agency, or an individual or entity appointed by  a state or juvenile court; it must be determined not in the best interests of  the child to be returned to his or her home country; and it must be that  reunification of the child with a parent is not viable due to abuse, neglect,  abandonment, or a similar basis found under state law. Once an  unaccompanied child has met all the eligibility requirements for SIJ  status, he or she must then file for adjustment of status to receive an SIJ- based green card.", "In July 2015, the Associate Director of the Refugee, Asylum and  International Operations Directorate at USCIS testified that USCIS has  received increasing numbers of asylum applications from unaccompanied  children in recent years and, in particular, from fiscal years 2012 through  2014. Specifically, the Associate Director testified that USCIS received  534 asylum applications from unaccompanied children who were  apprehended in fiscal year 2011 as compared to 6,990 asylum  applications from such children who were apprehended in fiscal year  2014. In addition, according to USCIS, when compared to the number of  unaccompanied children apprehended annually over the 2011 through  2014 time period, the percent of children applying for asylum with USCIS  has also increased (from 3 percent in fiscal year 2011 to 10 percent in  fiscal year 2014). Further, the Associate Director testified that since fiscal  year 2009, USCIS granted asylum to unaccompanied children at a rate of  42.6 percent (according to USCIS, the overall rate at which all new  asylum applicants with USCIS were granted asylum was 41 percent).  From fiscal year 2009 through May 31, 2015, USCIS\u2019s testimony  statement indicated that 92 percent of the unaccompanied children who  applied for asylum with USCIS were from El Salvador, Guatemala, or  Honduras.", "If unaccompanied children have not yet sought, or are not granted,  certain immigration benefits within the jurisdiction of USCIS, there are  several other possible outcomes, and various forms of relief that may be  available to them during immigration proceedings.

With this information, EOIR began using a specific code in its automated  case management system to identify unaccompanied children.  According to EOIR data, from July 18, 2014, through July 14, 2015, DHS  initiated more than 35,000 removal proceedings for unaccompanied  children. Of these 35,000 removal proceedings, EOIR data indicate that  as of July 14, 2015, an immigration judge issued an initial decision in  nearly 13,000 proceedings (or 36 percent). Of those 13,000 decisions,  about 7,000 (or 55 percent) resulted in a removal order for the  unaccompanied child. According to EOIR data, about 6,100 (or 88  percent) of those initial decisions that resulted in removal orders were  issued in absentia, which is when a child fails to appear in court for their  removal proceedings and the immigration judge conducts the proceeding  in the child\u2019s absence. However, a judge\u2019s initial decision does not  necessarily indicate the end of the removal proceedings. For example,  cases that are administratively closed can be reopened, and new charges  may be filed in cases that are terminated. In addition, children who  receive a removal order in absentia, and with respect to whom a motion  to reopen their case has been properly filed, are granted a stay of  removal pending a decision on the motion by the immigration judge.  Moreover, a child may seek to appeal a removal order; thus, it is unclear  from the data pertaining to orders of removal whether such orders were  deemed administratively final as a result of all avenues for appeal with  EOIR to remain in the United States being exhausted or waived.  Overall, according to ICE data, from fiscal year 2010 through August 15,  2015, based on final orders of removal, ICE removed 10,766  unaccompanied children, 6,751 of whom were from El Salvador,  Guatemala, or Honduras.

However, the number of referrals began increasing towards the end of the  summer and has remained high through the beginning of what is typically  ORR\u2019s \u201clow\u201d season. Although ORR may not be able to predict the exact  number of facilities and beds needed in any given year, developing a  process for updating its bed capacity framework on an annual basis may  help ensure an adequate response while minimizing the use of federal  funds and provide documentation of its analysis and decisions in support  of its capacity levels.", "In addition, ORR brought new grantees online quickly and increased the  number of its staff responsible for monitoring these grantees. Now, ORR  has to determine how best to leverage its resources and use its staff to  monitor these grantees. Grantees provide care and services to  unaccompanied children, many of whom have been exposed to trauma  and violence and travelled great lengths to get to the United States. It is  important that grantees comply with ORR\u2019s policies to ensure these  children receive, among other things, medical, clinical and educational  services, and that children are quickly reunified with sponsors. However,  ORR does not regularly monitor its grantees, and cannot ensure that they  are providing these needed services and properly documenting them.  Lastly, in addition to many questions about the children\u2019s well-being and  whether they have access to needed services, there are questions about  their potential involvement with state child welfare services, and whether  these children will return to their country of origin or legally remain in the  United States. Although ORR has recently taken steps to gather more  information on the children once they are released, it does not have a  process to ensure that the data are reliable, systematically collected, and  summarized. While ORR is not required to gather this information, an  opportunity would be lost to help ORR and other government agencies  better understand and respond to issues related to unaccompanied  children if this information is not collected in a reliable and consistent  manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Health and  Human Services direct the Office of Refugee Resettlement to take the  following three actions:", "Develop a process to update its bed capacity framework on an annual  basis to include the most recent data related to numbers of  unaccompanied children who may be referred to its care and adjust its  planning scenarios that guide its bed capacity as appropriate.", "Review its monitoring program to ensure that onsite visits are  conducted in a timely manner, case files are systematically reviewed  as part of or separate from onsite visits, and that grantees properly  document the services they provide to children.", "Develop a process to ensure all information collected through its  existing post-release efforts are reliable and systematically collected  so that they can be compiled in summary form and provide useful  information to other entities internally and externally."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Health and  Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security, and Justice for review and  comment.

HHS agreed  to update its bed capacity framework annually. Additionally, HHS agreed  to improve its monitoring of grantees. HHS described several of its  monitoring efforts, for example day long site visits, desk monitoring, and  monthly reporting, which we discuss in the report, and stated that it has  created a new monitoring initiative workgroup to examine opportunities for  further improvement. These are all important efforts, but it is also  important for HHS to take steps to strengthen its most comprehensive  monitoring of grantees, its weeklong on-site monitoring, through timely  visits, systematic reviews of case files, and properly documenting  services provided to children. HHS also agreed to improve its data  collection process to provide more systematic and standardized  information on post-release services.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date.

In addition, we interviewed relevant ORR and HHS  officials and officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and  Justice.", "To address how ORR responded to the increased number of  unaccompanied children, we analyzed changes in the number of ORR\u2019s  grantees and ORR\u2019s average monthly bed capacity from fiscal year 2010  through 2015. We reviewed ORR documents, such as ORR\u2019s Bed  Capacity Framework for fiscal years 2015, funding opportunity  announcements, and other relevant planning documents. We also  reviewed a plan developed by the Unified Coordination Group and  interviewed ORR and ACF officials about the Unified Coordination  Group\u2019s activities. In addition, we reviewed ORR\u2019s policy guide for its  unaccompanied children program, updates to this guidance, and ORR\u2019s  schedule for additional policy updates.", "To gather information about how children were cared for while in ORR  custody, we analyzed information from ORR\u2019s web-based UAC portal for  children admitted to and discharged from ORR care between January 7,  2014, when ORR began using the portal, and April 17, 2015. This  database contains information such as children\u2019s date and country of  birth, intake, placement, and sponsor information, among other data. To  assess the reliability of these data, we conducted electronic testing of the  data, reviewed ORR business rules to ensure data reliability, and  interviewed ORR officials and contractors knowledgeable about the data.  We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also visited nine ORR facilities in three states\u2014New York, Texas, and  Virginia\u2014to interview ORR grantee staff. Locations were selected to  ensure variation in the types of care provided by ORR grantees, shelter  size, and location. We visited shelters, staff-secure shelters, secure  shelters, and transitional foster care providers. We also reviewed a  nongeneralizable random sample of 27 case files of children who were  released from the nine shelters we visited. This sample was generated  using alien identification numbers from data from ORR\u2019s UAC portal for all  children with a status of discharged and a valid discharge date. Each  case file was reviewed by two GAO analysts to assess the extent to  which documents required by the Flores Agreement and specific ORR  policies were present and complete. After both analysts reviewed the  files, they reconciled any differences between their reviews.", "To assess ORR\u2019s monitoring of its grantees, we reviewed ORR and  grantee documents, including monitoring schedules, reports, and  corrective actions. We also analyzed data provided by ORR on the  frequency of past monitoring and levels of staffing devoted to monitoring  activities. In addition, we discussed monitoring with grantees\u2019 staff during  site visits and with ORR officials.", "Lastly, to learn what is known about these children once they leave  ORR\u2019s custody, we conducted phone interviews with school districts and  other local government officials and nonprofit groups in 6 counties where  50 or more children were released to sponsors in fiscal year 2014. We  interviewed individuals representing 19 local entities including\u2014six school  districts, one county office of education, five human services agencies or  organizations, one county health system, one county executive\u2019s office,  one county juvenile court system, one mayor\u2019s office, and three local  health clinics. We also corresponded via email with a representative from  a second mayor\u2019s office. The counties include Fairfax County, VA; Harris  County, TX; Nobles County, MN; Pulaski County, AR; San Mateo County,  CA; and Scott County, MS. These counties were selected to represent a  diversity of size, geographic location, and demographics, including  variation in the size of the Latino population. We used publically available  ORR data on the number of children released to sponsors by county and  county demographic data from the United States Census Bureau to select  counties. We then obtained additional data on the cities within selected  counties children were being released to from ORR to select localities  within counties to contact. Separately, we conducted interviews with city  officials and nonprofit service providers in one of the cities in which we  conducted a site visit.", "We also analyzed Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for  Immigration Review (EOIR) data and interviewed relevant officials from  EOIR. To assess the reliability of EOIR data we reviewed related  documentation and interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data.  We also spoke with DHS officials. DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS) responded to written questions regarding the reliability of their  data.
