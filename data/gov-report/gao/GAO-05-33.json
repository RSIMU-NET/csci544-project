Within each of these mission areas, the strategy identifies \"major initiatives\" to be addressed. In all, the strategy cites 43 initiatives across the six mission areas.

All 43 of the initiatives were included in some of the planning or implementation activities of at least one of these six departments. Most of the initiatives (42 of the 43) also had departments identified as the lead agencies for their implementation, which helps to ensure accountability for implementation. However, many of these 42 initiatives had multiple lead agencies, indicating that interagency coordination of roles and activities will be important, particularly on those initiatives involving domestic counterterrorism and critical infrastructure protection. All of the initiatives were being implemented in fiscal year 2004 by at least one department. While GAO determined that implementation was occurring, it did not assess the status or quality of the various departments' implementation of the initiatives. While departments have incorporated these initiatives into their planning and implementation activity, the United States faces significant challenges in fully implementing the strategy in a coordinated and integrated manner. Some of the most difficult challenges being confronted are those that cut across the various critical mission areas, such as balancing homeland security funding needs with other national requirements, improving risk management methods for resource allocation and investments, developing adequate homeland security performance measures, developing a national enterprise architecture for homeland security, and clarifying the roles and responsibilities among the levels of government and the private sector. GAO has also identified a large diversity of other challenges in each of the six critical mission areas since September 11."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to increase homeland security following the September 11,  2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, President Bush issued the  National Strategy for Homeland Security in July 2002 and signed  legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in  November 2002. The strategy sets forth overall objectives to prevent  terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America\u2019s vulnerability  to terrorism, and minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from  attacks that may occur. To accomplish these overall objectives, the  strategy describes six critical mission areas and 43 initiatives. Since the  strategy was issued, the President has also issued additional documents\u2014 known as Homeland Security Presidential Directives (or HSPDs)\u2014that  provide more detailed guidance on the mission areas and initiatives. The  creation of DHS, which began operations in March 2003, represents a  fusion of 22 federal agencies to coordinate and centralize the leadership of  many homeland security activities under a single department. In addition  to DHS, the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Health and  Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), and State play an important role in  implementing the strategy. These six key departments represent 94  percent of proposed federal spending for homeland security in fiscal year  2005.", "With the strategy now more than 2 years old, and DHS more than a year  old, you asked that we review the implementation of the strategy and  organize our work by critical mission area. In response, we have    determined whether the initiatives in the strategy were being addressed  by the key department\u2019s strategic planning and related activities;  whether the initiatives had \u201clead\u201d agencies identified for their  implementation, and whether multiple departments were implementing  the initiatives in fiscal year 2004; and  identified homeland security challenges as reflected in our products  since September 11, 2001, by both mission area and issues that cut  across mission areas.", "This report establishes one framework from which to assess federal  department implementation of the National Strategy for Homeland  Security. Since agency homeland security activities are ongoing, this  report is intended to identify a baseline from which to assess progress  toward meeting homeland security objectives. In this report, we first  provide the proposed fiscal year 2005 homeland security-related budget by  mission area and department. Then, we discuss the homeland security  planning and implementation activities of the six departments under  review, as well as remaining homeland security challenges, by mission  area. The appendixes that follow provide more detailed assessments of  each of these sections and are also arranged by mission area. (See app. I  for more information on the scope and methodology.) Further, this report  should be considered in the context of several companion efforts to  provide baseline information. In February 2004, we testified on the desired  characteristics of national strategies and whether various strategies\u2014 including the National Strategy for Homeland Security\u2014contained those  desired characteristics. In March, we summarized strategic homeland  security recommendations made by congressionally chartered  commissions and us. We organized this analysis by critical mission area,  as defined in the strategy. In July, we reported on our recommendations to  DHS and the department\u2019s progress in implementing such  recommendations. We organized this analysis by DHS directorate or  division. In September, we compared 9/11 Commission recommendations  with those of the National Strategy for Homeland Security and the  National Strategy to Combat Terrorism. We also provided a preliminary  analysis of department planning and implementation activities with  respect to the six mission areas.

For example, HSPD-4 focuses on defending against catastrophic threats  and HSPD-7 focuses on protecting critical infrastructure. These HSPDs  provided some of the details that were not in the strategy, particularly with  respect to agency roles and milestones. See appendix X for a complete list  and description of these HSPDs.", "The strategy also identifies the major initiatives to be addressed within  each of these six mission areas. For example, within the Intelligence and  Warning mission area, 5 initiatives are indicated: (1) enhancing the  analytic capabilities of the FBI; (2) building new capabilities through the  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate of DHS;  (3) implementing the Homeland Security Advisory System; (4) utilizing  dual-use analysis to prevent attacks; and (5) employing \u201cred team\u201d  techniques.  Within the Border and Transportation Security mission area,  6 initiatives are cited: (1) ensuring accountability in border and  transportation security, (2) creating \u201csmart borders\u201d, (3) increasing the  security of international shipping containers, (4) implementing the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, (5) recapitalizing the  U.S. Coast Guard, and (6) reforming immigration services. In all, the  strategy cites 43 initiatives across the six mission areas. See appendix IX  for a complete list of all the initiatives by mission area.", "The latest available funding data from the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) for the six mission areas is illustrated in figure 1.", "The National Strategy for Homeland Security specifies a number of  federal departments, as well as nonfederal organizations, that have  important roles in implementing the mission areas and related initiatives.  In terms of federal departments, DHS is intended to have a prominent role  in implementing all of the mission areas. Other key federal departments  specified in the strategy include, in alphabetical order, the Department of  Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human  Services, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State (State).  These departments have their own strategic plans, which indicate how  they will implement their homeland security programs (as well as other  programs unrelated to homeland security). Together, DHS and these other  five departments constitute 94 percent of the proposed $47.4 billion  budget for homeland security-related activities in fiscal year 2005. OMB  did not report funding for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) although  it has activities related to the Intelligence and Warning mission area. As  explained further in appendix II, we did not include the CIA in our analysis  because of the lack of funding data and because the strategy provides little  discussion of the agency. Figure 2 shows the proposed fiscal year 2005  funding for these departments as well as the proposed homeland security  funding for all other agencies.", "The National Strategy for Homeland Security and the related HSPDs  typically identify a specific federal department as being a \u201clead\u201d agency for  specific initiatives. However, the language varies in precision. In some  cases, the documents use clear language to identify which department will  lead efforts across the government. In other cases, the lead is more  implied than stated. Sometimes, more than one department is identified as  a lead agency\u2014which can occur because some of the initiatives in the  strategy are large in scope, and different departments lead different parts  of the initiatives. The identification of lead agency is important in order to  specify which agencies are accountable for the implementation of the  initiatives, particularly if implementation requires the efforts of several  different agencies exercising different statutory authorities. By clearly  identifying the lead agency, the strategies and the HSPDs enable the  federal, state, local, and private stakeholders to determine who is  responsible and accountable for the implementation, and thus more  effectively direct their inquiries and integrate their own actions,  particularly where multiagency coordination is required. See appendix IX  for a complete list of the initiatives and the departments identified as lead  agencies.", "Congress, because of concerns about terrorism in recent years, chartered  four commissions to examine terrorist threats and the government\u2019s  response to such threats, as well as to make recommendations to federal,  state, local, and private organizations.

We  evaluated each department\u2019s high-level strategic planning documents  related to homeland security to determine if they had planning or  implementation activities related to each initiative. To satisfy the planning  and implementation criteria, we generally required departments to provide  documentary support for one such activity, per initiative. Where classified  or undocumented activities were involved, we worked with department  officials to verify the activity. We provided the results of our analyses to  planning officials from the various departments for their verification.  Additionally, we reviewed the language in the strategy and HSPDs to  determine which departments had been identified as lead agencies in  implementing the initiatives. In some cases, the leadership language was  clear; in other cases, it was less precise or implied. We were then able to  determine whether departments demonstrated planning or  implementation activities in both lead and nonlead initiatives. Our analysis  is necessarily a snapshot of activity as of particular points in time. The  agencies reviewed provided us with information as to their planning and  implementation as of various dates, including fiscal year 2004. We  recognize that the agencies continue to plan and implement their  strategies and programs and have and may continue to progress beyond  the status portrayed in this analysis.

Neither the strategy nor the HSPDs identified a lead agency on the fifth  initiative, which relates to the employment of red-team techniques.

First, the size and complexity of the effort make the  challenge especially daunting, requiring sustained attention and time to  achieve the department\u2019s mission in an effective and efficient manner.  Second, the components being merged into DHS already face a wide array  of existing challenges that must be addressed.

Additionally, we found that the strategy and  HSPDs identified lead agencies for 42 of the 43 initiatives. For these 42  initiatives where a lead had been identified, 13 initiatives had leads that  were implied rather than clear.

Architectures are  essential to effectively managing such complex endeavors and are  recognized as hallmarks of successful public and private organizations.  The challenge for the FBI will be to make architecture development an  institutional management priority; until this is accomplished and the  architecture is developed and implemented, the FBI faces the challenge of  ensuring systems currently being developed and deployed will be  consistent with the yet-to-be-developed architecture. Our research and  experience at federal agencies has shown that attempting a major  modernization effort without a well-defined and enforceable architecture  results in systems that are duplicative and not well integrated, are  unnecessarily costly to operate and maintain, and do not effectively  optimize mission performance.

We  testified in March 2004 that this implementation is challenging because of  the type of program it is and the way it is being managed. US-VISIT is to  perform a critical, multifaceted mission, its scope is large and complex, it  must meet a demanding implementation schedule, and its potential cost is  enormous. One critical aspect of the program\u2019s mission is to prevent the  entry of persons who pose a threat to the United States. DHS estimated  that the program would cost $7.2 billion through fiscal year 2014, but this  estimate did not include all costs and underestimated some others. In  addition, several factors related to the program\u2019s management increase the  risk of not delivering mission value commensurate with costs or not  delivering defined program capabilities on time and within budget. Also,  the requirements for interim facilities at high-volume land ports of entry  are not only demanding, they are based on assumptions that, if altered,  could significantly affect facility plans.

US-VISIT largely met its  commitments for implementing an initial operating capability in early  January 2004, including the deployment of entry capability to 115 air and  14 seaports of entry. However, challenges remain because DHS has not  employed rigorous, disciplined management controls typically associated  with successful programs. More specifically, testing of the initial phase of  the implemented system was not well managed and was completed after  the system became operational. In addition, multiple test plans were  developed during testing, and only the final test plan, completed after  testing, included all required content. Such controls, while significant for  the initial phases of US-VISIT, are even more critical for the later phases,  as the size and complexity of the program will only increase. Finally, as we  reported in May 2004, DHS\u2019s plans for future US-VISIT resource needs at  the land ports of entry are based on questionable assumptions, making  future resource needs uncertain.

In contrast, the  aviation system is housed in closed and controlled locations with few  entry points. The openness of mass transit systems can leave them  vulnerable because transit officials cannot monitor or control who enters  or leaves the systems. In addition, other characteristics of some transit  systems\u2014high ridership, expensive infrastructure, economic importance,  and location (e.g., large metropolitan areas or tourist destinations)\u2014also  make them attractive targets because of the potential for mass casualties  and economic damage.

For example, we reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s integrated  product teams have struggled to effectively collaborate and accomplish  their missions, and management has not measured the extent of  competition among suppliers or held the system integrator accountable for  taking steps to increase competition in order to control future costs. In  addition, in June 2004, we expressed concern that the Coast Guard had  not updated Deepwater\u2019s original 2002 acquisition schedule. We noted that  maintaining a current acquisition schedule for programs of similar scope\u2014 such as those of the Department of Defense\u2014is a fundamental and  necessary practice. The Coast Guard\u2019s lack of an updated acquisition  schedule makes it difficult to determine the degree to which the program  is on track with its original schedule, lessens the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to  monitor the contractor\u2019s performance, and may prevent the Department of  Homeland Security and Congress from basing budget decisions on  accurate information.

As we recommended in November 2003, the FBI, which leads  terrorist financing investigations and maintains case data, should  systematically collect and analyze data on terrorists\u2019 use of alternative  financing mechanisms. Alternative financing mechanisms are outside the  mainstream financial system and include the use of commodities  (cigarettes, counterfeit goods, illicit drugs, etc.), bulk cash, charities, and  informal banking systems to earn, move, and store assets. Cutting off  terrorists\u2019 funding is an important means of disrupting their operations. As  initial U.S. and foreign government deterrence efforts focused on  terrorists\u2019 use of the formal banking or mainstream financial systems,  terrorists may have been forced to increase their use of various alternative  financing mechanisms. When agencies inform the FBI that an investigation  has a terrorist component, the FBI opens a terrorism case. However, the  FBI\u2019s data analysis programs do not designate the source of funding (i.e.,  specific charity, commodity, etc.) Without such data, the FBI will be  challenged to conduct systematic analysis of trends and patterns focusing  on alternative financing mechanisms from its case data. Without such an  assessment, the FBI does not have analyses that could aid in assessing risk  and prioritizing efforts. In response to our recommendation, the FBI  conducted a onetime survey of its field offices to gather information about  terrorist financing investigations since October 2001. Additionally, the FBI  has instructed its field offices to update some of this information when  new terrorist financing investigations are initiated.

Specifically, we conducted tests over the past several  years that demonstrate how counterfeit identification documents can be  used to obtain genuine state driver\u2019s licenses. In conducting these tests,  we created fictitious identities and counterfeit identification documents  using off-the-shelf computer graphic software that is available to any  purchaser. These documents were then used to fraudulently obtain  genuine driver\u2019s licenses in other states. Our work identified three basic  challenges: (1) government officials and others generally did not recognize  that the documents we presented were counterfeit; (2) many government  officials were not alert to the possibility of identity fraud, and some failed  to follow security procedures; and (3) identity verification procedures are  inadequate. The weaknesses we found during this investigation clearly  show that border inspectors need to have the means to verify the identity  and authenticity of the documents that are presented to them. In addition,  government officials who review identification need additional training in  recognizing counterfeit documents. Further, these officials also need to be  more vigilant when reviewing identification documents to the possibility  of identification fraud.

Accordingly, SSNs are key pieces of information in creating false  identities. In prior work we recommended that the Social Security  Administration verify the documents of all SSN applicants and reassess its  policies for issuing replacement cards, which allowed an individual to  obtain up to 52 per year.

Additional departments and agencies are similarly involved in the  management of federally owned or operated facilities, including DOD and  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Furthermore, a challenge  identified in the strategy is that most government organizations occupy  buildings that are also used by a variety of nongovernmental tenants, such  as shops and restaurants where the public is able to move about freely.  The strategy also states that private owners of these properties may not  want or have the ability to modify their procedures to accommodate the  increased or special security countermeasures required by their federal  tenants, such as installing surveillance cameras in lobbies, redesigning  entry points to restrict the flow of traffic, or setting up x-ray machines and  metal detectors at these entrances. To overcome protection challenges  associated with government facilities, DHS plans to    develop a process to screen nonfederal tenants and visitors entering  private sector facilities that house federal organizations,    determine the criticality and vulnerability of government facilities,    develop long-term construction standards for facilities requiring  specialized security measures, and  implement new technological security measures at federally occupied  facilities.", "In part because of the challenges associated with protecting government  facilities, we designated federal real property as a high-risk area in January  2003.

For  example, anthrax was sent through the mail in October 2001, resulting in  the death of five people, including two postal workers in Washington, D.C.,  and potentially exposed hundreds more to this lethal substance. Moreover,  use of the mail as a vehicle for transmitting anthrax or similar weapons  threatens the nation\u2019s mail stream and places the American public at risk.  To help address this challenge, DHS has a role in mail security as part of  its overall homeland security mission, in support of the two agencies that   have key roles\u2014the United States Postal Service (USPS) and GSA. Under  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS is responsible for, among other  things, protecting certain buildings, grounds, and property owned or  secured by the federal government and identifying and assessing current  and future threats to the homeland. In addition, the National Strategy for  the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets states  DHS has a role in determining the criticality and vulnerability of  government facilities, including federal mail centers. Following the  anthrax attacks, USPS established increased security procedures to  protect mail destined for federal agencies in the Washington, D.C., area,  including the irradiation of mail. At the same time, federal agencies have  taken various steps to increase the security of their mail centers in order  to protect federal workers and buildings from possible exposure to  anthrax and other types of dangerous material, such as explosives. In our  December 2003 review of mail security in the executive branch, we  determined that a lack of information from USPS on mail security  incidents, as well as on mail security policies and practices, reduced the  ability of federal agencies to make well-informed decisions regarding mail  practices or their future plans for mail screening. In addition, we found  that agencies\u2019 fear of cross-contamination influenced their decision to  implement practices which were not recommended by the USPS or other  government and industry sources of mail-screening information.

Specifically, the distribution system, source water  supplies, critical information systems, and chemicals stored on-site that  are used in the treatment process have been identified as potential targets  of terrorism. Additionally, our work has identified vulnerability challenges  that may involve multiple system components or even an entire drinking  water system.

Fundamental changes are needed to improve  the effectiveness and efficiency of the federal food safety system and to  protect the nation\u2019s food supply from acts of deliberate contamination.", "One challenge involves the fact that bioterrorism attacks could be directed  at many different targets in the farm-to-table continuum, including crops,  livestock, and food products in the processing and distribution chain. For  example, experts believe that terrorists would attack livestock and crops if  their primary intent were to cause severe economic dislocation. On the  other hand, if their motives were to harm humans, they could decide to  contaminate finished food products. While agencies have taken steps to  better protect the food supply, for the most part, the nation must still rely  on the current food safety system to respond to bioterrorism acts against  it. An additional challenge relates to the broad authority that agencies  have to regulate the safety of the U.S. food supply but not the security of it.  As a result, federal agencies are beginning to explore the extent to which  food processors are voluntarily implementing security measures to protect  against deliberate contamination. Finally, a challenge involves protecting  against animal diseases that could be accidentally\u2014or deliberately\u2014 introduced into the country. Certain animal disease can be devastating to  the agricultural economy while others, such as mad cow disease, can be  transmitted to humans.

Among the possible terrorist targets within this sector  are the nation\u2019s nuclear power plants\u2014104 facilities containing radioactive  fuel and waste. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees  security of these facilities through an inspection program designed to  verify the plants\u2019 compliance with security requirements. However, in  September 2003, we reported that NRC faces challenges in ensuring that  its oversight programs are effective in safeguarding these facilities and the  surrounding communities. Specifically, three aspects of its security  inspection program reduced NRC\u2019s effectiveness in this area. First, NRC\u2019s  inspectors often used a process that minimized the significance of security  problems found in annual inspections by classifying them as \u201cnon-cited  violations\u201d if the problem had not been identified frequently in the past or  if the problem had no direct, immediate, or adverse consequences at the  time it was identified. By making extensive use of these non-cited  violations for serious problems, NRC may overstate the level of security at  a power plant and reduce the likelihood that needed improvements are  made. Second, NRC does not have a routine, centralized process for  collecting, analyzing, and disseminating security inspections to identify  problems that may be common to plants or to provide lessons learned in  resolving security problems. Such a mechanism may help plants improve  their security. Third, although NRC\u2019s force-on-force exercises can  demonstrate how well a nuclear power plant might defend itself against a  real-life threat, several weaknesses in how NRC conducts these exercises  limited their usefulness. Weaknesses included using (1) more personnel to  defend the plant during these exercises than would be available on a  normal day, (2) attacking forces that are not trained in terrorist tactics,  and (3) unrealistic weapons (rubber guns) that do not simulate actual  gunfire. We also found that NRC made only limited use of some available  improvements that would make force-on-force exercises more realistic  and provide a more useful training experience. Finally, even if NRC  strengthens its inspection program, commercial nuclear power plants face  legal challenges in ensuring plant security. First, federal law generally  prohibits guards at these plants from using automatic weapons, even  though terrorists are likely to be using them. Second, state laws vary  regarding the permissible use of deadly force and the authority to arrest  and detain intruders, and we found that guards are unsure about the  extent of their authorities and may hesitate or fail to act if the plant is  attacked."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectively Securing Nuclear Weapons Sites", "paragraphs": ["The homeland security strategy identifies the defense industrial base as a  critical infrastructure sector.

Multilateral export control regimes have expanded their  lists of controlled items, but key countries of concern are not members.  Some of these countries are also on the State Department\u2019s list of state  sponsors of terrorism. In addition, U.S. efforts to control U.S. exports of  dual-use items are hindered by a gap in U.S. export control authority. U.S.  companies can sell certain dual-use items to foreign buyers, even if the  exporter knows the buyer plans to use the items to build cruise missiles or  UAVs. Finally, the United States seldom uses its end-use monitoring  program to verify compliance with conditions placed on the use of cruise  missiles.", "With regard to export controls over items that could be employed by  terrorists, we found that post-shipment verification (PSV) provides limited  assurance that dual-use items are being properly used. Specifically, we  reviewed Commerce\u2019s efforts to conduct PSV checks to ensure that dual- use items and technologies arrive at their intended destination and are  used for the purpose stated in the export license. We reported, in February  2004, that Commerce conducted relatively few post-shipment verification  checks. For example, PSV checks were completed on only 6 percent of  dual-use items exported to countries of potential proliferation concern.  We also identified three key challenges in the PSV process itself. First,  PSVs do not confirm compliance license conditions because U.S. officials  frequently do not check license compliance, they often lack the technical  training to assess compliance, and end-users may not be aware of the  license conditions they are supposed to be abiding by. Second, some  countries of concern limit the U.S. government\u2019s access. Third, PSV results  have only limited impact on Commerce\u2019s future licensing decisions.  Commerce generally agreed with our recommendation to address these  challenges and indicated it had taken steps to strengthen the PSV process.", "In March 2004, we reported that another area of proliferation raising  potential terrorism concerns involves delays in implementing the  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). CWC bans chemical weapons and  requires their destruction by 2007, with possible extension to 2012. CWC  has played an important role in reducing the risks posed by chemical  weapons. However, CWC\u2019s nonproliferation goals have proven more  challenging than originally anticipated. First, the destruction of chemical  weapons will likely take longer and cost more than originally anticipated.  Even with significant international assistance, Russia may not be able to  destroy its declared chemical weapons stockpile until 15 years beyond the  extended CWC deadline. Second, technical advancements in the chemical  industry and the increasing number of dual-use commercial facilities  worldwide challenge the CWC\u2019s ability to deter and detect proliferation.  Third, many CWC member states have not yet adopted national laws to  fully implement the CWC or have not submitted complete and accurate  declarations of their CWC-related activities.", "The Bremer, Gilmore, Hart-Rudman, and 9/11 commissions made  recommendations related to the challenges presented in this section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controlling the Sale of Biological Production Equipment", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge related to keeping weapons of mass destruction out of  the hands of terrorists involves the ability of terrorists to readily obtain  equipment that can be used to make biological agents.
