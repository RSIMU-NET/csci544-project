Established in 1977 in response to the global energy crisis that disrupted U.S. and world markets and economies, DOE is an amalgam of various federal agencies that had energy and science responsibilities. The roots of the Department came from the Atomic Energy Commission that was established in 1947 to assume the responsibilities of the Manhattan Engineer District, which had developed the first atomic bombs. The Commission was responsible for developing and producing nuclear weapons; operating nuclear reactors, uranium enrichment plants and plutonium production plants; performing research and development on both military and civilian uses of nuclear energy; and promoting and funding nuclear and other sciences. DOE assumed these as well as other responsibilities, including energy technology research, development, and demonstration; fostering energy conservation and efficiency; managing federal petroleum reserves; and, more recently, cleaning up environmental contamination resulting from its past operations.", "To carry out these responsibilities, DOE continues a highly decentralized structure that began under the Atomic Energy Commission. This structure relies heavily on private contractors, either corporations or universities, to manage most of its operations and activities. DOE owns the facilities needed to conduct the work, but the private contractors manage and operate the facilities. DOE\u2019s work force is composed primarily of contractors. As of mid-1996, DOE had about 12,500 federal employees and about 120,000 contract workers located at its headquarters and field facilities throughout the country. To support these facilities and workers, DOE receives substantial funding, which ranged from $19.0 billion in 1986 to $23.7 billion in 1990. For fiscal year 1996, DOE was authorized to spend $19.7 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE Conducts Many Large-Scale, High-Risk Projects", "paragraphs": ["More than most federal agencies, DOE\u2019s activities involve projects that are usually long term and high cost. In many cases, the projects are first-of-a-kind and thus involve substantial risk. These projects generally involve substantial funding for construction, are conducted to address a specific mission need, and are often separate line items in DOE\u2019s budget. For example:", "DOE\u2019s science programs in high-energy physics and nuclear physics require the construction of accelerators, which are large machines that propel atomic particles near the speed of light. The collisions of these particles are studied to explore the properties of matter. These accelerators can range in cost from several hundred million dollars to several billion dollars, or more. For example, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility in Virginia (recently renamed the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility), shown in figure 1.1, cost over $500 million.", "DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons programs required the construction of nuclear reactors to produce the materials needed for nuclear weapons. Additionally, other large and specialized facilities are needed to process the materials and manufacture, assemble, and test nuclear weapons components. Any of these facilities can easily cost over a billion dollars. For example, just the design work and close-out costs for a nuclear reactor to produce tritium, a key component of nuclear weapons, were more than $1.2 billion.", "DOE\u2019s environmental management programs require facilities and technologies to process nuclear waste into forms suitable for longer-term or permanent disposal. These programs also need technologies and equipment to remove nuclear and hazardous material contamination from existing facilities and sites. Some facilities at major DOE field sites will cost many billions of dollars. For example, the Defense Waste Processing Facility in South Carolina (to process high-level radioactive waste into a stable form for long-term storage), and the support facilities to prepare the waste for processing, shown in figure 1.2, cost over $4 billion.", "These large-scale projects account for a significant portion of DOE\u2019s budget. Funds for many of the projects are requested by DOE as specific construction line items, and funding for such projects is identified in congressional committee reports. However, from a total budget standpoint, considerably more operating funds than construction funds are provided for DOE projects, and the operating funds provided for some projects cannot be as easily determined, particularly for older projects. Funds needed for conceptual design, management, start up, and other nonconstruction activities\u2014which can be as much as 40 percent of a project\u2019s total cost\u2014are included as part of DOE\u2019s operating funds. Furthermore, some projects are funded entirely with operating funds. For example, over $1 billion of the operating funds appropriated annually for DOE\u2019s environmental restoration activities are used for large-scale clean-up projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major System Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-109, dated April 5, 1976, recognized that certain projects and/or activities are crucial to an agency accomplishing its missions. The circular defined projects that are critical to fulfilling an agency mission, entail the allocation of relatively large amounts of resources, and warrant special management attention as major system acquisitions (MSA). The circular (1) required early communication with the Congress that relates MSAs to agency mission needs and goals, (2) focuses top-level management attention on the determination of these mission needs and goals, and (3) requires an integrated approach to budgeting, contracting, and managing these projects. However, the specific criteria and dollar thresholds for determining which activities will be considered MSAs were left to the discretion of the individual agencies.", "In response to the OMB circular, DOE initially defined MSAs as systems or projects that had a total project cost in excess of $250 million and were specifically identified as mission critical. In 1990, DOE changed the cost threshold to $100 million. During the period 1980 through 1996, DOE conducted 80 different MSAs. These projects addressed many different program areas and activities, including the Superconducting Super Collider; nuclear reactors; uranium enrichment processes and facilities; fossil fuel demonstration plants; nuclear waste disposal facilities; and environmental cleanup efforts. According to current cost estimates, DOE has spent or plans to spend over $65 billion on these 80 MSAs.", "Successfully completing MSAs on time and within estimated dollar targets has proven difficult. Over the past few years, we have issued a number of reports that have discussed overall acquisition issues and problems in other federal agencies, as well as problems with individual projects. In a December 1992 report, we discussed problems with the Department of Defense\u2019s major weapons acquisitions resulting in substantial cost overruns, delays in completing and fielding these acquisitions, and performance problems. Similarly, in an August 1996 report, we discussed the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s problems in acquiring new air traffic control system equipment within cost, schedule, and performance parameters. Both reports identified fundamental problems that inhibit the successful completion of these agencies\u2019 major acquisitions. For example, we reported that Federal Aviation Administration officials acted in ways that did not reflect a strong commitment to the agency\u2019s acquisition mission. They performed little or no mission needs analysis, set unrealistic cost and schedule estimates, and started production on the systems before having completed their development.", "Furthermore, in July 1995, we reported on governmentwide federal information technology acquisitions that cost more than anticipated, did not meet schedules, and did not meet mission needs. All of these acquisitions have suffered from a lack of advance planning and ineffective management oversight that has led to cost overruns and schedule slippages. Currently, 11 federal agencies have problems with information management or systems development that are serious enough that they have been listed by GAO, OMB, and/or the General Services Administration as high-risk programs.", "We have also discussed problems with specific DOE MSAs in many reports over the years. These reports address MSAs that range from the multibillion dollar Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project in Nevada (a proposed repository for high-level radioactive waste), shown in figure 1.3, to the approximately $140 million Central Receiver Solar Thermal Power Plant in California, shown in figure 1.4. We have also reported on generic MSA management problems facing DOE, such as the agency\u2019s frequent failure to ensure that critical management control documents for MSAs are prepared before projects are allowed to proceed beyond the conceptual design phase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, asked us to review DOE\u2019s acquisition management program and the past problems that have occurred.

As a result, the data used in this report had to be reconstructed from budget submissions, internal documents, and from officials of DOE\u2019s Office of Project and Fixed Asset Management. We did not verify the data obtained from DOE. However, we did examine the reasonableness of these data based on information in prior GAO reports and audits. For this report, we used, wherever possible, the MSA\u2019s \u201cTotal Project Cost,\u201d which includes construction and operating funds.

When the project was terminated in 1994, about $116 million had been spent for construction.", "There are many reasons for these terminations, some of which were outside of DOE\u2019s control. In some cases, changing circumstances and/or world events simply caught up with the projects, and they were no longer needed. In others, the necessary technologies to make the projects work could not be perfected in time. Some were canceled due to changes in administration policy. However, in other cases, as pointed out in DOE Inspector General and our reports, management problems and/or ineffective oversight by DOE led to enormous schedule slippages and cost overruns, and the Congress eventually cut off funding.

Cost overruns on DOE projects were common occurrences during the 1980 through 1996 period. Complete original cost estimates and final/current cost estimates were available for 35 of the 49 completed or ongoing projects. Of these 35 projects, 4 were completed and 4 were expected to be completed at or below their originally budgeted cost. The remaining 27 projects had or were projected to have cost overruns averaging over 70 percent. Table 2.1 provides examples of projects that were experiencing substantial cost overruns.", "A list of the original and final/current cost estimates for all completed and ongoing projects are contained in appendixes II and III, respectively.", "Cost overruns also occurred in terminated projects and, in some cases, were the contributing factor to their termination. For example, DOE\u2019s estimate of the total cost to build the Superconducting Super Collider grew from $5.9 billion in 1990 to $8.25 billion in 1991. In May 1993, we reported that additional known costs showed that the project\u2019s total costs would exceed $11 billion and could go higher. The project was terminated by the Congress in October 1993, because of concerns over the escalating costs and the federal budget deficit.", "Over the years, we and DOE\u2019s Inspector General have reported that cost overruns on DOE\u2019s MSAs have occurred for a number of reasons, including technical problems, some of which were beyond the agency\u2019s control; poor initial cost estimates; and ineffective oversight of contractor operations. For example, in 1992, we reported that technical problems were important factors causing the cost of the Defense Waste Processing Facility to increase. This facility, at DOE\u2019s Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, was designed to turn high-level radioactive waste into a glass-like form for long-term storage. The technical problems included the generation of benzene during the pretreatment process and the buildup of highly explosive gases during the vitrification process.", "In 1993, we reported that poor estimating of project costs contributed to cost overruns with DOE\u2019s environmental projects. In 1995, the Inspector General reported on problems with the High Level Waste Evaporator at Savannah River. The evaporator is designed to evaporate water added to the high-level radioactive waste processing stream, thereby reducing the total volume of waste. The estimated cost of the project had more than doubled, and the estimated completion date had slipped by more than 4 years. The Inspector General found that many of the cost increases and schedule delays could have been avoided if DOE had adequately planned, contracted, funded, and maintained management continuity. A major factor was DOE\u2019s failure to ensure that the contractor followed the project management guidance in DOE\u2019s orders.", "Project cost overruns have occurred for other reasons. On some projects, according to DOE officials, changing legal and regulatory requirements have increased the scope of the projects resulting in higher costs than were originally estimated. For example, DOE officials point out that the number of sites to be cleaned up under DOE\u2019s Formerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Program increased, due in part to legislation. Furthermore, DOE officials told us that some program offices were not consistently following guidance on which costs are to be included as part of Total Project Cost, and this resulted in understating those costs. Consequently, the Total Project Cost for some MSAs increased when these program offices began to adhere to the cost guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule Slippages", "paragraphs": ["Schedule slippages can have serious implications for DOE projects. Slippages can adversely impact DOE\u2019s ability to produce or maintain nuclear weapons components, achieve timely cleanup of contaminated sites, or be the first to make new scientific breakthroughs. Schedule slippages also generally equate to additional project costs. Many administrative or overhead costs\u2014such as security, heat, water, etc.\u2014will be incurred throughout the life of the project and increase as the length of the project increases. Contractors\u2019 costs, which are passed on to DOE, will also rise as the schedule slips.", "Schedule delays and slippages were prevalent on DOE projects during the period 1980 through 1996. Most of the 15 completed MSAs did not meet their originally scheduled completion dates. Of the 34 ongoing projects, only a few originally scheduled for completion in this century are on time. Examples of projects that experienced some large schedule slippages are shown in table 2.2.", "The reasons for schedule slippage are similar to those for cost overruns, and they are very much intertwined. Any event that causes schedule slippage is likely to cause cost increases. For example, the schedule for the West Valley Demonstration Project in New York State (to solidify high-level radioactive waste for long-term storage), shown in figure 2.3, slipped by over 7 years and costs more than doubled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Completed Projects Have Not Operated as Intended", "paragraphs": ["Once completed, an MSA must operate as intended in order to fulfill a program need.

The project is listed by DOE as being completed at a final cost of $364 million; however, the facility never became operational because programmatic funding was reduced by the Congress, and the remaining funds were used by DOE for higher priority projects. The facility has remained shut down since 1986.", "The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, shown in figure 2.5, was to demonstrate the feasibility of underground storage of certain types of government-generated radioactive waste. DOE declared the plant operational in 1991. However, due to additional environmental, regulatory, and technical requirements that were imposed by legislation, the facility has not yet received the necessary certificates and permits to operate and has not yet received any radioactive waste. DOE currently expects this facility to begin operations in fiscal year 1998. To date, DOE has spent $710 million on this project.", "The Fuels and Materials Examination Facility at DOE\u2019s Hanford Plant in Washington State, shown in figure 2.6, was to fabricate and examine a full range of breeder reactor fuels. This project, although listed by DOE as being completed, has never operated for its intended purpose because DOE\u2019s breeder reactor program was terminated in the early 1980s when the Congress cut off funding.

When looked at individually, there appears to be logical explanations of why specific MSAs experienced delays and cost increases. However, when looked at collectively over an extended time (e.g., 80 MSAs from 1980 through 1996), other more fundamental reasons or factors can be seen. We believe that there are four key factors underlying the increasing project costs, schedule slippages, and high number of terminations. The factors include constantly changing missions for DOE that often make it difficult to maintain departmental and congressional support for these long-term, high-cost projects; the funding of projects incrementally, from year to year rather than up front, which subjects those projects to potential delays or terminations in funding each year; a flawed system of incentives that does not always reward individuals and organizations for doing the right thing and has often rewarded contractors despite poor contract performance; and difficulty in hiring, training, and retaining enough people with the requisite skills to provide effective oversight and/or management of contractor operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changing DOE Missions and Inconsistent Support", "paragraphs": ["Since its creation, DOE\u2019s missions have continued to change, and the DOE of today bears little resemblance to the agency created in 1977. The relative priority of DOE\u2019s responsibilities has also changed greatly over the years. As a result, DOE no longer has major efforts underway or has substantially cut back its efforts to develop alternative sources of energy to help promote energy independence (a key activity in the late 1970s); further develop commercial nuclear power (a major DOE activity in the late 1970s); build new nuclear weapons (a major buildup in the 1980s); rebuild the nuclear weapons complex (a principal agency concern in the late 1980s); or provide commercial uranium enrichment services (which the Congress transferred out of DOE in 1993 to a government corporation, the U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation).", "At the same time, other missions have become a greater focus of the agency\u2019s efforts. These include cleaning up years of contamination resulting from DOE\u2019s nuclear and other activities, improving the nation\u2019s scientific and industrial competitiveness, and providing stewardship for the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, many projects have been terminated, either by DOE or the Congress, because they were no longer considered critical or important to DOE\u2019s mission. Examples include the following.", "The Clinch River Breeder Reactor project was begun in 1970 as a high-priority project to demonstrate a nuclear reactor that could \u201cbreed\u201d or produce more fuel than it consumed. However, the fuel that it would produce is plutonium, a key material for nuclear weapons, and this raised concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Coupled with reduced expectations for the future use of nuclear energy, the development of a breeder reactor was no longer a priority. The project was terminated by the Congress in 1983 after the expenditure of about $1.6 billion.", "The Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation Project in California, shown in figure 3.1, was begun in 1973 to develop a more efficient process to enrich uranium for use as fuel in commercial nuclear power plants. In the early 1990s, however, DOE\u2019s mission of providing uranium enrichment services to public utilities and other non-DOE customers ended. Consequently, DOE terminated its efforts on this project in 1993 after a total expenditure of $1.3 billion.", "The Fuel Processing Restoration Project was begun in 1985 to build improved facilities to process naval nuclear propulsion fuels for reuse in DOE\u2019s production reactors. With the end of the cold war, however, this mission changed and the production reactors closed, thereby negating the need for this project. The project was terminated by DOE in 1992 after a total expenditure of $306 million for construction.", "Projects have also been terminated when a change in administration policy occurred. In the early 1980s, DOE terminated five coal demonstration plants, on which it had spent $459 million. These projects were looking at more efficient and/or environmentally safe ways to burn coal. The projects were canceled because the new administration did not believe that funding demonstration projects was an appropriate mission for DOE. Other terminations resulted from changing world conditions. For example, after spending over $1.2 billion, DOE terminated plans to develop the New Production Reactor to produce tritium, a vital material for nuclear weapons. The project was terminated because of anticipated reductions in the nuclear weapons arsenal resulting from arms reduction agreements and the end of the Cold War. Also, because of reductions in nuclear weapons, DOE terminated upgrades on its existing production reactor at its Savannah River Plant after spending about $1.7 billion. Finally, DOE terminated the Uranium Solidification Facility when it was 90 percent complete, because the products from the facility\u2014materials for nuclear fuel\u2014were no longer needed with the shut down of the Savannah River reactors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incremental Funding of Projects", "paragraphs": ["Having funds available to keep a project on schedule is critical to achieving project objectives. DOE has historically received incremental funding for its projects. With incremental funding, the Congress provides funds for one fiscal year for a project based on the obligations estimated to be incurred within that fiscal year. Funds to continue the project must be requested from the Congress each year. DOE, in its annual budget submissions, develops and provides the Congress with a profile or schedule of the funding it will need each year to complete each project.", "However, when funds are provided incrementally, they often do not keep pace with the agency\u2019s estimated needs. For many projects, particularly in their first years of development and construction, the funding received is considerably below the amount requested. This causes project schedules to slip and costs to rise. Contractors continue to charge, and certain administrative costs (e.g., heat, water, electricity, security, etc.) are incurred each month no matter what the progress. For example, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility was designed to conduct nuclear physics experiments. The project\u2019s funding request called for it to receive a total of $236 million for construction during fiscal years 1987 through 1991. However, in its first 3 years the project received only $94 million, or about 60 percent, of the $155 million scheduled. According to DOE officials, largely because of this funding delay, the project\u2019s construction schedule was extended 3 years, and the construction costs increased by $77 million to $313 million.", "Similarly, the Fermilab Main Injector Project in Illinois (to construct a new particle accelerator for use in high-energy physics experiments) received only 40 percent of its first 3 years planned funding and the Security Enhancements at the Pantex Plant in Texas (where nuclear weapons components are assembled into final weapons), shown in figures 3.2 and 3.3, were funded at only 43 percent of the first 3 years schedule. According to DOE officials, both of these projects are now over cost and years behind schedule as a result of the reduced funding levels.", "On the other hand, DOE has had better results with projects when year-to-year funding was not a concern. In May 1994, we reported that under DOE\u2019s clean coal technology program, the Congress appropriated $2.75 billion to fully fund the federal share of this joint federal/nonfederal program. Nonfederal contributions eventually reached more than $4.5 billion. According to DOE, this advance commitment of federal funds was an important reason for the industry\u2019s significant response to the program, in terms of both the quantity and quality of the proposals received as well as the nonfederal cost-sharing achieved. Virtually all of the DOE officials, project sponsors, and other program participants we spoke with perceived the government\u2019s advance financial commitment as a very big advantage for multiyear projects, because it indicated that the government would be involved in cost-sharing throughout the life of the projects. The industry participants told us that they would not want to commit significant funds in the early years of projects if they perceived that the government might stop sharing costs before the projects were completed.", "An additional problem with incremental funding is that it may allow some projects to be started that would not be funded if the Congress had to provide budget authority for their full estimated costs at the time the project was approved. (This concept of full funding is discussed in ch. 4.)

Parochial interests can take over, and the real goal can become simply keeping the project going.", "Many DOE managers view themselves as advocates for their projects, which provides an incentive to not surface problems that could result in the project being terminated.

DOE eventually agreed that the project was no longer needed and terminated it after spending $2.8 billion. The delay in stopping this project occurred largely because of DOE\u2019s desire to maintain its historical mission of being the major world supplier of enrichment services.", "Participants in DOE\u2019s Superconducting Super Collider saw this project as allowing the United States to maintain preeminence in high-energy physics. Project managers originally expected that it would cost $5.9 billion and that large amounts of foreign contributions to the project would be forthcoming. However, the foreign contributions never reached expected levels, and project costs escalated greatly.

Subtitle B, which applies to civilian agencies, provides that agency heads are to establish cost, schedule, and performance goals for acquisition programs and annually report on the progress in meeting those goals. These goals are to include achieving, on average, 90 percent of the established cost and schedule goals without reducing the performance or capabilities of the items being acquired.

Full funding means that when an asset or any programmatically or economically separable segment of an asset is approved by the Congress, the requesting agency is given budget authority for the full estimated cost of that asset or segment. For example, if an agency was undertaking a project that required the construction of a building first, and then the subsequent installation of equipment to perform a task, the agency would request the full cost of constructing the building in one fiscal year.

The report details plans to encourage competition wherever possible and develop specific contract performance measurements and incentives. The reform initiatives will require DOE to develop definitive work scopes and objective performance measurement criteria to replace the requirements now contained in most traditional cost-reimbursement contracts used by the Department. Once specific performance criteria are established, the contracts must provide incentives and/or disincentives to motivate the contractors to meet expectations. To accomplish this, DOE should have a central role in overseeing and evaluating contractor performance. The contract reform report recommended more than 40 specific actions that DOE began implementing in early 1994.", "We believe that the contract reform initiatives could improve many aspects of DOE\u2019s contracting. More competition and better control over the contractors should lead to cost savings and quality improvements. These initiatives could also benefit DOE\u2019s MSAs. Some of the key factors we previously identified, such as lack of effective incentives, could be addressed by contract reform, depending on how performance objectives are established. If these objectives focus on successful outcomes, cost control, and timeliness, they could improve the MSA process. Nevertheless, as we concluded in a 1989 report, contracting deficiencies generally resulted from people failing to carry out their responsibilities, rather than from a need for more rules and regulations. Realizing this, the full benefits of contract reform will require that DOE have enough properly trained staff to oversee the implementation of the reforms.", "Furthermore, recent DOE actions raise questions about the agency\u2019s commitment to fully implementing the contract reforms. Two basic tenets of DOE\u2019s philosophy of contract reform are that contracts will be competed except in unusual circumstances, and, if current contracts are to be extended, the terms of the extended contracts will be negotiated before DOE makes its decision to extend them. However, in May 1996, DOE extended the University of California\u2019s three laboratory contracts (currently valued at about $3 billion) rather than compete them. These large contracts have been held by the university continuously for 50 years. DOE justified its decision on the basis of its long-term relationship with the university. This decision was made despite DOE\u2019s Contract Reform Team\u2019s conclusion that the agency\u2019s contracting suffered from a lack of competition, which was caused, in part, by several long-term relationships with particular contractors.

The key to the successful implementation of DOE\u2019s Strategic Plan, and also what the plan is now missing, is how a consensus will be reached to carry out these missions.

In July 1994, DOE issued an information management plan to support the objectives in its Strategic Plan. Lack of reliable information has been a long-standing problem with DOE\u2019s MSAs.

For example, the report pointed out that DOE\u2019s budget information came from a myriad of budget documents and in various formats. Because of this, the budget process did not provide the accurate and timely data managers needed. Among other things, the report recommended that DOE adopt a consistent budget format for the agency; adopt standard, electronically integrated budget software; and centralize budget preparation with the Chief Financial Officer.
