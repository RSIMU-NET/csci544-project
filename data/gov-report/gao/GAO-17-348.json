WMATA officials also collect lessons learned during and after each surge, and use those lessons during subsequent maintenance and planning efforts. Additionally, WMATA developed a new organization-wide quality control and assurance framework and is implementing it for the first time through SafeTrack.", "The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has used safety inspections and other tools to oversee SafeTrack and direct WMATA to undertake safety-critical work. FTA has relied on two different authorities to oversee SafeTrack: (1) FTA's public transportation safety oversight authority, and (2) its project management oversight authority. Prior to the start of SafeTrack and during the project, FTA conducted safety inspections and directed WMATA to make repairs to reduce the risk of smoke and fires on the rail system. After SafeTrack work began and estimated project costs exceeded $100 million, FTA determined SafeTrack to be a major capital project, triggering the statutory requirement that WMATA prepare a project management plan. WMATA did not submit its project management plan until 4 months into SafeTrack. FTA found the plan lacked sufficient detail, and WMATA told GAO it is working to improve the plan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that WMATA develop a policy that requires and includes procedures for it to, prior to starting future large-scale rehabilitation projects: (1) use asset data to develop project objectives; (2) analyze alternatives; and (3) develop a project management plan for those projects that may not be designated as major capital projects.

In response to some  of these issues, as well as its backlog of track work, WMATA intends,  through SafeTrack, to complete three years of track infrastructure  rehabilitation in approximately one year. According to WMATA, SafeTrack  is a unique effort, designed to address urgent safety issues with railroad  track assets. SafeTrack will be funded by federal grants, as well as  contributions from the three local jurisdictions that are signatories to the  interstate compact governing WMATA\u2014the District of Columbia,  Maryland, and Virginia.

The extent to which WMATA\u2019s implementation of SafeTrack was  consistent with these practices; and,  3.  The steps that were taken by FTA to oversee SafeTrack.", "To address our first two research questions on SafeTrack\u2019s planning and  implementation, we examined documentation on how WMATA planned  SafeTrack, including the alternative plans it developed, as well as how it  carried out work for SafeTrack. We also examined FTA\u2019s project  construction guidelines and its quality management guidelines for their  applicability to SafeTrack work. We also examined WMATA  documentation on the quality control and quality assurance frameworks in  place for SafeTrack as well as the results of WMATA\u2019s own SafeTrack  quality reviews. We also obtained and summarized data from WMATA on  work tasks planned for and completed during SafeTrack. Based on  interviews with WMATA officials, we determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for our purpose of summarizing work planned and  completed to date under SafeTrack. Further, we examined the results of  FTA\u2019s inspections of WMATA track infrastructure. We also reviewed  recent investigations and studies regarding WMATA, including those from  the American Public Transportation Association, DOT\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG), NTSB, and WMATA\u2019s OIG.", "To further address our first two research objectives, we interviewed  officials from WMATA and other organizations. Specifically, we  interviewed WMATA officials about actions they took to plan and  implement SafeTrack. We also interviewed officials from the DOT\u2019s OIG,  FTA, NTSB, and WMATA\u2019s OIG about their work with WMATA and  perspectives on SafeTrack. Additionally, we interviewed officials from  local jurisdictions (the District of Columbia; Montgomery County,  Maryland; and Fairfax County, Virginia) about the coordination and  communication between them and WMATA officials concerning  SafeTrack. We also interviewed officials from the Chicago Transit  Authority (CTA), Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA),  New York City Transit (NYCT, part of the Metropolitan Transportation  Authority), and Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH, part of the Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey) about their experiences planning  and implementing large-scale rehabilitation projects. We selected these  transit agencies based on their similarity to WMATA in terms of total  ridership, heavy rail track and passenger miles, as well as whether they  have carried out or are currently undertaking large-scale rehabilitation  projects akin to SafeTrack. In selecting these transit agencies we also  considered geographic diversity and the views of the American Public  Transportation Association officials on WMATA\u2019s \u201cpeers.\u201d Though we  believe these transit agencies provided relevant and diverse perspectives  on carrying out transit rehabilitation projects, the information gathered  from these entities is not generalizable to all transit agencies. We did not  evaluate or compare the number or type of safety incidents at these other  transit systems to those at WMATA.", "For the first two research questions, we compared WMATA\u2019s planning  and implementation of SafeTrack to leading project management  practices identified by the Project Management Institute (PMI) in its A  Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae  Guide), and by the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) in its  Report 157, which focuses on rehabilitation of transit assets. We  compared WMATA\u2019s SafeTrack project to those leading practices  identified by PMI and TCRP that we determined were most relevant to the  planning and implementation of large-scale rehabilitation projects, such  as SafeTrack. We consider these documents to be relevant summaries of  leading project management practices for transit agencies and  appropriate to large-scale rehabilitation projects, such as SafeTrack.  Further, WMATA indicated to us that the PMI PMBOK\u00ae Guide and the  TCRP report are appropriate references for the future state of good repair  work. We also evaluated WMATA\u2019s efforts based on internal control  frameworks published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of  the Treadway Commission (COSO), which WMATA uses as criteria for its  internal control evaluations.", "To address our third research objective on FTA\u2019s oversight of SafeTrack,  we examined FTA and WMATA documents and interviewed various  officials. We examined: (1) FTA documents related to its oversight of  major capital projects and SafeTrack specifically, (2) relevant federal  statues and FTA regulations governing transit agencies and projects, and  (3) WMATA documents related to FTA\u2019s oversight of SafeTrack.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["WMATA\u2019s Metrorail system has experienced a variety of serious safety  incidents in recent years (see fig. 1 below). On June 22, 2009, one  Metrorail train struck the rear of a second train stopped near the Fort  Totten station on the Red Line, resulting in nine deaths and over 50  injuries. The NTSB report on the incident found that WMATA failed to  institutionalize, and employ system-wide, an enhanced track-circuit  verification test procedure that was developed following near-collisions in  2005. NTSB also found evidence of an ineffective safety culture within  WMATA. More recently, WMATA has experienced smoke and fire  incidents involving the electrical cables and other components supporting  its third-rail system. On January 12, 2015, a Metrorail train stopped after  encountering heavy smoke in the tunnel between the L\u2019Enfant Plaza  station and the Potomac River Bridge on the Yellow Line caused by  electrical arcing resulting from a short circuit on the third rail power  system, causing one passenger\u2019s death and numerous injuries. In a  report on this incident, the NTSB again found a lack of a safety culture  within WMATA. NTSB specifically noted deficiencies in WMATA\u2019s  response to smoke reports, tunnel ventilation, railcar ventilation,  emergency response, as well as the oversight and management of  WMATA. In November 2015, WMATA\u2019s new General Manager began his  tenure and initiated a variety of efforts to address WMATA\u2019s Metrorail  safety issues. On March 14, 2016, an electrical fire occurred near the  McPherson Square station involving the same kind of power cable that  caused the L\u2019Enfant Plaza smoke incident. Following this fire, WMATA  closed the entire Metrorail system for a day for emergency inspections of  the system\u2019s third-rail power cables.", "On May 19, 2016, WMATA announced SafeTrack, \u201ca massive,  comprehensive, holistic effort to address safety recommendations and  rehabilitate the Metrorail system on an accelerated basis by expanding all  available maintenance windows.\u201d The primary focus of SafeTrack is  rehabilitating Metrorail\u2019s track infrastructure by replacing over 45,000  crossties, which are the wooden beams that lay across the railroad bed  on above ground sections of the track, and 35,000 fasteners, which  secure rails directly to concrete on underground or aerial sections of the  track where wooden crossties are not used. SafeTrack is being carried  out through a series of \u201csurges\u201d that involve intensive work on specific  areas of track that are either shut down to normal traffic or have only one  of the two tracks open, a type of operation known as \u201csingle tracking\u201d (see  fig. 2 below). SafeTrack also involves the reduction of operating hours to  allow additional work to be carried out overnight and on weekends in non- surge areas. Although the primary focus of SafeTrack is track assets,  WMATA is also using the extended outages to address other safety  concerns, such as concerns regarding power cables and other electrical  components raised by NTSB and FTA. According to WMATA\u2019s initial  announcement, the project was designed to bring Metrorail\u2019s track  infrastructure to a \u201cstate of good repair,\u201d which WMATA defines as the  condition at which individual railroad assets can be sustained at ongoing,  annual replacement rates under normal maintenance cycles.", "WMATA estimates that SafeTrack will cost approximately $120 million.  According to WMATA and FTA officials, these costs will be covered by  about $48 million in federal funding, which includes two FTA formula  grants as well as funding authorized by the Passenger Rail Investment  and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA). The PRIIA funding is also  matched by over $30 million in local funds from the three jurisdictions that  help fund WMATA. Beyond the almost $80 million in federal and local  matching funds, SafeTrack will require an additional $40 million in fiscal  year 2017 funding; according to WMATA, the sources of this funding are  yet to be finalized. Although SafeTrack was not specifically included in  WMATA\u2019s approved fiscal year 2016 or 2017 budgets, WMATA amended  and its board approved its fiscal year 2017 budget, in November 2016, to  include additional funding for the project. WMATA\u2019s track rehabilitation  projects and other capital investments are made through a 6-year Capital  Improvement Program, with the current version covering fiscal years 2017  through 2022.", "Other transit agencies with aging infrastructure like WMATA have also  undertaken, or plan to carry out, large-scale rehabilitation projects that  involve extended disruptions to normal revenue service. For example, in  2013 CTA shut down the southern half of one of its lines for 5 months to  completely rebuild the railroad and renovate rail stations on the branch.  Additionally, NYCT is planning to shut down the Canarsie subway tunnel  connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn to facilitate extensive repairs from  damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Similarly, the Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey is rehabilitating tunnels used by its PATH  service between New Jersey and Manhattan and installing positive train  control technology, which can reduce the risk of accidental collision  between trains on the same track.", "In recent years, FTA has been provided with an expanded role in  overseeing public transportation safety within WMATA and in other transit  agencies. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP- 21) expanded FTA\u2019s safety oversight role over public transportation  systems and established the public transportation safety program,  providing FTA with new authority to inspect and audit a public  transportation system. This new authority also required FTA to  promulgate regulations requiring states to establish state safety oversight  programs and agencies for states\u2019 public transportation systems.  Additionally, MAP-21 provided FTA with more safety oversight authority  and more options for enforcement when transit agencies were found to be  out of compliance with federal safety laws. For example, in response to  concerns regarding WMATA\u2019s safety performance over the last decade,  FTA conducted a Safety Management Inspection of the WMATA rail and  bus systems. The Safety Management Inspection evaluated WMATA\u2019s  operations and maintenance programs, safety management capabilities,  and organizational structures. FTA found that, in recent years, WMATA  has implemented new management initiatives and programs to address  safety concerns, but organizational deficiencies and operational concerns  continue to limit WMATA\u2019s effectiveness in recognizing and resolving  safety issues. For example, FTA found that WMATA work crews do not  have sufficient access to the rail right-of-way to perform critical inspection,  testing, and maintenance activities. FTA also found serious safety lapses  in the rail operations control center. More broadly, FTA also reported that  in key areas, WMATA\u2019s organization is not effectively balancing safety- critical operations and maintenance activities with the demand for  passenger service.", "In response to WMATA safety incidents, FTA assumed temporary and  direct safety oversight of WMATA in October 2015. Specifically, as part of  its investigation of the January 2015 smoke and fire incident near the  L\u2019Enfant station, NTSB found that the Tri-State Oversight Committee\u2019s  safety oversight of WMATA was deficient and recommended that DOT  seek an amendment to federal law so that the Federal Railroad  Administration within DOT could exercise regulatory oversight over the  WMATA rail system. DOT agreed that the Tri-State Oversight  Committee was deficient and ineffective, but disagreed with NTSB that  the most urgent and effective solution was to transfer safety oversight of  WMATA\u2019s rail transit system to the Federal Railroad Administration.  Instead, in October 2015, DOT directed FTA to take direct and temporary  control of safety oversight at WMATA from the Tri-State Oversight  Committee. To perform direct safety oversight of WMATA, FTA  established the FTA WMATA Safety Oversight (FWSO) office, which is  currently comprised of FTA personnel, inspectors on detail from FRA, and  contractor support staff, according to FTA officials. In February 2016, FTA  found the Tri-State Oversight Committee was incapable of enforcing its  safety findings and thus, using new authority provided by the Fixing  Americas Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, FTA determined that it  would continue with its direct safety oversight of WMATA.", "FTA\u2019s FWSO and region three office, which includes the Washington  metropolitan area, have jointly managed oversight of SafeTrack. When  WMATA announced SafeTrack in May 2016, the FWSO was in place and  performed initial safety oversight of the project. However, FTA\u2019s various  regional offices exercise project management oversight over \u201cmajor  capital projects,\u201d which include, among other things, projects that involve  the rehabilitation or modernization of an existing fixed guideway with a  total project cost in excess of $100 million. Using this project  management oversight authority for major capital projects, FTA can  monitor the project\u2019s progress to determine whether a project is on time,  within budget, in conformance with design criteria, constructed to  approved plans and specifications, and is efficiently and effectively  implemented. According to FTA officials, FTA designated SafeTrack as  a major capital project based upon WMATA\u2019s decision to group together  funding from multiple FTA formula grants, as well as funding authorized  by PRIIA, and to manage those activities as a discrete project estimated  to cost more than $100 million. FTA\u2019s region three office provides project  management oversight of SafeTrack.", "FTA has other efforts to improve the safety and performance of public  transportation systems. For example, in July 2016, FTA issued its final  rule establishing a National Transit Asset Management System in  accordance with section 20019 of MAP\u201321. Transit agencies are  required to have an initial transit asset management plan completed by  October 2, 2018. Transit agencies\u2019 plans must include an inventory of  the number and type of capital assets and a condition assessment of  those inventoried assets for which a provider has direct capital  responsibility, among other elements. In August 2016, FTA also issued  a Public Transportation Safety Program final rule establishing rules to  support its administration of the public transportation safety program.  The rule provides the framework for FTA to monitor and enforce transit  safety."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA Did Not Fully Follow Leading Practices When Planning SafeTrack Because It Wanted to Address Safety Issues Immediately, but Future Projects Could Benefit from Additional Planning", "paragraphs": ["WMATA\u2019s planning of SafeTrack did not fully align with leading project  management practices, including some that are focused on projects for  rehabilitating transit assets.

WMATA did not  follow these practices because it believed it needed to start work  immediately to address critical safety issues. However, by not following  these leading practices, WMATA lacks assurance that the accelerated  approach taken with SafeTrack is the most effective way to identify and  address safety issues. WMATA also lacks a policy that requires, and  relevant procedures specifying how, it follow these leading planning  practices for large-scale rehabilitation projects.

Public transit agencies have a wide variety of assets to maintain,  including track and third rail infrastructure. The TCRP report on prioritizing  the rehabilitation of capital assets states that transit agencies should  collect detailed information on assets, including data on the age and  condition of infrastructure. The TCRP report also states that agencies  should use data to assess the conditions of assets. This assessment  should then form the basis of prioritizing rehabilitation work. Indeed,  according to TCRP, \u201cthe process of evaluating and prioritizing  rehabilitation and replacement work starts with collecting data on existing  transit capital assets.\u201d", "Though WMATA collected data on its track assets through inspections  when planning SafeTrack, those inspections were not comprehensive  because they focused on specific items like rail crossties and did not  cover all track-related infrastructure. Specifically, in 2015, WMATA  conducted inspections of its Metrorail track to collect data on the condition  of its track infrastructure and identify the work necessary to bring the track  to a state of good repair. The inspections were carried out by a contractor for WMATA\u2019s Track and Structures department as part of WMATA\u2019s  Track Quality Improvement Program (TQIP). According to WMATA  officials we spoke with, these inspections were necessary under TQIP  because they could not rely solely on track condition data in WMATA\u2019s  existing asset database. Indeed, WMATA\u2019s OIG recently found that  WMATA\u2019s asset database does not have adequate controls and oversight  in place to properly manage assets, among other concerns. WMATA  used the data collected in its 2015 inspections as the primary source for  identification of the most degraded areas of track, which would be subject  to SafeTrack surges. However, the data collected during the inspections  focused on the rail crossties and did not cover all infrastructure in the  Metrorail track area. For example, according to WMATA officials, the  inspections did not include an examination of all interlockings or of all  track power systems, including the electrical cables that power the third  rail system. According to WMATA officials we spoke with, these systems  were not included in the inspections because the Track and Structures  department leading the TQIP effort is not responsible for the maintenance  of other systems. Electrical cables, for example, are managed by  WMATA\u2019s Power Engineering department. Data on the condition of  assets in non-track systems has generally been collected by the  responsible department, but according to WMATA officials, these data  were not used to identify areas for SafeTrack work.", "Officials with other transit agencies we spoke with said that accurate and  comprehensive data on assets are crucial to identifying and prioritizing  rehabilitation efforts. For example, NYCT officials told us that they rely on  data from their transit asset management database to identify track  sections with the greatest number of defects, or areas in need of repair, to  prioritize sections of tracks for rehabilitation activities. MBTA officials we  spoke with said that their agency has developed a state-of-good-repair  database that includes an inventory of the age of assets that managers  can use to prioritize rehabilitation and replacement projects. Officials from CTA said they use a new asset management system, which has detailed  information on the condition of CTA\u2019s assets, to better identify and  prioritize capital projects.", "WMATA\u2019s planning of SafeTrack relied on limited data regarding the  condition of Metrorail assets, in part because the agency lacks internal  requirements governing the collection and use of asset information in  planning projects. More specifically, WMATA does not have a policy or  procedures requiring it to collect and use asset data, and coordinate with  other departments on the collection of such data when planning large- scale rehabilitation projects. To ensure that such proper management  practices are consistently carried out, the COSO internal control  framework used by WMATA states that management should set policies  establishing what is expected and relevant procedures specifying the  necessary actions to carry out the policy. As we reported recently, asset  management can help transit agencies optimize limited funding so that  they receive the \u201cbiggest bang for their buck\u201d when rehabilitating and  replacing assets. By not gathering and using detailed data on all  aspects of the track infrastructure when planning SafeTrack, WMATA  decision-makers may not have had sufficient information to develop  project objectives and properly prioritize SafeTrack work. Indeed, serious  safety incidents have continued to occur on the Metrorail system during  SafeTrack on assets that were not being addressed in the project. On  July 29, 2016, a train derailed near the East Falls Church station. This  derailment occurred on an interlocking, a part of track not scheduled at  that time for rehabilitation under SafeTrack. As a result of this incident,  WMATA modified the scope of future SafeTrack surges to include the  rehabilitation of interlockings. Additionally, FTA has directed WMATA to  complete safety critical work both prior to starting and during SafeTrack, resulting in changes to the scope and schedule of SafeTrack, as  discussed later in this report.", "Though WMATA did not utilize comprehensive asset information in  planning SafeTrack, it is developing a new inventory, as required by  FTA\u2019s 2016 Transit Asset Management final rule. More specifically,  WMATA is currently conducting a Transit Asset Inventory and Condition  Assessment, and is working with FTA to develop its new transit asset  inventory. According to WMATA, this effort will help ensure that it has a  complete, consistent, accurate, and centralized repository of relevant  asset-related data. A reliable repository of asset data can then facilitate  data-driven maintenance and capital investment decision making.  WMATA has completed the first of two phases for this assessment. In the  first phase, WMATA sought to conduct an initial asset inventory and  condition assessment. In the second phase, WMATA plans to further  develop how it will manage its assets and collect additional data, among  other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA\u2019s Analysis of Alternatives for Improving the State of Repair of the Track Did Not Align with Leading Practices", "paragraphs": ["Leading management practices for transit rehabilitation projects state that  transit agencies should have a policy in place for evaluating project  alternatives.

As noted above, the COSO internal controls  framework used by WMATA also states that management should  establish policies and procedures to help ensure that proper practices are  carried out.", "Though WMATA considered different plans for improving the state of  repair of its track infrastructure, it did not quantify the costs and impacts of  each alternative. WMATA currently lacks a policy requiring alternatives  analysis for large-scale rehabilitation projects. After collecting data from  track inspections in 2015, WMATA developed three alternatives for  improving the state of repair of its track infrastructure. These alternatives  included 8, 10, and 22-month work schedules. According to WMATA  officials, these alternatives included different levels of service disruptions,  including extensive single-tracking and track section closures, but generally included the same work tasks. According to WMATA officials,  they ultimately settled on the initially announced 10-month plan, dubbed  SafeTrack, because it best balanced rider disruption with addressing the  urgent safety needs of the system. Additionally, they said that WMATA\u2019s  ability to make effective and efficient use of time on the track was also a  primary consideration. However, WMATA did not fully assess the  alternatives to improving the state of its track infrastructure. In particular,  WMATA did not quantify the effects of the various alternatives on  extending the life of the track assets, on reducing maintenance costs, and  on Metrorail ridership. WMATA also did not quantify the costs or establish  a detailed budget for its alternatives and still has not determined the final  funding sources for its selected alternative. Although WMATA estimates  that the SafeTrack project will cost approximately $120 million to  complete, it has identified funding sources for about $80 million of these  costs and has yet to determine how it will fund the remaining $40 million.", "Other transit agencies we spoke with described detailed considerations of  alternatives to carrying out large-scale rehabilitation projects. For  example, CTA officials we spoke with said they developed and assessed  different plans to rehabilitate its Red Line South track, including estimates  of the costs and impacts of each alternative. Further, officials at PATH  told us that they selected a particular approach to upgrading a tunnel they  use for trains that travel from New Jersey to Manhattan, New York,  because it balanced rider disruption and work efficiency. The PATH  officials told us that they conducted approximately one year of planning in  advance of this project and developed seven different scenarios before  finally settling on the current approach.", "WMATA did not fully assess alternatives to rehabilitate its track assets  because it believed it needed to start work immediately to address critical  safety issues. At the time SafeTrack was planned, according to officials  we spoke with, WMATA leadership was making critical decisions on how  to address systemic deferred maintenance. Indeed, according to  WMATA\u2019s Chief Safety Officer, in a call on May 10, 2016, a senior official  within FTA\u2019S FWSO office notified WMATA that FTA was considering  taking action to \u201cshut down\u201d the entire Metrorail system due to safety  concerns. According to WMATA officials, SafeTrack was conceived as  WMATA\u2019s unique and necessary response to the state of its track  infrastructure. Further, WMATA officials noted that the agency is  committed to devoting the resources necessary to bring the track to a  state of good repair, and to developing preventative maintenance  programs that would prevent similar safety-critical situations in the future.", "Nevertheless, by not having a policy and procedures in place requiring  analysis of alternatives for future large-scale rehabilitation projects,  WMATA lacks a framework to comprehensively plan such projects to  meet their objectives. WMATA plans to spend over $56 million a year on  track rehabilitation projects alone starting in fiscal year 2018.

WMATA  therefore chose to manage SafeTrack using tools that they considered  more appropriately suited for managing coordinated maintenance tasks.  For example, WMATA uses detailed \u201cmarch charts\u201d to plan and coordinate its various maintenance tasks within surge work areas.  However, according to WMATA officials, they did not develop a plan that  clearly defined the budget, execution, monitoring, and control of the  project before beginning SafeTrack. According to FTA officials we spoke  with, FTA has discretion regarding when it determines a project is major  and when a project management plan must be submitted.

For example,  CTA officials we spoke with said that they conducted extensive planning,  and developed a project management plan, for their Red Line South  reconstruction project, even though they did not use federal funds and  therefore were not required by FTA to develop such a plan. Additionally,  in planning for the shutdown and rehabilitation of the Canarsie tunnel,  NYCT is developing a detailed plan that reflects its risk assessments and  analysis of lessons learned from previous work, according to the officials  we spoke with.", "Though WMATA developed SafeTrack as a unique response to the state  of its track infrastructure, future large-scale rehabilitation projects  undertaken by the agency would benefit from the development of a  comprehensive project management plan prior to the start of the project.  As discussed above, WMATA officials told us that they implemented  SafeTrack to respond to a critical safety situation and that they could not  postpone this track work to develop a project management plan.  SafeTrack, though, involves an unprecedented amount of track work  performed over an extended period, significantly disrupts ridership, and is  estimated to cost well over $100 million. WMATA currently lacks a policy  and procedures requiring the development of a project management plan  for large-scale rehabilitation projects like SafeTrack, according to WMATA  officials, regardless of whether the work is to be completed in response to  an emergency situation or within WMATA\u2019s normal state of good repair  efforts. The COSO internal controls framework used by WMATA states  that management should have policies establishing what is expected of  management and employees, to help mitigate risks to achieving goals.  Although WMATA told us that it has a manual on project implementation  that is focused on the implementation and close-out phases of a project, it does not yet cover the planning phase. Further, although a project  management plan is required for public-transportation-related major  capital projects receiving federal financial assistance, WMATA may  undertake future large-scale rehabilitation projects that do not meet the  major capital project definition or that do not use federal funds at all.

According to WMATA officials, although  prior to SafeTrack inspections focused solely on track assets such as the  condition of crossties, pre-surge inspections have since included  assessments on the condition of both track and non-track assets, such as  power cables. However, the number of assets planned for maintenance  or replacement in each surge varies depending on the conditions of the  assets in question. WMATA officials told us that during each surge, they  regularly discuss progress with departments that are responsible for  ensuring completion of scheduled work, as well as monitoring teams\u2019  work quality and site safety. At the end of each surge, WMATA officials  have compiled totals for all work completed, after verification and  completion of the various departments\u2019 quality control processes.  WMATA has then compared the completed work against the pre-surge  work plan. WMATA has used the completed work data to develop its  surge progress reports, which it issues to stakeholders and makes  available to the public at the end of each surge. However, although  WMATA is collecting information on the condition of assets repaired  through SafeTrack, WMATA does not have a policy or procedures  requiring it to use asset data when planning future large-scale  rehabilitation projects, as previously discussed.", "WMATA has also used work performance data and information to identify  the amount of rehabilitation work that can be performed during a given  maintenance window. For example, WMATA is not replacing all crossties  within a given SafeTrack segment; rather, its goal is to ensure that 75  percent of the ties in a surge area are in good condition so that it will not  need to replace all of them at the same time in the future. WMATA officials stated they believe that this approach will allow them to move to a  more sustainable crosstie replacement model, eliminate maintenance  backlog, and achieve a state of good repair for those assets. WMATA has  also incorporated other types of data, such as logistical constraints for  available work crews and equipment, to inform its assessment of how  work will be accomplished during each surge. See figure 3 for select track  assets that have undergone repair or replacement during SafeTrack.", "The work performance data collected by WMATA demonstrate that  WMATA has renewed or replaced a substantial amount of track  infrastructure, as well as other non-track assets, during the course of  SafeTrack.

For example, WMATA reported  that by limiting service for 13 days on the Red Line from Shady Grove to  Twinbrook, it was able to replace over 3,500 crossties; this work would  have taken more than 2 years to complete if performed only after the end  of the rail system\u2019s service each day. As shown in table 1, through the  first 10 surges, WMATA has replaced more than 26,000 crossties, with its  goal being to replace over 45,000 crossties when the project is  complete.

For example, WMATA officials said that over the  course of the initial SafeTrack surges, they evaluated their work  procedures and refined their approach to replacing rail crossties. In  particular, they acquired new machines to remove ties and install rail  spikes, and implemented better scheduling of the machines and work  crews to facilitate more efficient crosstie replacement. As another  example, during the course of the initial SafeTrack surges, WMATA  officials learned to define clear work limits prior to each surge to improve  work efficiency.

Maintenance  groups are to provide the first level of review, with managers assessing  the quality of the work completed by crews, such as installation and  maintenance of assets, and documenting their findings on quality control  checklists. Second, QICO is responsible for assessing the overall quality  of completed work by reviewing a sample of work tasks competed during  the surge, and providing feedback for work teams on quality and safety  concerns. This feedback includes preparing surge closeout reports that  document any quality, safety, or other concerns and reporting them to  WMATA leadership and the relevant work teams involved. The work  teams must then address and close out any quality deficiencies through  ongoing maintenance activities. Last, the WMATA OIG and Board of  Directors are responsible for monitoring internal performance at the  agency and approving manager-level decisions regarding quality control  and assurance. In addition to this review structure, the QICO team is also  developing an enterprise-wide Quality Management System, in  accordance with the FTA\u2019s Quality Management Systems Guidelines, that  is intended to clearly define WMATA\u2019s organizational objectives with  respect to quality assurance.

Through SafeTrack, WMATA has accomplished a substantial amount of  repair work to bring its track infrastructure closer to a state of good repair.  WMATA is also learning some important lessons in implementing  SafeTrack that could better equip it to identify and address issues in  future large-scale rehabilitation projects. Perhaps more importantly,  SafeTrack indicates that WMATA is now committed to preventative  maintenance, including the repairing of track assets before they break  and cause more cost and safety impacts on Metrorail riders. Though  SafeTrack consists largely of routine maintenance work, the intensity,  length, cost, and disruption of the effort distinguishes it from normal  maintenance work. As a result of the urgent need for work on the track  infrastructure and the unique nature of SafeTrack, WMATA\u2019s planning of  SafeTrack did not fully align with leading practices, and WMATA likely  experienced some early challenges as a result. These challenges  highlight the importance of comprehensive planning and project  management for large-scale rehabilitation projects to minimize the  impacts on riders and ensure work is completed efficiently and according  to quality standards. Indeed, SafeTrack is not a comprehensive approach  to addressing WMATA\u2019s safety needs and additional efforts will be  needed to bring the entire Metrorail system to a state of good repair.  Without a policy requiring planning processes that are more consistent  with leading project management practices, which call for thorough  analysis, planning, and informed decision-making, WMATA\u2019s ability to  effectively address future infrastructure challenges may be limited. This  situation is particularly true for future large-scale rehabilitation projects  that may not be designated as major capital projects and subject to FTA\u2019s  project management oversight authority, but which could still benefit from  having a project management plan in place before beginning the project,  consistent with leading practices.
