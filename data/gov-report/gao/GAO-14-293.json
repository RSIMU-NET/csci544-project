Specifically, licensees face challenges in (1) securing mobile and stationary sources and (2) protecting against an insider threat. Regarding mobile sources, their portability makes them susceptible to theft or loss, as the size of some of these sources is small enough for them to be easily concealed. The most common mobile source is contained in a device called a radiography camera. GAO identified four incidents from 2006 to 2012 where such cameras that use high-risk sources to test pipeline welds were stolen. These thefts occurred even though the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established increased security controls. Licensees also face challenges in determining which employees are suitable for trustworthiness and reliability (T&R) certification to have unescorted access to high-risk radiological sources. GAO found two cases where employees were granted unescorted access, even though each had extensive criminal histories, and one had been convicted for terroristic threats, which include a range of violent threats. In this case, NRC said that the person was convicted not of a threat against the United States, but of making violent verbal threats against two individuals. It is unclear whether these cases represent isolated incidents or a systemic weakness in the T&R process established by NRC. Without an assessment of the process, NRC may not have reasonable assurance that access decisions made by licensees can prevent threats to high-risk radiological sources, particularly by a determined insider.", "Federal agencies responsible for securing radiological sources\u2014including NRC, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014have taken steps to improve the security of industrial radiological sources. For example, NRC is developing a best practices guide that is expected to provide licensees with practical information about how to secure their sources. Also, NNSA is developing new technology that would, if successful, improve tracking of radiological sources while in transit. However, GAO found that although the agencies have been meeting quarterly to discuss, among other things, radiological security, this mechanism did not always help them collaborate and draw on each agency's expertise during research, development, and testing of a new technology for a mobile source tracking device. By not collaborating consistently, the agencies have missed opportunities to leverage resources and expertise in developing this new technology to track radiological sources. This technology could aid in the timely recovery of a lost or stolen radiological source and support the agencies' common mission. As GAO has previously reported, when responsibilities cut across more than one federal agency\u2014as they do for securing industrial radiological sources\u2014it is important for agencies to work collaboratively to deliver results more efficiently and in a way that is consistent with the federal government's multiple demands and limited resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that NRC assess the T&R process to determine if it provides reasonable assurance against insider threats. In addition, GAO recommends that NNSA, NRC, and DHS review their collaboration mechanism for opportunities to enhance it, especially in the development of new technologies.

Some of  these sources are highly radioactive and are found in a wide variety of  devices, ranging from mobile industrial radiography sources containing  hundreds of curies of iridium-192 to larger irradiators with thousands, or  even millions, of curies of cobalt-60. The facilities where these sources  are contained include, among other things, warehouses, commercial  facilities, and research buildings. becquerels. explosives are used to disperse radioactive material. Previous incidents  involving radiological sources provide a measure of understanding for  what could happen in the case of a dirty bomb attack. For example, in  1987, an accident involving an abandoned teletherapy machine, which is  used to treat cancer by focusing a beam of radiation from a highly active  radiological source at affected tissue, killed four people and injured more  in central Brazil. The radiological source in the teletherapy device  contained about 1,400 curies of cesium-137. The accident and its  aftermath caused about $36 million in damages to the region, according  to an official from Brazil\u2019s Nuclear Energy Commission. The accident  significantly contaminated 85 houses and created environmental and  medical problems.

For example, radioactive  materials used for certain diagnostic imaging may not present a  significant safety or security risk due to their low levels of activity.  However, high-risk sealed radiological sources that contain cobalt-60,  cesium-137, or iridium-192 could pose a greater threat to the public and  the environment and a potentially more significant security risk,  particularly if acquired by terrorists to produce a dirty bomb. Industrial  radiological sources are used in, among other things: (1) industrial  radiography devices for testing the integrity of welds, (2) well logging  devices in oil and gas production, (3) research irradiators in the  aerospace sector, and (4) panoramic and underwater irradiators used to  sterilize industrial products.", "NRC oversees licensees through three regional offices located in  Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Texas.

We recommended, among other things, that NRC strengthen its  security controls by providing medical facilities with specific measures  they must take to develop and sustain a more effective security program,  including specific direction on the use of cameras and alarms.

Specifically, in 2006, the theft of a radiography camera in her  state prompted the governor to petition NRC to consider requiring GPS  for vehicles carrying high-risk sources, such as radiography cameras, or  allow states the flexibility to implement more stringent security measures  than those required by NRC. In the petition, the governor pointed to a  separate incident where a smaller radioactive source in a portable gauge  was stolen, but it was quickly recovered due to a GPS tracking feature on  the phone of the operator. In response to the petition, NRC informed  Washington State that the issues raised in the petition would be  considered in the ongoing Part 37 rulemaking. However, in March 2013,  NRC denied the petitioner\u2019s request and did not require GPS tracking in  the final Part 37 rule.

For example, many of the facilities we visited did not have  security measures of the type often recommended by NNSA as part of   Examples of facilities we visited that  their voluntary security upgrades.met NRC\u2019s security controls but still had potential security vulnerabilities  include the following:", "At one facility, we observed that a warehouse storing 25 iridium-192  radiography cameras had an exterior rolltop door that was open and  unattended (see fig. 6). Once inside the warehouse, we also observed  that the wall acting as one of the barriers to the sources did not go  from the floor to the ceiling. When we asked the NRC security  inspector who accompanied us about the barrier, the inspector told us  that the licensee was in compliance with NRC\u2019s security controls  because the sources were secured through other measures\u2014such as  locks and a motion detector. The inspector told us that while the  security measures in place were not optimal, there were no apparent  security violations.", "At another facility, we observed a cesium-137 irradiator with  approximately 800 curies that was on wheels and in close proximity to  a loading dock rollup door that was secured with a simple padlock  (see fig. 7). The irradiator was stored in a vault that had a reinforced  sliding door and a motion detector that was activated after normal  working hours. The licensee told us that the wheels on the irradiator  were needed to move the device to different parts of the facility when  conducting research. During our visit, we observed that the sliding  door to the vault\u2014which is one of the security measures used by the  licensee\u2014was left open for ease of access. In our September 2012  report, we identified a similar situation at a medical facility and  concluded that although the facility met NRC\u2019s security controls, it  could be vulnerable because of the limited security we observed and  the mobility of the irradiator.", "We also observed unsecured exterior skylights at a number of  warehouses that contained radiological sources ranging from iridium-192  radiography cameras to higher curie levels of cobalt-60 and cesium-137  used for industrial research and manufacturing. Of the 33 industrial  facilities we visited, 9 had unsecured skylights. When we questioned an  NRC safety and security inspector who accompanied us on the visit about  the unsecured skylights, he noted that the licensees met NRC\u2019s security  controls because the sources were secured in a locked container, and he  said that these skylights did not pose a security vulnerability. Figure 8  shows examples of unsecured skylights.", "We also identified two types of stationary sources that pose unique  security challenges due to (1) how americium-241 sources are currently  being stored at some well logging facilities and (2) the large curie levels of  cobalt-60 sources found in panoramic irradiators.", "Well logging is a process used to determine whether a well has the  potential to produce oil. Some well logging storage facilities with large  amounts of americium-241, including two facilities that we visited, are  potentially more vulnerable to theft as they have not implemented NRC\u2019s  security controls. Under NRC\u2019s security controls, increased security  measures are triggered by the type and amounts of curies of radiological  sources. For example, licensees with americium-241 are required to  implement NRC\u2019s security controls when the radiological sources in their  possession total 16 curies or more. Under the security controls, multiple  sources of the same type are added together for regulatory purposes only  if they are \u201ccollocated.\u201d NRC considers these sources to be collocated if  someone could gain access to them by breaching a single physical  barrier. However, some well logging licensees do not come under NRC\u2019s  security controls because they separate their americium-241 into  quantities that are not considered collocated. For example, these  licensees may store quantities of this source in multiple separately locked  containers, which function as barriers, so they do not meet the definition  of being collocated. Figure 9 shows an example how licensees could  store americium-241 in separate containers that would not be considered  collocated, and therefore, not under NRC\u2019s controls. As a result, a  segment of facilities with large quantities of radiological sources falls  outside of NRC\u2019s increased security controls, including security  inspections for the increased controls.identified the security of radioactive sources as a top agency priority to  prevent the use of such sources by terrorists.

Officials at almost half of the facilities we visited told us that they  face challenges in making T&R determations. These challenges include  limited security experience and training and incomplete information to  determine an employee\u2019s suitability for unescorted access.", "Before a licensee can grant an employee unescorted access to high-risk  radiological sources, NRC security controls require the licensee, among  other things, to: (1) conduct employment and education background  checks; (2) perform an identification and criminal history check that  includes taking the employee\u2019s fingerprints and sending them to NRC,  which forwards the fingerprints to the FBI; and (3) determine that the  individual is trustworthy and reliable. These controls are intended to  mitigate the risk of an insider threat\u2014an employee or someone else with  authorized access who might be trying to steal, tamper with, or sabotage  radiological sources. NNSA officials told us that they consider an insider  threat to be the primary threat to facilities with radiological sources.  According to an NNSA Fact Sheet, almost all known cases of theft of  nuclear and radiological material involved an insider. The document  states that skills, knowledge, access, and authority held by some insiders  make the threat difficult to mitigate. As a result, great care must be taken  in determining the T&R of employees who are granted unescorted access  in facilities with high-risk radiological sources.", "Under NRC\u2019s security controls, the criminal history check is performed by  the FBI, submitted to NRC, and forwarded to the licensee. NRC\u2019s controls  place the responsibility on the licensee to evaluate all the information and  determine whether the employee is trustworthy and reliable. In its Part 37  regulations, NRC codified the process for criminal history check and  review generally as established in the orders. In response to its proposal  for these regulations, NRC received comments stating that it should  provide specific criteria\u2014such as disqualifying convictions\u2014for use by  licensees with respect to the T&R determination. However, NRC declined  to provide specific criteria, stating that it is the licensee\u2019s responsibility to  consider all information and make a determination. An NRC official told us  that this was a policy choice by the Commission. The official said that  NRC\u2019s role in the T&R determinations is limited, but NRC inspectors may  review a licensee\u2019s records during a site inspection. However, the official  told us that such a review is limited to whether the licensee obtained the  required types of information, not the merits of the licensee\u2019s  determination to grant unescorted access to an individual.", "NRC has provided licensees with a number of indicators to consider when  evaluating an individual\u2019s T&R. Some of these include the following:  conduct that warrants referral for criminal investigation or results in  arrest or conviction; uncontrolled anger, violation of safety or security procedures, or attempted or threatened destruction of property or life; and  the frequency and recency of the conduct.", "NRC implementation guidance states that these indicators are not meant  to be all inclusive or be disqualifying factors. Moreover, NRC\u2019s guidance  states that it is a licensee\u2019s business decision as to what criteria it uses  for the basis of the T&R determination. NRC guidance\u2014as well as its  new regulations\u2014does not specify how a licensee should evaluate an  individual\u2019s T&R. For example, NRC\u2019s current and former implementation  guidance do not include indicators that would disqualify an employee from  receiving unescorted access. Instead, each case must be judged on its  own merits, and final determination remains the responsibility of the  licensee. NRC\u2019s implementation guidance also states that the  requirements are not intended to stop determined adversaries intent on  malevolent action from gaining access to the radioactive sources. Rather,  this implementation guidance is designed to provide reasonable  assurance that individuals with unescorted access to the radiological  sources are trustworthy and reliable and that facilities have a reliable  means to monitor events that are potentially malevolent and have a  process for prompt police response.", "Under NRC\u2019s security controls, it is left to the licensee to decide whether  to grant unescorted access, even if an individual has been indicted or  convicted for a violent crime or terrorism, and the licensee is not required  to consult with NRC before granting T&R access. Officials at 7 of the 33  licensees we reviewed said that they have granted unescorted access to  high-risk radiological sources to individuals with criminal histories. We  found two cases where employees of industrial radiographers in two  different states were granted unescorted access despite having serious  criminal records.", "Case 1: Individual with numerous criminal convictions. In one case, a  T&R official told us that she granted unescorted access to an  individual in 2008 with an extensive criminal history, some of which  was included on the FBI report the company received from NRC, and  some that was absent. This criminal history included two convictions  for terroristic threat that occurred in 1996, which were not included in  the background information provided to the T&R official by NRC.  While NRC\u2019s security orders do not preclude granting unescorted  access to radiological sources to persons with convictions for  terroristic activity (or other serious crimes), the T&R official said that  had she been aware of the individual\u2019s convictions for terroristic  threat, she would not have granted him unescorted access. Based on  available documents, we identified that the individual had been  arrested and convicted multiple times between 1996 and 2008. These  convictions included the following: terroristic threat (twice), assault,  forgery, failure to appear in court, driving while intoxicated, and driving  with a suspended license. According to that state\u2019s statute, a  terroristic threat includes any offense involving violence to any person  or property with intent to, among other things: place the public or a  substantial group of the public in fear of serious bodily injury; place  any person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; or prevent or  interrupt the occupation or use of a building, place of assembly, place  of employment or occupation, aircraft, automobile, or other form of  conveyance. According to NRC officials, identification of a criminal  history through the FBI or a discretionary local criminal history check  does not automatically indicate unreliability or untrustworthiness of an  individual. The licensee may authorize individuals with criminal  records for unescorted access to radioactive materials  notwithstanding the individual\u2019s criminal history.", "In 2010, the individual was declared to be a substantial threat by the  Agreement State\u2019s licensing agency after he impersonated a  radiography inspector and was hostile toward radiographers in the  field, as previously discussed. An investigation performed by the state  health department concluded that the individual was a threat to public  health and safety, and he subsequently surrendered his state  radiography license. It was not clear from available information why  the terroristic threats and other convictions did not appear on the FBI  criminal background check or why the official deemed the individual  trustworthy and reliable. We brought this case to NRC\u2019s attention after  learning about it in February 2014. In response, NRC officials said  that they contacted the Agreement State office to gather relevant  information and independently evaluate whether the situation  represented an isolated incident or if it was indicative of a  programmatic issue. Based on their initial review, the officials said that  they believed the event was an isolated incident. However, without an  assessment of the T&R process, NRC will not be able to determine  the extent to which this case may represent a larger problem or if  corrective actions are needed.", "Case 2: Individual caught stealing from company. In another case, an  industrial radiographer in charge of making T&R determinations told  us that an individual with an extensive criminal record was granted  unescorted access to radiological sources. The T&R official told us  that he considered the individual a risk and objected to granting him  unescorted access, but he was overruled by his supervisor. The  employee who had been granted access was subsequently arrested  for stealing from the company.", "Without more complete information and specific guidance on how to  evaluate an individual\u2019s T&R, licensees could continue to face challenges  in making decisions about the suitability of personnel who are granted  unescorted access to high-risk radiological sources, elevating the risk of  an insider threat, which NNSA has identified as being responsible for  almost all known cases of theft of nuclear and radiological material. As  noted above, NRC\u2019s approach to providing reasonable assurance to an  insider threat is to require licensees to collect and to consider various  types of information, including an FBI criminal history, and to make a  determination based on the licensee\u2019s judgment, without any NRC- identified disqualifying criteria. Therefore, nothing in the NRC controls or  guidance precluded the licensees in these two examples from approving  access.

Under cost-sharing arrangements, NNSA officials told us that  they are collaborating with industry partners from both the industrial  radiography and well logging industries who have agreed to provide  support for development, design reviews, and field testing of prototype  systems. According to the officials, this technology, if successful, would  allow for (1) real-time tracking and monitoring of the source in storage,  during transport, and during temporary storage within the transport  vehicle, (2) immediate notification of a potential loss or theft situation to a  central monitoring location, and (3) assistance in recovering a source that  is lost or stolen. NNSA officials said that they plan to complete the  development of the tracking systems and transfer the technology to one  or more vendors for commercial manufacture and sale by summer 2015.  Individual industrial radiography and well logging companies would be  able to purchase the systems directly from the commercial manufacturer.  To encourage use of the technology, NNSA is also evaluating if the  government should subsidize all or a portion of the cost of the systems  and, if so, for all potential users, or a particular group of users meeting  certain criteria.

To date, NNSA has  focused most of its attention and planning\u2014and expended the majority of  available funds for making such upgrades\u2014on U.S. medical facilities. As  of June 2013, NNSA had completed security upgrades at approximately  one-quarter of all U.S. hospitals and medical facilities with high-risk  radiological sources at a total cost of $135 million. NNSA officials said  that the agency\u2019s focus on medical facilities is due primarily to the large  number of facilities that, in their view, pose a more immediate risk  because they are located in and around urban areas, contain large  quantities of high-risk sources, and include buildings that are generally  more accessible to the general public. However, these officials said that,  as the number of medical facilities left to upgrade decreases, the program  has begun to focus on industrial facilities and is finding that these facilities  (particularly in the panoramic irradiation, industrial radiography, and well  logging industries) may require unique security solutions and an updated  budget estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Are Not Always Effectively Collaborating on Technology Development", "paragraphs": ["Although DHS, NNSA, and NRC have an interagency mechanism for  collaborating on, among other things, radiological security, they were not  always doing so effectively.

DHS collaborated with NRC and several DOE national  laboratories to develop the study but did not share the results with key  NNSA officials who are directly involved in radiological source security.  According to DHS officials, they made NNSA aware of the report through  their quarterly meetings of senior officials, but NNSA officials with  responsibility for securing radiological sources told us that they were not  aware of the report until we brought it to their attention during the course  of our review.

However, due to the serious nature  of the security problems identified in our report, this reevaluation of the  definition of collocation and the T&R process should be conducted by  NRC with a greater sense of urgency. If NRC follows its current plan to  address these recommendations in the time frame outlined in its  comment letter, the review will not occur until 1 to 2 years after  implentation of 10 C.F.R. Part 37. In the case of the 37 Agreement  States, the earliest the review would occur is 1 to 2 years afer they issue  their own compatible regulations\u2014required by March 2016. The longer it  takes for licensees to implement the security upgrades, the greater the  risk that potentially dangerous radiological sources remain vulnerable and  could be used as terrorist weapons.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the  Administrator of NNSA, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the appropriate  congressional committees, and other interested parties. In addition, this  report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff members have any questions concerning this report,  please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or trimbled@gao.gov.

We also performed work at the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) because they are also involved in securing  radiological sources, and we interviewed officials with responsibility for  radiological security at the Department of Transportation (DOT) and  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In addition, we  interviewed an expert in the field of nuclear security, representatives from  state government, and safety and security personnel at U.S. industrial  facilities to discuss their views on how radiological sources are secured.", "We visited 33 industrial facilities in California, Colorado, Hawaii,  Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. These facilities included 15  industrial radiography companies, 6 commercial or sterilization  companies, 5 academic research facilities, 3 well logging companies, 2  manufacturing and distribution companies, and 2 USDA facilities. The 33  facilities we visited are a nongeneralizable sample, selected on the basis  of whether they were NRC states or Agreement States, the amount of  curies contained in the devices using radiological sources, and the types  of radiological devices. In addition, we considered if the site had  undergone security upgrades funded by NNSA, and whether the site is  located in a large urban area. At each location, we interviewed facility  staff responsible for implementing procedures to secure the radiological  sources, including questions about the use of security measures and if  the licensee had made contact with NNSA. We also met with security  personnel at sites, when available, and spoke to officials at some local  law enforcement agencies responsible for security breaches.", "We used NNSA\u2019s G-2 database, which aggregates data from NRC\u2019s  National Source Tracking System (NSTS), to identify the location of  industrial radiological sources, determine the different types of industrial  devices that use radiological sources, and quantify curie amounts for  different types of radiological sources. The G-2 data is based on  information extracted from the NRC\u2019s 2011 NSTS database, the NRC\u2019s  2008 Sealed Source Inventory, and NNSA project team visits. G-2  contains all buildings in the United States that have risk-significant  radiological sources (> 10 curies). To determine the reliability of these  data, we conducted electronic testing and interviewed staff at NNSA and  NRC about the reliability of these data. We tested these data to ensure  their completeness and accuracy, and we determined that these data  were sufficiently reliable to use in selecting locations to visit and  summarizing the total number of facilities and the total number of curies.", "To evaluate the challenges industrial licensees with industrial radiological  sources face in securing these sources, we reviewed laws, regulations,  and guidance related to the security of industrial radiological sources. We  interviewed agency officials at NRC, NNSA, DHS, DOT, and USDA. We  also interviewed state government officials in three states, and safety and  security personnel at 33 industrial facilities we visited in six states, to  obtain their views on how radiological sources are secured and what  challenges they face in securing them. To identify thefts and incidents  involving radiological sources, we reviewed relevant documentation and  spoke to federal and state officials. We also spoke to officials at 33  industrial facilities we visited in California, Colorado, Hawaii,  Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. At the facilities, we observed the  security measures in place and spoke to officials in charge of  implementing NRC and Agreement State security controls and  overseeing the security measures.", "To learn what steps federal agencies are taking to ensure radiological  sources are secured at industrial facilities, we obtained information from  and interviewed agency officials at NRC, NNSA, DOT, DHS, and USDA  who are involved in securing sources and undertaking studies evaluating  technologies related to source security. We also obtained information  from Agreement States and NRC regions by reviewing documentation  and interviewing officials at four Agreement States (California, Colorado,  Texas, and Washington State) and one NRC regional office (Region IV)  with responsibility for overseeing high-risk radiological sources. We  selected these states and the NRC region based on the amount of curies  and number of devices in the state containing radiological sources and  the types of devices used. We also interviewed officials at DOE\u2019s Pacific  Northwest National Laboratory about the status of efforts made to  strengthen remote tracking of mobile devices containing radiological  sources. We visited industrial facilities that received NNSA funded  upgrades and security assessments in California, Hawaii, and  Pennsylvania. To determine the costs of NNSA\u2019s security upgrades for  industrial facilities, we obtained cost data from NNSA and interviewed the  agency official who manages NNSA\u2019s Global Threat Reduction Initiative  program. These data were used to determine the number of U.S.  industrial facilities that have received NNSA security upgrades, as well as  the total cost for completing these upgrades. We discussed the reliability  of these data with knowledgeable NNSA officials and questioned them  about the system\u2019s controls to verify the accuracy and completeness of  the data. We also analyzed these data for missing information and  obvious outliers. We found the data sufficiently reliable for our reporting  purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 to June 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
