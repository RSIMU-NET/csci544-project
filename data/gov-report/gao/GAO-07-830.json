SEC's Division of Enforcement (Enforcement) is charged with investigating securities law violations; recommending civil enforcement actions when appropriate, either in a federal court or before an administrative law judge; and negotiating settlements on behalf of the Commission. The types of sanctions that Enforcement can seek on behalf of the Commission include monetary penalties or fines and disgorgements of the profits that individuals or companies may derive by having committed securities violations. While SEC has only civil authority, it also works with various law enforcement agencies, including the United States Department of Justice (Justice), to bring criminal cases when appropriate. In addition, Enforcement is responsible for overseeing the Fair Fund program, which seeks to compensate investors who suffer losses resulting from fraud or other securities violations by individuals and companies. Under the Fair Fund program, SEC can combine the proceeds of monetary penalties and disgorgements into a single fund and then distribute the proceeds to harmed investors. In recent years, Enforcement has initiated high-profile actions that resulted in record civil fines against companies and senior officers and in some cases contributed to criminal convictions. However, the capacity of SEC in general and Enforcement in particular to appropriately plan and effectively manage their activities and fulfill their critical law enforcement and investor protection responsibilities on an ongoing basis has been criticized in the past. Although SEC received a substantial increase in its appropriations as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, questions have been raised in Congress and elsewhere on the extent to which the agency is using these resources to better fulfill its mission. Moreover, we have reported that aspects of Enforcement's information systems and management procedures could limit the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. For example, we found in 2004 that Enforcement faced challenges in developing the advanced information technology necessary to facilitate the investigative process. In addition, we reported in 2005 that the distribution of funds to harmed investors under the Fair Fund program was limited and that Enforcement had not developed adequate systems and data to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. Because of congressional interest in ensuring that SEC effectively manages its resources and helps ensure compliance with securities laws and regulations, Congress requested that we review key Enforcement management processes and systems and follow up on our previous work where appropriate. Accordingly, this report evaluates Enforcement's (1) internal processes and information systems for planning, tracking, and closing investigations and planned changes to these processes and systems; (2) implementation of SEC's Fair Fund program responsibilities; and (3) efforts to coordinate investigative activities with other SEC divisions and federal and state law enforcement agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement's processes and systems for planning, tracking, and closing investigations have had some significant limitations that have hampered the division's capacity to effectively manage its operations and allocate limited resources. While Enforcement and SEC officials are aware of these deficiencies and have recently begun addressing them, additional actions are necessary to help ensure that the planned improvements fully address limitations in the division's operations. In March 2007, Enforcement said it would centrally review and approve all new investigations of potential securities law violations by individuals or companies. Under Enforcement's previous, largely decentralized approach, the division was not always able to ensure the efficient allocation of resources or maintain quality control in the investigative process. While the new centralized approach was designed to help address these issues, Enforcement has not yet established written procedures and criteria for reviewing and approving new investigations. Without such procedures and criteria, Enforcement may face challenges in consistently communicating the new approach to existing and new staff. The lack of written procedures and criteria could also limit the Commission's ability to evaluate the implementation of the new approach and help ensure that the division is managing its operations and resources efficiently. Recognizing that the division's current information system for tracking investigations and enforcement actions--Case Activity Tracking System (CATS)--is severely limited as a management tool, Enforcement plans to start using a new system (the Hub) by late 2007. The deficiencies of CATS include its inability to produce detailed reports on investigations of certain types or the status of such investigations. While the Hub is designed to address many of CATS's deficiencies the way that the system is being implemented may not address all existing limitations. More specifically, Enforcement has not established written controls to help ensure that staff enter investigative data in the Hub in a timely and consistent manner. Without such controls, management reports generated by the Hub may have limited usefulness, and the system's capacity to assist Enforcement in better managing ongoing investigations will not be fully realized. In May 2007, Enforcement implemented procedures to help ensure the prompt closure of investigations that are no longer being pursued and thereby better ensure the fair treatment of individuals and companies under review, but these procedures do not fully address the entire backlog of these investigations. One regional Enforcement official said that as of March 2007, nearly 300 of the office's 840 open investigations were 2 or more years old, were no longer being pursued, and had no pending enforcement actions. Enforcement officials said that the failure to close such investigations promptly could have negative consequences for individuals and companies no longer suspected of having committed securities violations. They attributed the failure to close many investigations to several factors, such as time-consuming administrative requirements for attorneys to prepare detailed investigation closing memorandums that then must be routed to senior division officials for review and approval. To address these issues, Enforcement plans to inform individuals and companies more promptly that they are no longer under review and expedite the review and closure of the existing backlog of investigations for which administrative tasks have been completed (as of March 2007, there were 464 such investigations). However, Enforcement's plans do not include clearing the potentially large backlog of investigations for which such administrative tasks have not been completed, which could be negatively impacting individuals and companies no longer actively under review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) ability to conduct  investigations and bring enforcement actions for violations of securities  laws is critical to its mission to protect investors and maintain fair and  orderly markets.

The agency has a five-member Commission that the President  appoints, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and that a Chairman  designated by the President leads. The Commission oversees SEC\u2019s  operations and provides final approval of SEC\u2019s interpretation of federal  securities laws, proposals for new or amended rules to govern securities  markets, and enforcement activities. Table 1 identifies several key SEC  units and summarizes their roles and responsibilities.", "SEC\u2019s current 2004-2009 strategic plan established four goals: (1) enforce  compliance with the federal securities laws, (2) promote healthy capital  markets through an effective and flexible regulatory environment, (3)  foster informed investment decision-making, and (4) maximize the use of  SEC resources. Enforcement and OCIE share joint responsibility for  implementing the agency\u2019s first strategic goal. The Commission and the  Office of the Executive Director, which develops and implements all the  agency\u2019s management policies, are updating the agency\u2019s strategic plan,  which is to be issued in the summer of 2007.", "Enforcement personnel are located in SEC\u2019s home office in Washington,  D.C., as well as the agency\u2019s 11 regional offices. Enforcement staff  located in the home office include the director and one of two deputy  directors, five investigative groups or Offices of Associate Directors, as  well as internal support groups, including its Offices of Chief Counsel and  Chief Accountant (see fig. 1). An associate director heads each Office of  Associate Director and has one or more assistant directors. Branch chiefs  report to assistant directors and supervise the work of investigative staff  attorneys assigned to individual investigations, with review and support  provided by division management. SEC regional office staff are typically  divided between Enforcement and OCIE personnel. Enforcement units in  the regional offices have Office of Associate Director structures similar to  those in the home office and report to the Director of Enforcement in  Washington, D.C.", "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 substantially increased SEC\u2019s  appropriations, and Enforcement subsequently increased its staffing  levels. In 2002, Enforcement had 1,012 staff and, at the end of fiscal year  2006, 1,273 staff. As shown in figure 2, the number of investigative  attorneys in Enforcement increased substantially, from 596 in 2002 to 740  in 2005. However, the number of staff in Enforcement, in particular its  investigative attorneys, decreased from 2005 to 2006 because of a May  2005 hiring freeze (instituted across the agency in response to diminished  budgetary resources) and subsequent attrition. Since October 2006,  however, SEC has permitted Enforcement and other SEC divisions and  offices to replace staff that leave the agency. However, the agency does  not contemplate returning to early 2005 staffing levels. Appendix II  provides additional information on Enforcement\u2019s staffing resources and  workload indicators.", "Figure 3 provides a general overview Enforcement\u2019s investigative process.  At the initial stage of the investigative process, attorneys evaluate  information that may indicate the existence of past or imminent securities  laws violations. The information can come from sources such as tips or  complaints from the public as well as referrals from other SEC divisions or  government agencies. If Enforcement staff decide to pursue the matter,  they will open either a Matter Under Inquiry (MUI) or an investigation.  Staff open a MUI when more information is required to determine the  merits of an investigation; otherwise, staff may open an investigation  immediately. Investigations can be conducted informally\u2014without  Commission approval\u2014or formally, in which case the Commission must  first approve a formal order if staff find it necessary to issue subpoenas for  testimony or documentation. Based on the analysis of collected evidence,  Enforcement will decide whether or not to recommend that the  Commission pursue enforcement actions, which can be administrative or  federal civil court actions (both of which must be authorized by the  Commission). Enforcement has established a variety of controls over the  enforcement action process, including reviews by senior division officials  in Washington, D.C., and, ultimately, review and approval by the  Commission. Enforcement has an information technology system\u2014 CATS\u2014that tracks the progress of its MUIs, investigations, and  enforcement actions.", "Enforcement also is responsible for implementing and overseeing the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s Fair Fund provision, which allows SEC to combine  civil monetary penalties and disgorgement amounts collected in  enforcement cases to establish funds for investors harmed by securities  laws violations. Fair Funds may be created through either SEC  administrative proceedings or litigation in U.S. District Court, and either  SEC or the courts may administer the funds. However, SEC is responsible  for general monitoring of all Fair Funds created. Typically, for SEC- ordered Fair Funds, the agency hires consultants to create Fair Fund  distribution plans (independent distribution consultants) and oversee  payments to harmed investors (fund administrators). However, in some  cases, SEC staff will take care of all of the distribution responsibilities  internally. The development of a Fair Fund plan can include estimating  losses suffered by harmed investors. For court-ordered funds, SEC  recommends a receiver or distributions agent, who creates a distribution  plan that is presented for court approval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement Has Taken Steps to Better Manage the Investigative Process, but These Steps May Not Fully Address Existing Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement\u2019s approaches for planning, tracking, and closing  investigations have had some significant limitations that have hampered  its ability to effectively manage its operations, allocate limited staff  resources, and ensure the fair treatment of individuals and companies  under investigation.

For example, Enforcement officials  said that they hold weekly meetings with the SEC Chairman and other  commissioners as appropriate. During the Chairman\u2019s tenure, he has  identified the pursuit of securities fraud against senior citizens as a key  investigative priority for Enforcement and other agency offices, including  OCIE. In addition to specific priorities, Enforcement officials said that  they seek to maintain a constant investigative presence across all areas of  potential securities violations (for example, insider trading abuses) and  that this \u201ccover the waterfront\u201d approach is designed to prosecute and  possibly deter securities law offenders. While an Enforcement official said  that the division has not established minimum quotas for different types of  investigations and enforcement actions, it will intervene if any one type  threatens to overwhelm the division\u2019s operations. Based on internal  analysis of enforcement action data, Enforcement officials determined  that if the division\u2019s pursuit of any type of securities enforcement action  exceeded 40 percent of total enforcement actions, an unacceptable  commitment of division resources would result.", "While Enforcement has established planning processes for determining  overall priorities, the division has used a largely decentralized approach  for reviewing and approving individual new investigations, which may  have limited the division\u2019s operational effectiveness, according to senior  SEC and Enforcement officials. Under this traditional approach, associate  directors in either SEC\u2019s home or 11 regional offices approved the opening  of MUIs after staff came across a potential violation of federal securities  law. While Enforcement\u2019s senior leadership in the home office reviewed  proposals for formal investigations and received weekly reports on MUIs  and new investigations that had been approved in each office (and  reviewed summaries of all investigations on a quarterly basis), it did not  have formal approval responsibility for such new MUIs and investigations.  According to Enforcement officials, staff in each office generally decided  to open MUIs and investigations based on considerations such as the  likelihood that they would be able to find and prove a violation of federal  securities laws, the potential amount of investor loss, the gravity of the  misconduct, and the potential message the case would deliver to the  industry and public. Typically, the staff attorney who opened the MUI was  responsible for conducting the investigation. According to Enforcement  officials, this decentralized approach was generally viewed as fostering  creativity in the investigative process and providing staff with incentives to  actively seek potential investigations.", "However, without a centralized control mechanism for reviewing and  approving all new MUIs and investigations, Enforcement\u2019s capacity to  ensure the efficient use of available resources, which is one of SEC\u2019s four  strategic goals, was limited. For example, SEC\u2019s Chairman, officials from  his office and the Office of the Executive Director, and Enforcement  officials said that the division has not always been able to prioritize or  ensure an efficient allocation of limited investigative staff resources.  Officials said that in some cases staff attorneys worked on investigations  that were outside of their geographic area (for example, San Francisco  staff conducting an investigation in the Atlanta region). Consequently, the  officials said that the division incurred travel and other related costs that  could have been minimized if a centralized process had been in place to  approve all new investigations. Further, one official from the Chairman\u2019s  office said that without a formal quality check by senior Enforcement  officials, in some cases MUIs and investigations had been opened and  allowed to linger for years with little likelihood of resulting in enforcement  actions.", "In March 2007, Enforcement began using a new, more centralized  approach to review and approve investigations. Under the new approach,  two deputy directors, who report directly to the Director of Enforcement,  are to review and approve all newly opened MUIs and investigations to  ensure the appropriateness of resource allocation considerations and  whether the MUI should be pursued. One deputy director is to review  MUIs opened in the division\u2019s home office and another deputy director,  based in New York, is to review MUIs opened in regional offices. In  addition to the MUI review, after an investigation is open for 6 months,  staff will be required to prepare a memorandum with information on  evidence gathered to date, whether an enforcement action is likely,  resources, and estimated time frames for review by their deputy director.  According to Enforcement officials, the goal of this new approach is to  provide early assessments of whether an investigation ought to be pursued  further and resources reallocated. The deputy directors are also expected  to use this review to determine if the investigation is being conducted in a  timely manner, if it should be reprioritized based on Enforcement\u2019s  current caseload, or if it should be closed.", "While these are positive developments, Enforcement has not yet  established comprehensive written policies specifying how the new  approach will be carried out or the criteria that will be used to assess new  MUIs and ongoing investigations. According to our and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) standards, documentation is one type of  control activity that will help ensure that management\u2019s directives, such as  these new procedures, are carried out. In spring 2007, Enforcement  developed and distributed divisionwide a one-page planning document  that, among other items, identified the new centralized approach for  reviewing and approving MUIs and investigations. However, without the  establishment of agreed-upon and written procedures for carrying out the  new approach and relevant assessment criteria, the division may face  challenges in consistently communicating and explaining the new  approach to all current and new staff. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s ability  to oversee how effectively Enforcement is implementing the new  approach and generally managing its operations may be limited. For  example, the lack of a transparent and documented standard could limit  the Commission\u2019s capacity to identify inconsistencies in the  implementation of the new approach, determine whether any such  inconsistencies have affected Enforcement\u2019s operations, and take  corrective action as warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planned Investigative Information System Has Significant Potential Benefits, but Enforcement Has Not Taken Sufficient Steps to Help Ensure Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement officials have consistently stated that the division\u2019s current  information system for tracking investigations and enforcement actions\u2014 CATS\u2014is severely limited and virtually unusable as a management tool. In  particular, the officials have said that access to CATS is limited and the  system does not allow division management to generate summary reports,  which could be used to help manage operations on an ongoing basis.  Currently, the only summary reports CATS readily produces for  management review are lists of all open MUIs, investigations, and  enforcement actions by general violation types, such as violations  involving broker-dealers or investment advisers. CATS does not allow its  users to create timely reports on more specific topics, such as ongoing  investigations involving hedge funds, which do not exist as classification  fields in the system. As a result of the system\u2019s limitations, several senior  Enforcement management officials said that they maintain their own  manual lists of certain types of investigations (such as those for hedge  funds) to assist in managing division activities.", "Further, to obtain customized reports and statistics on Enforcement  operations, division officials said that they must submit requests to SEC\u2019s  Office of Information Technology (OIT) and then wait for OIT staff to  create and run a computer program to respond to the request.  Enforcement officials said that OIT staff generally are responsive and  work very hard to address these requests; however, given their heavy  workload, one Enforcement official said that it generally takes 1-2 days to  receive the information, and more complex requests can take as long as a  week. Further, Enforcement officials said that obtaining technical support  for CATS can be difficult because the system is proprietary and the  company that created it is no longer in business. According to  Enforcement officials, CATS\u2019s deficiencies result from the fact that the  system was hastily designed in preparation for expected year 2000  technical challenges.", "Having recognized CATS\u2019s limitations, SEC and Enforcement officials are  developing a new investigation information management system, called  the Hub, which is scheduled to be in use divisionwide by the end of fiscal  year 2007. According to Enforcement officials, division officials and staff  in SEC\u2019s Boston office developed a prototype of the Hub in 2004 because  of their dissatisfaction with CATS. Subsequently, Enforcement, in  coordination with OIT, developed an enhanced version of the Hub, which  was then tested among home and regional office staff in late 2006 and  early 2007. Enforcement officials said that the Hub is an interim system  that will continue to interface with the CATS database until the second  phase of the Hub fully replaces CATS, which is expected to occur in fiscal  year 2009.", "Although the Hub is an interim system, Enforcement officials said that it  will significantly enhance the division\u2019s capacity to manage the  investigative process. In particular, the officials said that the Hub will  facilitate the creation of a variety of management reports on the division\u2019s  investigative activities, including detailed reports on ongoing  investigations by certain types (for example, reports on the number of  hedge fund investigations). The Hub will also provide more detailed  information on the status of investigations so management can better  track their progress and timeliness. Further, the officials said that the Hub  is designed to be (1) generally accessible to all division staff, although  highly sensitive investigative information will be restricted on a need-to- know basis; (2) user-friendly, primarily employing drop-down menus for  data entry; (3) searchable so that staff can identify relevant information  associated with an investigative matter; and (4) flexible, because new data  fields can be added. We reviewed prototype screens for the Hub and found  that they were consistent with the descriptions of Enforcement officials,  and staff we contacted generally made favorable comments about the  system.", "However, due to significant planned changes to Enforcement\u2019s traditional  approach for recording investigative data, there is a risk that data may not  be entered into the Hub on a timely and consistent basis, as required by  federal internal control standards. Enforcement has traditionally required  support personnel or case management specialists (rather than attorneys)  to enter investigative data into CATS because of the limited access to the  system and its lack of user friendliness. However, once the Hub is  implemented in late 2007, Enforcement officials said that they plan to  require division attorneys to enter relevant data into the system for all  investigations opened after that date. Further, Enforcement officials said  that attorneys will be responsible for entering relevant data into the Hub  for ongoing investigations that are being actively pursued but were  initiated prior to the system\u2019s implementation. Enforcement officials  regard the entry of such data as critical; otherwise, management reports  generated by the Hub would only include information on investigations  begun after the system\u2019s scheduled implementation in late 2007. One  Enforcement official said that the decision to require attorneys to enter  data into the Hub was based on the view that such attorneys have first- hand knowledge of ongoing investigations and thus would be able to  streamline the process. However, another Enforcement official said that  requiring attorneys to maintain timely, accurate, and consistent  investigative data in the Hub would require a cultural change on the  attorneys\u2019 part because they have become accustomed to relying on case  management specialists to perform this task. Another Enforcement official  questioned whether division attorneys would enter investigative data into  the Hub on a timely and consistent basis because they may view doing so  as another administrative requirement diverting them from their primary  investigative responsibilities.", "While Enforcement\u2019s plans to require attorneys rather than case  management specialists to enter data into the Hub may be appropriate, the  division plans only a limited number of actions to ensure that data entered  into the system are timely, consistent, and reliable. For example,  Enforcement plans to train attorneys on the Hub as it is implemented and  is developing a system user manual. However, Enforcement is not  developing written guidance identifying data entry into the Hub as a  priority for division attorneys and specifying how and when such data  entry is to be done. Moreover, Enforcement has not yet established a  written process that would allow division officials to independently review  and determine the extent to which data entry for the Hub is performed on  a timely, consistent, and reliable basis in accordance with federal internal  control standards. Without doing so, the usefulness of management  reports generated by the Hub may be limited, and the system\u2019s potential to  significantly enhance Enforcement\u2019s capacity to better manage the  investigative process may not be fully realized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement Has Planned Improvements to Its Investigation Closure Processes, but Plans May Not Fully Address Backlog of Cases", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement may leave open for years many investigations that are not  being actively pursued with potentially negative consequences for  individuals and companies no longer under review. According to CATS  data, about two-thirds of Enforcement\u2019s nearly 3,700 open investigations  as of the end of 2006 were started 2 or more years before, one-third of  investigations at least 5 years before, and 13 percent at least 10 years  before. According to an Enforcement official, technical limitations in  CATS make it difficult to readily determine how many of these  investigations resulted in enforcement actions and how many did not.  Nevertheless, other data suggest that the number of aged investigations  that did not result in an enforcement action may be substantial. For  example, Enforcement officials at one SEC regional office said that as of  March 2007, nearly 300 of 841 open investigations (about 35 percent) were  more than 2 years old, had not resulted in an enforcement action, and  were no longer being actively pursued.", "Enforcement officials cited several reasons for division attorneys not  always closing investigations promptly. In particular, the officials said that  Enforcement attorneys may view pursing potential securities violations as  the division\u2019s highest priority and lack sufficient time, administrative  support, and incentives to comply with established administrative  procedures for closing investigations. For example, Enforcement requires  attorneys to complete closing memoranda for each investigation that is to  be closed. These memoranda must identify why the investigation was  opened, describe the work performed, and detail the reasons for  recommending that the investigation be closed without an action. Staff  must also prepare draft termination letters, which inform individuals or  companies that they are no longer under review. A closing memorandum  is also required for investigations with associated enforcement actions. In  these cases, the staff attorney must account for all ordered relief before  the investigation is closed. One regional Enforcement official estimated  that it could take as long as a month for a staff attorney to complete this  process and submit the closing package to the home office, although  senior division officials noted that attorneys typically would not spend all  their time doing so. Once closing packages are received by the home  office, Enforcement\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel must then approve the  closing of the investigation, at which point final termination letters are  sent to affected individuals and companies.", "Enforcement officials in SEC\u2019s home office said that a lack of resources in  their office also contributed to delays in closing investigations. They noted  that only one person in the division was assigned to processing closing  packages for investigations. Consequently, the officials said there was a  backlog of investigations for which the closing package had been  completed but not reviewed. As of March 1, 2007, the backlog consisted of  464 investigations, according to an Enforcement official.", "However, Enforcement officials told us that in May 2007 they began  eliminating the backlog of investigations with completed\u2014but  unreviewed\u2014closing packages and had almost eliminated the backlog by  mid-June 2007. The division recently added one staff person to work on  administering closing procedures in the home office, and Enforcement  officials have set a goal of processing new closing documentation within 2  weeks of receipt.", "Also in May 2007, Enforcement implemented revised procedures for  sending termination letters for investigations that will not result in an  enforcement action. Under the procedures, Enforcement will send the  letters to individuals and companies at the start of the closing process  rather than at the end. This particular effort will be emphasized on  Enforcement\u2019s intranet\u2014EnforceNet. Enforcement officials said they  changed this procedure out of concerns about fairness to those under  investigation and to reduce any negative impact an open investigation may  have on them. For example, a company may bar an individual from  performing certain duties until a pending SEC investigation is resolved.  Staff are generally encouraged to close investigations if they know they  will not be bringing any enforcement actions, even if all of their  investigative steps have not yet been completed.", "While the above steps are a positive development, they do not address the  potentially large backlog of investigations that are not likely to result in  enforcement actions and for which closing packages have not been  completed. As a result, the subjects of many aged and inactive  investigations may continue to suffer adverse consequences until closing  actions are completed.

However,  the largely decentralized approach that Enforcement and SEC have used  in managing the Fair Fund program may also have contributed to  distribution delays. SEC has announced plans to create a central Fair  Funds office, but it is too early to assess this proposal, as final  determinations about its staffing, roles and responsibilities, and  procedures have not yet been determined. Further, Enforcement does not  yet collect key data necessary to effectively monitor the Fair Fund  program (such as data on fund administrative expenses for ongoing plans)  because an information system designed to capture such data is not  expected to be implemented until 2008. In the meantime, Enforcement has  not ensured that reports intended to provide expense data for completed  Fair Fund plans contain consistent information or are analyzed.

The  Fair Fund plans vary considerably in size and complexity, ranging from  plans for small broker-dealers with relatively few customers to large  corporate cases, according to SEC data. The smallest Fair Fund plan  established (measured by the amount of funds ordered returned to  investors) was $29,300 for alleged fraud at a hedge fund; the largest was  $800 million for alleged securities fraud at American International Group,  Inc. (AIG). Table 2 shows the 10 largest Fair Funds ordered through June  2007; 7 are court-created plans, and 3 have been established through SEC  administrative proceedings. SEC monitors all Fair Fund plans regardless  of their source.", "According to SEC data, from 2002 to 2007, federal courts and SEC  administrative proceedings ordered individuals and entities subject to SEC  enforcement actions to pay a total of $8.4 billion into Fair Fund plans, an  increase of about 75 percent from the $4.8 billion total Fair Funds we  identified in our 2005 report. As of June 2007, $1.8 billion of the $8.4 billion  (about 21 percent) had been distributed to harmed investors, according to  SEC data. As shown in table 3, the amount distributed from court-overseen  plans exceeded that distributed from SEC-overseen plans. According to  Enforcement officials, the funds were distributed more slowly from SEC- overseen plans largely because much of the money ordered through SEC  proceedings involves mutual fund market timing matters, which, as  discussed later, are among the most complex Fair Fund plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fair Fund Distribution Delays Have Been Attributed to Difficulties in Identification of Harmed Investors, the Complexity of Certain Cases, and Tax Issues", "paragraphs": ["According to Enforcement officials and consultants who work on Fair  Funds, a key reason for the slow distribution of Fair Funds has been the  difficulty of identifying harmed investors in certain cases. Unlike typical  securities class action lawsuits, Fair Funds may not rely on a claims-based  process in which injured parties identify themselves by filing claims with  trustees or other administrators. For example, in Fair Fund cases involving  mutual fund market timing abuses, which account for many funds ordered  into Fair Fund plans, Enforcement attorneys and plan administrators have  assumed responsibility for identifying harmed investors. This step was  taken because with the large number of affected investors and the nature  of market timing violations, many such investors may not even have been  aware that their accounts experienced losses. One Fair Fund plan  consultant said that many harmed investors already had redeemed their  shares in the affected mutual fund companies in prior years. Tracking  down such former customers can be challenging because they may have  changed their addresses several times, the consultant said. Several  consultants and Enforcement officials also said that tracking down  customers can be hard because securities brokers, through whom  individuals may purchase mutual funds, may maintain customer account  information rather than the mutual fund company itself. As a result, a  Fair Fund administrator might need to contact and obtain the cooperation  of relevant broker-dealers to obtain customer account information and  make related distributions.", "The complexity of some cases can also impede the timely distribution of  Fair Funds. For example, in mutual fund market timing cases,  sophisticated analysis might be required to first identify trades that  benefited from improper activity and then to calculate profits earned from  those transactions and associated losses to investors, which may be  spread across many such customers. According to a Fair Fund plan  consultant and Enforcement officials, another significant challenge to the  Fair Fund distribution involves retirement plans and the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the federal law setting  minimum standards for pension plans in private industry. Retirement  plans hold assets on behalf of their beneficiaries, and it is not unusual for  those assets to be invested with entities that become subject to Fair Fund  enforcement actions. Thus, ERISA-covered retirement plans will be  entitled to Fair Fund proceeds by virtue of such investments. But  depending on circumstances, a Fair Fund distribution consultant may  need to make determinations on a variety of complex issues before funds  can be distributed, such as determining when such distributions become  plan assets under ERISA. One Fair Fund consultant told us he spent a  year waiting for Department of Labor clarification of relevant ERISA  issues.", "Finally, determining the tax treatment of funds may also slow the  distribution process. According to Fair Fund consultants, tax information  must accompany Fair Fund distributions to investors so that recipients  have some idea of how to treat their payments for tax purposes.  Consultants and Enforcement officials told us that determining  appropriate tax treatment has been time-consuming as they had no  precedents upon which to draw. Depending on circumstances, an  investor\u2019s recovery of disgorged profits can constitute ordinary income or  a capital gain\u2014which can be taxed at different rates\u2014or not represent  taxable income at all. SEC ultimately hired a consulting firm to handle tax  issues. One Fair Fund consultant told us that obtaining tax guidance from  the Internal Revenue Service delayed the plan\u2019s distribution by about 1  year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement\u2019s Approach to Managing Fair Funds May Also Have Slowed Distributions, and SEC Has Not Defined Responsibilities of a New Office to Administer the Program", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the factors discussed above, Enforcement\u2019s largely  decentralized approach to managing the process may also have  contributed to delays in the distribution of Fair Funds. Currently,  Enforcement staff attorneys in either SEC\u2019s home office or 1 of its 11  regional offices who are pursuing individual enforcement cases take a lead  role in the Fair Funds process, overseeing much of the work necessary to  establish and maintain a fund. This includes supervising cases directly,  overseeing consultants who design or administer distribution plans, and  advising or petitioning courts presiding over Fair Fund plans. Enforcement  officials said that the approach made sense from a Fair Fund  administration standpoint because division attorneys have substantial  knowledge of the regulated entity involved and the relevant enforcement  action. Enforcement officials also said that senior officials in the home  office have always played an important role in the oversight of the  program. Their responsibilities have included providing guidance on  selecting consultants, leading information-sharing and problem-solving  efforts (for example, leading regular conference calls among fund  consultants, parties involved in Fair Fund enforcement actions, their legal  counsel, and SEC staff in Enforcement and elsewhere), and reviewing  proposed Fair Fund distribution plans and recommending modifications  as necessary.", "Outside consultants hired to design and implement Fair Fund plans told us  that Enforcement staff attorneys assigned to their cases were dedicated  and responsive and that the agency appears to be making a good faith  effort to implement and oversee the Fair Funds provision. However, they  also said that Enforcement\u2019s delegated approach has resulted in delays,  higher costs, and unnecessary repetition of effort. With different  Enforcement staff handling different Fair Fund cases, the consultants said  that Enforcement forgoes the opportunity to build institutional expertise  and efficiencies. For example, one consultant said that Enforcement\u2019s  delegated management of the Fair Fund program has resulted in  inefficiencies in key administrative aspects of the program, such as the  development of standardized means of communicating with investors (for  example, form letters) and the mechanics for distributing funds to them.  Consequently, the consultant said that the Fair Fund program incurs a  substantial amount of unnecessary administrative costs. Further, the  consultants generally agreed that it would make sense for SEC to consider  centralizing at least some aspects of the administration of Fair Fund plans  to improve the efficiency of the distribution process.", "While Enforcement officials have cited benefits associated with the  current management of the program, both SEC and division officials also  acknowledged that it has created challenges. An official within the  Chairman\u2019s office said that the slow distribution of funds to harmed  investors is of significant concern to the agency and that the lack of a  centralized management approach has limited the development of  standardized policies and controls necessary to facilitate disbursements.  Further, Enforcement officials said that while Fair Fund work is  important, it can divert investigative attorneys from pursuing other cases.  The officials said that the Fair Fund workload on any particular case  varies over time, but during peak periods it can consume about 50 to 75  percent of a staff attorney\u2019s time. At one SEC regional office, Enforcement  officials said that administering the Fair Fund program has resulted in a  significant commitment of attorneys\u2019 time, especially because the office  lost almost 25 percent of its investigative staff due to attrition in the past  year or so.", "In response to concerns about the slow distribution of Fair Fund proceeds  to harmed investors, SEC\u2019s Chairman took two actions in 2007. First, he  established an internal agency committee to examine the program\u2019s  operation. The committee\u2014which includes representatives from  Enforcement, General Counsel, the Office of the Secretary, and the Office  of the Executive Director\u2014is assessing lessons learned in program  implementation, the agency\u2019s selection of consultants to administer the  plans, and SEC\u2019s policies and procedures for managing the program. An  Enforcement official said that the committee is expected to complete its  analysis by September 30, 2007. Second, in March 2007, the Chairman  announced plans to create a centralized Fair Fund office. The Chairman  stated that the purpose of the new office is to develop consistent fund  distribution policies and dedicate full-time trained staff to ensure the  prompt return of funds to harmed investors.", "While creating a central office within SEC could facilitate the distribution  of Fair Funds, it was not yet possible to assess the planned office\u2019s  potential impact at the time of our review. For example, SEC had not  announced which SEC unit the office would report to, although one  official said that the office probably would be located within Enforcement.  Further, SEC had not staffed the new Fair Fund office and had not  established the roles and responsibilities of the new office or written  relevant policies and procedures. For example, SEC had not determined  the extent to which the new office might assume complete responsibility  for managing at least some Fair Fund plans, although it is expected the  office will continue to provide support to division attorneys who currently  manage such plans. Until such issues are resolved, the new office\u2019s  potential efficiency in more quickly distributing Fair Fund proceeds to  harmed investors will not be realized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement Does Not Yet Collect Key Data Necessary to Effectively Oversee the Fair Funds Program", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement does not collect key data, as we recommended in 2005, to aid  in division oversight of the Fair Fund program. In particular,  Enforcement does not systematically collect data on administrative  expenses for all ongoing Fair Fund plans. These costs range from fees and  expenses that Fair Fund administrators and consultants charged to the  costs of identifying harmed investors and sending checks to them.  Approximately two-thirds of individual Fair Funds pay for administrative  costs from fund proceeds, so that the greater the administrative expenses,  the less money is available for distribution to harmed investors, according  to our analysis of SEC Fair Fund information. However, without data on  administrative expenses charged, Enforcement cannot judge the  reasonableness of such fees and take actions as necessary to minimize  them.", "Enforcement officials generally attributed SEC\u2019s inability to implement  our 2005 recommendation to changes in priorities for the development of  the agency\u2019s information systems. After we issued our 2005 report,  Enforcement officials said they began working to modify the CATS system  so that it could better track Fair Fund administrative expenses and other  data. However, SEC ultimately decided to accelerate the development of a  new financial management system for the division, called Phoenix. SEC  and Enforcement officials said that the agency implemented the first phase  of Phoenix in February 2007. The first phase includes limited information  relevant to the Fair Fund program (the amount of money ordered in  penalties and disgorgement and the amount paid to the agency), but it  does not include data on such items as fund administrative expenses.  Enforcement officials told us that a second phase of the Phoenix system  will contain additional features for more complete management and  monitoring of Fair Fund activity, consistent with our 2005  recommendation. According to Enforcement officials, Phoenix II has been  funded and is expected to be in place in 2008. Until Phoenix II is  implemented and tested, Enforcement officials will continue to lack  information necessary for effective Fair Fund management and oversight.", "We also note that in the meantime, Enforcement has not leveraged reports  that could enhance the division\u2019s understanding of Fair Fund expenses,  including administrative expenses. SEC rules generally require that final  accounting reports be prepared when SEC-overseen Fair Funds are fully  distributed and officially closed. We reviewed four such reports and  found that three of them were inconsistent in data reported and did not  include comprehensive accounting information. For example, two of the  accounting reports did not include complete data on the expenses  incurred to administer the Fair Fund plan. Further, senior Enforcement  officials said that the division could improve its analysis of information  contained in the reports.

According to the Director of Enforcement, she meets weekly with the  heads of other SEC divisions, and other senior division officials said that  they meet periodically with their counterparts in other agency units.  Enforcement officials cited their coordination with other SEC units on  investigations of the backdating of stock options as an example of the  agency\u2019s successful collaborative efforts.

Enforcement officials said that because OCIE staff regularly examine  broker-dealers, investment advisers, and other registered entities, they  have a broad perspective on compliance with securities laws and  regulations. Enforcement officials in SEC\u2019s Philadelphia regional office  estimated that about 30 or 35 percent of the enforcement actions the  Philadelphia office initiates are based on referrals from OCIE staff. They  cited one notable recent insider trading case\u2014involving broker-dealer  Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc., and which was among the first  cases of its kind since the 1980s\u2014as stemming from a referral from an  OCIE examination.", "However, other Enforcement officials said that historically they have had  some concerns about limitations in information contained in OCIE  referrals. These concerns centered on how clearly OCIE identifies  potentially improper conduct in its referrals and how much evidence it  provides in support of such matters. As a result, in November 2006, OCIE  and Enforcement instituted a process that would provide a more formal  review of the nature and quality of OCIE referrals. According to OCIE and  Enforcement officials, the new procedures expand and formalize a  preexisting committee process for reviewing OCIE referrals to  Enforcement and communicating the ultimate outcome of those referrals  to OCIE. The officials said the revised procedures were instituted to (1)  help identify the types of OCIE referrals that were likely (or not) to result  in enforcement actions and (2) provide better information to OCIE on the  ultimate disposition of its referrals.", "Enforcement officials noted that the division receives many more referrals  from OCIE than from any other SEC division or office; therefore,  developing a formal committee and tracking process for other internal  referrals has not been viewed as warranted. SEC also receives referrals  from self-regulatory organizations (SRO)\u2014such as what is now the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u2014often involving  allegations of insider trading, which are received by Enforcement\u2019s Office  of Market Surveillance (OMS).

In our 2005  report, we discussed how Enforcement worked with Justice and state  attorneys general to prosecute investment advisers that allegedly violated  criminal statutes related to market timing and late trading. In some cases,  Enforcement details investigative attorneys to Justice to assist in the  criminal prosecution of alleged securities law violators. Other outside  organizations with which SEC and Enforcement coordinate investigative  activities include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, federal banking  regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, state securities  regulators, and local police.

As discussed in that  report, SEC has established a policy under which Enforcement attorneys  may make referrals on an informal basis to Justice and other agencies with  authority to prosecute criminal violations. That is, Enforcement attorneys  may alert other agencies to potential criminal activity through phone calls  or meetings, and such referrals need not be formally approved by the  division or the Commission. We noted that such an informal referral  process may have benefits, such as fostering effective working  relationships between SEC and other agencies, but also found that  Enforcement did not require staff to document such referrals. Appropriate  documentation of decision-making is an important management tool.  Without such documentation, Enforcement and the Commission cannot  readily determine whether staff make appropriate and prompt referrals.

While Enforcement has demonstrated considerable success in  carrying out its law enforcement mission, some significant limitations in  the division\u2019s management processes and information systems have  hampered its capacity to operate at maximum effectiveness and use  limited resources efficiently. One key reason for these limitations appears  to have been Enforcement\u2019s management approach, which emphasized a  broad delegation of key functions with limited centralized management  review and oversight, particularly in the approval and review of new  investigations and the administration of the Fair Fund program.  Delegation of authority is an important management principle that can  foster creativity at the local level and, in the case of Enforcement, likely  had some benefits for the investigative process and the administration of  the Fair Fund program. However, without well-defined management  processes to exercise some control over delegated functions, inefficient  program implementation and resource allocation can also occur.", "Officials from Enforcement and the Offices of the Chairman and Executive  Director have recognized limitations in the division\u2019s operations and taken  important steps to establish more centralized oversight procedures. In  particular, they have centralized the review and approval of new  investigations, moved forward to upgrade or replace information systems  key to division operations and management, and announced the creation  of a new Fair Fund office.

While this ratio may  provide a more accurate assessment of Enforcement attorneys\u2019 active  workloads, individual investigations more than 2 years old could continue  to be actively pursued while some individual investigations less than 2  years old may no longer be actively pursued. Enforcement officials  estimated that staff attorneys generally can be working on from 3 to 5  investigations at one time, including administering individual Fair Fund  plans.", "Table 5 shows that the ratio of Enforcement investigative attorneys to  paralegals, who provide support to the investigative process, generally  declined from 2003 to 2006. Our review of SEC data indicates that the  number of Enforcement paralegals increased substantially from 2003 to  2005 (from 58 to 98, or 69 percent) and remained stable in 2006 at 94 (a  decline of just over 4 percent). While the number of Enforcement staff and  supervisory attorneys also increased from 2003 to 2005 (from 596 to 740,  or 24 percent), the rate of increase was not nearly as high as for paralegals.  In addition, the number of Enforcement investigative attorneys declined  from 740 in 2005 to 684 in 2006, or 8 percent. The relatively slower pace of  attorney hiring from 2003 to 2005 and relatively higher rate of attrition in  2006 helps explain why the ratio of attorneys to paralegals has declined in  recent years. Other SEC data that we reviewed also indicated a decline in  the ratio of investigative attorneys to various types of administrative  support staff, such as research specialists, during this period.", "Table 6 shows that the ratio of investigative staff attorneys to supervisory  attorneys has remained relatively constant. Supervisory attorneys are  branch chiefs and assistant directors and do not include attorneys at the  associate director level and above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Wesley M.
