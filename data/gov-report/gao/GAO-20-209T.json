In 2018, GAO reported that DHS had implemented several methods to reduce backlogged FOIA requests, including sending monthly emails to its components on backlog statistics and conducting oversight. In addition, several DHS components, implemented actions to reduce their backlogs. Due to efforts by the department, the backlog dropped 66 percent in fiscal year 2015, decreasing to 35,374 requests. Although there was initial progress by the end of fiscal year 2015, the number of backlogged requests increased in fiscal years 2016 and 2018 (see figure). One reason DHS was struggling to consistently reduce its backlogs is that it lacked documented, comprehensive plans that would provide a more reliable, sustainable approach to addressing backlogs and describe how it will implement best practices for reducing backlogs over time.", "DHS attributed the increase in its FOIA backlogs to several factors, including the increased numbers and complexity of requests received and the volume of responsive records for those requests. Until it develops a plan to implement best practices to reduce its backlogs, DHS will likely continue to struggle to reduce the backlogs to a manageable level.", "In addition, in 2014 GAO reported that certain immigration-related requests were processed twice by two different DHS components. The duplicate processing of such requests by the two components contributed to an increase in the time needed to respond to the requests.

The department used modern  technology (e.g., mobile applications) to inform citizens about FOIA. The  commercial systems allowed requesters to submit a request and track the  status of that request online. In addition, DHS developed a mobile  application that allowed FOIA requesters to submit a request and check  its status.

CBP hired and trained  additional staff, encouraged requesters to file requests online, established  productivity goals, updated guidance, and used better technology.  USCIS, the National Protection and Programs Directorate, and ICE  increased staffing or developed methods to better forecast future  workloads to ensure adequate staffing. ICE also implemented a  commercial off-the-shelf web application, awarded a multimillion-dollar  contract for backlog reduction, and detailed employees from various other  offices to assist in the backlog reduction effort.

These files usually contain various types of information  pertaining to immigrants, including asylum applications, law enforcement  records, and border crossing documents. As such, they may contain  information and records that are generated by various DHS components  or other agencies.", "In 2014, we reported that within DHS, three components\u2014USCIS, CBP,  and ICE\u2014created most of the documents included in immigration files.  USCIS was the custodian of the files, and all FOIA requests for such files  were either initiated with, or referred to, USCIS for processing.  Specifically, to process a FOIA request for an immigration file, the USCIS  staff to whom the request was assigned first manually entered the  requester\u2019s data, such as a name and address, into USCIS\u2019s FOIA  system to establish a record of the request. Next, the staff retrieved and  scanned the documents in the requested file and reviewed the  documents. If all of the documents were generated by USCIS, the staff  made redactions as needed, sent the documents to the requester, and  closed out the request.", "Further, if the FOIA request covered files containing documents  generated by CBP, then USCIS was able to process the request on the  basis of an agreement to that effect with CBP. By having USCIS process  such requests for CBP documents, the two components avoided  duplication in their response to a FOIA request.", "In November 2014, however, we reported that USCIS and ICE did not  have such an agreement for documents generated by ICE. Thus, the  USCIS staff was to identify any such documents and make them available  to ICE\u2019s FOIA staff for their separate processing. In doing so, we noted  that USCIS and ICE engaged in duplicative processing of FOIA requests  for those immigration files containing documents related to law  enforcement activities that were generated by ICE.", "Specifically, to facilitate ICE\u2019s review of such files, USCIS staff transferred  copies of the ICE-generated documents to a temporary electronic storage  drive maintained by USCIS. ICE retrieved the documents, and the ICE  staff then re-entered the data to create a new FOIA request in ICE\u2019s FOIA  processing system. The staff then proceeded with processing the  requested documents, and released them to the requester\u2014in essence,  undertaking a new, and duplicate, effort to respond to the FOIA request.  Figure 1 depicts the duplication that occurred in USCIS\u2019s and ICE\u2019s  downloading and re-entering of data to respond to FOIA requests for  immigration files.", "We noted that, up until April 2012, USCIS and ICE had an agreement  whereby USCIS processed ICE\u2019s documents contained in an immigration  file. However, the components\u2019 officials stated that, since that agreement  ended, the components had not made plans to enter into another such  agreement. According to ICE\u2019s FOIA Officer, USCIS\u2019s processing of ICE\u2019s  documents in immigration files was viewed as being too costly.", "Nonetheless, while there would be costs associated with USCIS  processing ICE\u2019s documents in immigration files, the potential existed for  additional costs to be incurred in the continued duplicate processing of  such files.", "Our work has noted that duplication exists when two or more agencies  or programs are engaged in the same activities or provide the same  services to the same beneficiaries. We concluded that the duplicate  processing of a single FOIA request by USCIS and ICE staff contributed  to an increase in the time needed to respond to a FOIA request for  immigration files. Because USCIS did not send the immigration file to ICE  until it had completed its own processing of the relevant documents\u2014 which, according to USCIS, took on average 20 working days\u2014ICE  usually did not receive the file to begin its own processing until the 20-day  time frame for responding to a request had passed.", "We pointed out that re-establishing an agreement that allows USCIS to  process ICE-generated documents included in requests for immigration  files, to the extent that the benefits of doing so would exceed the cost,  could enable the two components to eliminate duplication in their  processes for responding to such a request. Further, it could help reduce  the time needed by these components in responding to a request.  Therefore, in November 2014, we recommended that DHS direct the  Chief FOIA Officer to determine the viability of re-establishing the service- level agreement between USCIS and ICE to eliminate duplication in the  processing of immigration files. We stressed that, if the benefits of doing  so would exceed the costs, DHS should re-establish the agreement. We  also reported on our finding and recommendation regarding duplicate  processing in our reports and updates on fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication, issued in 2015 through 2019.", "In response, DHS indicated that it was working on a system intended to  address the duplication. Specifically, in August 2018, DHS\u2019s Privacy  Office Director of Correspondence/Executive Secretary stated that the  Privacy Office was leading a working group in collaboration with the  Office of the Chief Information Officer to develop requirements for a single  information technology solution for processing incoming FOIA requests.  The director added that DHS used three disparate systems to track,  manage, and process FOIA requests and that moving USCIS and ICE to  one processing solution should result in processing benefits and lower  overall administrative costs. We continue to track DHS\u2019s progress in  implementing this recommendation. However, as of October 2019, DHS\u2019s  Privacy Office stated that these actions were still in progress.", "In conclusion, DHS has implemented a number of key FOIA practices.  However, it does not have a comprehensive plan to address its FOIA  backlog, nor has it yet addressed duplication in its FOIA process.  Addressing both of these issues is important, as the number and  complexity of requests will likely increase over time and DHS may be  challenged in effectively responding to the needs of requesters and the  public.", "Chairwoman Torres Small, Ranking Member Crenshaw, and Members of  the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
