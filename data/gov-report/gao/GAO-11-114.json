Moreover, in fiscal year 2009, some of the most common impairments for veterans receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits were hearing related, as annual payments for such conditions exceeded $1.1 billion. To examine Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to prevent hearing loss, GAO is reporting on (1) how well the DOD and armed services identify and mitigate hazardous noise; (2) how well the military evaluates hearing conservation program performance; and (3) the status of DOD's Hearing Center of Excellence and the extent that DOD and VA are sharing information to inform this and other efforts. GAO reviewed DOD and services' policies and guidance, reviewed DOD performance data, interviewed officials and servicemembers, and conducted site visits to nine military bases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Each of the armed services is taking steps to monitor hazardous noise, but inconsistencies in some hearing protection strategies and limited training weaken mitigation efforts. Services monitor noise periodically, depending on the level of risk servicemembers have in being exposed to hazardous noise (for example, annually for firing ranges and flight decks, and every 5 years for administrative offices). However, they lack a reliable system for detecting changes in noise levels that may occur outside the scheduled review cycle. Although DOD requires that noise be controlled by setting exposure limits and requiring the use of hearing protection, these strategies are not consistently used. For example, servicemembers told us that they do not always wear hearing protection, citing concerns with comfort and communication. Annual hearing-related training is required for at-risk servicemembers, but services are not able to fully determine who has completed annual training, and many servicemembers told GAO that training is not necessarily well timed. DOD's evaluation of services' hearing conservation programs has key weaknesses, but some services have taken steps to review and improve their own programs. First, DOD performance indicators are not sufficiently comprehensive. One key indicator--the rate of hearing loss among servicemembers in the hearing conservation programs--only measures program performance after hearing loss has occurred. Second, evaluation is limited by weaknesses in the processes used to capture, track, and use performance data. For example, the data may not accurately capture the number of servicemembers enrolled in the respective programs--a number required to calculate compliance rate. Third, audiologists, and other key stakeholders do not, on some bases GAO visited, routinely coordinate to share and evaluate hearing loss data to identify and mitigate noise hazards. Individual services have, at times, conducted reviews of their own programs and made some improvements. For example, once the Army decided that soldiers would not be deployed if the individual had not completed a required hearing test, the number of hearing tests rose significantly. DOD has developed, though not yet finalized, a plan for a Hearing Center of Excellence to improve hearing loss prevention and treatment as well as a plan for its registry to track and share information with VA on injured military personnel and veterans. Neither Congress nor the DOD set a date for when planning should be formally approved to implement the center, but a key DOD official estimated that plans may receive final DOD approval in the near future. In the meantime, an interim director for the center has begun to lay the groundwork for implementation of both the center and the registry. While data sharing between DOD and VA has been very limited to date, military and VA officials said the registry should ultimately facilitate sharing and development of best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that to improve hearing conservation programs, DOD should address issues with the type, timing, and tracking of training and education; develop an appropriate set of performance indicators; improve processes to collect and use performance data; and examine services' reviews to identify opportunities for program improvement. In reviewing a draft of this report, DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations. DOD and VA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Military service can expose soldiers to hazardous levels of noise, ranging  from gunfire to military aircraft, all of which can lead to a loss or damage  in hearing if protective equipment and measures to reduce exposure are  not employed in advance. Well before retirement, such damage can reduce  servicemembers\u2019 ability to communicate and affect the quality of their  professional and personal lives. Moreover, it can create additional costs to  the government and taxpayers by decreasing troop readiness and  increasing the need for medical services and disability compensation. To  protect servicemembers\u2019 hearing, the Department of Defense (DOD) and  the armed services have established hearing conservation policies and  programs. Nevertheless, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has  reported that tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and hearing loss remain some of  the most common service-connected disabilities. Approximately $1.1  billion in disability compensation was paid out for these two conditions in  fiscal year 2009.", "Many have raised concerns about the need to protect servicemembers\u2019  hearing, including DOD, VA, Congress, and national organizations  dedicated to protecting hearing. Such concern on hearing-related  disabilities prompted Congress in October 2008 to require that DOD  establish a center dedicated to the prevention and rehabilitation of  servicemembers and veterans with auditory disabilities. Congress has  mandated GAO to review DOD\u2019s hearing protection efforts and report on  the status of the hearing center. Specifically, to respond to this mandate  and gain insight into DOD\u2019s efforts to prevent hearing loss, we determined  (1) how well the DOD and armed services identify and mitigate hazardous  noise; (2) how well the military evaluates hearing conservation program  performance; and (3) the status of DOD\u2019s Hearing Center of Excellence  and the extent to which DOD and VA are sharing information to inform  this undertaking and generally protect servicemembers. To address  objectives one and two, we reviewed DOD and armed services hearing  conservation policies and guidance, reviewed other federal agencies that  set standards and policy for hearing conservation, and interviewed  cognizant military officers from DOD, Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines,  as well as stakeholders. We reviewed past evaluations of DOD hearing  conservation programs, including a study conducted by the Institute of  Medicine (IOM). We conducted site visits to nine military installations.  During these site visits, we interviewed senior officials, audiologists,  industrial hygienists, servicemembers, safety officers, and other officials  who assess, measure, and mitigate occupational health hazards. We  selected these site visits based on a number of factors, including the  military branch, size of the installation, presence of different types of  hazardous noise, and geographic location. To determine how DOD and the  armed services monitor program performance, we also interviewed  cognizant officials, reviewed hearing conservation performance measures  and program data and reviewed documentation for DOD\u2019s Defense  Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS),  and analyzed key system reports for each of the armed services. To  address objective three, we interviewed the DOD Hearing Center of  Excellence program manager, the interim director of the Hearing Center of  Excellence, as well as representatives from the VA involved with the  center\u2019s development.", "We conducted our overall performance audit from November 2009 to  January 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis  for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. For additional information  on our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Noise is one of the most common occupational health hazards faced by  military servicemembers. Servicemembers may be exposed to high- intensity noise of various types during their training and when performing  general job duties or combat operations. Without proper protection, this  exposure can cause or contribute to tinnitus and hearing loss. The effects  of tinnitus, a ringing in the ears significantly associated with unprotected  exposure to hazardous noise and noise-induced hearing loss, can range  from minor to debilitating and can be permanent. Noise-induced hearing  loss, and occasionally tinnitus, can be rehabilitated with a hearing aid, but  they are permanent disabilities.", "After leaving the military, servicemembers who sustain tinnitus or hearing  loss during service may qualify for compensation from the VA. VA\u2019s  disability compensation program compensates veterans for the average  loss in civilian earning capacity that results from injuries or diseases  incurred or aggravated during military service, regardless of current  employment status or income. In fiscal year 2009, VA compensated 1.2  million claims for veterans with either tinnitus or hearing loss injuries,  representing an annual federal expenditure exceeding $1.1 billion for  disability compensation payments. In 2005, auditory impairments, which  include hearing loss and tinnitus, became the most common service- connected disabilities compensated by VA. Since 2005, VA has reported  that the numbers of veterans who have begun receiving compensation  each year for these disabilities have continued to grow, contributing to  VA\u2019s increasing annual expenditure on disability claims (see fig. 1).", "Beyond the cash benefits VA provides to veterans with hearing-related  disabilities, there are other expenditures by both VA and DOD to  rehabilitate, treat, or correct auditory injuries. For example, VA purchased  almost 382,000 hearing assistive devices in fiscal year 2008, for an  expenditure of approximately $154 million.", "Both noise-induced hearing loss and noise-induced tinnitus may be  avoided through auditory injury prevention, referred to as hearing  conservation. Due to the introduction of the jet engine to military  environments and the number of World War II veterans who sustained  hearing loss during combat, hearing conservation became a concern of the  armed services in the late 1940s. According to a recent IOM study, in 1948,  the armed services began developing hearing conservation programs and,  in 1978, DOD issued the first departmentwide hearing conservation  directive that provided guidelines to unify the implementation and goals of  hearing conservation programs (HCP) throughout the armed services.", "According to DOD policy, the goal of hearing conservation is to protect all  servicemembers and other personnel from hearing loss resulting from  occupational noise exposure. The policy states that each armed service is  to implement a hearing conservation program, including the Air Force, the  Army, the Marine Corps, and the Navy, and that these programs are to be  implemented when personnel are exposed to a certain level of noise. All  the services have policies that include the enrollment of personnel  working in areas with noise at or above levels that can be hazardous when  performing their general job duties. Though military operations are not  subject to federal civilian health and safety regulations, DOD\u2019s hearing  conservation instructions direct that the armed services\u2019 HCPs comply  with federal standards whenever practicable.", "DOD policy incorporates the following key elements into its hearing  conservation programs: noise hazard identification, safety signs and labels,  noise mitigation, education and training, audiometric surveillance, and  program evaluation (see table 1). Each armed service branch must submit  a written plan to DOD that outlines its program, including the strategies  for implementing these elements.", "DOD instructions require services to reduce noise to safer levels, where  possible, using three strategies: engineering controls, hearing protection,  and administrative controls. DOD policy requires that engineering controls  be the primary means of eliminating exposure of personnel to potentially  hazardous noise. To implement engineering controls, services should  design their work environment to reduce noise below hazardous levels  and purchase equipment with the lower sound emissions. The use of  hearing protection is considered an interim measure, but if services  determine that engineering controls are not possible, DOD policy allows  them to use personal hearing protection as a permanent measure to  mitigate noise. Furthermore, if additional protection is needed,  administrative controls, such as modifying work schedules or procedures  should be used to limit exposure to hazardous noise.", "In recent years, studies have addressed hearing loss and tinnitus in the  military. For example, in 2002, Congress directed that VA contract with the  National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on noise exposure with  respect to hearing loss and tinnitus in the military. The National  Academies\u2019 IOM study examined the sources of hazardous noise exposure  in the military, levels of noise exposure necessary to cause hearing loss or  tinnitus, the course of hearing loss following noise exposure, risk factors,  and compliance by the military services with requirements for audiometric  testing and the adequacy of their hearing conservation programs. The  study found that military hearing conservation programs were not  adequate to protect servicemembers\u2019 hearing. This conclusion was  supported by findings that the annual audiometric testing of  servicemembers enrolled in hearing conservation programs showed that  10 percent to 18 percent had a significant shift in their threshold, which  was estimated to be two to five times higher than rates considered  appropriate in industrial hearing conservation programs. The study also  found that the military programs may not perform the required annual  audiometric testing on all servicemembers exposed to hazardous noise  and that overall testing was not sufficient to evaluate changes in hearing  associated with military service for the majority of servicemembers.  Furthermore, while information was limited, the study noted that a high  proportion of servicemembers (sometimes up to 50 percent in certain  situations) may not be wearing hearing protection when needed.", "Additionally, in fiscal year 2008, the Marine Corps identified hearing loss  among personnel as a risk in its annual Risk and Opportunities  Assessment and, in following up, requested that the Naval Audit Service  (NAS) conduct a review of its hearing conservation program. The  objective of the NAS audit was to determine whether the management and  implementation of the Marine Corps HCP is effective in protecting  servicemembers\u2019 hearing.", "In response to serious auditory injuries incurred by servicemembers  associated with Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom, Congress mandated in October 2008 that DOD create a center of  excellence in the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and  rehabilitation of hearing loss and auditory system injury. A key  responsibility of the Hearing Center of Excellence is to create an  electronic registry that tracks the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for  each case of hearing loss and auditory system injury incurred by  servicemembers on active duty. The center is required to inform VA when  any of these servicemembers transition from the armed services to VA to  help ensure the coordination and provision of auditory system  rehabilitative services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Are Employing Strategies to Identify and Mitigate Hazardous Noise, but Inconsistent Practices and Limited Training Weaken Their Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Services Use a Risk-Based Approach to Monitor Sites for Hazardous Noise Levels, but Lack Reliable Notification for Interim Changes", "paragraphs": ["According to services\u2019 policies, the services monitor noise levels at various  sites on a periodic basis according to the level of risk these sites pose to  servicemembers, but they do not provide guidance for a reliable  notification system for changes to site conditions that may occur in the  interim. DOD policy specifically requires the services to measure noise  levels, and we found that hearing conservation personnel at each of the  sites we visited use noise surveys to assess the level at which specific  work and training areas are likely to expose servicemembers to hazardous  noise. At the sites we visited, such site noise is subsequently monitored  through periodic surveys, scheduled according to their respective level of  risk. For example, at sites we visited, high-risk areas, such as firing ranges  and flight decks, thought to pose the greatest chance of exposure to  hazardous noise are surveyed annually. Medium risk areas, such as flight  hangars and light industrial areas can be surveyed every 2 years; low-risk  areas, such as administrative offices, can be surveyed up to every 5 years,  depending on the service\u2019s policy. For example, Navy officials told us they  conduct noise surveys every 4 years for their administrative offices,  whereas Army officials conduct them every 5 years.", "According to the policies from most services, responsibility for measuring  and reporting noise levels is delegated to experts in noise abatement, such  as industrial hygienists, who employ a number of measuring devices, such  as sound level meters and noise dosimeters, to determine how loud the  noise is and how long servicemembers are exposed (see fig. 2 for  examples of measuring devices). At the sites we visited, the results of the  measurements were recorded on noise survey forms that were used as the  basis for reports that were sent to safety offices, individual military units,  work sites and base leadership, depending on local base procedures.", "At the sites we visited, while the frequency at which the services monitor  site noise depended on an initial determination of the site\u2019s risk level, it  did not appear that changes to a site that alter its noise levels are always  promptly and systematically reported. DOD policy requires that noise be  measured within 30 days of any change in operations affecting noise  levels; however, several noise abatement experts at the sites we visited  told us they are not always informed of changes in noise. Instead, they  more often encounter the changes in noise levels during a scheduled noise  survey. Some of these experts suggested that servicemembers could be  exposed to more hazardous noise levels for a prolonged period of time if  no one informs them of changes to noise levels between scheduled  surveys; some of which are conducted only once every several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Employ Strategies to Mitigate Noise, but Some Practices Are Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with DOD policy for those in the hearing conservation  program, the services employ a number of strategies to control the amount  of exposure to hazardous noise.

Under  DOD policy, the services are required to use engineering controls as the  primary means of eliminating personnel exposure to potentially hazardous  noise. During our site visits, we observed examples of how the services  have implemented such controls. For example, at an Air Force base  maintenance shop we visited, we observed a \u201cmuff\u201d being used to reduce  the noise for a newly acquired water drill. At a Navy base we visited, a  separate building was constructed apart from the maintenance shop to  house a loud piece of equipment to reduce servicemembers\u2019 noise  exposure. Services are also required to review equipment being  considered for procurement to determine if they produce hazardous noise  and consider methods for limiting the noise when technologically and  economically feasible. In the Air Force, when designing weapons and  facilities such as firing ranges, procurement decisions are not made at the  base level, but are decided centrally by the Air Force Civil Engineering  Support Agency (AFCESA). AFCESA attempts to strike a balance between  operational effectiveness and worker protection when making  procurement decisions. During this decision-making process,  bioenvironmental engineers and other staff are involved in examining  safety, fire, and occupational health issues\u2014including hazardous noise.  For example, AFCESA\u2019s involvement in the procurement of the new F-22  fighter jet led to considerations in how bases could redesign hangars to  reduce the impact of noise from this plane. Officials from the Army Office  of the Surgeon General said noise abatement experts are usually included  in the procurement process for weapons systems, though not necessarily  for non-weapon system procurements. Also several Navy officers from the  Office of the Surgeon General told us the Navy has recently started to  include industrial hygienists in the procurement of weapon systems  though, to date, this has involved only one such procurement. Navy  officials also added they are attempting to update their own procurement  guidance to include noise abatement experts.

For example, the DOD allows servicemembers to  be exposed to 85 decibels of noise, a more stringent threshold than the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers  hazardous, for up to 8 hours without the use of hearing protection  equipment. However, according to a number of hearing conservation  personnel, controlling the amount of time that servicemembers are  exposed to noise is often more practical for military personnel who work  in civilian or industrial style, non-military operations. By comparison, for  servicemembers engaging in military operations, abiding by specific time  limits is more difficult because their duties may require them to stay at  their station beyond recommended limits. For example, hearing  conservation personnel aboard an aircraft carrier we visited told us that  personnel who work on the flight deck have flight operations lasting as  long as 16 hours. Reflecting a similar point, an audiologist told us that  controlling the amount of time Marines are exposed to hazardous noise in  battle is unrealistic, as Marines cannot stop fighting because they have  exceeded their allotted exposure time to noise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personal Protective Equipment", "paragraphs": ["DOD policy requires servicemembers to wear personal protective  equipment, such as earplugs, when engineering controls are not sufficient  to reduce noise levels. Based on our interviews with servicemembers and  audiologists, we found that the services largely make such equipment  available. More specifically, some servicemembers at the sites we visited  told us they were able to obtain hearing protection primarily from their  units or from hearing testing centers and from work or training areas (see  fig. 3 for examples of hearing protection devices). However, according to  several hearing conservation personnel we spoke with, some of the  services do not have an up-to-date list of approved equipment that units  can choose from when purchasing hearing protection. They also said  purchasers have little to no experience with hearing protection and we  were told of a unit that, as a result, had purchased personal protective  equipment without determining whether it would be effective. Hearing  conservation personnel at one of the Army bases we visited recounted a  story where one unit deployed using untested hearing protection that was  later rejected. In addition, senior DOD officials also told us that some  servicemembers bought their own hearing protection equipment that was  below the required standards. Finally, we observed that servicemembers  themselves are not necessarily using equipment provided to them or are  not using the hearing protection equipment properly.", "To assure that the correct personal protective equipment is used, DOD\u2019s  policy requires that all hazardous noise areas and industrial and military  equipment have signs or labels that identify them as producing hazardous  noise. The signs and labels are also expected to communicate the level of  protective devices (i.e., single or double hearing protection) that should be  worn to prevent hearing loss while working in or around the hazardous  noise. However, at many of the sites we visited, we observed signs and  labels indicating hazardous noise equipment or areas, although not all of  the signs included the protective measures required. (See fig. 4 for an  example of a hazardous noise sign that does not include the level of  hearing protection needed.) In some limited instances, a sign was not  posted in an area that the safety officer guiding our walk-through noted  should have had proper signage.", "Also, some of the servicemembers at the sites we visited maintained that  enforcement of the wearing of protective equipment is limited. These  servicemembers said their superiors did not consistently check for  equipment usage, and there is little to no discipline for members who are  not using them. Some services also placed the responsibility for reminding  their members about the importance of hearing protection with  servicemembers who are often of lower rank and thus lack the authority  to enforce adherence to the requirements. Army Hearing Program  personnel described to us a program that assigned specific soldiers to  disseminate information on hearing conservation issues and remind  individuals to wear hearing protection. However, according to some Army  Hearing Program staff these assigned soldiers were of low-rank with  limited authority to ensure their peers and superior officers were educated  on hearing conservation or wore appropriate hearing protective  equipment.", "During our interviews with DOD officials and servicemembers, we heard  that in some cases, servicemembers do not wear required hearing  protection. During our site visits, many servicemembers expressed a  number of reasons why they chose not to wear the required hearing  protection. Some servicemembers said the protective equipment was  uncomfortable. At the sites we visited we spoke with a number of  servicemembers working on a flight line in close proximity to fighter jets  who are required to wear double hearing protection. While they were  generally aware that they were required to wear double protection, each  was wearing single protection and many cited comfort as a reason for their  non-compliance. (See fig. 5 for an example of the proximity of flight line  personnel to jet airplanes.) At other locations we visited, servicemembers  cited the impact of hearing protection on communication. They said that  the protection can interfere with the need to communicate with their  colleagues and to hear orders from superiors. Still others said they  perceived that wearing hearing protection in combat can put them in  harm\u2019s way because they cannot hear an enemy approach or determine  where enemy gunfire is coming from. Finally, many servicemembers  expressed the view that hearing loss is part of the military experience and  many accepted this as a fact of a military career. For those that used  hearing protection equipment, we heard of a number of instances where  hearing protection equipment was not worn properly. Across many of the  military sites we visited, servicemembers told us of hearing protection  either falling out of their ears or getting dirty to the point of being  unsanitary to wear."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Educating Servicemembers on Hearing Conservation Is Not Necessarily Tracked or Well Timed", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with DOD policy for the armed services\u2019 hearing  conservation programs, participating servicemembers should be educated  and trained annually with regard to hearing conservation requirements.

For example, Army Hearing Program personnel  noted that the Army has no method for tracking whether soldiers have  received such training. Also, Navy hearing conservation personnel told us  the Navy operates systems for tracking individual training activities, but  servicemembers are not required to record their training in the system.  However, Air Force officials require that workplace supervisors document  a servicemember\u2019s annual training on hazardous noise exposures and  equipment on an Air Force Record of Training form.", "We also found that educating servicemembers on hearing conservation is  not necessarily conducted prior to servicemembers\u2019 first exposure to  hazardous noise or during hearing tests, when they are interfacing with  audiologists or audiometric technicians with hearing conservation  expertise. At many of the sites we visited, we were told that  servicemembers, as new recruits, were given very little education on  hearing conservation prior to the first time they fire weapons during basic  training in these locations. The education generally consisted of  instructors telling new recruits to simply use hearing protection in their  ears, but not explaining its importance or the proper technique to insert  such equipment. A few servicemembers stated they were told not to wear  hearing protection during training, with the justification that training  should be conducted under the same conditions as combat, which does  not include hearing protection. Also, at the sites we visited, a number of  servicemembers added that educating new recruits on hearing  conservation may be difficult during basic training because there is little  time for any additional education. Despite these observations, a number of  hearing conservation personnel told us that even a single exposure to  hazardous noise can trigger some level of hearing loss and believe that  educating new recruits on hearing conservation during basic training  would help underscore the importance of hearing protection.", "Lastly, several audiologists and audiometric technicians\u2014hearing testing  personnel\u2014at sites we visited told us there is no formal training in  conjunction with the hearing examination process for those  servicemembers in a hearing conservation program. Similarly, a number of  servicemembers we spoke with noted that the training they receive from  hearing testing personnel primarily consists of reminding them to wear  hearing protection.

Several senior service-level hearing program managers expressed  concern about the adequacy of the indicators. More specifically, they told  us that the current performance indicators are not sufficiently  comprehensive and that the rate of significant hearing loss only provides a  measure of performance after damage has occurred. In general, key  officials in the services we spoke with expressed a desire for more leading  indicators that could signal to program managers that targeted  interventions are needed before hearing loss has occurred. Moreover,  some Army officials told us that they would like to see indicators that are  more closely aligned with their readiness\u2014which is a basic measure to  assess each servicemember\u2019s ability to deploy. A senior-level DOD official  told us they convened two working group sessions\u2014which involved  representatives from across the services\u2014since spring 2010 to discuss  amending existing performance indicators. According to another senior- level DOD official, additional indicators were put in place in December  2010 when DOD released its updated hearing program guidance. This  guidance includes indicators designed to be more proactive in hazard  evaluation and intervention prior to measurable hearing loss, such as the  percentage of noise hazardous workplace characterizations completed and  an index of unacceptable noise exposures.

DOD has  multiple information systems related to its hearing conservation program,  including one that tracks servicemember hearing test results and another  that tracks servicemembers\u2019 exposure to occupational noise hazards. But  officials we spoke with identified limitations in the processes designed to  support these systems that, collectively, compromise the reliability or  usefulness of performance data that they generate.", "We found limitations in the process to identify whether hearing loss for an  individual may have occurred. Typically, immediately prior to  administering a hearing test, an audiometric technician will query the  hearing test system to retrieve a servicemember\u2019s prior test results, which  are used as a baseline with which to establish whether a loss has occurred.  However, on some occasions, prior hearing test data cannot be located in  the system and must be entered manually by audiometric technicians  before they administer the hearing test. For example, at one base we  visited, if a servicemember did not bring their original paper examination  to the test, technicians told us they would sometimes have to categorize  the test as a \u201cnon-hearing conservation\u201d hearing test or have to re-establish  the baseline hearing test, making it difficult to assess whether a significant  hearing loss has occurred because there would not be two comparison  points. Audiometric technicians must also manually enter into the hearing  test system whether a servicemember is receiving an initial or follow-up  hearing test. However, Navy researchers conducting system reliability  tests told us they have found anomalies in how initial and subsequent  hearing tests were categorized, making it difficult to tell whether tests  were given in the proper sequence. They attributed many of these  problems to technicians\u2019 manual data entry errors and the lack of a  consistent review process to ensure these entries are accurate, which  undermine the accuracy of the test data.", "We also found limitations in the process to establish that hearing loss for  an individual has actually occurred. If a hearing loss is detected during an  annual examination, it is generally considered temporary until the hearing  loss is confirmed in at least two additional follow-up examinations.  According to DOD officials, servicemembers must appear for the follow-up  examinations within 90 days of an annual test. However, we found that  when servicemembers who fail their annual tests do not appear for follow- up examinations within the required period, the system will automatically  count their temporary hearing loss as permanent. To the extent this  occurs, the rate of permanent hearing loss could be inflated. Without a  reliable rate for hearing loss, services are unable to properly assess the  effectiveness of their program or properly target prevention efforts.", "Finally, in reference to hearing tests, we found limitations in the process  used to identify the number of servicemembers enrolled in the services\u2019  respective hearing conservation programs\u2014which is essential to  calculating the hearing test compliance rate. Because the system designed  to track hearing tests does not automatically capture the number of  enrollees, each service must estimate its number from other data sources.  For example, Air Force hearing program enrollment information is  maintained in a separate database that does not link to the hearing test  system. Consequently, Air Force officials resort to using an often time- consuming manual process to tally the number of servicemembers  enrolled in the hearing conservation program. Similarly, Navy and Marines  officials told us that at some locations, officials must construct enrollment  information from multiple sources, including paper files.

This system is designed to track  servicemembers\u2019 occupational exposure to noise and other hazards over  the course of a military career. However, based on the information we  received, the system is not yet fully implemented at some installations.  Moreover, Army industrial hygiene officials at one installation told us that  they had been trained on the system, but did not have the staff resources  to upload exposure information into the system from individual files. In  discussing this issue, Army officials told us that 300 new industrial hygiene  personnel they expect to hire over the next 3 years will aid systems  implementation. A senior-level Air Force official told us that the Air Force  has fully implemented the hazard tracking system across all installations.  However, Air Force industrial hygiene officials expressed concern to us  about the system\u2019s capacity to generate reports in a format that provides  useful performance information. More specifically, they noted that to get  critical information about the hazards that exist in each Air Force work  site, the new system generates a 14-page report. To overcome the system\u2019s  limitations, the Air Force developed a reporting process that could  produce the same information in 2 pages. A senior-level Air Force official  told us it is necessary for them to upload hazard information twice daily  from the new system into an existing Air Force form to get the  performance information needed to effectively mitigate noise hazards on  base and meet DOD requirements, respectively. Moreover, the hazard  exposure tracking system is not currently integrated with the hearing test  system. DOD initially designed these systems with the intent to integrate  data from both systems to identify the impact of each servicemember\u2019s  individual exposure to noise and other occupational hazards. Although the  DOD hearing test system has been active since 1999 and the hazard  exposure system was initiated in 2006, to date, these systems have not  been linked.

However, based on interviews  with senior-level officials and our site visits, coordination does not appear  to routinely occur at some bases. For example, at a Navy and Marine base  we visited, industrial hygienists were responsible for identifying hazardous  noise at work sites and making recommendations on how to mitigate these  hazards, but they had no authority to oversee the implementation of their  recommendations. Across all the services, officials, who reside in a  separate department from industrial hygienists, are responsible for  monitoring hearing loss and following up and enforcing industrial hygiene  recommendations, but we were told on some bases these two departments  rarely coordinate. At one base we visited, industrial hygiene and audiology  officials had never met one another prior to our visit. However, we did  document one instance of effective coordination at one Army installation,  whereby an audiologist responsible for hearing testing identified an  increase in hearing loss among servicemembers at a particular work site.

The reviewers recommended  a number of policy changes to make hearing protection policies more  effective for active duty soldiers, such as requiring that, in order to meet  combat readiness standards, soldiers must be up to date on their periodic  hearing tests and be fitted with combat arms earplugs. Subsequently, the  Army instituted a policy that soldiers who did not meet the hearing  readiness standard could not be deployed. Army officials we spoke with  told us that implementing this enhanced readiness standard has improved  compliance with hearing tests, and have given individual soldiers and unit  commanders clear accountability for taking steps to protect soldier  hearing.
