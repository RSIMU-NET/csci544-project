In its report to Congress, DOD addressed the six elements that included, among other things: (1) a description of the ADM facility and its capabilities and an explanation of the origin of the ADM capability requirement; (2) information on some of the program goals, high-level performance metrics, and estimated completion costs along with a statement that DOD is not requesting procurement or operations and maintenance funds in the future years defense program for the ADM facility and that sustainment costs will come from existing medical countermeasure programs; (3) a copy of a 2009 analysis of alternatives conducted for the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services (HHS) that DOD stated justifies the ADM capability; (4) and (5) combined, an independent analysis of the incremental cost and benefits, schedule, and performance of continued DOD investment in its ADM facility; and (6) the department's medical countermeasures production plans for the ADM facility.", "GAO identified additional information related to these elements that may be useful for congressional oversight. This information may be particularly useful as DOD decides whether and how to renew its contract for 2-year option periods with the contractor that constructed the ADM facility. First, DOD's sustainment payments for priority access to the ADM capability will be budgeted as a cost of developing medical countermeasures (e.g., vaccines), a funding structure similar to the model used with DOD-owned laboratories, according to DOD officials. Second, discussions with officials indicate that the total costs to the ADM capability contractor to operate and maintain the ADM facility, which are separate from and in addition to the costs in the initial contract with DOD for building the facility, were not fully known at the time of DOD's report and are not fully covered by the DOD-provided sustainment payments. However, GAO learned that the contractor and DOD have taken some initial steps toward bringing additional funded work to the DOD ADM capability, which may help to reduce DOD's sustainment payments under the contract options. Third, the three HHS facilities were not analyzed as alternatives to the DOD ADM facility, although HHS officials said that DOD could separately contract for medical countermeasures with any of HHS's facilities, either independently or through existing HHS contracts. Officials from DOD's ADM program office stated that the HHS facilities are not appropriate for DOD's needs\u2014because they are large dedicated facilities designed primarily to address pandemic influenza threats. However, an official from one of the three HHS facilities informed us that they currently produce medical countermeasures for DOD. An official with the ADM program office said that DOD is represented on the governing board for the HHS Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing and is aware of what HHS is doing there, so this information can be taken into consideration along with ADM performance and utilization metrics as DOD considers future contract extensions for the ADM capability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

These  concerns stem from the challenges associated with attracting large and  experienced private-sector pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce  DOD-specific medical countermeasures. These challenges include, but  are not limited to, overcoming the manufacturers\u2019 concerns about low  profitability, intellectual property rights, the lack of a long-term  commitment from DOD, complying with the Federal Acquisition  Regulation, and restrictions on exporting medical countermeasures.  Specifically, a recent study conducted for DOD said that DOD medical  countermeasures have little or no commercial market, and DOD will not  buy sufficient quantities at high enough prices to justify the opportunity  cost to large pharmaceutical manufacturers. Even during a crisis, large,  dedicated production lines from these private-sector manufacturers would  not be readily convertible to produce DOD medical countermeasures.  Small biopharmaceutical companies often originate the innovations  needed for DOD medical countermeasures, but lack the experience and  capability to develop the production processes beyond laboratory scale  and also do not conduct the clinical trials required for licensure by the  Food and Drug Administration. As a result, according to DOD\u2019s Joint  Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, DOD\u2019s  reliance on small innovator biopharmaceutical companies resulted in a  lack of Food and Drug Administration regulatory and manufacturing  experience, schedule slips, increased costs, and a lack of access to  manufacturing infrastructure.", "In 2014, we reported that DOD had started planning to develop an  advanced development and manufacturing (ADM) facility in 2012 with the  capability to produce medical countermeasures such as vaccines and  other therapeutics using \u201cflexible technologies.\u201d DOD formally contracted  for a public-private partnership with a private-sector biopharmaceutical  company in March 2013 to construct the ADM facility. We noted in the  2014 report that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  also had contracted for three facilities\u2014Centers for Innovation in  Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM)\u2014with the capability  to produce medical countermeasures using flexible technologies.  According to officials with DOD\u2019s Chemical and Biological Defense  Program, DOD\u2019s ADM facility became fully operational in March 2017.  According to HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness  and Response, as of April 2017, it was yet to be determined when the  three CIADMs would be fully operational, as this includes establishing  their pandemic flu surge capacity. HHS officials said that all three  CIADMs have been capable of responding to core services task orders  since early 2014. In our 2014 report, we reported that DOD and HHS had  established a memorandum of understanding to facilitate collaboration at  their facilities for advanced development and manufacturing and  recommended, among other things, that DOD develop and implement a  process to update and validate DOD\u2019s list of biological threats. DOD  concurred with the recommendation but had not fully implemented it at  the time of our review.", "Because of cost and schedule overruns and the apparent overlap of DOD  and HHS efforts to establish ADM capabilities, Congress included a  provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016  that DOD conduct an independent cost-benefit analysis of DOD\u2019s ADM  facility and report the results, among other things, before all authorized  fiscal year 2016 research, development, test, and evaluation funds for this  facility could be released to the department.", "DOD submitted its report, Department of Defense Advanced  Development and Manufacturing Capability Report, to Congress on  October 17, 2016.

We obtained documents from and conducted interviews with  analysts from the Institute for Defense Analyses to corroborate our  understanding of their DOD-commissioned study. Additionally, we  obtained documents from and conducted interviews with officials from  DOD, HHS, and the ADM and CIADM contractors regarding the  information that DOD had provided in its report and to determine what, if  any, other information related to the six required elements might be useful  to Congress. Finally, we conducted site visits at the following facilities to  compare the capabilities of the DOD ADM facility with the capabilities of  the three HHS CIADM facilities: (1) DOD\u2019s ADM facility operated by  Nanotherapeutics, Inc. in Alachua, Florida; (2) HHS\u2019s CIADM facility  operated by the Texas A&M University System in College Station, Texas;  and (3) HHS\u2019s CIADM facility operated by Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., in  Baltimore, Maryland. Due to ongoing sensitive contract negotiations  during our audit work, we were unable to visit or meet with officials from  HHS\u2019s third CIADM facility, which at the time was contracted to Novartis  Aktiengesellschaft (AG) in Holly Springs, North Carolina. In lieu of a site  visit to that facility, we met with senior officials in HHS\u2019s Office of the  Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to discuss the North  Carolina CIADM facility. In December 2016, HHS informed us that  bioCSL/Seqirus was now recognized by the U.S. government as the  owner and operator of the HHS CIADM facility in Holly Springs, North  Carolina.

According to the ADM contractor\u2019s  executives, DOD\u2019s sustainment payments should represent  approximately 25 percent of this overhead cost for operating the ADM  facility. As noted earlier, DOD is working to renegotiate the amount of the  sustainment payments based upon several changes, such as changes in  facility size, the number of employees in the facility, and the sale of the  contractor\u2019s building and the land for the ADM facility. Further, as the  cost-benefit analysis portion of the DOD report noted, the sustainment  payments are not fixed at the amount negotiated by DOD and the  contractor, but may be reduced through funded work. As the DOD report  states, there is some uncertainty about the amount each dollar of funded  work will offset a dollar of overhead cost (i.e., the costs covered in part by  DOD\u2019s sustainment payments). Nanotherapeutics executives noted, for  example, that there can be great variations in the cost of labor and  materials for some contracts, although other cost elements remain more  fixed.", "During our review, we learned that the contractor and DOD have taken  some initial steps toward bringing additional funded work to support the  DOD ADM capability, which may help to reduce DOD\u2019s sustainment  payments under the contract options.

Second, included within the  noncompetitive contracting mechanisms discussed in the cost-benefit  analysis portion of the DOD report to Congress was Other Transaction  Authority. DOD\u2019s ADM program officials informed us that DOD used this  authority in April 2016 to establish a consortium through which the  department may be able to award some DOD medical countermeasures  efforts to the ADM facility while retaining some of the benefits of  competition, since the ADM contractor is a member of the consortium.  DOD officials explained that because this consortium operates under  Other Transaction Authority, it provides DOD with more flexibility to  negotiate with contractors and to arrange for some subcontracted work to  go through the ADM facility, as well as provide access to industry  expertise and collaboration, among other things. DOD officials also  expect the consortium to provide its members with a flexible contracting  vehicle capable of multiple taskings with a single set of terms and  conditions.

However, since neither the DOD nor HHS capabilities  existed at the time of the 2009 analysis (the contracts were signed in  2013 and 2012, respectively), the analysis did not consider HHS\u2019s  CIADMs as alternatives for DOD or DOD\u2019s ADM capability as an  alternative for HHS. HHS issued a request for contract proposals for the  CIADMs in March 2011, 5 months before DOD issued its request for  contract proposals for the DOD ADM. However, even though the HHS  CIADMs were not analyzed as alternatives to the DOD ADM capability,  HHS officials said that DOD could separately contract for medical  countermeasures with any of HHS\u2019s CIADMs either independently or  through existing HHS CIADM contracts. Additionally, a senior official with  DOD\u2019s ADM program office informed us that the program office constantly  assesses its portfolio, and maintains awareness of the HHS CIADMs  through DOD\u2019s participation in HHS\u2019s Public Health Emergency Medical  Countermeasures Enterprise\u2014an interagency body\u2014and the CIADM  governing board.", "Although officials from DOD\u2019s ADM program office stated that the HHS  CIADMs are not appropriate for DOD\u2019s needs\u2014with one official noting  that they are large dedicated facilities designed primarily to address  pandemic influenza threats\u2014the cost-benefit analysis for DOD\u2019s ADM  capability conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses, as well as our  own observations, suggest otherwise. Based on discussions with CIADM  and HHS officials and some CIADM contractor documents, all three of the  HHS CIADMs plan to use flexible manufacturing technologies in at least a  portion of their facilities and may be capable of addressing DOD\u2019s flexible  manufacturing needs. At least one CIADM official has testified about this  capability at a CIADM facility upon completion, as at least 50 percent of  the CIADM capabilities will be available for non-HHS projects. Officials  from two of the CIADMs informed us that they could potentially address  some of DOD\u2019s medical countermeasure manufacturing needs, to include  potentially providing priority access to the CIADM capabilities under a  contract. In addition, an official from one CIADM informed us that the  CIADM\u2019s contractor currently is producing medical countermeasures for  DOD. An official with the ADM program office said that DOD is  represented on the governing board for the CIADMs and is aware of what  HHS is doing there, so CIADM information can be taken into  consideration along with ADM performance and utilization metrics as  DOD considers future contract extensions for the ADM capability.

During our review, we identified  additional information that may add clarity to various aspects of the cost- benefit analysis. DOD\u2019s contracted analysis compared the cost and  benefits, schedule, and performance of continued DOD investment in the  DOD-dedicated ADM capability with a set of available alternatives. The  cost-benefit analysis also reviewed the results of a study conducted by  Tufts University in 2015 to determine whether the \u201csunk\u201d costs (i.e., costs  incurred in the past that will not be affected by any present or future  decision) of constructing the DOD ADM facility were of an appropriate  magnitude.", "DOD reported that, per the results of the Institute for Defense Analyses- conducted cost-benefit analysis, with the exception of certain potential  benefits that are hard to quantify, the benefit of having a DOD-dedicated  ADM capability was largely focused on the priority access to the  manufacture of biologic medical countermeasures guaranteed to DOD  through the sustainment payments. The cost-benefit analysis quantified  this benefit as potentially saving 13 to 28 months of production time over  the future years defense program\u2014which captures and summarizes  forces, resources, and programs associated with all DOD operations  approved by the Secretary of Defense\u2014and 23 to 50 months of  production time over the course of current manufacturing production  projections for medical countermeasures. The cost-benefit analysis also  concluded that this priority access could come at a cost of between   $55 million and $76 million over the future years defense program (and  between $93 million and $136 million over the course of current  manufacturing production projections). The cost-benefit analysis noted  that DOD could offset some or all of this cost if the DOD-dedicated ADM  facility received sufficient DOD and non-DOD funded work to offset  DOD\u2019s annual sustainment payments to the contractor.", "Our review of the cost-benefit analysis suggests that it can help inform  decision makers about the potential economic effects of DOD\u2019s  investment. We also identified additional information that would be useful  for Congress in evaluating or interpreting the results of the DOD- commissioned cost-benefit analysis. Specifically, we reviewed the ADM  cost-benefit analysis using selected key elements, based on economic  guidance from the Office of Management and Budget and other sources,  to determine whether the cost-benefit analysis provided evidence to  decision makers of the potential economic effect of DOD\u2019s continued  investment in the ADM capability. Based on this review, we identified  the following regarding the cost-benefit analysis:", "The cost-benefit analysis did not estimate the monetary value of the  potential benefits of the DOD-dedicated ADM capability, such as  those associated with priority access, making it unclear whether  DOD\u2019s continued investment in the ADM capability is economically  justified (e.g., whether the benefits exceed the costs).", "Future costs were not discounted.", "The analysis did not clearly discuss the baseline that was used to  estimate incremental costs and benefits (i.e., Institute for Defense  Analyses officials explained to us that the ADM capability was  evaluated against a baseline that was not a single facility, but rather a  combination of the HHS CIADMs and other similar facilities owned by  private contract manufacturing organizations).", "The analysis assumed that development and manufacturing costs of  the DOD-dedicated ADM capability and the alternatives would be  roughly comparable, but did not assess some plausible adjustments  to this assumption in a sensitivity analysis.", "According to the Institute for Defense Analyses official overseeing the  analysis, data used to develop the estimate of time savings\u2014the  primary benefit of having a DOD-dedicated ADM capability, according  to the analysis\u2014were anecdotal and were not assessed for reliability  due to time constraints; additionally, industry changes limit the  usefulness of retrospective studies. where i is the  interest rate and t is the number of years from the date of initiation for the program or  policy until the given future year. See Office of Management and Budget, Circular A-94  (Oct. 29, 1992). use has only recently become common place. As a result, these changes  in the industry would limit the usefulness of retrospective studies because  older data and practices are not comparable to current data and  practices.", "Additionally, the Institute for Defense Analyses\u2019 cost-benefit analysis  reviewed a study previously conducted by Tufts University in 2015 to  determine whether the ADM capability\u2019s sunk costs were of an  appropriate magnitude. In its review, the Institute for Defense Analyses  concluded that the Tufts University assessment was reasonable, and  provided a brief explanation of the Tufts University sunk-cost analysis,  stating that the 2015 Tufts University assessment demonstrated that the  costs of building the facility were within the expected bounds for the  project. The 2015 Tufts University sunk-cost analysis may provide  additional information in understanding the degree to which \u201cthe  manufacturing and privately financed construction\u201d of the DOD ADM  facility is justified."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making any recommendations in this report.
