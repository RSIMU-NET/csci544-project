For example, based on preliminary results from a representative sample of weekend-nighttime and Friday daytime drivers, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) 2013-2014 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers ( NRS ) estimated that 20 percent of drivers would have tested positive for at least one drug, with marijuana being the most common drug. However, the survey does not capture the extent to which drivers were impaired by drugs. Arrest data and drug-testing results provide some information on drug-impaired driving, but these data are limited. For example, data for drug impairment may not be separated from that for alcohol impairment and drug testing is not standardized. According to NHTSA officials, currently available data on drug involvement in crashes are generally unreliable due to variances in reporting and testing.", "The lack of a clear link between impairment and drug concentrations in the body makes it difficult to define drug impairment, which, in turn, exacerbates challenges related to enforcement and public awareness. Compared to alcohol, defining and identifying impairment due to drugs is more complicated due to the large number of available drugs and their unpredictable effects. For example, the NRS includes tests for 75 illegal prescriptions, and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs identified as potentially impairing. Additionally, law enforcement processes for obtaining samples for drug testing can be time consuming and result in a loss of evidence. For example, there is no validated device for roadside drug testing, and obtaining a search warrant to collect a blood sample to confirm the presence of drugs in a driver's system could take several hours, during which time the concentration of the drug in the driver's system could dissipate. Further, state officials identified limited public awareness about the dangers of drugged driving as a challenge. As a result, members of the public may drive while impaired without knowing the risks, potentially leading to collisions, injuries, and fatalities.", "Federal and state agencies\u2014including NHTSA, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014are taking actions to address drug-impaired driving, including improvements in the areas of research and data, education for police officers, evidence gathering, and legal changes. For example, NHTSA is currently conducting research to assess the crash risk associated with drug use (including illegal, prescription, and OTC drugs) by collecting samples from more than 10,000 drivers. However, public awareness of the dangers of drug-impaired driving is an area in which state officials told us that NHTSA could do more to support their efforts. As part of its mission to support state safety efforts, NHTSA has provided media and other materials to states for impaired-driving awareness programs, but these materials are focused on alcohol-impaired driving. While NHTSA plans to improve public awareness through initiatives to conduct surveys on drug-impaired-driving behaviors and attitudes as well as training for medical professionals, these plans could take several years to implement. Additional efforts, such as general messaging reminding the public about the impairing effects of drugs, could help improve public awareness in the near term."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NHTSA take additional actions to support states in emphasizing to the public the dangers of drug-impaired driving.

For  example, officials in six of the seven selected states told us that state  arrest data does not currently separate data on drug-impaired driving and  alcohol-impaired driving cases across law enforcement agencies.

However, the increase in arrests may be due to the 659 percent increase  in the number of officers participating in impaired-driving enforcement  activities, the 1,604 percent increase in the number of traffic stops, and  better reporting of those traffic stops, rather than an increase in drug- impaired driving. The rates of contacts resulting in DUID arrests do not  show an increasing trend.

Officials from NHTSA and  six states said that in general, if a person suspected of impaired driving  has a BAC over 0.08, the individual is not tested further for the presence  of drugs, regardless of whether drug impairment is also suspected. As a  result, drivers impaired by both drugs and alcohol may not be reported  accurately in arrest data, contributing to a lack of knowledge about the  number of drivers impaired by both drugs and alcohol.", "Further, based on our review of information from the seven selected  states on arrests and toxicology results for DUID cases, we found that  state data on impaired driving are often not centralized or complete.  Among the selected states, data on DUID arrests are generally collected  by local law enforcement agencies, and one of the seven selected states  collects statewide data on DUIDs in a centralized database. While  Arizona collects arrest data from a majority of its local law enforcement  agencies in a central database, a small number of local agencies do not  participate. One official estimated about 2 percent of agencies do not  submit data. Similarly, statewide toxicology/drug-testing data may not be  easily available because it is decentralized. In five of the seven selected  states, toxicology data are maintained by individual state and local law  enforcement agencies and toxicology labs (including private and public  labs), with no centralized database. For example in California, DUID  testing varies by jurisdiction and can be completed by one of 22 private  labs or 6 public labs at the local or state level. In contrast, Vermont and  Washington have centralized results of all DUID drug tests, which are  conducted by a single laboratory for each state. While Vermont toxicology  data do not show any clear trends, a study using Washington state  toxicology data indicates that the prevalence of marijuana in suspected  impaired-driving cases increased after marijuana was legalized, from an  average of 19.1 percent of cases positive for tetrahydrocannabinol   (THC) from 2009 through 2012 to 24.9 percent in 2013 (post  legalization). However, according to one of the authors, it is unclear  whether this increase is due to factors other than an increase in  marijuana-impaired driving, such as an increased focus on marijuana  impairment in the state. Over the same period, the prevalence of alcohol  and drugs other than marijuana in the population of suspected impaired  drivers remained relatively stable in Washington.", "Further, drug test results may not be comparable among laboratories.  Officials from three of the seven selected states, as well as  representatives from SOFT, stated that a lack of standardization among  labs means that test results from different labs cannot necessarily be  compared. For example, labs do not have uniform reporting-level cutoffs  for drugs (the level at which a drug is reported as present). Therefore, for  the same sample, one lab may report the sample as positive for the  presence of a drug while another lab may report the sample as negative  because the amount present is below the reporting level cutoff for the  second lab.

Alcohol is a chemically simple  molecule that is absorbed and metabolized at a relatively consistent and  predictable rate. In contrast, most drugs are chemically complex  molecules; various drugs are absorbed and eliminated from an  individual\u2019s system at different rates. As a result, impairment does not  necessarily correspond to a specific concentration level in the blood, and  detectable amounts of certain drugs may remain even after impairing  effects wear off. For example, as noted earlier, marijuana can be detected  in a daily marijuana user\u2019s system up to 30 days after using the drug.  Toxicologists in four states and representatives from SOFT stated that, as  a result, a positive drug test does not necessarily indicate impairment.", "Additionally, drugs can have varying and unpredictable effects on  individuals. For example, individuals with prescriptions for central nervous  system depressants, such as a prescription sleep aid, can develop a  tolerance which can reduce some of the impairing effects. During the first  few days of taking a prescribed central-nervous-system depressant, a  person can feel sleepy and uncoordinated, but as the body becomes  accustomed to the effects of the drug and tolerance develops, these side  effects begin to disappear. As a result, drug concentrations that would be  impairing for one individual may not be impairing to another. Further,  drivers may combine more than one drug or mix drugs with alcohol, which  can have unpredictable results and cause impairment more quickly than  the same amounts of each substance taken alone. According to literature  we reviewed, when combined, multiple drugs or drugs and alcohol can  have a synergistic effect, rather than a simple additive effect, so each  substance may increase the impairing effects of the others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyzing Samples for the Large Number of Available Legal and Illegal Drugs Is Time Consuming and Expensive", "paragraphs": ["Drug testing is more time consuming and expensive than testing for  alcohol because rather than the single blood or breath test needed to  determine blood alcohol level, separate tests must be conducted for each  suspected drug class (e.g., pain relievers, antidepressants), and the  required instrumentation is sophisticated and costly. According to  toxicologists from two states and representatives from SOFT, it is more  expensive to test for drugs than alcohol. For instance, one toxicologist  stated that standard equipment for alcohol analysis costs between  $100,000 and $120,000; but equipment needed to test for certain types of  drugs can cost up to $500,000. Additionally, the number of potentially  impairing legal and illegal drugs is large. For example, the NRS tested  drivers for 75 illegal, prescription, and OTC drugs identified as potentially  impairing, and while some medications do not affect or can even improve  driving ability, the FDA has identified eight common classes of  prescription and OTC medications as potentially impairing.

According to toxicologists in two states, to pursue  detection of new drugs, even if the molecular structure is only slightly  different from other known drugs, labs need to develop a new testing  methodology and then validate that methodology through extensive  testing on each individual instrument. For example, according to one  toxicologist, developing and validating testing methods for a new drug  recently cost about $31,000. Validation of new methodologies is a  complicated task and requires qualified personnel, time, and money.

For example,  officials from a state highway-safety office stated that a DUID arrest can  take 3 to 4 hours if blood is being collected, because arresting officers  must wait for a warrant signed by a judge to conduct the blood test.  Moreover, depending on local requirements and resources, potential  offenders may need to be transported by law enforcement to a hospital or  other location for a phlebotomist or nurse to collect a blood sample,  leading to further delays.

According to a 2010 NHTSA report on the  effectiveness of such laws, the compelling argument for zero tolerance  laws is that, in their absence, a driver under the influence of an illegal  substance was less likely to be prosecuted for impaired driving than a  driver under the influence of alcohol. This problem existed because a  maximum threshold linked to impairment has been established for  alcohol, but there is no practical way to establish such a level for drugs.  This study found some anecdotal support that zero tolerance laws  increased prosecution rates, but a lack of reliable data prevented NHTSA  from conclusively determining the effectiveness of such laws. Further,  officials from NTSB stated there is no evidence that zero tolerance laws  reduce impaired driving (since a driver need not be impaired to be  prosecuted under the law). As of December 2014, 15 states have enacted  laws that prohibit driving with a detectable prohibited substance in the  driver\u2019s body, without any other evidence of impairment. For example,  Illinois prohibits drivers from having a detectable amount of any illegal  substance or other prohibited substances listed in the statute in his or her  system, which would include certain medications such as hyoscyamine,  which is used to control symptoms associated with gastrointestinal  disorders. See figure 2.", "Per se laws/drug concentration limits: Some officials recommend  establishing \u201cper se\u201d limits, or thresholds, for certain drugs, similar to the  0.08 BAC limit established for alcohol.

As of  December 2014, six states have enacted per se laws based on drug  concentration limits for one or more drugs (see fig. 2).

Colorado has implemented a similar law establishing 5  nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood as a \u201cpermissible inference,\u201d  which, according to a state official, means jurors may infer that the  defendant was impaired but are not required to do so. Additionally,  Nevada and Ohio have developed per se thresholds for certain controlled  substances including illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin as well as  legal drugs such as amphetamines, which can be used to treat conditions  such as attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy.", "Per se laws based on drug concentration limits may increase  prosecutions for drivers who are over the established limits, but the  effectiveness of these laws is unknown and may have unintended  consequences. Officials from Colorado, Ohio, and SOFT stated that per  se limits make prosecution of drivers who are over the limits more likely.  However, others, including officials from California and Washington,  stated that it may also make prosecution of drivers who were observed to  be impaired but whose drug test results were under the established limit  more difficult: once thresholds are established, drivers and jurors may  develop the false assumption that driving below the established limit is  legal, even if there is observable impairment. Some toxicologists,  including representatives from SOFT, stated that per se laws based on  thresholds may serve a particular policy goal of increasing prosecutions,  but that a link between the established thresholds and impairment levels  cannot be supported scientifically. A representative from SOFT also  stated that, because illegal drugs generally have no medical purpose,  there is a significant difference between establishing per se threshold  levels for illegal drugs versus per se threshold levels for prescription and  OTC medications.
