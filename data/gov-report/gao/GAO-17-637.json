GAO was asked to review air ambulance pricing. This report examines: (1) the prices charged for air ambulance service, (2) the factors that affect prices, and (3) stakeholders' views on any actions the federal government could take to address air ambulance pricing. To answer these questions GAO analyzed 2 years of data (2010 and 2014\u2014the latest available) on prices from CMS and a private health insurance database; interviewed 26 stakeholders, such as 8 air ambulance providers chosen to represent a range of types (hospital-affiliated and independent) and sizes; and interviewed DOT and CMS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between 2010 and 2014, the median prices providers charged for helicopter air ambulance service approximately doubled, from around $15,000 to about $30,000 per transport, according to Medicare data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and private health insurance data. Air ambulance providers do not turn away patients based on their ability to pay and receive payments from many sources depending on the patient's coverage, often at rates lower than the price charged. For example, the Medicare median payment was $6,502 per transport in 2014. Air ambulance providers might bill a privately-insured patient for the difference between the price charged and the insurance payment\u2014a practice called balance billing\u2014when the provider lacks an in-network contract with the insurer. However, due to a lack of information it is unclear to what extent patients are balance billed.", "Factors such as a provider's proportion of transports provided by payer and competition may play a role in air ambulance prices charged, but data to assess these factors are not available. For example, selected providers reported that they adjust prices to receive sufficient revenue from private health insurance to account for certain lower-paid transports, such as those covered by Medicare. Price increases may also be tied to the industry's characteristics such as apparent market concentration\u2014the three large independent providers reported operating 73 percent of the industry's total helicopters in 2016. An analysis of these factors is not possible due to a lack of currently available data such as the number of transports or the industry's composition by provider.", "Selected stakeholders we spoke to proposed actions to address air ambulance pricing issues, including (1) raising Medicare rates, (2) allowing state-level regulation of air ambulance prices, and (3) improving data collection for the purposes of investigations and transparency regarding prices. Stakeholders expressed mixed views on the first two proposals but none disagreed with the third. Federal internal control standards state that management should identify and communicate information needed to achieve objectives and address risks. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has discretionary authority to investigate potentially unfair practices in air transportation or the sale of air transportation, but has not exercised this authority in regards to helicopter air ambulances. DOT officials said they need additional information about the air ambulance industry. For example, DOT officials note that they have received few air ambulance complaints since 2006 and report that consumers may not think of DOT as the place to complain. Although DOT recently modified its online form to include air ambulance complaints, it has not communicated how to file complaints. Without doing so and obtaining more industry data, DOT is missing important information needed to put complaints into the context of the overall industry that could affect its assessment on whether to pursue investigations. Further, stakeholders such as hospital staff could benefit from greater transparency as they currently have limited ability to make air ambulance decisions that serve both the financial interests and medical needs of the patient."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Transportation should: (1) communicate a method to receive air ambulance, including balance billing, complaints; (2) take steps to make complaint information publicly available; (3) assess available data and determine what information could assist in the evaluation of future complaints; and (4) consider air ambulance consumer disclosure requirements.

Medical theory and practice hold  that providing critically injured patients with medical intervention within the  first hour after injury occurs\u2014the so-called \u201cgolden hour\u201d\u2014can  significantly improve chances for survival and recovery. Air ambulance  helicopters, with their ability to land at accident sites and quickly shuttle to  landing areas at or near hospitals, can reduce transport times for many  patients.", "Since enactment of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which  deregulated the domestic air carrier industry, including air ambulance  providers, the number of air ambulance helicopters has grown steadily\u2014 from an estimated fewer than 100 helicopter air ambulances in the early  1980s to 1,045 in 2016. In the past few years, instances of \u201cbalance  billing\u201d\u2014when patients with private health insurance are billed by  providers for the difference between the air ambulance price charged and  the insurer\u2019s payment\u2014have received attention in the news media. For  example, on December 4, 2015, a helicopter air ambulance patient was  transported 66 miles from Tawas, Michigan, to Saginaw, Michigan. The  provider, which was not contracted with the patient\u2019s insurance, charged  $35,000 for the transport. The patient\u2019s insurance paid $6,320, leaving a  balance of almost $29,000 for which the patient was billed. The patient\u2019s  family later unsuccessfully petitioned both the insurer and the state of  Michigan on this bill, noting that during the emergency, which involved a  gunshot wound to the leg from a hunting accident, no alternative transport  options were offered. Although most patients have little to no choice over  the service or provider during air ambulance transports, they might be  billed for charges that can have potentially devastating financial impacts.

We  reviewed documentation\u2014including pertinent laws, regulations, guidance,  enforcement actions, and legal opinions\u2014and interviewed officials from  DOT and the Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Air ambulance providers inhabit a unique position at the intersection of  aviation and medical services. Providing air ambulance service is capital  intensive and requires both aviation and medical investments (see fig. 1).  Air ambulances must be ready to deploy at a moment\u2019s notice in  response to emergencies. Air ambulances are of two main types\u2014rotor  wing (helicopter) and fixed-wing aircraft. These two types of aircraft are  generally used on different types of missions, with helicopters providing  on-scene responses and shorter distance hospital-to-hospital transports  and fixed-wing aircraft providing longer transports between airports.  Because helicopter air ambulances make up approximately 74 percent of  all air ambulances, this report focuses on helicopter air ambulance  service. This report also focuses on air ambulance providers that are  direct air carriers. Although most people may associate helicopter air  ambulance with on-scene response to an accident such as a car  accident, the majority of transports are interfacility, or from hospital to  hospital. For example, Air Methods, the largest air ambulance provider,  reported in June 2016 that of its total flights in the first quarter of 2016,  approximately 70 percent were interfacility and 30 percent were on-scene  response.", "Unlike other aviation services that are scheduled ahead of time, air  ambulance transports are initiated only in response to time-sensitive  medical-related events. In the case of on-scene response transports, first  responders decide when air ambulance service is needed, while hospital  staff make decisions regarding when to initiate interfacility transports.  Because air ambulance providers transport critically sick or injured  patients facing time-sensitive emergencies, patients typically have little to  no ability to make cost-saving decisions, such as selecting a provider that  participates in the patient\u2019s insurance or electing to be transported by  ground ambulance. On the other hand, air ambulance providers respond  to emergencies without regard for a patient\u2019s ability to pay and provide  the same service regardless of the amount the provider will ultimately be  compensated for the transport.", "Air ambulance providers fall under three main types of business models,  which vary on which entity makes business decisions, including setting  prices and determining in-network agreements with private insurance.  These business models are:", "Hospital-affiliated\u2014may be a department of a hospital or owned by  a consortium of hospitals, is typically non-profit, makes business  decisions, and provides the medical crew. These providers may  operate their own aviation services or contract for the services, often  from companies that operate their own air ambulance service as  independent providers.", "Independent\u2014a company, typically for-profit, that handles both  medical and aviation aspects and makes business decisions.", "Hybrid\u2014joint venture between a hospital and an independent provider  where the hospital typically provides the medical crew but (unlike the  hospital-affiliated model) does not make business decisions, although  the hospital name may be branded on the helicopter. Instead, the  independent provider makes business decisions such as setting  prices.", "In 2007, we reported that a few large providers dominated the air  ambulance industry, and in 2010, we reported that the industry had  shifted since 1999 from mostly hospital-affiliated providers toward  independent providers. These trends appear to have continued. For  example, in 2015 three for-profit, independent providers together reported  operating 692 helicopters, or about 66 percent of the total 1,045  helicopters in the industry that year. These three providers operate  helicopters that span all three business model types across multiple  states. As a result, some of these 692 helicopters may be under contract  for aviation services to hospital-affiliated providers, in which case the  hospital pays the independent provider a fixed rate and sets the prices  charged for the service rather than the independent provider.", "Air ambulance providers, like other medical service providers, charge  standard rates for all transports but receive payments from many sources,  often at varying rates. Air ambulance providers charge patients based on  a pre-established lift-off fee and per mile fee, regardless of medical  services provided in route. Providers then receive payments from a mix of  sources, depending on the transported patient\u2019s insurance coverage.  The amount paid by private health insurance also depends on whether  the provider has a contract in place with the insurer. Key payers of air  ambulance service charges include:", "Medicare\u2014a federal program for people who are 65 or older and  certain younger people with disabilities, regardless of income level.", "Medicaid\u2014a joint federal and state program for some people with  limited income and resources.", "Private health insurance companies\u2014may have a contractual in- network agreement with an air ambulance provider for a payment rate  negotiated ahead of time. Without such a contract, air ambulance  providers are considered out of network, and the insurance  company\u2019s policies set its payment rates.", "Self-pay\u2014patients not covered by insurance.", "Whether or not an air ambulance provider may bill a patient for amounts  in excess of the amount covered by insurance, as well as any  deductibles, coinsurance, or copayment\u2014called balance billing\u2014varies  based on the patient\u2019s insurance coverage. Under Medicare rules, for  example, air ambulance providers are not permitted to balance bill  Medicare patients for ambulance services beyond deductibles and  coinsurance requirements. With respect to Medicaid, providers  participating in a state\u2019s Medicaid program are required to accept  Medicaid payment as payment in full and are prohibited from collecting  any additional amounts from Medicaid patients, other than authorized  cost sharing amounts. Patients with private health insurance might only  be balance billed when the insurer and provider lack an in-network  agreement, while uninsured patients might be held responsible by the  provider for the entire price charged (see table 1).", "CMS sets rates and pays claims for Medicare. Medicare payments,  including beneficiary co-payments, for helicopter air ambulance service  totaled approximately $460 million in 2014. Although CMS typically sets  Medicare payment rates by considering whether payments are adequate  for a relatively efficient provider, Medicare rates for air ambulance  service were last updated in 2002 as part of a negotiated rulemaking  that involved public and industry stakeholders. Beginning with the  negotiated rulemaking in 2002 through 2006, CMS phased in an air  ambulance fee schedule as part of a series of Medicare reforms that  were enacted into law in 1997. The fee schedule redistributed payments among various types of ambulance services and effectively raised the  payment amounts for air ambulance service. Medicare air ambulance  payments include three components: a base payment, a separate  payment for mileage to the nearest appropriate facility, and a geographic  adjustment factor. In addition, there is a permanent add-on payment that  includes a 50 percent increase to both the base and mileage rate for rural  air ambulance transports. Since 2006, CMS has adjusted rates annually,  primarily based on inflation.", "Although the prices, routes, and services of the air ambulance industry  are largely deregulated, DOT oversees certain aspects of the industry. As  air carriers, air ambulance providers fall under the ADA, which was  designed to promote \u201cmaximum reliance on competitive market forces\u201d as  the means to best further \u201cefficiency, innovation, and low prices\u201d as well  as \u201cvariety  quality\u2026 of air transportation.\u201d The ADA also contains  a provision that explicitly precludes state-level regulation of matters  related to air carrier rates, routes, and services. Beyond aviation safety,  which DOT\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees in a variety  of ways, DOT oversees certain aspects of the industry. DOT\u2019s  involvement with the air ambulance industry falls within the Office of the  Secretary of Transportation (OST). For example, as an air carrier, an air  ambulance provider must obtain economic authority from DOT before  offering service. In addition, OST\u2019s Office of the General Counsel issues  guidance and opinion letters regarding the ADA provision that precludes  state level regulation of air ambulance prices, routes, and services.  Furthermore, the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation  Enforcement and Proceedings (Enforcement Office), within OST\u2019s Office of the General Counsel, has discretionary authority to investigate whether  an air carrier, including an air ambulance provider, has been or is  engaged in an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive  practice in air transportation or the sale of air transportation.", "States are involved with air ambulances in several ways and some have  taken action to bring awareness to air ambulance pricing. State  emergency medical services offices are responsible for licensing medical  services such as emergency medical technicians and ground and air  ambulances. In addition, states have the authority to regulate the  business of insurance and, as a part of this function, may review insurers\u2019  health insurance plans and premium rates. Furthermore, each state  administers and operates its Medicaid program, including setting payment  rates, within broad federal requirements. States across the country have  attempted to gather information or raise awareness regarding air  ambulance pricing. For example, state governments have held hearings,  including Maryland (2015) and Pennsylvania (2017); New Mexico recently  completed a study, and Florida has convened a working group to  examine air ambulance pricing issues. Meanwhile Montana developed a  public website that features \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d about air  ambulance service and provides information on pricing and the extent of  contracting with insurance by provider."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Median Prices Charged Approximately Doubled from 2010 to 2014, and Extent of Balance Billing Is Unknown", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Median Prices Charged by Air Ambulance Providers Increased 76 to 113 Percent from 2010 to 2014", "paragraphs": ["Between 2010 and 2014, the median prices charged for helicopter air  ambulance service by providers approximately doubled.

For example, according  to Medicare data, median payments per transport increased only slightly  between 2010 and 2014\u2014from $6,267 in 2010 to $6,502 in 2014.

In contrast to the payment received, these selected providers  reported average prices charged ranging from $13,200 to $49,800 per  transport in 2016.", "Representatives of the providers we spoke to said that privately insured  patients account for the highest percentage of their revenue. For  example, seven of the eight providers indicated that the majority of their  transport revenue comes from privately insured patients, which accounted  for a minority (22 to 41 percent) of their overall transports in 2016.  According to an HCCI report, which includes data from three large,  national private health insurers, the median payment these insurers paid  per transport increased by 70 percent from 2010 to 2014, from about  $15,600 to $26,600. As with prices charged, payment amounts increased  in range between these years, with the upper end payment increasing  more substantially than the lower end payment. Although HCCI data  includes approximately 40 million individuals with employer-sponsored  insurance, according to an HCCI representative, patients in rural areas  may be underrepresented in the data. Even though the HCCI data show  private insurance payments increasing largely in parallel to price  increases from 2010 to 2014, representatives from five of the eight  providers we spoke to noted that payment rates from private insurance  have been declining.

For example, according to Air Methods representatives, to operate one air  ambulance helicopter requires a staff of 13\u20144 pilots, 4 nurses, 4  paramedics, and a mechanic\u2014in order to maintain around-the-clock  readiness and be ready to deploy at any time. In contrast, helicopter tour  operators would generally only need to employ a pilot for times when  flights are arranged. Air ambulance providers\u2019 costs for air ambulance  service are relatively fixed\u2014meaning they do not increase significantly  when they complete more transports. For example, personnel and the  costs of helicopter ownership are the same regardless of how often the  helicopter is used. Providers we spoke to noted that a small portion of  their costs\u2014such as fuel\u2014are variable, meaning they increase with the  number of transports completed. To be profitable, and thus be in business  and provide service, providers must earn sufficient revenues to cover  their costs, including their fixed costs. To increase revenue, a provider  must increase its number of transports and/or its prices charged. When a  provider has a lower transport volume, then that provider must earn  higher prices on average across transports in order to be profitable.  Representatives from the eight selected providers we spoke to reported  average costs per transport, given current transport volumes, of $6,000 to  $13,000 in 2016.", "Representatives from the providers we spoke to agreed that average  transport volume per helicopter has decreased but offered different  perspectives on this change. According to the Atlas & Database of Air  Medical Services, from 2010 to 2014, the number of air medical  helicopters nationwide increased by more than 10 percent, from 900 to  1,020. Meanwhile, over the same time period, Medicare and HCCI data  do not show a proportionate increase in the number of transports per  Medicare or private health insurance beneficiary. Specifically, from 2010  to 2014, the number of air ambulance transports per 1,000 patients was  flat for Medicare and decreased slightly among privately insured patients  represented in the HCCI data. Representatives from three providers  stated that there is an issue with overcapacity or oversaturation in the  industry and that the helicopters being added to the industry are in areas  with existing coverage and not serving additional demand, thereby  reducing the average number of transports per helicopter rather than  increasing access to patients previously not covered by the service. On  the other hand, representatives from four other providers told us that the  decrease in transports per helicopter is due to helicopters increasingly  being located in rural areas where there is greater need, but less  population density, leading to fewer transports per helicopter.

Providers have  limited ability to control the payer mix\u2014the proportion of transports  reimbursed by, for example, Medicare or private health insurance\u2014as  they do not turn away patients based on insurance coverage.  Representatives from three providers report that the payer mix has shifted  over time from private insurance to Medicare as the population ages. For  example, one large independent provider reported a 13 percent shift in  transport mix from private insurance to Medicare over a 10 year period,  while a hospital-affiliated provider reported that since 2013, the  percentage of its transports covered by Medicare has increased from 30  to 35 percent, while the percentage of privately insured patients has  decreased from 39 to 33 percent.

As noted previously, patients do  not have control over decisions allocating the use of emergency air  ambulance service, such as the choice of air versus ground service or  between providers. As a result, patients cannot avoid out-of-network air  ambulance providers. In such an environment, providers may not lose  transport volume as a result of raising prices or being out-of-network with  private health insurance. Consequently, air ambulance providers are not  subject to the price competition that typically occurs in competitive  markets, where if prices are too high, consumers will find alternatives  such as a lower-priced service or provider. Furthermore, the ADA  preempts state-level regulation of prices, routes, and services of air  carriers, including air ambulance providers. DOT\u2019s guidance notes that  once DOT has granted economic authority to an air ambulance provider,  \u201cthe competitive marketplace, rather than state regulations\u201d controls the  provider\u2019s prices, routes, and services.", "Based on the eight selected providers we spoke to, the large independent  providers may have higher prices and be less likely to contract with  insurers than hospital-affiliated providers.

In addition, representatives from  the three large independent providers we spoke to noted they generally  do not have contracts with insurers, which, as noted earlier, leaves  patients vulnerable to balance billing. For example, representatives from  one large independent provider noted that they have contracts in place  with fewer than 10 of the approximately 1,000 private insurance payers  they work with per year\u2014in other words, around one percent. A  representative from a large independent provider noted that being out of  network with insurance is advantageous to the provider because a patient  receiving a balance bill will ask for a higher payment from the insurance  company, which often results in higher payment to the air ambulance  provider than having a pre-negotiated payment rate with the insurer. On  the other hand, a representative from a small hospital-affiliated provider  told us that as a non-profit, they feel obligated to contract with the largest  insurer in their service area, in part because one of the hospitals the  provider is affiliated with contracts with the insurer.", "The nature of competition in the air ambulance industry may also be  affected by the proportion of air ambulance helicopters operated by the  three large independent providers, which is growing and may indicate  increasing market concentration. Specifically, the three large independent  providers reported operating 692 air ambulance helicopters in 2015 and  763 in 2016\u2014an increase from about 66 to 73 percent of all helicopters in  the industry. This growth may be due to mergers and acquisitions. For  example, in January 2016, Air Methods acquired Tri-State Care Flight,  which had a fleet of 22 helicopters. In April 2017, the second largest air  ambulance provider, Air Medical Group Holdings (AMGH) announced that  it had agreed to acquire Air Medical Resource Group, adding 62 bases  across 15 states to its business. In addition, the three large independent  air ambulance providers are for-profit and increasingly owned by private  equity firms. For example, the largest provider in the industry, Air  Methods, a publicly traded company, announced in March 2017 that it  had entered into an agreement to be acquired by a private equity firm for  a total transaction value of approximately $2.5 billion. Meanwhile AMGH  is also held by a private equity firm and was purchased in 2015 for a  reported $2 billion.

Additionally, although the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has cost data for a  portion of ambulance providers\u2014those owned by hospitals\u2014CMS  found that these data had limitations, such as not distinguishing  between air and ground ambulance transports.

Furthermore, according to Xcenda representatives, the study  was designed to assess the adequacy of Medicare\u2019s air ambulance  payment rates, which may give respondents an incentive to report  high costs to justify higher Medicare payments.", "Number of transports: As noted above, transport volume is a key  factor in determining the total revenues earned and costs incurred to  provide service. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012  required that that the FAA collect certain specified operations data for  the air ambulance industry, including the number of annual transports,  and report this information to Congress by 2014 and annually  thereafter. In May 2017, FAA provided its first submission under the  act to Congress. The submission contains a summary of data  collected from helicopter air ambulance operators from April 1, 2015,  to December 31, 2015.", "Provider information, including business model type and established  prices charged: As noted above, the air ambulance industry may be  increasingly concentrated, which could indicate a lack of competition  in the industry such as relatively few providers setting prices for a  large portion of the total market. However, industry-wide data are not  available, such as prices charged by provider or providers\u2019 business  model types (hospital-affiliated, independent, or hybrid). Industry  information may become more difficult to obtain as private equity firms  increasingly own air ambulance providers. For example, upon  completion of the acquisition noted above, Air Methods\u2014the largest  provider in the industry\u2014will no longer be required to submit periodic  reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as is  required of publicly held corporations, thereby eliminating a key  source of publicly available information on the industry. As a result of  the lack of industry wide data, it is unknown how the approximately 73  percent of helicopters operated by the three large providers translates  into market share. Likewise, it is difficult to assess the nature of  competition in the industry or even determine relationships between  providers, such as what entity sets pricing for a particular provider. As  noted earlier, the helicopters operated by the large independent  providers include those contracted to hospital-affiliated providers that  set their own prices, as well as hybrid programs where the helicopter  is branded as part of the hospital system, but where the independent  provider sets the prices. For example, representatives from AMGH  note that one of their subsidiaries\u2014Air Evac Lifeteam\u2014is not  generally contracted with hospitals, but another AMGH subsidiary\u2014 Med-Trans\u2014operates mostly hospital-affiliated bases. However,  according to these representatives, AMGH handles its own pricing,  billing, and collections across 97 percent of all of its bases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Stakeholders Proposed Actions Regarding Air Ambulance Pricing, Including Improved Data Collection and Transparency", "paragraphs": ["The 26 stakeholders we interviewed identified three types of potential  actions to address air ambulance pricing, as shown in table 2.

Some stakeholders  said that when the ADA was enacted in 1978, the air ambulance industry  was in its infancy, and so the ADA was not formulated with the unique  aspects of the air ambulance industry in mind. In addition, some  stakeholders told us states are best suited to regulate air ambulance  service, noting that states have an incentive to protect patients from large  balance bills while also ensuring access to the service. Some states, such  as North Dakota, have passed legislation designed to address air  ambulance billing, legislation that has subsequently been struck down in  court. In particular, in 2015, the North Dakota legislature passed a statute  intended to protect patients from large balance bills. It required, among  other things, that air ambulance providers submit documentation  indicating that they are participating providers with health insurers in the  state that cover a certain proportion of the state\u2019s population in order to  be listed on a \u201cprimary call list\u201d for dispatching. The state statute also  required that air ambulance providers make their fee schedules available  to certain requesters, including potential patients, upon request. However,  the state statute was challenged in federal district court and in March  2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota struck it down  as being preempted, ruling that the call list requirement was \u201cprecisely the  type of state regulation Congress sought to prevent\u2026in the ADA.\u201d North  Dakota officials said they would like to see the ADA modified so they  could implement such legislation. Subsequent to the ruling, North Dakota  enacted a new statute in 2017 which is designed to increase  transparency regarding an air ambulance provider\u2019s health insurance  network status in non-emergency situations. North Dakota officials we  spoke to noted that the most recent legislation, which was signed by the  governor in April 2017, will likely be challenged in court.", "Eight stakeholders opposed modifying the ADA and seven instead  suggested raising Medicare rates as an approach to addressing high air  ambulance prices. An air ambulance provider association noted that  modifying the ADA could create a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of regulations nationwide,  disrupting the regulatory certainty the industry has been built upon. This  association also noted that since air ambulance providers do not turn  away patients based on their ability to pay, providers have limited options  to cover their costs. Two stakeholders noted that increased Medicare  rates would reduce the need for air ambulance providers to increase  prices, thereby alleviating pressure on patients with private health  insurance.", "Although raising Medicare rates across the board for air ambulance  service is being promoted by some stakeholders, particularly the large  independent providers, 10 other stakeholders we spoke with disagreed  with this approach as a solution to addressing air ambulance pricing  issues. Raising air ambulance Medicare rates is being promoted through  a national campaign sponsored by several providers and a key industry  association which supports legislation to raise air ambulance Medicare  rates. Meanwhile, 10 stakeholders we spoke with\u20142 providers, 1  association representing providers, 4 groups familiar with air ambulance  business and billing, 1 selected state, 1 association of state officials, and  1 insurance association\u2014disagreed with raising Medicare rates as a way  to address balance billing. Some of these stakeholders noted that  increasing Medicare rates could incentivize further growth in the industry,  which could reduce the average number of transports per helicopter,  putting pressure on providers to increase prices charged\u2014thereby  exacerbating the problem. Further, industry growth may be an indication  that Medicare rates are not too low. We have previously reported that  when rates are set too low, access to appropriate care for patients  covered by Medicare may be adversely affected. However, the growth  in the number of air ambulance helicopters indicates that providers are  still deciding to provide service under existing Medicare rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Stakeholders Suggest Data Collection and Price Transparency Could Better Inform DOT and Stakeholder Actions", "paragraphs": ["Five of the 26 stakeholders we spoke to\u2014including three groups familiar  with air ambulance business and billing and two providers\u2014told us that  DOT should collect information to better understand the air ambulance  industry.

As noted earlier, three large air  ambulance providers operate 73 percent of the total helicopters in the  industry in 2016, although the extent to which this translates into  market share is unknown.", "Unfair or deceptive practices: DOT could potentially use such  information to investigate concerns or complaints of unfair or  deceptive practices, which, as noted previously, DOT through its  Enforcement Office has discretionary authority to investigate.", "An official from DOT\u2019s Enforcement Office noted that DOT has not  exercised its discretionary authority to investigate air ambulance  providers. DOT officials noted that DOT needs additional information  about the overall industry and that there is a dearth of information about  the industry generally. For example, the officials told us DOT has  received very few air ambulance complaints. In particular, the officials  said they searched their database and found a small number of  complaints since 2006. DOT officials noted they believe the small number  of complaints may be due to consumers not thinking of DOT when  encountering issues with air ambulance pricing, and instead filing  complaints with other entities such as their health insurance or state  department of insurance. As noted earlier, some states have collected  such information\u2014for example together Michigan and Montana collected  58 instances of balance billing since 2013. For the commercial airline  industry, which is also subject to the ADA, DOT\u2019s Enforcement Office  gives consumers multiple options for filing airline service complaints,  including through an online form that allows users to select from an  extensive drop-down menu of U.S. and foreign air carriers. In May 2017,  DOT added \u201cair ambulance (all)\u201d as an option on the online complaint  form, with a field to manually enter an air ambulance provider\u2019s name.  However, the DOT website does not have online instructions on how to  file air ambulance complaints. DOT\u2019s Enforcement Office has a website  with information such as how to file a complaint (by phone, mail, or  online), what types of complaints to file (those about service other than  safety or security issues), and how DOT uses the submitted information.  It is unclear how, if at all, such information applies to air ambulance  complaints. For example, DOT officials noted they would like consumers  to know the boundaries of DOT\u2019s jurisdiction regarding air ambulance  service. Without communicating this and other aspects such as how to file  an air ambulance complaint, DOT has limited ability to understand the  industry including the nature of competition that could affect its decisions  on whether to pursue investigations into potential unfair or deceptive  practices.", "Some selected stakeholders suggested increased price transparency as  a solution to address air ambulance pricing issues. In particular, nine  stakeholders we spoke to\u2014two providers, two groups familiar with air  ambulance business and billing, two insurance associations, two selected  states, and one group involved with consumer policy or research\u2014noted  that price transparency could provide benefits to providers and the  industry, patients, insurance companies and other payers, hospitals, and  first responders. Furthermore, the federal standards for internal control  state that management should externally communicate information  needed to achieve objectives and address risks. According to a DOT  official, DOT enforces disclosure requirements due to the ADA\u2019s focus on  competitive market forces, which relies on consumers having accurate  and timely information on which they can make decisions. For example,  for commercial airlines, DOT\u2019s Enforcement Office compiles a monthly Air  Travel Consumer Report that includes consumer complaints submitted to  DOT and is made available to the general public so consumers and  others can compare the complaint records of individual airlines. Such  consumer disclosure requirements are intended to enable consumers to  make informed decisions on tradeoffs when selecting flights, considering  such factors as provider, service quality, and price. DOT officials noted  that air ambulance providers have not yet been included in the Air Travel  Consumer Report but may be included if a provider reaches a certain  threshold such as five complaints received in a month. However, as  mentioned above, air ambulance patients may be unaware that they can  file complaints with DOT. Furthermore, DOT lacks industry information to  group complaints together and to identify patterns, particularly for large  nation-wide providers which, as mentioned previously, operate across  many states and may set prices for hybrid programs where the helicopter  may be branded with a hospital\u2019s name rather than the large provider\u2019s  name. Without more industry information, DOT is unable to put any such  complaints into the context of the overall industry, both for the purposes  of potentially investigating unfair and deceptive practices and for  accurately compiling complaints for public reporting.", "Although DOT has required consumer disclosures for the commercial  airline industry, it has not done so for the air ambulance industry, such as  disclosing to patients the prices charged for services. For example, DOT  has recently issued a final rule that, among other things, requires air  carriers to disclose when flights involve any code-sharing arrangements  and a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the  disclosure of baggage fees wherever fare and schedule information is  provided to consumers. DOT officials note they have not made such  requirements for the air ambulance industry due in part to the emergency  nature of air ambulance transports. In particular, DOT officials questioned  the value of consumer disclosure requirements for the air ambulance  industry given that patients have little to no choice or ability to \u201cshop.\u201d  However, a representative from a group involved with consumer policy or  research noted that it is important that the public understands the price  variation that exists among air ambulance providers, along with any potential limits of their insurance coverage. Furthermore, patients are not  the only \u201cconsumers\u201d of air ambulance service. Other stakeholders make  decisions regarding air ambulance service such as insurance companies  that pay for transports or hospitals and first responders that initiate  transports. According to a representative from an association of insurers,  transparency is the first step toward a rational approach to air ambulance  costs\u2014all stakeholders need to know such fundamental aspects as  average prices charged, transport frequency, and the amount insurance  and patients may pay. Without such information, stakeholders may not be  able to make decisions that serve the patients\u2019 best interest. For example,  if hospital staff had information on the extent to which providers in the  area were contracted with insurance, such staff may make more informed  decisions in selecting providers that best serve the financial interests of  the patient while still maintaining the same level of care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The ADA largely deregulated the domestic air carrier industry, including  the air ambulance industry, and was intended to promote reliance on  competitive market forces in order to best further quality service at low  prices, among other things. Despite growth in the number of helicopters  offering air ambulance service in recent years, lower air ambulance prices  have not materialized. In fact, air ambulance prices have increased\u2014 approximately doubling between 2010 and 2014\u2014and large providers  report average prices charged of over $40,000 per transport in 2016.  These increases pose risks to privately insured patients who may be held  responsible by the provider for a portion of these charges (balance  billing). Despite media reports of balance billing, DOT officials note they  have received very few air ambulance complaints since 2006, possibly  because consumers do not think of DOT as a place to file such  complaints. DOT recently modified its online form to include air  ambulance complaints, but the website does not have instructions on how  to file such a complaint. Without taking such steps, DOT is missing  potential information both for its understanding of the industry and for  public disclosure to enable informed decision making. Furthermore, DOT  lacks data needed to assess several key aspects of the industry, ranging  from basic aspects\u2014such as the composition of the industry by provider  type, prices charged by provider, or number of overall air ambulance  transports\u2014to the more complex, such as the extent of contracting  between providers and insurers or extent of balance billing to patients.  However, information from the eight selected providers we interviewed  indicate concerning trends about the nature of competition in the industry,  such as increasing prices and growing concentration of the market among  three large providers. Further, the increasing role of private equity in the  industry could further exacerbate these trends while also reducing  transparency. Without better information, DOT has limited ability to  understand the industry including the nature of competition that could  affect its decisions on whether to take investigative or enforcement  actions.

Although HCCI data include data from three large national insurers and  includes approximately 40 million individuals with employer-sponsored  insurance, the data may not be generalizable to all privately insured  patients. The years 2010 and 2014 were selected as they were the  furthest back year and the most recently available year from HCCI, could  be compared across both data sets, and allowed us to analyze changes  over time. The price charged is the amount providers claim for two  components: (1) the transport and (2) each mile that the patient is  transported. The amount paid is the total amount allowed by the payer  (i.e., the private insurer or Medicare); the patient may be responsible for a  portion of that total amount through copays or deductibles. For Medicare,  we excluded claims without both the transport and mileage components  and excluded claims with mileage amounts over the 99th percentile.", "To address possible issues with payments by secondary payers, we  excluded claims where the payment amount was less than 10 percent of  the price charged and claims that otherwise may have indicated a  secondary payer. We also excluded any claims for transports with  multiple patients or where an ambulance was dispatched but the patient  died before being transported; these types of transports are paid at  reduced rates. We also excluded outliers based on the price charged\u2014 excluding claims that were above the 99th percentile or below the 1st  percentile for that year. We assessed the reliability of the data published  by HCCI by reviewing related documentation, discussing the methods  used with knowledgeable officials, performing data reliability checks, and  comparing the findings to published information, and we determined the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Medicare  claims data, which are used by the Medicare programs as a record of  payments made to health care providers, are closely monitored by both  CMS and contractors that process, review, and pay claims for Medicare- covered services. The data are subject to various internal controls,  including checks and edits performed by the contractors before claims are  submitted to CMS for payment approval. Although we did not review  these internal controls, we assessed the reliability of Medicare claims and  enrollment data by reviewing related CMS documentation and comparing  our results to published sources. We determined that the Medicare claims  and enrollment data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives.", "To describe what is known about the factors affecting prices of air  ambulance service, we also reviewed previous reports on costs to provide  air ambulance service from the Department of Health and Human  Services and by the contractor Xcenda as commissioned by the  Association of Air Medical Services.
