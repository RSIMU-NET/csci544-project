This amount included $4.5 billion to convert federal buildings and U.S. courthouses into green buildings that would reduce energy and water use, among other goals.", "GAO was asked to review GSA's use of Recovery Act funds as they related to courthouses. This report examines (1) how GSA determined which courthouse projects to fund under the Recovery Act, (2) how GSA's management of selected Recovery Act projects aligned with successful practices and whether these projects disrupted judiciary operations, and (3) how GSA set environmental goals for courthouses and whether selected projects met those goals. GAO reviewed relevant laws and agency documents, collected cost and schedule data on courthouse projects, and analyzed environmental outcomes for 10 projects. GAO selected these 10 Recovery Act courthouse projects, based on project size, type, and location, and interviewed GSA officials and judiciary tenants about GSA's management and coordination."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The General Services Administration (GSA) developed eight selection criteria for utilizing its $4.5 billion in high-performing green (green) building funds\u2014or more than 80 percent of its total $5.5-billion budget\u2014under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). GSA used almost $800 million of its $4.5-billion green building funds on 15 full or partial modernization projects and the remaining funds were used on federal buildings or limited scope projects. For example, at the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in San Antonio, Texas, GSA installed solar panels and a solar water heater on the roof, installed a green roof on the interior courtyard, and replaced the building's lighting. In addition, as of May 2014, GSA used $257 million of the $750 million in Recovery Act funds dedicated to federal buildings and U.S. courthouses to construct or acquire seven courthouses.", "GSA management of selected Recovery Act courthouse projects did not always align with seven successful practices that GAO developed for managing large-scale investments. GAO's more in-depth review of 10 courthouses showed that while GSA generally provided top leadership support and sufficient funding, its management of these Recovery Act projects did not always align with the remaining five practices. For example, judiciary tenants at 3 of the 10 courthouses said that GSA management did not actively engage with judiciary stakeholders during construction. In one case, judiciary officials at the Federico Degetau Federal Building and Clemente Ruiz Nazario Courthouse in Puerto Rico said they were not consulted on the project's phased schedule approach that required the closure of all public restrooms in the operating courthouse for a year, except for one restroom on the seventh floor of the adjoining federal building. For the projects GAO reviewed, when GSA did not incorporate the successful practices, GAO found that projects were more likely to experience schedule delays, cost increases, or lack of tenant support. GAO found that most judiciary tenants were satisfied with the completed projects, although tenants at 4 courthouses said the projects disrupted court operations.", "GSA set environmental goals by establishing minimum performance criteria (MPC) to guide how it designed green courthouse Recovery Act projects; however, environmental outcomes are not yet known. The MPC included dozens of environmental requirements for projects in areas such as energy, water, and material use. While some Recovery Act projects have been completed for several years and GSA has the necessary data to evaluate projects, GSA officials have not developed a schedule for analyzing building performance against the MPC. GAO evaluated the extent to which the selected courthouses with a year or more of operational data contributed toward the energy and water- reduction goals that GSA used to develop the MPC. GAO found that as of fiscal year 2014, 2 of the 5 courthouses with available data are contributing toward energy reduction goals, and all 4 courthouses with available data are contributing toward water reduction goals. Without evaluating the performance of courthouse projects against the MPC, GSA lacks important information that could guide the agency's future investments in green infrastructure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA (1) examine incorporating successful management practices into its capital investment process and (2) analyze and apply environmental outcomes for green Recovery Act projects.

We use the term courthouse throughout the report to  refer to these buildings. To identify how GSA determined which U.S.  courthouse projects would receive Recovery Act funds, we reviewed  GSA\u2019s Recovery Act planning documents, project selection criteria, and  relevant legislation and guidance\u2014including the Energy Independence  and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and related federal statutes and  executive orders\u2014related to its $4.5 billion in green building Recovery Act  funds and its $750 million in Recovery Act funds for federal buildings and  U.S courthouses. We also worked with GSA and the Administrative Office  of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) to identify which Recovery Act projects had  any judicial presence. We excluded border stations and land ports of  entry from our analysis because none of these buildings has a judicial  presence. GSA categorized green buildings as full or partial  modernizations, limited scope projects, or small projects.", "To assess how GSA\u2019s management of selected Recovery Act projects  aligned with successful management practices and whether these  projects disrupted judicial operations, we applied seven successful  management practices for large scale investments that we identified in  prior GAO work. While the successful practices were originally  developed for information technology (IT) investments, IT stakeholders  agreed that these practices have broader applicability. We also shared  these successful practices with GSA officials who oversaw the Recovery  Act program and asked how GSA addressed each practice; GSA officials  did not identify any concerns with applying these successful practices to  Recovery Act projects. These practices are also consistent with the  leading practices we set forth in our capital decision-making guide. We  selected 10 courthouses, from GSA\u2019s 22 new construction or full or partial  courthouse modernization projects, for examination with regard to how  GSA implemented the management practices. We selected projects that  ranged in size, Recovery Act-funding amount, geographic location, and  project type. In general, we selected projects that had the largest scope  and funding because larger projects increased the likelihood that tenants  were aware of the Recovery Act-funded work and would be able to  describe how, if at all, GSA coordinated with them. We interviewed the  judicial tenants that resided in the selected courthouse buildings during  construction or would reside in them once construction was completed to  obtain their views about how their experiences aligned with the successful  practices mentioned above and whether projects disrupted court  operations. In addition to interviewing judicial tenants, after interviews, we  sent a structured questionnaire to tenants at each courthouse to verify  responses captured during initial interviews and to collect additional  information specific to the seven successful practices. Our findings from  our review of the 10 selected courthouse projects cannot be used to  make generalizations about all of GSA\u2019s Recovery Act projects. We also  examined GSA\u2019s cost and schedule data for all 22 courthouses that were  either full or partial modernization projects or new construction to identify  how, if at all, project costs or schedules changed from 2009 through  2014. We discussed with GSA staff how these data were collected and  maintained and determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To determine how GSA established environmental performance goals for  the courthouse projects it funded and the extent to which selected  projects met those goals, we reviewed agency and regulatory documents  describing GSA\u2019s performance goals for Recovery Act projects and  examined GSA\u2019s data on energy and water usage. Specifically, we  compared GSA\u2019s energy and water usage data for the selected buildings  from fiscal years 2003 and 2007, respectively, to fiscal year 2014 to  determine whether expected reductions in energy and water consumption  were achieved. We used 2003 energy data and 2007 water data because  those were the baseline years for federally required energy and water  reductions. We did not complete this analysis for courthouses that were  still under construction for any part of fiscal year 2014. We reviewed  documentation related to these data and interviewed knowledgeable GSA  staff about the quality of the data and determined the data to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

GSA established the PMO, which included construction and  acquisition subject-matter experts, to help regional teams deliver  Recovery Act projects on time and in accordance with GSA\u2019s policies and  Recovery Act requirements. The PMO provided additional support and  oversight to GSA\u2019s capital investment process. The PMO grouped GSA\u2019s  11 regions into three Recovery Act zones. GSA officials stated that the  objectives of the zone structure were to create and foster the sharing of  ideas and resources and to provide project oversight. GSA zone and  regional recovery executive officials were responsible for, among other  things, monitoring and reviewing the performance of Recovery Act  projects and managing risks at the regional level.", "GSA selected 259 federal buildings and U.S. courthouses for its  Recovery Act program, in addition to a number of small projects.

Among other things, a  green building must, throughout the life cycle of the building, as compared  with similar buildings, accomplish the following:  reduce energy, water, and material resource use;  improve indoor environmental quality, including reducing indoor  pollution, improving heating and cooling, and improving lighting and  acoustic environments that affect occupant health and productivity;  reduce negative impacts on the environment, including air and water  pollution and waste generation; and  consider indoor and outdoor effects of the building on human health  and the environment, including improvements in worker productivity,  and other factors, considered appropriate by specified green-building  officials.", "GSA\u2019s portfolio of buildings is also subject to federal energy and water  conservation requirements and goals established in federal statutes and  executive orders. For example, the National Energy Conservation Policy  Act, as amended by EISA and the Energy Policy Act of 2005,  established energy-efficiency performance standards. EISA amendments  require, for example, that agencies\u2014including GSA\u2014apply conservation  measures that annually reduce energy consumption resulting in a 30  percent reduction by fiscal year 2015 compared to a fiscal year 2003  baseline to applicable facilities across an agency\u2019s entire portfolio.

According to agency officials, GSA\u2019s criteria served as a reference for  initial project rankings, and the PMO made some modifications to those  rankings to arrive at a final project list, to ensure, for example, that each  of GSA\u2019s 11 regions received funding. Once the PMO and initial list of  selected projects were created, officials from the PMO would recommend  new projects as funds became available due to, for example, cost savings  on other projects. In total, GSA used about $800 million of its $4.5 billion  green building funds toward 15 full or partial courthouse modernization  projects (an average of about $53 million each).", "EISA\u2019s broad definition of green building attributes provided GSA  flexibility in carrying out its first selection criteria, targeting projects that  would help transform buildings into green buildings. For example, each of  the full or partial modernization courthouse projects we reviewed  contained green infrastructure components aimed at reducing energy and  water use, such as energy-efficient lighting and upgraded mechanical  systems or water-efficient bathroom fixtures. In our review of eight full or  partial modernization courthouses, we also found instances at each  courthouse where GSA utilized EISA\u2019s broad definition of a green building  to incorporate other goals, such as improving indoor environmental  quality, fire protection and life safety systems, or building layout.  According to GSA officials, each of these projects\u2014which were designed  under the supervision of GSA regional officials\u2014were reviewed by GSA\u2019s  PMO and legal department to make sure projects supported the goals of  EISA. The following examples illustrate how GSA used a portion of its  green Recovery Act funds for green infrastructure and other broader  uses:", "At the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in San  Antonio, Texas, GSA installed solar panels and a solar water heater  on the roof (fig. 1), a green roof on the interior courtyard, energy- efficient lighting, water-efficient plumbing throughout the building, and  a new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, among other  upgrades.", "At the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse in New York City, New  York, GSA used $64 million to pay for construction cost increases of  the full modernization project. According to GSA officials, costs  increased due to unforeseen building conditions that required  additional work, funding to remediate asbestos from the historic  building, and the higher-than-expected cost of construction in  Manhattan at the time.", "At the Birch Bayh Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in  Indianapolis, Indiana, GSA used a portion of its green funds to  complete structural renovations in bathrooms to increase accessibility  for people with disabilities. The project also included lead paint and  asbestos removal, new carbon monoxide sensors, and fire alarm  sprinkler systems.", "At the George C. Young Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in  Orlando, Florida, GSA regional officials told us they requested and  received $12.5 million in additional Recovery Act green project funds  to move an elevator pavilion to the building\u2019s exterior and improve the  building\u2019s layout (fig. 1).", "To minimize the execution risk and expedite the execution timing of  Recovery Act projects, GSA generally selected projects that had already  completed design work. GSA officials said that they used Recovery Act  funding to quickly begin or expand construction on these projects, while  also identifying ways to incorporate energy savings or environmental  improvements into their design. To guide the design process and ensure  that these projects contained green elements, GSA established minimum  performance criteria (MPC), which we will discuss in greater detail later.  Additionally, GSA funded cost escalation for some ongoing modernization  projects\u2014that is, projects that needed additional funding to start or  complete construction.", "GSA estimated the return on investment or cost effectiveness of its  Recovery Act investments based on a calculation of each investment\u2019s  simple payback period. Pursuant to Department of Energy regulations, as  a rough measure of cost effectiveness, federal agencies may calculate a  simple payback period for projects that demonstrate payback periods  significantly shorter than the useful life of such projects. The simple  payback period estimates the amount of time it takes to recover the cost  of an initial investment, through future energy and water cost savings. An  energy or water conservation technology is likely to be cost-effective if its  estimated payback period is less than the useful life of that system. In  accordance with the National Institute of Building Sciences\u2019 Whole  Building Design Guide, GSA can calculate cost effectiveness for all  project components within a building as a whole, rather than individually.  This process allows the benefits of some technologies to exceed the cost  recovery time frames if they are offset by technologies with shorter cost- recovery time frames, up to an average of 40 years. Table 3 shows  simple payback period estimates for selected energy- and water-saving  technologies installed at the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal Building and U.S.  Courthouse in San Antonio. According to GSA\u2019s analysis shown below,  project components that recover costs quickly, such as high-efficiency  chillers and low-flow plumbing fixtures have been combined with  components that take longer to recover costs, such as solar water  heaters, for a simple payback period below 40 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Generally Selected New Construction Projects That Helped It Build or Acquire New Courthouses", "paragraphs": ["In addition to $4.5 billion in green funds, the Recovery Act provided GSA  with $750 million for federal buildings and U.S. courthouses.

GSA project managers and judiciary tenants attributed the  timely completion to, among other things, good working relationships  between GSA and the judiciary. However, 14 of the 22 projects  experienced schedule delays or cost overruns. For example, according to  GSA officials, the Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole Federal Building and  U.S. Courthouse\u2019s full modernization in Honolulu was completed more  than 6 months after originally planned. GSA officials attributed the delay  to unforeseen conditions in a federally owned building that had been held  by GSA since it was built, including the need for asbestos removal, new  electrical wiring, and plumbing issues. GSA also requested an additional  $10 million in Recovery Act funds for the Federal Building and U.S.  Custom House in Denver to, among other things, increase the project\u2019s  scope and address unforeseen building conditions (e.g., asbestos  removal). As a result, the project was delayed about 6 months. For one  project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, GSA has encountered substantial  ongoing management challenges leading to both cost overruns and  schedule delays from the original planned completion date of December  25, 2014.

In at  least one instance, advantageous economic conditions allowed GSA to  increase a project\u2019s scope while staying within budget. According to GSA  officials, in these instances GSA project managers could request to use  extra funds for additional green upgrades or GSA could obligate the funds  to other projects. For example, GSA officials expected the Hipolito F.  Garcia Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in San Antonio to cost  about $50 million. When the awarded bid came in at $31 million, GSA  officials commissioned a green-performance study to identify additional  environmental improvements that could be made. As a result of the study,  the project included $16 million in green upgrades and was GSA\u2019s first  LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum  project.the project to stay within costs. As previously discussed, GSA reduced  the scope at three projects we reviewed because of unexpected  courthouse conditions. For example, solar panels were removed from the  original project plans for the Richard H. Poff Federal Building in Roanoke.  According to GSA officials, they excluded the solar panels in the final  project to use the funds instead for asbestos abatement and electrical  work.

According to GSA  officials, over the course of the Recovery Act, savings and project needs  fluctuated and GSA needed to account for that in its spend plan.

Conversely, judiciary tenants at 4 courthouses reported disruptions and  told us that the impacts ranged from moderate to significant. Judiciary  tenants described moderate disruptions to include such things as  requiring judges to move offices and modify schedules; significant  disruptions were said to be such things as unexpected trial delays  resulting from the Recovery Act projects. For example, the Richard H.

Furthermore, since GSA\u2019s  management of other construction projects is similar to how the agency  managed Recovery Act projects, going forward, GSA would be better  positioned to manage those projects more efficiently and with minimal  disruption to tenants if it ensured that the successful practices for large- scale investments were incorporated to the fullest extent appropriate.", "While GSA used the vast majority of its $4.5 billion in Recovery Act funds  to modernize buildings and install green technologies, building  performance and outcomes remain unclear.

We also shared these  leading practices with GSA officials who oversaw the Recovery Act  program to ask how GSA addressed each practice and incorporated any  comments as appropriate; GSA officials did not identify any concerns with  applying these successful practices to Recovery Act projects. These  practices are also consistent with the leading practices we set forth in our  capital decision-making guide.omitted two practices from our analysis. Specifically, we omitted two  practices: (1) end users participated in testing of system functionality prior  to formal end user acceptance testing and (2) program officials  maintained regular communication with the prime contractor.

We limited our selection from among the large courthouse projects  because there was greater risk in spending large amounts of funds under  the tight timeframes of the Recovery Act (compared to smaller projects)  and because the larger projects would likely be more visible to the  tenants and under construction for a longer period of time, resulting in  potential obvious benefits or inconveniences to courthouse tenants. Of  the 10 courthouse projects we selected, 2 were new construction  projects, 6 were full modernization projects, and 2 were partial  modernization projects.", "We conducted semi-structured interviews with GSA and judiciary tenants  at 6 courthouses in-person.

We  followed-up with judiciary tenants to make sure we had accurately  captured their assessments of GSA\u2019s management. Observations with  GSA and judiciary tenants at these selected courthouses cannot be used  to make generalizations about the views of all GSA project managers or  tenants of Recovery Act projects.", "To identify how, if at all, costs and schedules changed for selected  Recovery Act projects, we collected GSA\u2019s data on costs and schedules  for all 22 courthouses that were either new construction or full and partial  modernizations for years 2009 through 2014. To assess changes in  project costs, we compared GSA\u2019s original request to Congress against  the final project cost. To assess changes in project schedules, we  compared GSA\u2019s planned completion date with the contractor when the  project was awarded to GSA\u2019s substantial completion date. We also  interviewed GSA project managers to identify how costs or schedules  changed and any mitigating factors. We did not evaluate GSA\u2019s cost- estimating process for this report. GSA provided us data as of May 2014.  To assess the reliability of GSA\u2019s data we reviewed documentation  related to this data source from our prior reports, and agencies\u2019 websites,  and asked knowledgeable government officials to provide written  responses to our questions about the quality of the data. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable to provide general trends on GSA\u2019s  costs and schedules for Recovery Act projects. Since we only evaluated  22 Recovery Act projects, generalizations should not be made to all  projects. Rather, we provide illustrative examples for why costs and  scheduled may have changed.", "To determine how GSA set environmental performance goals for the  projects it funded and the extent to which selected projects met their  goals, we reviewed agency and regulatory documents and summarized  GSA\u2019s minimum performance criteria (MPC) for Recovery Act projects  and identified outcomes for select projects. We described how GSA  developed building-specific MPC that would also help the agency achieve  broader federal environmental goals and requirements, including energy  and water reduction requirements, as outlined in various statutes. While  GSA is required to meet federal-energy and water-reduction requirements  across its entire portfolio of buildings, it also tracks individual buildings  against this baseline. To evaluate whether the selection of buildings we  reviewed are contributing toward meeting federal energy and water  reduction goals, we analyzed GSA\u2019s data on energy usage for 5 of the 10  courthouses we reviewed, and we analyzed GSA\u2019s data on water usage  for 4 of the 10 courthouses we reviewed. We did not assess results for  the 2 new courthouses because the buildings were not yet constructed in  the federally-required baseline comparison years. We also did not assess  results for 3 courthouse modernizations that were under construction for  part of fiscal year 2014 because we wanted to compare a full year of  operational utilities data. We omitted the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal  Building and U.S. Courthouse from our analysis of water reductions  because of concerns we had regarding the reliability of its water use data.  GSA\u2019s MPC for energy and water reductions are developed with a  performance-based approach requiring, for example, that buildings  achieve a percentage reduction compared to a baseline. We compared  building-specific energy and water-use data from fiscal year 2014 to each  building\u2019s energy and water use data during the baseline comparison  years specified in the agency-wide federal energy and water reduction  goals GSA must achieve. Specifically, with respect to energy and water  usage, EISA amendments to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act  of 2007 require GSA to reduce energy consumption per gross square foot  of the buildings it manages by 30 percent by fiscal year 2015 compared  with fiscal year 2003, and must reduce water consumption per gross  square foot of the buildings it manages by 16 percent by fiscal year 2015  compared with fiscal year 2007, pursuant to Executive Order 13423.", "To evaluate project outcomes, we calculated energy and water use  reductions based on historic utility use data for electric, steam, gas, and  oil (none of the courthouses in our selection used coal), and water  utilities, provided by GSA. We converted all energy utilities to British  Thermal Units and calculated the energy use intensity\u2014British Thermal  Units per gross square foot\u2014to compare across our selection of  courthouses. Similarly, we calculated the water use intensity\u2014gallons per  gross square foot\u2014 to compare across our selection of courthouses that  had been in operation for the full fiscal year 2014. Our analysis has some  limitations, however. Comparing energy or water reductions based on two  endpoints can produce misleading results if the baseline or final years do  not represent a typical year of the assessed building. For example, many  variables can affect the results, making it difficult to attribute results to  installed building systems or technologies. Some of the reductions can be  attributed to the many green infrastructure enhancements made on the  building; other reductions could be explained by a change in building  occupancy rates or abnormal seasonal effects in the baseline or final  years of measurement that would influence demand for energy. We  assessed the reliability of the program data we used by reviewing GSA  documentation on GSA\u2019s Energy Usage Analysis System (EUAS), and  questioning knowledgeable GSA officials about the quality of the data and  controls in place to ensure data accuracy.
