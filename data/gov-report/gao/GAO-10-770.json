These projects must be relicensed when their licenses expire to continue operating. Relevant federal resource agencies issue license conditions to protect federal lands and prescriptions to assist fish passage on these projects. Under section 241 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, parties to the licensing process may (1) request a \"trial-type hearing\" on any disputed issue of material fact related to a condition or prescription and (2) propose alternative conditions or prescriptions. In this context, GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which stakeholders have used section 241 provisions in relicensing and their outcomes and (2) describe stakeholders' views on section 241's impact on relicensing and conditions and prescriptions. GAO analyzed relicensing documents filed with FERC and conducted a total of 61 interviews with representatives from relevant federal resource agencies, FERC, licensees, tribal groups, industry groups, and environmental groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the passage of the Energy Policy Act in 2005, nonfederal stakeholders--licensees, states, environmental groups, and an Indian tribe--used section 241 provisions for 25 of the 103 eligible hydropower projects being relicensed, most of which occurred within the first year. Of these 25 projects, stakeholders proposed a total of 211 alternative conditions and prescriptions. In response, the federal resource agencies (U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service, and several bureaus in the Department of the Interior) accepted no alternatives as originally proposed but instead modified a total of 140 and removed a total of 9 of the agencies' preliminary conditions and prescriptions and rejected 42 of the 211 alternatives; the remaining alternatives are pending as of May 17, 2010. Under section 241, resource agencies must submit a statement to FERC explaining the basis for accepting or rejecting a proposed alternative. While agencies generally provided explanations for rejecting alternative conditions and prescriptions, with few exceptions, they did not explain the reasons for not accepting alternatives when they modified conditions and prescriptions. As a result, it is difficult to determine the extent, type, or basis of changes that were made and difficult to determine if and how the proposed alternatives affected the final conditions and prescriptions issued by the agencies. As of May 17, 2010, nonfederal stakeholders requested trial-type hearings for 18 of the 25 projects in which section 241 provisions were used, and three trial-type hearings were completed. Of the remaining 15 projects, requests for hearings were withdrawn for 14 of them when licensees and agencies negotiated a settlement agreement before the administrative law judge made a ruling, and one is pending because the licensee is in negotiations to decommission the project. In the three hearings held to date, the administrative law judge ruled in favor of the agencies on most issues. According to the federal and nonfederal relicensing stakeholders GAO spoke with, the section 241 provisions have had a variety of effects on the relicensing process and on the license conditions and prescriptions. While most licensees and a few agency officials said that section 241 encourages settlement agreements between the licensee and resource agency, some agency officials said that section 241 made agreements more difficult because efforts to negotiate have moved to preparing for potential hearings. Regarding conditions and prescriptions, some stakeholders commented that under section 241, agencies put more effort into reviewing and providing support for their conditions and prescriptions, but environmental groups and some agency officials said that in their opinion, agencies issued fewer or less environmentally protective conditions and prescriptions. Many agency officials also raised concerns about increases in workload and costs as a result of section 241. For example, their estimated costs for the three hearings to date totaled approximately $3.1 million. Furthermore, many of the stakeholders offered suggestions for improving the use of section 241, including adjusting the time frame for a trial-type hearing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that cognizant officials who do not adopt a proposed alternative include reasons why in their statement to FERC.

Hydropower projects\u2014which include  dams, reservoirs, stream diversion structures, powerhouses containing  turbines driven by falling water, and transmission lines\u2014have several  advantages over other energy sources. Hydropower generation from  existing facilities produces little, if any, air pollution and greenhouse gas  emissions and can be adjusted quickly to match real-time changes in the  demand for electricity. In addition, hydropower projects can provide other  benefits, including flood control, irrigation, and recreation. However,  hydropower also has some disadvantages. For example, hydropower  projects may prevent fish from moving upstream or downstream,  disrupting the spawning cycle, and the projects\u2019 turbines can kill or injure  fish passing through them. Hydropower projects can also alter stream  flows in ways that impair wildlife habitats and water quality.", "Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), as amended, the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) issues licenses to construct and operate  nonfederal hydropower projects, such as those owned by public utilities or  private industry, including those located on federal lands. As of May 17,  2010, FERC has issued licenses for 1,016 hydropower projects. FERC can  issue licenses for up to 50 years, and when these licenses expire, projects  must be relicensed in order to continue operating.", "While resource agencies and licensees may begin the relicensing process  up to 10 years before its expiration, the current FERC relicensing  process\u2014the Integrated Licensing Process\u2014begins 5 to 5-1/2 years before  a license is due to expire according to FERC\u2019s timeline. After initial  meetings with FERC and other stakeholders, the licensee proposes a study  plan to review project operations and potential impacts of the hydropower  project, including environmental, recreational, and cultural impacts. FERC  reviews this plan and comments from other stakeholders, such as federal  resource agencies; makes revisions; and finalizes this plan. The licensee  conducts the studies identified in the plan and submits a license  application with proposed mitigations for impacts. After FERC receives  the application, federal resource agencies may submit preliminary  conditions, prescriptions, and recommendations. Section 4(e) of FPA  makes licenses for projects on federal lands reserved by Congress for  other purposes\u2014such as national forests\u2014or that use surplus water from  federal dams subject to mandatory conditions imposed by the head of the  federal agency responsible for managing the lands or facilities. These  conditions may be used to protect federal lands and their environmental,  recreational, and cultural resources; for this report, these are referred to  as conditions. Similarly, section 18 of FPA requires FERC to include  license prescriptions for fish passage issued by federal fish and wildlife  agencies; for this report, these are referred to as prescriptions. In  addition, the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 added section  10(j) to FPA. This section authorizes federal and state fish and wildlife  agencies to recommend license conditions to benefit fish and wildlife that  FERC must include in the license unless it (1) finds them to be  inconsistent with law and (2) has already established license conditions  that adequately protect fish and wildlife.", "For many years the hydropower industry had expressed concerns that  agency conditions and prescriptions added unnecessary costs to their  hydropower operations. Licensees contend that prior to the  implementation of section 241 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, if they  disagreed with the preliminary conditions and prescriptions their only  option was to ask the resource agencies to hold further discussions and to  review the license terms. The agencies could decide on further review or  issue final conditions and prescriptions. Section 241 of the Energy Policy  Act of 2005 authorizes parties to the licensing process to (1) request a  \u201ctrial-type hearing\u201d of not more than 90 days on any disputed issue of  material fact related to a condition or prescription and (2) propose  alternative conditions or prescriptions. Section 241 also requires the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Department of the Interior  (Interior), and U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)\u2014in  consultation with FERC\u2014to jointly establish by rule, procedures  governing the processes for trial-type hearings and alternative conditions  and prescriptions. The agencies issued three substantively identical  interim rules on November 17, 2005, addressing trial-type hearings and  procedures for the consideration of alternative conditions and  prescriptions submitted by any party to a license proceeding. These  interim rules allow licensees and other nonfederal stakeholders to request  a hearing or submit alternatives within 30 days after the deadline for the  agencies\u2019 filing of preliminary conditions and prescriptions with FERC.  When the interim rules were issued, some projects had already passed the  phase of the relicensing process where the section 241 provisions could be  used under the normal procedures defined by the interim rules, but were  allowed to use the provisions because they had not had new licenses  issued as of November 17, 2005. These projects are referred to as  \u201ctransition projects\u201d in this report. In 2005, the resource agencies stated  they would consider revising the interim rules based on the comments  received and the initial results of implementation, and issue revised final  rules within 18 months of the effective date of the interim rules. However,  the 2005 interim rules remain in effect because the agencies have not yet  issued final rules.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) determine the extent to which  licensees and other nonfederal stakeholders have used the section 241  provisions in relicensing projects and the outcomes associated with their  use and (2) describe federal and nonfederal stakeholders\u2019 views on section  241\u2019s impact on the relicensing process and on the conditions and  prescriptions in relicensing.", "To determine the extent to which licensees and other nonfederal  stakeholders have used section 241\u2019s provisions for trial-type hearings and  alternative conditions and prescriptions, we analyzed FERC summary  documents. To determine the outcomes of the use of section 241  provisions, we analyzed the relicensing documents filed with FERC for all  25 projects in which nonfederal stakeholders used section 241 between  November 17, 2005, and May 17, 2010. Our review included an analysis of  whether each alternative condition or prescription was accepted or  rejected and whether the preliminary condition or prescription associated  with this alternative was modified or removed. We have included criteria  for our categorization in tables 3 and 4 in this report. We also met with  FERC officials for further information about the use and results of the  section 241 provisions. To determine stakeholders\u2019 views on section 241\u2019s  impact on the relicensing process and the license conditions and  prescriptions, we conducted 32 interviews with officials from FERC;  Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of  Reclamation, National Park Service, Office of the Solicitor, Office of  Environmental Policy and Compliance, Office of Hearings and Appeals,  Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and U.S. Geological Survey; USDA\u2019s  Forest Service; Commerce\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS);  and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Bonneville Power Authority. We also  conducted 29 interviews with nonfederal stakeholders involved in the  relicensing process about their views of section 241. These stakeholders  included all of the licensees who used the section 241 provisions for the 25  relicensing projects, as well as a nonprobability sample of three other  licensees that have been engaged or recently engaged in the relicensing  process during the period of our review; environmental organizations  involved in hydropower issues; hydropower industry groups; and tribal  groups that have been affected by hydropower. We visited stakeholders  and hydropower projects in California, Oregon, North Carolina, and  Washington State. We selected these projects because their licensees were  either undergoing relicensing or had recently been relicensed and these  projects offered a variety of different characteristics including public and  private ownerships and eastern and western U.S. locations. While we  collected a variety of views on the effects of section 241, each hydropower  project is unique, and the effects of section 241 on one project may not  apply or may apply differently to another project. Thus, the results of our  interviews cannot be projected to the entire universe of all hydropower  projects in relicensing.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2009 to August 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The statement must demonstrate that  the Secretary of the department gave equal consideration to the effects of  the alternatives on energy supply, distribution, cost, and use; flood control;  navigation; water supply; and air quality (in addition to the preservation of  other aspects of environmental quality).

Some stakeholders also  suggested providing an opportunity to delay the start date of a trial-type  hearing if all parties were close to reaching a settlement.", "The stakeholders we spoke with also had several suggestions that were  specific to their interests, which included the following:    A couple of licensees noted that while the provisions of section 241 may  be used after preliminary conditions and prescriptions are issued, they  would like to be able to use these provisions after the issuance of final  conditions and prescriptions because of concerns that the final conditions  and prescriptions could differ from the agreed-upon terms that were  arrived at through negotiations. These licensees assert that if they do not  have this option, their only recourse is to sue in an appeals court, after the  license has been issued. These licensees were not aware of any instance in  which the terms had drastically changed between negotiations and the  issuance of the final license.", "Several environmental group representatives commented that while  section 241 allows stakeholders to propose alternative conditions and  prescriptions, they would like to be allowed to propose additional  conditions and prescriptions to address issues that the resource agencies  have not addressed in their preliminary conditions and prescriptions.  Three of these representatives also commented that the section 241  criteria for the acceptance of an alternative\u2014adequately or no less  protective and costs less to implement\u2014favored licensees, not  conservation groups. Instead, one representative suggested that the  criterion for an alternative should be that it is more appropriately  protective and not that it costs less to implement. In addition, another  representative suggested that all interested parties should be allowed to  participate in negotiations to modify the preliminary conditions and  prescriptions after the submission of an alternative. In his experience,  these negotiations have been limited to the stakeholder who uses the  provisions of section 241 and the resource agency.", "A few resource agency officials suggested that licensees who lose the trial- type hearing should pay court costs, such as the costs of the ALJ. They  also suggested that licensee reimbursements for the relicensing costs go  directly to the resource agencies rather than the General Fund of the U.S.  Treasury.", "Almost 5 years have passed since the interim rules were issued, and  several stakeholders that we spoke with expressed interest in having an  opportunity to comment on a draft of the revised rules when they become  available and before these rules become final. In addition, on June 2, 2009,  the National Hydropower Association\u2014an industry trade group\u2014and the  Hydropower Reform Coalition submitted a joint letter addressed to  Interior, NMFS, and USDA expressing interest in an opportunity to  comment on the revised rules before they become final."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 241 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changed the hydropower  relicensing process, including permitting licensees and other nonfederal  stakeholders to propose alternative conditions and prescriptions. All  parties involved in relicensing a hydropower project have an interest in  understanding how the conditions and prescriptions for a license were  modified, if at all, in response to proposed alternatives. Indeed, the interim  rules require agencies to provide, for any condition or prescription, a  written statement explaining the basis for the adopted condition and the  reasons for not accepting any alternative condition or prescription. While  we found that the agencies have provided a written explanation for all 42  rejected conditions and prescriptions, they provided a written explanation  of the reasons for not accepting a proposed alternative for only 13 of the  140 modified conditions and prescriptions. The absence of an explanation  makes it difficult to determine the extent or type of changes that were  made.", "Furthermore, when the interim rules that implemented section 241 were  issued on November 17, 2005, the federal resource agencies stated that  they would consider issuing final rules 18 months later. Instead, nearly 5  years later, final rules have not yet been issued. Given this delay and the  amount of experience with section 241\u2019s interim rules, many stakeholders  we spoke with had ideas on how to improve section 241 and several  expressed interest in providing comments when a draft of the final rules  becomes available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To encourage transparency in the process for relicensing hydropower  projects, we are recommending that the Secretaries of Agriculture,  Commerce, and the Interior take the following two actions:    Direct cognizant officials, where the agency has not adopted a proposed  alternative condition or prescription, to include in the written statement  filed with FERC (1) its reasons for not doing so, in accordance with the  interim rules and (2) whether a proposed alternative was withdrawn as a  result of negotiations and an explanation of what occurred subsequent to  the withdrawal; and  Issue final rules governing the use of the section 241 provisions after  providing an additional period for notice and an opportunity for public  comment and after considering their own lessons learned from their  experience with the interim rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments, Third-Party Views, and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and the Interior;  FERC; the Hydropower Reform Coalition; and the National Hydropower  Association with a draft of this report for their review and comment.  FERC had no comments on the report. Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Interior, USDA\u2019s Forest Service, the  Hydropower Reform Coalition, and the National Hydropower Association  provided comments on the report and generally agreed with the report\u2019s  recommendations.", "While Forest Service, Interior, and NOAA generally agreed with our  recommendation that they file a written statement with FERC on their  reasons for not accepting a proposed alternative, they all cited a  circumstance in which they believed that they were not required to do so.  Specifically, the three agencies commented that under the interim rules,  they do believe that they are required to explain their reasons for not  accepting a proposed alternative when the alternatives were withdrawn as  a result of negotiations. Two of the agencies, Interior and NOAA, agreed to  indicate when a proposed alternative was voluntarily withdrawn, and  NOAA acknowledged that providing an explanation on what occurred  after the withdrawal of an alternative may be appropriate in some  circumstances. We continue to believe that providing an explanation for  not accepting a proposed alternative is warranted, even when the  proposed alternative is voluntarily withdrawn as a result of negotiations,  and we have modified our recommendation to address this situation. The  agencies could add transparency to the settlement process by laying out  the basis for the modifications made to the preliminary conditions and  prescriptions; the reasons the agencies had for not accepting the proposed  alternative, including those alternatives withdrawn as a result of  negotiations; and an explanation of what occurred subsequent to the  withdrawal. Further, no provision of the interim rules discusses  withdrawal of proposed alternatives or provides an exemption from the  requirement to explain why a proposed alternative was not accepted.  The agencies have an opportunity to clarify their approach to withdrawn  conditions and prescriptions as they consider revisions to the interim  rules.", "Interior and NOAA commented that they agreed with our recommendation  regarding the issuance of final rules and are considering providing an  additional public comment opportunity. According to Interior and NOAA,  the resource agencies are currently working on possible revisions to the  interim rules.", "NOAA also commented that resource agencies use the term \u201cmodified  prescription\u201d as a \u201cterm of art\u201d to refer to the agencies\u2019 final prescription,  regardless of whether the final prescription actually differs from the  preliminary one. As we noted in table 4 of this report, we counted a  preliminary prescription as modified if the resource agency does not  explicitly accept or reject the proposed alternative. In response to this  comment, we added an additional clarifying footnote in the report.", "Interior suggested that we clarify in our report that agencies have no  reason to write less protective recommendations because  recommendations cannot be the basis for trial-type hearing requests. We  did not change the language in our report because we believe that  Interior\u2019s assertion that agencies have no reason to write less protective  recommendations may not always be the case. For example, as stated in  our report, NMFS officials told us that a licensee had threatened to issue a  trial-type hearing request on fish passage prescriptions if NMFS made flow  rate recommendations that it did not agree with.", "The Hydropower Reform Coalition suggested that we collect additional  information and conduct further analysis on the use of the section 241  provisions.
