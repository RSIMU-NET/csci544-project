OGAC, USAID, and CDC publicly issued plans and reports on PEPFAR performance in recent years consistent with 2008 Leadership Act requirements and GPRA practices; however, two key elements are lacking. First, although OGAC has internally specified annual performance targets, its most recent annual reports to Congress did not identify these targets or compare annual results with them. According to the 2008 Leadership Act, OGAC's annual reports on PEPFAR program results must include an assessment of progress toward annual goals and reasons for any failure to meet these goals. In addition, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 calls for federal agency performance reports to compare program results with established targets. Performance documents published by USAID, jointly with State, and by CDC report program targets and results for two and four PEPFAR indicators, respectively. Second, OGAC's most recently published performance plans and reports do not provide information on efforts to validate and verify reported data, while USAID's and CDC's published performance documents cite such efforts by OGAC. In addition, none of the plans or reports refers to noted data reliability weaknesses or efforts to address these weaknesses.

GPRA calls for the use of several performance  management practices intended to improve federal program  effectiveness, accountability, and service delivery and to enhance  congressional decision making by requiring federal agencies to provide  more objective information on program performance. In addition, our  prior work suggests the use of a practice to bolster program performance  reporting. These practices include the following, among others:  \uf0b7  Performance planning. GPRA calls for preparation of public annual  performance plans that articulate goals for the upcoming fiscal year.  These plans should link annual program goals to program activities,  include indicators that will be used to measure performance, provide  information on the operational processes and resources required to  meet the performance goals, and identify the procedures that will be  used to verify and validate performance information. \uf0b7  Performance reporting. GPRA calls for annual performance reports  reviewing the success of achieving the performance goals of the fiscal  year. The reports are to describe and review results compared with  performance goals, provide explanations for any unmet goals and  actions needed to address them, and include summaries of completed  program evaluations. In addition, our prior work found that explaining  any limitations of performance information can provide context for  understanding and assessing program performance and the costs and  challenges faced in gathering, processing, and analyzing data. This  practice can help identify the actions needed to address any  inadequacies in the completeness and reliability of performance data  and thereby improve program performance reporting.", "In August 2009, OGAC issued its Next Generation Indicators Reference  Guide, providing an updated list of indicators for establishing targets and  reporting on results of PEPFAR prevention, care, treatment, and health  systems strengthening programs.

We also interviewed  cognizant USAID OIG officials in Washington, D.C., and two regional  offices in Africa (Pretoria, South Africa, and Dakar, Senegal) to gain  additional information on past and current USAID OIG audit work on  PEPFAR. We identified the countries and programs covered by each  report and found that the 24 reports covered prevention, treatment, and  care programs in 19 PEPFAR countries: Botswana, Cambodia, C\u00f4te  d\u2019Ivoire (two reports), Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana,  Haiti, Kenya (two reports), Mozambique (two reports), Namibia, Nigeria,  Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia (two reports),  and Zimbabwe. In addition, one USAID OIG report reviewed USAID\u2019s  implementation of PEPFAR\u2019s New Partners Initiative. We identified the  recommendations in these reports and entered this information into a  spreadsheet database. To identify and describe types of performance  management-related themes, we utilized the Joint United Nations  Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 12 components of a national HIV  monitoring and evaluation system as categories. (See app. II for a list of  these categories and their definitions.) Two analysts independently  assigned each recommendation to not more than two of these categories.  The two analysts then met to discuss the results of their analysis; in  cases where the analysts\u2019 categorizations differed, the analysts discussed  and came to agreement on final categories. We determined that 74  recommendations addressed one category, and 56 addressed two of the  categories\u2014totaling 130 recommendations. We also determined that 43  recommendations\u2014related, for example, to disposal of expired  medications and to requirements for USAID branding and marking\u2014did  not fall into any of the categories. Furthermore, three of the 12  categories\u2014national multisectoral monitoring and evaluation plan; annual  costed national monitoring and evaluation workplan; and advocacy,  communication, and culture for monitoring and evaluation\u2014were not used  to categorize any of the recommendations. To determine the extent to  which USAID has taken steps to implement the recommendations, we  interviewed cognizant USAID OIG officials in Washington, D.C., to gain  understanding of recommendation tracking, and we analyzed data  provided by USAID specifying dates for final action, target dates for final  action, and target dates for management decisions.", "To examine published PEPFAR performance plans and reports and the  extent to which they adhere to established practices, we identified  OGAC\u2019s, USAID\u2019s, and CDC\u2019s most recent publicly available annual  performance plans and reports: for OGAC, the PEPFAR annual  operational plans and annual reports to Congress for fiscal years 2009  and 2010; for USAID, the \u201cForeign Operations FY 2010 Performance  Report, FY 2012 Performance Plan\u201d that it issued with the Department of  State as part of their joint congressional budget justification for fiscal year  2012; and for CDC, the \u201cFiscal Year 2012 Justification of Estimates for  Appropriation Committees\u201d and \u201cFY 2012 Online Performance  Appendix.\u201d We systematically reviewed these documents using a matrix  with a series of questions about key performance management practices,  as defined by the 2008 Leadership Act, the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993, and previous GAO work. We also interviewed  OGAC, USAID, and CDC officials in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta,  Georgia, regarding the information contained in these documents and the  procedures they followed to produce them.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 to July 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
