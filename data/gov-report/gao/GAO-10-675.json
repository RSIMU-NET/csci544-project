Coal power plants also account for about one-third of the nation's emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), the primary greenhouse gas that experts believe contributes to climate change. Current regulatory efforts and proposed legislation that seek to reduce CO2 emissions could affect coal power plants. Two key technologies show potential for reducing CO2 emissions: (1) carbon capture and storage (CCS), which involves capturing and storing CO2 in geologic formations, and (2) plant efficiency improvements that allow plants to use less coal. The Department of Energy (DOE) plays a key role in accelerating the commercial availability of these technologies and devoted more than $600 million to them in fiscal year 2009. Congress asked GAO to examine (1) the maturity of these technologies; (2) their potential for commercial use, and any challenges to their use; and (3) possible implications of deploying these technologies. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed reports and interviewed stakeholders with expertise in coal technologies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOE does not systematically assess the maturity of key coal technologies, but GAO found consensus among stakeholders that CCS is less mature than efficiency technologies. Specifically, DOE does not use a standard set of benchmarks or terms to describe the maturity of technologies, limiting its ability to provide key information to Congress, utilities, and other stakeholders. This lack of information limits congressional oversight of DOE's expenditures on these efforts, and it hampers policymakers' efforts to gauge the maturity of these technologies as they consider climate change policies. In the absence of this information from DOE, GAO interviewed stakeholders with expertise in CCS or efficiency technologies to identify their views on the maturity of these technologies. Stakeholders told GAO that while components of CCS have been used commercially in other industries, their application remains at a small scale in coal power plants, with only one fully integrated CCS project operating at a coal plant. Efficiency technologies, on the other hand, are in wider commercial use. Commercial deployment of CCS is possible within 10 to 15 years while many efficiency technologies have been used and are available for use now. Use of both technologies is, however, contingent on overcoming a variety of economic, technical, and legal challenges. In particular, with respect to CCS, stakeholders highlighted the large costs to install and operate current CCS technologies, the fact that large scale demonstration of CCS is needed in coal plants, and the lack of a national carbon policy to reduce CO2 emissions or a legal framework to govern liability for the permanent storage of large amounts of CO2. With respect to efficiency improvements, stakeholders highlighted the high cost to build or upgrade such coal plants, the fact that some upgrades require highly technical materials, and plant operators' concerns that changes to the existing fleet of coal power plants could trigger additional regulatory requirements. CCS technologies offer more potential to reduce CO2 emissions than efficiency improvements alone, and both could raise electricity costs and have other effects. According to reports and stakeholders, the successful deployment of CCS technologies is critical to meeting the ambitious emissions reductions that are currently being considered in the United States while retaining coal as a fuel source. Most stakeholders told GAO that CCS would increase electricity costs, and some reports estimate that current CCS technologies would increase electricity costs by about 30 to 80 percent at plants using these technologies. DOE has also reported that CCS could increase water consumption at power plants. Efficiency improvements offer more potential for near term reductions in CO2 emissions, but they cannot reduce CO2 emissions from a coal plant to the same extent as CCS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE develop a standard set of benchmarks to gauge and report to Congress on the maturity of key technologies. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE concurred with our recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Coal power plants generate about half of the United States\u2019 electricity and  are expected to continue supplying a large portion of the nation\u2019s  electricity in the future. According to the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE)  Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal will provide 44 percent of  the electricity in 2035 in the United States. The critical role that coal plays  in supplying electricity is due in part to the large coal reserves in the  United States, which some estimate will last about 240 years at current  consumption levels, and the relatively low cost of this energy supply.  However, coal power plants also currently account for about one-third of  the nation\u2019s emissions of carbon dioxide (CO), the most prevalent  greenhouse gas. Concerns over rising greenhouse gas emissions and their  potential effects on the climate have led some countries to adopt or  consider adopting policies to reduce these emissions. In the United States  and elsewhere, these concerns have also increased focus on developing  and using technologies to limit CO emissions from  coal plants: carbon capture and storage (CCS) and efficiency technologies.  CCS technologies separate and capture CO\u2014post-combustion, pre-combustion,  and oxy-combustion. Post-combustion capture involves capturing COPre-combustion capture involves capturing CO produced when gasifying  coal at Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants, which are  in limited use in the electricity industry. Oxy-combustion capture involves  capturing CO Efficiency upgrades can also be made in existing coal plants, such  as overhauling or replacing turbine fan blades. Improving the efficiency of  coal plants allows them to use less coal per unit of electricity produced  and achieve a corresponding reduction in CO emissions could affect coal power plants. The  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken steps to regulate  greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and plans to begin  regulating emissions from certain stationary sources, including coal power  plants, beginning in 2011. As part of this effort, EPA is compiling technical  and background information on potential control technologies and  measures, such as CCS, and developing policy guidance to assist  permitting agencies in determining the best available control technology  for greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the American Clean Energy and  Security Act passed the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009, and  would require an 83 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from  2005 levels by 2050. Among other things, this proposed legislation would  create a cap and trade program, a market-based mechanism to establish a  price for emissions of greenhouse gases, and require additional specific  actions to reduce these emissions. For example, section 116 of the bill  would require new coal power plants permitted before 2020 to reduce  their CO emissions by half, 4 years after certain CCS deployment criteria  are met or by 2025, whichever comes first.", "DOE plays a key role in accelerating the commercial availability of  technologies to reduce CO from coal plants along with other policymakers that are  considering climate change policies. In the near term, according to DOE\u2019s  fiscal year 2011 budget submission, DOE hopes to facilitate the  development of CCS and efficiency technologies, with longer term goals of  improving these technologies so that coal can remain part of the nation\u2019s  fuel mix in generating electricity. In fiscal year 2009, DOE\u2019s coal RD&D  funding was at least $681 million, and $3.4 billion was appropriated in the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) for fossil  energy RD&D.", "In this context, you asked us to review key technologies to reduce CO emissions from coal power plants;  (2) the potential for these technologies to be used commercially in the  future, and challenges, if any, to their use; and (3) the possible  implications of deploying these technologies.

We conducted interviews with stakeholders such as  power plant operators, technology vendors, and federal officials from EPA  and DOE along with officials from the North American Electric Reliability  Corporation (NERC). We then selected a group of 19 stakeholders with  expertise in CCS or efficiency technologies to answer a standard set of  questions. This group included those from major utilities that are planning  or implementing projects using key coal technologies, technology vendors  that are developing these technologies, federal officials providing RD&D  funding for these technologies, and researchers from academia and  industry that are researching these technologies. We asked these  stakeholders to describe the maturity of these technologies using a nine  point scale we developed in conjunction with the Electric Power Research  Institute (EPRI) based on the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration\u2019s (NASA) Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). TRLs are a  tool that is used by NASA and other agencies to rate the extent to which  technologies have been demonstrated to work as intended.

Finally, we visited coal  power plants and research facilities in three states\u2013\u2013Alabama, Maryland,  and West Virginia\u2013\u2013that we selected because they contained projects  involving advanced coal technologies. Importantly, our discussion focuses  on the technological maturity of these technologies. TRLs describe the  level of demonstration achieved for particular technologies, but they do  not provide information on other factors that play a critical role in  decisions to deploy them, such as their cost, availability of financing, and  applicable regulations. Technological improvements could help these  technologies overcome some challenges or potential negative  implications. For example, novel approaches to CO capture could help to  lower the cost of using these technologies.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 through May 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
