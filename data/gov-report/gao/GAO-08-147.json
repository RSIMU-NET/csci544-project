The decision to label a device as single-use or reusable rests with the manufacturer. To market a reusable device, a manufacturer must provide data demonstrating to FDA's satisfaction that the device can be cleaned and sterilized without impairing its function. Alternatively, a single-use device (SUD) may be marketed without such data after demonstrating to FDA that the device is safe and effective if used once. Even though labeled for single-use, some SUDs are reprocessed for reuse with FDA clearance. This report addresses (1) the SUD reprocessing industry--the number of reprocessing establishments, the types of devices reprocessed, and the extent to which hospitals use reprocessed SUDs, (2) the steps FDA has taken to strengthen oversight of reprocessed SUDs, both on its own and in response to legislative requirements, and (3) the safety of reprocessed SUDs compared with other types of medical devices. GAO reviewed FDA data on reprocessors, reprocessed SUDs, and device-related adverse events, as well as FDA documents and inspection reports, studies published in peer-reviewed journals, and relevant statutes and regulations. GAO interviewed FDA officials and officials from associations of manufacturers, reprocessors, and providers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FDA has information on domestic reprocessing establishments, but it does not have data on the extent of actual production or on where the devices are being used. FDA officials identified 11 establishments that reported planning to market or actively marketing more than 100 types of reprocessed SUDs in the United States as of July 2007. Reprocessed SUDs ranged from devices used external to the body, such as blood pressure cuffs, to surgical devices used to repair joints. While many hospitals were believed to be reprocessing their own SUDs in 2000, FDA identified only one hospital in 2007 that was reprocessing SUDs. Reprocessed SUDs are being used in a variety of hospitals throughout the nation, including military hospitals. However, the Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates one of the nation's largest health care systems, prohibits their use entirely. Since 2000, FDA has taken a number of steps--on its own and in response to legislation--to enhance its regulation of reprocessed SUDs both before they go to market (called premarket review) and afterwards (called postmarket oversight). In 2000, FDA published guidance that clarified its policies on the regulation of reprocessed SUDs. This guidance was directed at third-party entities and hospitals engaged in reprocessing SUDs for reuse. Following legislation passed in 2002, FDA imposed additional requirements for about 70 types of reprocessed devices and implemented new labeling requirements so that users would recognize those devices that had been reprocessed. In terms of postmarket review, FDA now inspects reprocessors and monitors reports of adverse events involving reprocessed SUDs. Seven of the 10 reprocessing establishments that FDA inspected in the last 3 years had problems requiring corrective actions. Regarding adverse event reporting, FDA modified its reporting forms in 2003 to enable FDA to better identify and analyze those adverse events involving reprocessed SUDs. Neither existing FDA data nor studies performed by others are sufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the safety of reprocessed SUDs compared to similar original devices. While FDA has made changes to its data collection process regarding reprocessed SUD-related adverse events, the data are not suitable for a rigorous comparison of the safety of reprocessed SUDs compared to similar original SUDs. The other studies published since 2000 that GAO identified are likewise insufficient to support a comprehensive conclusion on the relative safety of reprocessed SUDs. FDA officials have concluded that the cost of conducting rigorous testing would not be an efficient use of resources, especially given that the available data, while limited, do not indicate that reprocessed SUDs present an elevated health risk. FDA has analyzed its data on reported adverse events related to reprocessed SUDs and has concluded that there are no patterns that point to these devices creating such risks. After reviewing FDA's processes for monitoring and investigating its adverse event data, we found no reason to question FDA's analysis. HHS provided language to clarify several sentences of a draft of this report which GAO generally incorporated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), takes the  lead in ensuring that the thousands of types of medical devices sold for  use in surgeries and other medical procedures are reasonably safe and  effective and do not pose a threat to public health. These devices range  from bandages and surgical clamps to complicated devices such as heart  pacemakers. Unless exempt, all devices are subject to FDA review\u2014 referred to as premarket review\u2014before they may be legally marketed in  the United States.", "Using many types of devices, such as tongue depressors, a second time is  not feasible, while others, such as stethoscopes, are specifically designed  and sold to be used more than once. The decision to label a device as  single-use or reusable rests with the manufacturer. If a manufacturer  intends to label a device as reusable, it must provide data demonstrating to  FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the device can be cleaned and sterilized without  impairing its function. Thus, a device may be labeled as single-use because  the manufacturer believes that it cannot be safely and reliably used more  than once, or because the manufacturer chooses not to conduct the  studies needed to demonstrate that the device can be labeled as reusable.", "Some devices fall into another category\u2014they are labeled and marketed  by the original manufacturer as single-use devices (SUD), but with  clearance from FDA are marketed after being reprocessed for reuse\u2013\u2013that  is, they are cleaned, sterilized, and performance-tested by one of  numerous entities that are in business to reprocess them for reuse. These  reprocessed SUDs can range from relatively simple items for external use,  such as inflatable sleeves to improve blood circulation, to complex items  placed inside the body, such as catheters inserted into the heart to monitor  cardiac function.", "For more than two decades, establishments such as hospitals and private  companies have reprocessed various types of SUDs, citing lower  purchasing and in-house sterilization costs and reduced medical waste.  This development followed an increase in the number of devices labeled  as single-use. Because these devices were intended to be discarded after  one use, manufacturers did not develop appropriate cleaning, sterilization,  and testing methods or provide instructions to health care providers about  how to clean and sterilize them while still maintaining performance.", "Concerns have been raised by the committee and others about the  potential risks of infection from reprocessed SUDs or their failure to  function properly. The original manufacturers of the SUDs, in particular,  have objected to SUD reprocessing, saying that the reprocessed SUDs are  inherently unsafe because these devices are not designed to facilitate  cleaning and sterilization. Reprocessing firms, on the other hand, contend  that reprocessed SUDs are indeed safe, citing a lack of data that show  otherwise. In a June 2000 report on SUD reprocessing, we found that  although there was little available evidence of harm from the use of  reprocessed SUDs, FDA oversight of SUD reprocessing was inconsistent.  Since that time, Congress has acted to strengthen oversight requirements.  The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA)  required that the labeling of all reprocessed SUDs specifically state that  they are reprocessed SUDs as well as identify the reprocessor. The act  also directed FDA to increase its oversight of these devices by identifying  reprocessed SUDs that should not be marketed unless the reprocessing  establishment first provided data demonstrating effective cleaning,  sterilization, and functional performance.", "In light of action taken since our last report, you asked us to review how  the reprocessing industry and FDA\u2019s oversight of reprocessed SUDs had  changed since June 2000. Specifically, our report addresses the following  three questions:    What is known about the reprocessing industry\u2014the number of  reprocessing establishments, the types of devices they are reprocessing,  and the extent to which hospitals are using reprocessed SUDs?", "What steps has FDA taken to strengthen oversight of reprocessed SUDs on  its own initiative and to implement requirements set forth in MDUFMA?", "What is known about the extent to which the safety of reprocessed SUDs  compares favorably or unfavorably with the safety of similar original  SUDs?", "To address these questions, we examined and evaluated available  information on the SUD reprocessing industry in the United States and  FDA\u2019s oversight of this industry. In conducting our work, we (1) reviewed  available data on the types and characteristics of, FDA guidance and  standards pertaining to, and FDA inspection reports on, SUD reprocessing  establishments; (2) reviewed FDA-generated data and analyses on  reported adverse events involving reprocessed SUDs; (3) interviewed FDA  officials, representatives of the device reprocessing and manufacturing  industry, including professional associations representing device  manufacturing establishments and the Association of Medical Device  Reprocessors (AMDR), which represents two firms that operate three  large reprocessing establishments in the United States, and officials  representing provider associations and medical facilities of the  Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense; (4) reviewed relevant  statutes, regulations, and Federal Register notices; and (5) conducted a  literature search of peer-reviewed periodicals and reviewed other  information to determine what is known about the safety of reprocessed  SUDs.", "In some cases, FDA data were not available or sufficiently reliable to allow  us to develop detailed information or perform analyses. For example, we  determined that FDA\u2019s data were not sufficiently reliable to determine the  number of domestic establishments reprocessing SUDs prior to July 2007  or the number of foreign establishments reprocessing SUDs. As a result,  we were unable to analyze trends in the number of reprocessing  establishments or the types of devices they were reprocessing since 2000  and we were limited to reporting on domestic reprocessing  establishments. Also, neither industry nor FDA representatives were able  to provide comprehensive information on the size of the reprocessed  SUDs market in the United States\u2014in terms of volume and value\u2014 compared to the overall U.S. market for medical devices.

Manufacturers intending to sell medical devices in the United States,  including reprocessed SUDs, must register with FDA and provide  information listing the devices they intend to market. FDA considers  establishments engaged in reprocessing (that is, any activity needed to  render a used SUD ready for use on a subsequent patient) to be the  manufacturers of those reprocessed SUDs. Establishments, including  reprocessing establishments, are required to update their registrations  annually and their device listings twice each year.", "FDA\u2019s premarket review activities for devices\u2014that is, for reusable  devices, for originally manufactured SUDs, and for reprocessed SUDs\u2014 mainly involve analyzing information submitted by those establishments  that plan to market devices, including clinical or engineering documents  and proposed labeling and instructions for use. Devices encompass a wide  range of complexity and potential risk, and higher-risk or innovative  devices require a more rigorous level of premarket review than lower-risk  devices. For example, many relatively simple, low-risk devices, such as  scissors used for medical purposes, are exempt from premarket review  requirements. For other devices, such as catheters, manufacturers are  required to submit documentation for FDA\u2019s review and receive clearance  before they may be marketed.", "For all devices, FDA has assigned about 1,700 device types into one of  three classes based on the level of risk posed and controls necessary to  ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I (low-risk) devices include  such things as elastic bandages. Class II (medium-risk) devices include  items like powered bone drills. Class III (high-risk) devices include those  that support or sustain human life such as balloon angioplasty catheters.  Most class I devices are exempt from premarket submission requirements  set forth in Section 510(k) of the FDCA (premarket notification). For  most class II devices, manufacturers are required to submit a premarket  notification report. The premarket notification report must provide  evidence that the device is substantially equivalent to a device already on  the market before FDA will allow it to be marketed. For class III devices,  manufacturers are required to submit an application for premarket  approval, which must provide evidence, including clinical data,  demonstrating that the device is safe and effective.", "FDA\u2019s postmarket surveillance activities mainly involve inspecting device  establishments and collecting and analyzing reports about device safety.  FDA inspects registered device establishments, including reprocessing  establishments, to assess compliance with applicable quality control and  adverse event reporting regulations, among others. In addition to  inspecting device establishments, FDA\u2019s postmarket activities include  collecting and analyzing reports of device-related adverse events to ensure  that devices already on the market remain safe and effective.  Manufacturers are required to report device-related deaths, serious  injuries, and certain malfunctions to FDA. In addition, user facilities, such  as hospitals and nursing homes, are required to report device-related  deaths to FDA and to the device manufacturer, and to report serious  injuries to the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to FDA.  Both manufacturers and user facilities may also voluntarily report to FDA  less-serious device-related events that are not likely to result in subsequent  serious injuries if the malfunction were to recur. FDA maintains  databases that include both mandatory and voluntary reports of device- related adverse events, which agency officials can search to conduct  research on trends or emerging problems with device safety. FDA  scientists review these reports, request follow-up investigations, and  determine whether further action is needed to ensure patient safety. Such  action may include product recalls, public health advisories to notify  health care providers and the public of potential device-related health and  safety concerns, or requiring a manufacturer to change the instructions in  its device labeling.

To develop this estimate, FDA surveyed more than 5,000 hospitals.  Nearly half of responding hospitals with more than 250 beds reported  using reprocessed SUDs, compared with 12 percent of responding  hospitals with fewer than 50 beds. This information was supplemented by  a more recent study in 2005. In this study, which focused on hospitals\u2019  level of satisfaction with reprocessed SUDs, FDA received information  from 102 representatives of hospitals across the nation. About 40 percent  indicated they used a third party to reprocess SUDs. FDA followed up with  focus groups to obtain more detailed information on the differing  perspectives of various types of hospital personnel about the hospitals\u2019 use  of reprocessed SUDs. In general, participating hospitals that reported  using reprocessed SUDs indicated their facilities had specific policies  regarding reprocessing, used a variety of types of reprocessed SUDs, and  believed that reprocessing provides substantial cost savings.", "In our discussions with representatives of reprocessing establishments  and a managed care organization that runs several hospitals, we were told  that hospitals or hospital systems generally set their own policies  regarding whether to use reprocessed SUDs, which reprocessing  establishment to use, and which reprocessed SUDs are acceptable to the  hospitals\u2019 physicians and other clinical personnel. This holds true for some  federal hospitals as well. The Department of Defense, for example, allows  individual medical facilities the option of using SUDs that are reprocessed  by establishments that are registered with FDA as reprocessors.

According to Department of Veterans Affairs officials, the agency could  not determine whether reprocessed SUDs are safe or not. However, the  agency does not allow the use of reprocessed SUDs because  manufacturers did not design SUDs to be used more than once and, as a  consequence, do not provide instructions on cleaning and sterilizing these  devices.

This guidance was directed at hospitals and third-party  entities engaged in reprocessing SUDs for reuse. At the time, a sizeable  minority of U.S. hospitals were thought to be reprocessing their own SUDs  without FDA oversight. FDA recognized that hospitals were not likely to  be familiar with its regulations, so the guidance included time frames for  these reprocessing establishments to comply. According to FDA officials,  the agency intended to subject each type of reprocessed SUD to the same  level of premarket review as required of original SUDs. For example, if the  SUD was exempt from premarket requirements before it was used for the  first time, the reprocessed SUD would also be exempt.", "MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, directed FDA to review the premarket  submission requirements for reprocessed SUDs and identify those devices  for which FDA would require additional validation data to document  cleanliness, sterility, and performance following reprocessing. This meant  that reprocessing establishments had to submit additional premarket  documentation for certain types of reprocessed SUDs to demonstrate that  they remain safe and effective or substantially equivalent to another device  already on the market. MDUFMA directed FDA to identify devices that fell  into the following two categories and to determine whether additional  information was needed to determine their continued marketability:    The first category consisted of reprocessed SUDs that had been exempt  from premarket notification at the time MDUFMA was enacted. For these  reprocessed SUDs, FDA was required to determine whether the devices\u2019  premarket notification exemptions should be terminated to provide  reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers of  devices identified by FDA were required to provide premarket notification  with validation data on cleaning, sterilization, and functional performance  to ensure that the reprocessed SUDs remained safe and effective after the  maximum number of reprocessing cycles. FDA, in response, identified 20  types of reprocessed SUDs that met these criteria and revoked their  premarket notification exemptions. Examples of types of reprocessed  SUDs that had their exemptions terminated and that were required to  submit the additional validation data included noncompression heart  positioners (devices intended to move, lift, and stabilize the heart during  open heart surgery), nonelectric biopsy forceps (devices used to remove a  specimen of tissue for microscopic examination), and various surgical  devices such as specialized needles and catheters.", "The second category consisted of reprocessed SUDs that were already  subject to premarket notification at the time MDUFMA was enacted. FDA  was required to determine whether additional documentation on cleaning,  sterilization, and performance was necessary to ensure that the device  remained safe and effective after the maximum number of reprocessing  cycles. FDA, in response, identified 52 types of reprocessed SUDs that met  those criteria and required that premarket submissions for them include  such data. Examples of device types that were subject to the additional  validation data requirement included electric biopsy forceps, surgical drills  and accessories, and oximeters (devices used to measure the level of  oxygen in a patient\u2019s blood).", "Appendix III summarizes FDA\u2019s methodology for identifying the 72 types  of reprocessed SUDs for which the agency has required additional  premarket data submissions in accordance with MDUFMA.", "As part of its premarket review, FDA evaluates not only the devices  themselves but the accompanying labeling and instructions for use.

For 3 establishments, none of the inspections  indicated that corrective actions were needed. That is, no objectionable  conditions or practices were found during the inspection. For the  remaining 7 reprocessing establishments, at least one FDA inspection for  those establishments during this period found that corrective actions were  needed. This means that the inspection identified objectionable conditions  or practices through which the establishment failed to meet either  regulatory or administrative requirements. In general, in cases like these,  depending upon the severity of the objectionable conditions identified,  FDA determined whether the establishments could take corrective actions  voluntarily, or whether conditions warranted issuance of FDA warning  letters or more severe enforcement actions such as product seizures or  injunctions. In the cases we reviewed that involved corrective actions, we  found the following:    For 6 establishments, FDA investigators determined that actions taken by  the establishments were adequate to address the deficiencies identified  during the establishment inspections. FDA considers these inspections to  be resolved. For example, one inspection revealed that the establishment  had reprocessed two models of SUDs before it received FDA approval to  reprocess them. The firm stopped reprocessing these models of SUDs  prior to FDA\u2019s inspection and FDA inspectors determined that the  establishment had voluntarily taken the corrective actions that were  required. In another instance, FDA investigators found that the  establishment had not maintained complaint files appropriately.  Specifically, the establishment received a complaint from one hospital that  five blood pressure cuffs reprocessed by that establishment did not  function properly. However, the establishment listed all five devices as a  single complaint rather than documenting each nonfunctioning device  separately as required. At the end of the inspection, the establishment  agreed to make each device a separate complaint rather than group  several devices under one complaint number.", "The inspection for 1 establishment was open and under investigation as of  November 2007.

In September 2007, FDA conducted a meeting  with officials representing the establishment to discuss the inspection  findings in detail. The establishment subsequently provided a written  response to FDA containing the actions it proposed to take in order to  correct the deficiencies identified by FDA investigators.

In  September 2006, the Director of FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and  Radiological Health testified that based on available adverse event data,  FDA had identified 434 reports submitted from October 2003 to July 2006  in which reprocessed SUDs were identified on the reporting form. With  respect to these reports, FDA determined that the majority of the reports,  including all 15 of the reports involving deaths, did not involve a  reprocessed SUD. For example, FDA determined that many of the  reported events involved reusable devices such as magnetic resonance  imaging machines or SUDs on their initial use. Of the 434 reports, FDA  further reviewed the 65 events that it found actually involved or were  suspected to involve a reprocessed SUD and that the reprocessed SUD  was one of several possible causal factors in the adverse event. In  reviewing these 65 reports, FDA found that the types of adverse events  reported to be associated with the use of reprocessed SUDs were the same  types of events that are reported for new, nonreprocessed devices.", "In 2005, FDA consulted hospitals participating in the agency\u2019s Medical  Product Safety Network (MedSun) about their experiences, including  adverse events or safety concerns, with reprocessing. None of the  representatives of MedSun hospitals who participated in the FDA focus  groups reported being aware of any infections related to the use of  reprocessed SUDs. However, hospital representatives noted that if an  infection occurred, it would be very difficult to discern if a reprocessed  SUD was the cause. Similarly, none of the hospital representatives  expressed significant concerns about potential malfunctions with  reprocessed SUDs, even though some of them indicated that malfunctions  of reprocessed SUDs occurred on occasion (for example, surgical blades  and other tools sometimes may not have been sharpened properly).  Overall, however, participating hospital representatives generally  expressed confidence in reprocessed SUDs, with some participants stating  that there were actually fewer performance problems with reprocessed  SUDs than with new SUDs. According to FDA, all participants believed  that reprocessing establishments are more stringently regulated by FDA  than are the manufacturers of the original devices, and this provided them  a sense of confidence in the reprocessing process.", "After reviewing the available evidence\u2014including FDA\u2019s process for  identifying and investigating device-related adverse events reported to  involve reprocessed SUDs, peer-reviewed studies published since 2000,  and the results of our and FDA\u2019s consultations with hospital  representatives\u2014we found no reason to question FDA\u2019s analysis indicating  that no causative link has been established between reported injuries or  deaths and reprocessed SUDs.

We conducted our work between November  2006 and January 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "We consulted a variety of sources, including FDA officials who track  industry trends, professional associations representing device  manufacturers and reprocessing establishments, and hospitals. We found  that neither industry nor FDA representatives were able to provide  comprehensive information on the number and volume of devices  manufactured for the United States, or on the subset of devices that are  SUDs or reprocessed SUDs.", "To determine the number of reprocessing establishments, we reviewed  FDA data on the number of registered reprocessing establishments. FDA  data indicated that more than 40 establishments were registered as  reprocessing establishments as of March 2007, including 13 located  outside the United States. After we determined that the FDA list did not  match information provided by two FDA district offices, FDA officials  determined that many of the establishments had registered as  reprocessing establishments in error and subsequently identified 11  establishments in the United States that, as of July 2007, were engaged in  reprocessing SUDs. We determined FDA\u2019s information on the number of  establishments reprocessing SUDs in the United States as of July 2007 was  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. However, given the errors in the  FDA list of registered reprocessing establishments in 2007 and the lack of  information on foreign establishments registered as reprocessors, we  determined that FDA\u2019s data were not sufficiently reliable to determine the  number of establishments reprocessing SUDs prior to July 2007 or the  number of foreign reprocessing establishments at any time. As a result,  we were unable to analyze trends in the number of reprocessing  establishments or the types of devices being reprocessed since 2000, and  we were limited to reporting on domestic reprocessing establishments.", "Regarding the types of SUDs being reprocessed, our ability to provide  precise information was limited because although FDA maintains  databases of the types of devices the reprocessing establishments listed  with FDA, it does not confirm that all listed devices are currently available.  As a result, FDA\u2019s data may include types of SUDs that the reprocessing  establishments no longer reprocess, types of SUDs they plan to reprocess,  or types of SUDs they listed in error\u2014in effect, overstating the types of  SUDs the establishments are reprocessing or plan to reprocess. In  addition, representatives of one reprocessing establishment identified one  device type listed in the FDA database that the establishment never  reprocessed, but only resterilized and repackaged in unused form. While  we were unable to determine their reliability, we used FDA\u2019s data listing  the types of SUDs being reprocessed for the limited purpose of portraying  the types of SUDs that the reprocessing establishments were reprocessing  or planned to reprocess as of July 2007.", "To determine available research published about the safety of reprocessed  SUDs since we last reported on the topic in 2000, we reviewed FDA  documents related to adverse events involving reprocessed SUDs and an  FDA-sponsored survey of the experience of some hospitals related to  SUDs, reviewed summaries of, and other documents related to, FDA  inspections of reprocessing establishments conducted from August 2004  through October 2007, and conducted a literature search of studies (which  we call articles) published in peer-reviewed journals from January 2000  through January 2007.

To  identify these reprocessed SUDs, FDA analyzed the risks of infection or  inadequate performance for 229 types of SUDs that the agency identified  as either actually or potentially being reprocessed. For purposes of  implementing MDUFMA, FDA took into account such factors as the  physical characteristics of each type of SUD, including coatings that could  be damaged by reprocessing, the type of contamination associated with  the type of SUD\u2019s intended use, and the severity of potential injuries that  could result if that type of SUD fails after reprocessing. FDA published the  results of its review in a series of Federal Register Notices between April  2003 and September 2005.
