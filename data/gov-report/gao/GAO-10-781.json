Value capture strategies--joint development, special assessment districts, tax increment financing, and development impact fees--are designed to dedicate to transit either a portion of increased tax revenue or additional revenue through assessments, fees, or rents based on value expected to accrue as a result of transit investments. GAO was asked to review (1) the extent to which transit agencies and local governments use joint development and other value capture strategies to fund or finance transit; (2) what stakeholders have identified as facilitators of, or hindrances to, the use of these; and (3) what stakeholders have said about the effects of federal policies and programs on the use of these strategies. GAO analyzed data from 55 of the 71 transit agencies that responded to its information request; reviewed literature, and statutes and regulations; and interviewed transit agency, local government, and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) officials; developers; and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["More than half of the transit agencies from which GAO collected data (32 of 55) reported that joint development--in which a transit agency and a private entity partner to create development at a transit station--has been used as a source of funding for transit, while about a third (19 of 55) reported that special assessment districts, tax increment financing, and development impact fees have been used. Transit agencies that have extensively used joint development typically share characteristics, such as having formal joint development policies and in-house real estate expertise. Financial data collected from several transit agencies indicate that revenue generated annually through joint development is generally small when compared with an agency's annual operating expenses. Revenue generated by the other three value capture strategies has varied, but in some cases has been critical to the financial feasibility of the transit project or to improvements that support transit-oriented development. Several factors can facilitate or hinder transit agencies' and state and local governments' use of value capture strategies, such as coordination and support from public- and private-sector entities, transit project location and design, and state laws. For example, transit agencies, which generally do not have taxing authority, often have to coordinate with local taxing authorities to help establish a tax increment financing district. Also, according to several stakeholders, value capture strategies have the potential to generate more revenue when a project is designed with land-use zoning that allows for high-density development. However, some states do not authorize the use of certain strategies or may limit their use. For example, tax increment financing is currently not authorized under Arizona state law. Several transit agency officials told GAO that FTA's joint development guidance is confusing, which can hinder their use of joint development when federal funding is involved. For example, transit agencies are sometimes unclear about which types of developments and structures are eligible for joint development sites and the extent to which FTA requires replacement of parking spaces when surface parking lots are converted to structured parking garages that support transit-oriented development. This confusion can delay final federal approval of a project. Transit agency officials also told GAO that federal requirements, such as limitations on the use of joint development revenue for operations, maintenance, or acquisition of land for future joint development, can be burdensome. Transit agency officials also said the strict cost-effectiveness requirement for federal New Starts funding limited the competitiveness of some transit projects designed to use value capture strategies. Recent changes to the New Starts program, including amending the current cost-effectiveness measure and increasing the significance of economic development along with other factors, may affect transit projects, yet it is unclear how these changes will ultimately affect the use of value capture strategies. The FTA should issue additional guidance on federal joint development requirements to clarify the types of developments eligible under current law, and requirements and conditions for parking replacement. FTA agreed to consider GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments across the country are increasingly looking to  build new transit systems to help alleviate the adverse effects of traffic  congestion and support growth and redevelopment in the urban cores of  metropolitan areas. However, the desire for increased investment in  transit infrastructure coincides with increasing strains on traditional  sources of funding for these projects. Fixed-guideway transit projects are  costly to build, and limited funding for transit projects at the state and  local level has created intense competition for federal transit funds.  Moreover, in addition to facing challenges in obtaining funds to construct  new transit systems, many transit agencies are struggling to keep up with  mounting operations and maintenance costs of existing transit systems.  Facing budget shortfalls, transit agencies are forced to raise fares or cut  service, either of which can drive transit users away, potentially reducing  ridership and exacerbating funding issues. Furthermore, the sales tax  receipts and other funding sources that many transit agencies rely on to  fund capital projects and agency operations have significantly declined  during the recent economic downturn. Given this economic environment,  transit project sponsors are increasingly looking for alternative  mechanisms to help finance and deliver new, large-scale transit projects.", "There is a well-established relationship between public transit investments  and nearby property values. We have previously reported that plans for  transit stations and amenities commonly found in transit-oriented  developments generally increase nearby land and housing values, but the  magnitude of the increase varies greatly depending upon several  characteristics. Value capture strategies\u2014mechanisms designed to  harness increases in value for properties surrounding transit to help fund  investments in public transit infrastructure or related improvements\u2014are  designed to take advantage of this increase to create beneficial outcomes  for both the public and the private sectors, as well as link funding to the  beneficiaries of a transit system. Value capture strategies used to fund  transit vary in form; however each typically involves a private sector  contribution through an assessment or fee, or a public sector contribution  drawn from increased property tax revenue. One value capture strategy,  joint development, often generates revenue for the transit agency through  a lease or sale of publicly-owned land through partnerships with private or  nonprofit developers, or other public sector partners to create a portion of  a transit-oriented development.", "Value capture strategies are administered at the state, regional, or local  level. As a result, the federal government does not play a direct role in  implementing value capture strategies\u2014its role is primarily limited to  providing the federal share of capital construction and land acquisition  costs. However, federal policies and programs can affect the cost, design,  and routing of transit systems\u2014characteristics vital to the viability of  value capture strategies. Recently, the federal government has increased  its focus on creating \u201clivable\u201d communities by better linking  transportation, housing, and environmental programs and policies. Part of  this focus reflects the federal government\u2019s recognition of the increasing  demand for transit-oriented developments. Recent policy changes by the  Department of Transportation (DOT) are designed to provide more  flexibility for transit agencies and local governments to accommodate  transit-oriented development near stations and multi-modal transportation  sites. For example, in 2007, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)  issued joint development guidance, which is intended to provide flexibility  for transit agencies interested in pursuing transit-oriented development on  lands purchased with federal funding. In addition, over the past year, FTA  has proposed and implemented several changes to how cost effectiveness,  economic development effects, and other factors are considered in the  evaluation and rating process for FTA\u2019s New Starts grant program.", "You asked us to provide information on the experiences of transit agencies  and local governments in using value capture strategies for transit. More  specifically, this report addresses the following questions:  1.  To what extent do transit agencies and state and local governments  use joint development and other value capture strategies to fund or  finance transit? 2.  What have selected stakeholders and literature identified as facilitators  of, or hindrances to, the use of joint development and other value  capture strategies to fund or finance transit? 3.  What have stakeholders said about the effects of federal policies and  programs on the use of joint development and other value capture  strategies to fund or finance transit?", "To address these questions, we reviewed relevant literature to determine  the most commonly used value capture strategies and to help identify  facilitators of, and hindrances to, using value capture strategies. We  requested data from the 71 transit agencies that we identified as operating  a fixed-guideway or large bus system on the extent to which value capture  strategies were used to fund or finance transit on their system. We  analyzed data from the 55 transit agencies that provided data to us in  response to our request. We conducted site visits to the  Washington/Baltimore metropolitan area; Atlanta, Georgia; Los Angeles,  Sacramento, San Jose, and the San Francisco Bay metropolitan area in  California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington. We selected this  nongeneralizable sample of cities and metropolitan areas based on criteria  we established, including locations where value capture strategies had  been used or were under formal consideration for use, and geographical  diversity. During our site visits, we interviewed transit agency, state, and  local government officials, and private developers about selected transit  projects, as well as individuals with expertise in the area of value capture  strategies, to determine the extent to which value capture strategies are  used to fund or finance transit and to identify facilitators of, and  hindrances to, using value capture strategies. We also interviewed federal,  state, and local transit officials to identify ways federal policies and  programs affect the use of value capture strategies. Finally, we reviewed  applicable state constitutions, statutes, and regulations to identify  facilitators of, and hindrances to, using value capture strategies, and  relevant federal statutes and regulations to determine federal requirements  and program implications for joint development and other value capture  strategies. We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to July  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. See appendix I for more  information about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Numerous local communities are seeking to expand housing opportunities  and other amenities located near transit by promoting transit-oriented  development\u2014commonly defined as compact, mixed-use, walkable  neighborhoods located near rail stations or other permanent transit  facilities. Many transit agencies view such development as a way to  accomplish multiple goals, including promoting transit-supportive land use  near stations and increasing ridership. In addition, research generally  shows that land and housing values tend to increase with proximity to a  transit station. While the magnitude of these increases can vary, residents  place a premium on living near public transportation, retail development,  and other amenities such as parks and sidewalks commonly found in  transit-oriented developments.", "Both the private and public sector entities benefit financially from these  increases in value; private parties through increased land values and rents  and public-sector agencies through increased revenue from property or  other taxes. For the purposes of this report, the term \u201cvalue capture\u201d  generally refers to strategies that allow local governments or transit  agencies to dedicate to transit either a portion of the increased tax  revenue, or additional revenue through assessments or fees based on value  expected to accrue as a result of public improvements or investments.  While many of these strategies are used in the United States to fund or  finance infrastructure improvements, such as water, sewer, and other  utility systems, this report focuses on the use of these strategies  specifically to fund or finance transit or transit-related facilities or  improvements. The four strategies that are the focus of this report are as  follows:    Joint development is generally defined as a real estate development  project that involves a cooperative arrangement between public and  private sector partners, often as part of a transit-oriented development.  Joint development arrangements can take a number of forms, including a  lease of land, air rights, or space to a developer; sale of land for specific  types of development; joint construction of a transit facility and private  development; and others. Public and private partners can share costs,  revenues, or financial risk depending on the particular arrangement. Any  joint development using federal funds to make capital improvements must  follow FTA\u2019s joint development guidance and meet the statutory definition  of an eligible capital project. See figure 1.", "Special assessment districts designate a formal boundary in which  taxes or fees are assessed on properties expected to see a projected  benefit due to the geographic proximity of a new transit facility or other  unique amenity. The revenue collected is then used to help pay for such  facility or amenity. See figure 2.", "Tax increment financing is a public financing technique used by local  entities to encourage economic development. Typically, a public-sector  agency issues a special bond to finance the infrastructure necessary to  support new development and then uses the incremental increase in  property value within a formally designated tax increment financing  district to fund repayment of the bonds for the development-related costs,  including the costs of transit infrastructure improvements. See figure 3.", "Development impact fees are one-time charges collected by local  governments from developers to help defray the cost of new or expanded  infrastructure and services associated with new development, including  capacity-increasing transit projects. See figure 4.", "The use of value capture strategies may be authorized by the state, and can  be limited or restricted by state governments. For instance, state  legislatures generally provide the authority to public entities to establish  special assessment districts or tax increment financing districts and to use  the revenue generated from the districts for specific purposes. State and  local governments also play a role in creating the environment needed to  optimize the value created by transit projects or improvements. For  example, local governments create the zoning environment, which may,  for example, allow developers to build mixed-use developments at higher  densities. The implementation of any of the above strategies requires  coordination among a number of key public and private sector entities.  Their principal roles are summarized as follows.", "Local transit agencies, such as transit authorities or transit operators,  are responsible for building, maintaining, and operating transit systems.  These transit systems can include fixed-guideway transit systems\u2014such as  light or heavy rail, streetcars, ferry systems, and some bus rapid transit\u2014 and local bus service. Transit agencies may be direct recipients of federal  transit funds, particularly in major urban areas.", "State and local departments of transportation and metropolitan  planning organizations develop transportation plans and improvement  programs; build, maintain, and operate transportation infrastructure and  services; and distribute federal funds to local entities for specific  projects.", "Local county and city governments are typically responsible for  assessing and collecting property taxes, development impact fees, or  special assessments. In addition, local governments, through agencies  such as county or city planning departments or redevelopment agencies,  have control over land use planning, which includes zoning and growth  management policies.", "Private developers decide on and create developments and build and  manage housing units and commercial developments. In some cases,  private developers enter into sale or lease agreements with transit  agencies or other public-sector entities when undertaking joint  developments.", "Property owners, in addition to paying property taxes, sometimes agree  to enter into formally established districts and pay assessments to local  public-sector entities for the purpose of funding new transit projects, other  infrastructure (e.g., sidewalks, utilities), or improvements to existing  transit services.", "In general, FTA plays no role in the direct implementation of most value  capture strategies. However, transit agencies must follow a number of  federal requirements if, for example, a joint development includes land  that was purchased as part of a federally funded transit project or receives  federal funds. In 2007, FTA issued guidance on joint development  requirements that clarified the eligibility of joint development activities for  federal capital funding. Transit agencies must receive FTA concurrence  to sell or lease federally funded property for joint development purposes.  To use program income or FTA grant funds for a joint development  improvement, a local transit agency must demonstrate that the  improvement provides economic and public transportation benefits, raises  revenue for public transportation, and covers a reasonable share of costs  (if applicable).", "While FTA does not have formal policies or programs related to forms of  value capture for transit other than joint development, FTA programs fund  capital transit projects\u2014a key step in creating a transit-oriented  development and of creating value. FTA\u2019s New Starts program\u2014its major  capital investment program for new, and extensions to, existing fixed- guideway transit systems\u2014awards funds to individual projects through a  competitive selection process, which applies ratings to potential projects  based on local financial commitment and project justification criteria,  including cost effectiveness, land use, operating efficiencies,  environmental benefits, economic development effects, and mobility  improvements. FTA also provides funding to state and local  governments, and metropolitan planning organizations through a num of other programs, that may be used for transit, including:    Transit Capital Assistance (Recovery Act)  the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program    Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery Discretionary    Transit Formula and Discretionary Programs  In addition, the federal government also currently has two programs  designed to offer credit assistance to states for surface transportation  projects. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century established  the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998  (TIFIA), which authorized DOT, who later delegated this authority to the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), to provide credit assistance, in  the form of direct loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit, for  projects of national significance. A similar program, the Railroad  Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program, offers loans  to acquire, improve, develop, or rehabilitate intermodal or rail equipment  or facilities.", "DOT has recently begun to emphasize livable communities. For example,  DOT has refocused the goals of some existing programs and entered into  the Sustainable Communities Partnership with the Department of Housing  and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency. This  partnership is intended to help American families gain better access to  affordable housing, more transportation options, and lower transportation  costs by coordinating and leveraging federal programs. FTA also  introduced funding opportunities for fiscal year 2010 for urban circulator  and bus-related livability projects that promote livability, sustainability,  economic development, and the leveraging of public and private  investments. In addition, FTA grant program funds can promote livability  by funding eligible expenses, such as joint developments, bicycle and  pedestrian access, and other amenities near transit stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Joint Development and Other Value Capture Strategies Has Been Limited but Is Sometimes Critical in Funding and Financing Transit", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Few Transit Agencies with Extensive Joint Development Experience Have Common Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["According to data collected from 55 transit agencies, experience with joint  development varies widely, both in quantity and type. More than half of  the transit agencies we collected data from (32 of 55) have used joint  development, while one-fifth (11 of 55) have used joint development  extensively (6 or more joint developments). Moreover, the 11 agencies  with extensive joint development experience were responsible for 115 of  the 166 reported developments, and just 3 agencies (Los Angeles Metro,  Washington Metro, and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit) were  responsible for 58 of the 166 reported developments. These developments  varied greatly in size and type. For example, while joint developments are  often small and on a single parcel of land near a transit station, a few  transit agencies have completed neighborhood-scale transit-oriented joint  developments. For instance, Atlanta\u2019s Lindbergh City Center will  eventually encompass 47 acres of mixed-use development near a  Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit station. Joint developments also varied  in the types of uses; while many joint developments include housing,  offices, and retail space, they sometimes include hotels, youth services,  clinics, or other civic uses.", "We found that transit agencies that have used joint development  extensively typically share certain characteristics. Specifically, these  transit agencies generally    operate older, larger fixed-guideway systems;    have formal joint development or transit-oriented development policies;    have in-house real estate expertise; and    have developable land holdings on which to build joint developments.", "According to state and local transit officials we spoke with, the  permanency of stations along fixed-guideway systems makes station areas  on these systems more attractive for joint development than station areas  along bus lines or other non-fixed-guideway systems. Although joint  development is more often undertaken on fixed-guideway systems, King  County Metro in Seattle has implemented a number of joint developments  at permanent intermodal transit centers and park-and-ride lots along its  bus routes.", "Most transit agencies with extensive joint development experience also  have formal joint development or transit-oriented development policies  and in-house real estate expertise. State and local transit officials we  spoke with told us that formal policies allow transit agencies to prioritize  joint developments and align them with broader agency and community  goals. Based on our review of transit agencies\u2019 joint development policies,  we found that these policies often have common goals, which include  increasing transit ridership; reducing automobile dependency; generating  revenue to support transit operations; and partnering with local  communities to achieve intensive, high-quality development near transit  stations.", "In addition, state and local transit officials we spoke with emphasized the  importance of having an in-house real estate office, along with outside  consultants, dedicated to managing their agency\u2019s real estate assets,  including its joint developments. For instance, Maryland Department of  Transportation (MDOT) officials told us the department\u2019s Office of Real  Estate has a $3 million bi-annual budget and several in-house staff  dedicated to transit-oriented development. The officials further estimated  that the Office of Real Estate spends about $300,000 a year on outside real  estate consultants to assist its in-house staff in managing MDOT-owned  property. According to MDOT officials, transit-oriented joint development  is unlikely to take place unless state and local transit agencies have an  office dedicated to managing agency-owned properties in ways that  promote transit-oriented development.", "Also, transit agencies with extensive joint development experience are  also likely to have developable land holdings on which to build joint  developments and transit-oriented developments. Many state and local  transit officials we spoke with told us their agency made land available for  joint development by converting expansive, underutilized surface park- and-ride lots at their stations into transit-oriented developments with  structured parking garages. Several of these transit agencies have also  constructed a number of joint developments on land holdings they  originally acquired for construction staging purposes during their system\u2019s  initial construction and subsequent expansions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Development Revenue Is Generally Small Relative to a Transit Agency\u2019s Annual Operating Expenses", "paragraphs": ["Although several transit agencies have generated millions of dollars in  annual revenue from joint development, this annual revenue is generally  small when compared with an agency\u2019s annual operating expenses. For  example, the three transit agencies with the most joint development  experience\u2014Los Angeles Metro, Washington Metro, and Metropolitan  Atlanta Rapid Transit\u2014 generated between $184,000 and $8.8 million in  revenue from their joint developments in fiscal year 2008, while their total  operating expenses for fiscal year 2008 ranged from $374 million to $1.3  billion. Specifically, each agency\u2019s fiscal year 2008 annual joint  development revenue\u2014when compared with the agency\u2019s total annual  operating expenses\u2014amounts to no more than 1 percent. See table 1.", "State and local transit officials we spoke with told us that joint  development revenue goes into either a set-aside joint development fund  or the agency\u2019s general fund. Whereas general fund revenue is used by  transit agencies for operations and maintenance as well as capital  projects\u2014including joint developments\u2014set-aside funds target funds for  specific purposes. For example, Santa Clara Valley Transportation  Authority officials told us that revenue from the agency\u2019s joint  developments is placed in a set-aside fund, rather than its general fund,  and used to fund the continued operation and development of the agency.  Moreover, revenue from one phase of a joint development can also be  used to fund a later phase of the same development. For example, MDOT  transferred approximately 10.2 acres of state-owned land adjacent to one  of its commuter rail stations to a developer for a transit-oriented  development at the station. The developer considered this land  contribution (valued at $3.3 million) a credit toward the construction of a  commuter garage on the transit-oriented development site.", "A majority of transit agency officials we spoke with told us that, for a  variety of reasons, they prefer to lease agency-owned land rather than  selling it when entering into joint development agreements. Agencies often  favor leasing because it allows them to maintain direct control over land  use and receive an ongoing revenue stream. For instance, Los Angeles  Metro officials told us that leasing land generates significant revenue for  the transit agency, and allows the agency to require \u201cattractive\u201d  developments and hold developers accountable if they walk away from a  failed development. But several transit agencies told us that, in some  cases, selling land makes sense. For example, Washington Metro officials  told us that although the transit agency\u2019s board members prefer to lease  agency-owned parcels, the agency may sell the parcel if it needs upfront  money to build a parking structure on the development site. Furthermore,  if a planned joint development includes for-sale condominiums,  Washington Metro officials stated they may sell the parcel rather than  lease it because the agency does not have the authority to own land where  condominiums are sold."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Value Capture Strategies Have Not Been Widely Used to Fund or Finance Transit", "paragraphs": ["According to transit agencies that we collected data from and relevant  literature that we reviewed, special assessments, tax increment financing,  and development impact fees (other value capture strategies) have not  been widely used as a source of funding for transit.

However, state and local transit officials we spoke with told us about  several major transit infrastructure projects funded by one or more other  value capture strategies.

Specifically, transit agencies are responsible for  building, maintaining, and operating transit, but need to coordinate with  local and state governments that generally have authority over taxation,  land use, and development. For instance, when tax increment financing is  involved, transit agencies\u2014which generally do not have taxing authority\u2014 often have to coordinate with local taxing authorities to help establish a  tax increment financing district and dedicate a portion of the tax  increment toward a transit project. In addition, because high-density  zoning around transit stations helps optimize the value available for  capture, transit agencies often work with local zoning authorities to  modify zoning regulations to allow for higher-density development.

Several officials from transit  agencies and local governments that we spoke with emphasized that the  support of private developers, typically financial support, was critical to  implementing their projects or developments. For example, officials from  a few transit agencies said that the upfront funds provided by the private  developer for one of its joint developments helped fund the transit  infrastructure, including the parking structure and other transit station  improvements. Another official from a different transit agency said that  in-kind land contributions (paid in lieu of a monetary development impact  fee) will be critical to implementing a planned transit project.  Furthermore, an official from one county government noted that  substantial interest from developers has allowed the county to be more  selective about which transit projects it undertakes because it can focus  on projects with the highest priority and revenue generation potential.

However, the property  owners petitioned to maintain the district and the fees. Without this  support, a sizeable funding source for the project would have been  eliminated. Another local agency official told us that the support of one  property owner, who was a majority owner in a proposed special  assessment district, was critical to bringing a project to fruition.

For  example, officials from one transit agency told us their agency cannot  generate as much revenue from its joint developments as other  metropolitan areas in the country, such as the Washington D.C.,  metropolitan area or San Francisco, California, because ridership and  density are not comparable.

In response to a concern  raised by a commenter, FTA stated that \u201cFTA does not require [transit  agencies] to replace parking spaces on a one-to-one basis if those spaces  are used for joint development purposes and using them for such purposes  will not decrease public transportation trips to and from the station.\u201d In  addition, FTA officials told us that shared parking arrangements are  allowed with complementary uses such as theaters, so long as there is an  agreement in place that spaces will be available primarily for transit  purposes\u2014which typically involves transit riders using park and ride lots  between mornings and afternoons, Monday through Friday.

However, according to these officials, the New Starts process does not  effectively take into account the effects of future high-density transi oriented developments (which are in-line with FTA\u2019s livability goals) on  parking when seeking funds for transit capital projects.

For example, one local  government official told us that during the multiyear review of a proposed  New Starts project, construction costs for the project more than doubled,  while the contribution from a special assessment district remained fixe through an agreement with affected property owners. As a result , the  proportion of the local share of the project paid for using special  assessment district revenue was significantly lower than anticipated,  forcing the local government to draw from other local revenue source complete funding for the project.

In 2009, FTA revised the weights  given to each of the project justification criteria in accordance with  direction in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity  Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) Technical Corrections Act of 2008  that they be \u201c\u2026comparable, but not necessarily equal\u2026.\u201d As part of this,  according to FTA, the weight given to cost effectiveness was lessened and  the land use and economic development criteria were split apart and each  assigned specific weights rather than being considered together as had  previously been the case. In January 2010, the Secretary of Transportation  announced that transit agencies are no longer required to have at least a  \u201cmedium\u201d cost-effectiveness rating for their project to be recommended in  the President\u2019s budget for New Starts funding. In addition, FTA issued a  request for comments in an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in  June 2010 to seek input on how to improve its calculation of \u2018\u2018cost  effectiveness\u2019\u2019 and input on how FTA should evaluate economic  development effects and environmental benefits in the evaluation and rating  process for the New Starts grant program, among other things. This  rulemaking follows FTA\u2019s change to consider economic development  separate from land use. Prior to July 2009, the project justification rating  was split evenly between cost effectiveness and land use. These changes  have encouraged some transit agencies that are considering the use of value  capture strategies, however the overall effect is still unclear. For some  transit agencies officials, the removal of the medium cost-effectiveness  rating requirement may affect planned transit projects, but one transit  agency official noted that regardless of the change, the routes will still need  to be cost effective because finding funds for the local match will always  limit how much additional land or other user-friendly amenities the agency  can buy. One agency official told us that planned transit routes would be  aligned differently if spurring economic development becomes a heavily  weighted criterion in the New Starts process. Another agency official said  that changes are not going to alter where the agency plans new projects;  however, the elimination of a minimum cost-effectiveness rating certainly  might influence agency plans to acquire additional land in station areas. FTA  officials told us they are not sure how the recent and proposed changes to  New Starts project evaluation criteria will affect the number or cost of  projects seeking funding under the program.

We chose to focus on these strategies because  our review of relevant literature on value capture strategies and interviews  with relevant stakeholders found that these four strategies were the most  commonly used value capture strategies by transit agencies and state and  local governments to fund or finance transit.", "To determine the extent to which transit agencies and state and local  governments use joint development and other value capture strategies to  fund or finance transit, we requested information from the 71 transit  agencies that we identified as operating a fixed-guideway system\u2014 commuter rail, heavy rail, light rail, streetcar, and bus rapid transit\u2014and  the 30 largest U.S. bus agencies. We requested information on the use of  each type of value capture strategy in projects on or around any of their  transit stations, including the number of projects and the lead agency of  the project. In response to our request, we obtained information from 55  of the 71 transit agencies contacted. We then analyzed the information  reported by the transit agencies. To ensure the reliability of the  information provided, we interviewed stakeholders about the design of  our information collection instrument, reviewed responses to ensure that  the value capture strategies reported met our definitions of each value  capture strategy, and when possible corroborated the reliability of the  information through interviews or other agency documents obtained. The  information we collected was deemed reliable for our purposes.", "We also conducted site visits to, or interviewed officials from, transit  agencies, state and local governments, and private developers in Atlanta,  Georgia; Dallas, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles, Sacramento, the  San Francisco Bay metropolitan area, and San Jose, California; Seattle,  Washington; and the Washington/Baltimore metropolitan area on selected  transit or transit-related projects incorporating the use of value capture  strategies. Using information from literature that we reviewed and  information we collected from the 55 transit agencies, we selected this  nongeneralizable sample of cities and metropolitan areas based on criteria  we established, including locations where value capture strategies had  been used or were under formal consideration for future use and  geographical diversity. Where available, we collected and reviewed  information obtained from transit agencies on the costs and value capture  revenue for projects that used value capture strategies.", "To identify facilitators of, and hindrances to, the use of joint development  and other value capture strategies, we reviewed relevant literature on  value capture strategies. We also interviewed transit agency, state and  local government, and FTA headquarters and regional officials, as well as  representatives from private developers and individuals with expertise in  the area of value capture strategies. In addition, we reviewed applicable  state statutes and regulations.", "To identify stakeholders\u2019 views about the effects of federal policies and  programs on the use of joint development and other value capture  strategies to finance transit, we interviewed federal, state, and local  officials to identify ways federal policies and programs affect the use of  value capture strategies. We also reviewed applicable federal regulations  and statutes to determine federal requirements and program implications  for joint development and other value capture strategies.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Descriptions of Select Transit Projects or Developments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Transit Infrastructure Projects (by Percentage of Revenue Contributed by Value Capture) Atlanta BeltLine", "paragraphs": ["Maryland Department of Transportation is planning to lease state-owned land to a developer to  construct a transit-oriented development at the Owings Mills Metro Station in Baltimore County, MD.  Project sponsors plan to use tax increment financing to help pay for the construction of two state- owned parking garages at the transit-oriented development. According to State officials, revenue  generated from a special assessment will be used to pay for operations of the state-owned garages,  roads, and other improvements; however it may also be used to help pay bond debt in the event that  the tax increment financing revenues are insufficient."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Raymond Sendejas, Assistant  Director; Lauren Calhoun; Elizabeth Eisenstadt; Terence Lam; Matthew  LaTour; Amanda Miller, Sara Ann Moessbauer; Jaclyn Nidoh; Josh  Ormond; and Gretchen Snoey made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
