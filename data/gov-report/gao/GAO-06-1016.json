In December 2004, Congress passed the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (REA) to standardize recreation fee collection and use at federal lands and waters. GAO was asked to determine (1) what the agencies have done to coordinate implementation of REA, (2) what agencies have done to implement REA, (3) the extent to which agencies have controls and accounting procedures for collected fees, (4) how projects and activities are selected to receive funding from fees, and (5) the extent of unobligated fund balances. To answer these objectives, GAO reviewed agency guidance, analyzed fee data, interviewed officials, visited 26 fee-collecting units, and administered a nationwide survey to 900 fee-collecting units."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Departments of the Interior (DOI) and Agriculture (USDA) established four working groups to facilitate interagency cooperation and coordination of REA implementation. Each working group has made progress, but some issues remain unresolved. For example, the Interagency Pass working group has yet to determine the price to charge for the new pass, which is to be implemented in January 2007. To implement REA, agencies reviewed their fee programs and made modifications to the fee programs at some of their units. For example, several of USDA's Forest Service units dropped 437 sites from their fee program, such as picnic areas, because they did not meet REA criteria. However, not all units are in compliance with REA. Many agency officials said that while the agencies have issued some interim guidance, REA was difficult to interpret and suggested the need for more specific and detailed guidance on the fee program. In addition, DOI's Bureau of Reclamation has not yet determined whether to implement REA. Reclamation is assessing how REA applies to its operations. Some agencies lack adequate controls and accounting procedures for collected recreation fees and lack effective guidance for establishing such controls. On the basis of visits, some units did not have an effective means of verifying whether all collected fees are accounted for. In addition, many units have not implemented a system of routine audits to help ensure that fees are collected and used as authorized and that collected funds are safeguarded. The various agencies participating under REA have different processes for selecting projects to be funded with recreation fee revenues. At DOI's Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service and USDA's Forest Service, most proposed projects are approved at the local unit level, usually within a few weeks. At DOI's National Park Service, fee projects are reviewed and approved at the unit, regional, and headquarters or department level before projects are funded. According to National Park Service officials, under this process, it can sometimes take a year or more to obtain approval for a requested fee project, which delays project implementation and contributes to unobligated fee revenue balances. Agencies have $300 million in unobligated fee revenue balances. Unit officials cited several reasons for the unobligated balances, such as the need to save for large projects. Many unit officials also said that recreation fee revenues are essential to providing services at their recreation areas that would not otherwise be funded."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, Congress has expressed concern about the  operation and maintenance of federal recreation sites and the ability of  federal land management agencies to continue providing visitors high- quality recreational opportunities, while at the same time protecting  natural and other resources. To help address these concerns, Congress  passed legislation in 1996 authorizing an experimental initiative called the  Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (Fee Demo), under which  participating agencies were authorized to establish and collect recreation  fees at a number of sites and to use the revenues to enhance visitor  services, manage and protect resources, and reduce maintenance backlogs,  among other uses. Agencies participating in the Fee Demo program  included the Department of the Interior\u2019s (DOI) Bureau of Land  Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the National  Park Service (NPS), as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA)  Forest Service (FS). The Fee Demo program created two types of  recreation fees: entrance fees for basic admission to an area and user fees  for specific activities, such as camping or boat launching. Between 1996  and 2004, Congress reauthorized the program several times. The program  was designed to allow agencies to be creative in developing and  experimenting with new fees and fee collection practices for improving  visitor services, and to alleviate visitor confusion by coordinating multiple  or overlapping recreation fees. The program required that at least 80  percent of fee revenues be used at the sites where they were collected,  while allowing for the remaining 20 percent to be distributed to other sites  that may or may not be participating in the demonstration program.  Despite these program benefits, our reviews of the Fee Demo program identified a number of areas needing improvement. Specifically, we  reported that opportunities remained for the agencies to be more  innovative and cooperative in designing, setting, collecting, and  coordinating fees. We also reported that heavily visited sites might  eventually have more revenue than needed for their projects, while other  sites could have unmet needs as a result of adhering to the requirement that  80 percent of the revenues be used at the sites where they were collected.", "To address these and other issues, in December 2004, Congress passed the  Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (REA), which repealed the  Fee Demo program. Under REA, five federal agencies\u2014BLM, FWS, NPS,  and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) in DOI, and FS in USDA\u2014 are authorized to charge and collect recreation fees at federal lands and  waters. When Congress authorized REA, it attempted to improve upon the  demonstration program by providing fee authority for 10 years until  December 2014, standardizing the types of fees, increasing flexibility for  fee revenue expenditures, and authorizing a new national, interagency  \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u2014the National Parks and Federal Recreational  Lands Pass\u201d designed to minimize visitor confusion over which passes can  be accepted where. REA also provides criteria for establishing several  different kinds of fees (entrance, standard amenity, expanded amenity, and  special recreation permit) and prohibits charging of fees for certain  activities and services such as outings conducted by schools for  noncommercial educational purposes.", "Under REA, only NPS and FWS are authorized to collect entrance fees. An  entrance fee simply refers to a fee charged to enter lands managed by these  agencies. BLM, FS, and Reclamation are authorized to collect standard  amenity fees, which is a fee for access to a National Conservation Area; a  National Volcanic Monument; a destination visitor or interpretive center  that provides a broad range of interpretive services, programs, and media;  or use of an area that provides significant opportunities for outdoor  recreation and contains all of the following six amenities: (1) designated  developed parking; (2) a permanent toilet facility; (3) a permanent trash  receptacle; (4) an interpretive sign, exhibit or kiosk; (5) picnic tables; and  (6) security services. In addition, each of the five agencies can collect  \u201cexpanded amenity fees,\u201d as well as fees for special recreation permits.  Expanded amenity fees may be charged for the use of a specialized facility,  equipment, or service, such as a campground, boat launch, reservation  service, or interpretive tour. REA outlines the criteria that must be met in  order to charge this fee. For example, in order for a BLM, FS, or  Reclamation unit to charge an expanded amenity fee for use of a developed  campground, the campground must include at least a majority of nine  specified amenities such as tent or trailer spaces, drinking water, and  simple devices for containing a campfire. Each of the five agencies can also  collect a special recreation permit fee in connection with the issuance of a  permit for specialized recreation uses of federal recreational lands and  waters, such as group activities, recreation events, and motorized  recreational vehicle use.", "In general, REA directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to  involve the public in developing recreation fees and requires BLM and FS to  establish committees, called Recreation Resource Advisory Committees  (RRACs) or use an existing Resource Advisory Committee, to allow public  input on recommendations for fee amounts and their usage, and the  establishment of new fee sites. REA provides that recreation fee revenues  are available for expenditure without further appropriation, until expended  and, in general, requires that the collecting unit retain a minimum of 80  percent of revenues from recreation fees. However, REA does give the  agencies some flexibility to make an annual decision to reduce the  percentage allocation to a collecting unit to as little as 60 percent if they  determine the revenues collected at a given unit exceed its reasonable  needs. The remainder of these revenues goes into a central agency account  for expenditure on an agencywide or regional basis. While we describe  agency procedures for distribution of these funds, the use of these central  funds was beyond the scope of this review. Furthermore, the law extends  the agencies\u2019 authority to collect recreation fees to December 2014. The  primary differences between the Fee Demo program and REA authority are  illustrated in table 1.", "You asked us to provide an early assessment of REA implementation and to  help ensure that the guidelines being developed to implement the new law  are based on sound management practices. As requested, we determined  (1) what agencies have done to coordinate the implementation of REA,  including preparing for the new interagency federal lands pass; (2) what  agencies have done to implement REA fee and amenity requirements and  sufficiency of guidance for REA implementation; (3) the extent to which  the agencies have control and accounting procedures for collected  recreation fee revenues; (4) how participating agencies prioritize and  approve activities and projects funded with fee revenues; and (5) the extent  to which units have unobligated fund balances and if recreational fees are  being used to fund projects formerly funded with other appropriations. We  are also providing in appendix II information on how recreation fees vary  by type, amount, and the level of amenities offered at units with similar  recreational opportunities across and within agencies participating in REA.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and reviewed applicable laws,  regulations, agencywide policies and procedures, regional policies and  procedures, and the fees collected at selected units under the Fee Demo  program and REA in order to determine what changes have resulted since  REA implementation. We developed and administered a nationwide survey  to about 900 units collecting fees under REA, and 89 percent of the units  responded. We supplemented the survey information with records reviews,  analyses of documents, and testimonial evidence gathered during 26 unit  visits and in meetings with state, regional, and headquarters officials.  Appendix I shows the 26 units we visited, as well as a more detailed  description of our objectives, scope, and methodology.

To enhance visitor services while protecting natural  and other resources, as well as to address concerns about the prior  recreation fee program, Congress passed REA, which authorized the  collection and use of recreation fees at federal lands and waters.", "BLM\u2019s mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the  public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future  generations. BLM manages more than 260 million acres located  primarily in 12 western states.

An  additional 31 units only generate revenue from the National Parks Pass  and other pass sales.", "The mission of Reclamation is to manage, develop, and protect water  and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound  manner in the interest of the American public. Reclamation manages  about 8.5 million acres of land associated with water projects in 17  western states. The agency delivers water and hydroelectric power  through the maintenance and administration of dams and reservoirs.  Currently, Reclamation has identified seven locations that meet REA  requirements for collecting standard amenity fees.", "The mission of the USDA FS is to sustain the health, diversity, and  productivity of the nation\u2019s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of  present and future generations. FS manages more than 190 million acres  throughout the country.  The agency manages and issues permits for  activities such as skiing, livestock grazing, recreation, timber harvesting,  mining, and rights-of-way for road construction. Recreation fees are  collected at about 410 ranger districts in 155 national forests.", "BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS have had broad authority to collect recreation fees  for over 40 years, first under the Land and Water Conservation Fund  (LWCF) Act of 1965 and later under Fee Demo. Initially, Fee Demo  authorized only a limited number of sites to charge and retain recreation  fees\u2014up to 100 sites per agency\u2014but Congress later expanded the  authority to allow any number of sites to charge and collect recreation fees.  Under Fee Demo, the agencies were encouraged to be innovative in  designing and collecting fees and to coordinate their fees with other  federal, state, and local recreational sites. The program yielded substantial  benefits for recreation sites by funding significant on-the-ground  improvements. Total fee collections were about $192 million in fiscal year  2004, with about 67 percent or $129 million collected by NPS; the four  agencies collected a total of over $1 billion in recreation fee revenues  during the 8 years of the Fee Demo program. Nevertheless, under the  demonstration program, the majority of the agencies\u2019 funds were still  provided to them through annual appropriations.", "Between 1998 and 2004, GAO conducted several reviews of the Fee Demo  program, resulting in numerous reports and testimonies. During these  reviews, we found that Fee Demo was successful in raising revenues and  providing benefits to the agencies, but that improvements could be made to  better the program. GAO informed Congress of several areas that needed to  be addressed to ensure the program\u2019s success. These included: (1)  providing a more permanent source of revenue to supplement existing  appropriations by providing the agencies with a more permanent fee  authority; (2) encouraging effective coordination and cooperation among  agencies and individual fee sites to better serve visitors by making the  payment of fees more convenient and equitable, while at the same time  reducing visitor confusion about similar or multiple fees charged at  adjacent federal recreation sites; (3) providing the agencies with greater  flexibility regarding fee revenue expenditures by modifying the  requirement that at least 80 percent of fee revenues remain at the collection  site; and (4) encouraging fee innovation through pricing structures based  on extent of use or peak pricing. In 2004, Congress passed REA, in part, as  a response to the suggestions and concerns documented in these previous  reports. REA repealed several prior authorities such as those contained in  LWCF Act, Fee Demo, and the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of  1998, which authorized national passes including the National Parks Pass.", "However, many of the fees currently charged under REA were first  instituted under the LWCF Act or during the Fee Demo program.", "For fee revenues, REA provides that recreation fees collected under the act  be deposited in a special fund account and remain available for  expenditure without further appropriation action. REA allows the revenues  to be used in a variety of ways such as for repair, maintenance, and facility  enhancement; interpretation and visitor information; law enforcement; and  direct operating or capital costs associated with the fee program. However,  not more than an average of 15 percent of total recreation fee revenues may  be used for administration, overhead, and indirect costs related to the  recreation fee program. Further, REA prohibits the use of recreation fee  revenues for employee bonuses or for biological monitoring under the  Endangered Species Act.", "Both visitors to federal lands and agency officials generally support  recreation fees and tout the benefits that fee revenues provide through  improved facilities and services. Some assert that the recreation fee  program will improve recreational opportunities and that it is a needed  supplement to general fund appropriations. However, concerns about the  recreation fee program continue to exist for a variety of reasons. For  example, some people are concerned that the fee program under REA does  not go far enough in simplifying fees, that federal lands will be  overdeveloped to attract fee-paying tourists, and that the law fails to ensure  that most collections will be used for the agencies\u2019 highest priorities. Other  critics continue to oppose recreation fees in concept, in large part, on the  grounds that the cost of operating and maintaining federal lands should be  covered by general fund appropriations and that these fees constitute a  barrier to public access to federally managed lands. However, in times of  budget constraints, recreation fees may provide an important source of  additional funding needed to sustain agency operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Working Groups Formed to Foster Interagency Cooperation and Coordination on REA Implementation Issues Have Made Progress, but Some Issues Remain Unresolved", "paragraphs": ["The four technical working groups formed by DOI and USDA to facilitate  interagency cooperation and coordination on specific REA implementation  issues have made progress. However, progress has been slow in some  areas, such as resolving issues surrounding the RRACs and the new  interagency pass, possibly delaying agency implementation of these  aspects of the law. For example, the working group responsible for forming  advisory committees, such as RRACs, has missed target dates, which has  ultimately delayed the establishment of some new recreation fees. GAO has  reported in the past that agencies face barriers any time they attempt to  work collaboratively, but that there are key practices that can be applied to  help enhance and sustain agency collaboration. For example, it is  important to establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries. While one working group has finalized  its interagency handbook, one is not planning to issue any guidelines, and  two have not issued all of their interagency guidelines and agreements. For  example, the working group responsible for preparing for the new  interagency federal lands pass has not issued interagency guidelines  outlining such details as pass eligibility requirements and distribution of  costs and revenues among the agencies, which could potentially delay  implementing the new pass."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The RRACs/Public Participation Working Group is Facilitating the Establishment of State and Regional RRACs, but Progress Has Been Slow", "paragraphs": ["The RRACs/Public Participation working group has focused on establishing  RRACs or utilizing existing advisory councils as part of the REA public  participation requirements. These committees may make  recommendations to the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture related to  public concerns about implementation of standard and expanded amenity  fees or the establishment of a specific recreation fee site managed by BLM  or FS, among other issues. However, the development of the RRACs has  been slow, which has delayed the implementation of new fees or fee  changes at some units. According to a June 2005 interagency presentation,  it was expected that the RRACs would be established with members  appointed by the end of 2005. Despite progress toward establishing RRACs,  some tasks have taken longer than originally estimated and, as of August  2006, no state or regional RRACs are fully operational. Before the working  group can move forward with many aspects of establishing RRACs\u2014 including issuing a charter and soliciting nominations for membership\u2014or  existing advisory councils can begin reviewing fee issues, an interagency  agreement on implementing the RRAC requirements had to be signed. This  interagency agreement, which covers issues such as the specific duties of  the new RRACs and existing advisory councils, was finalized on September  1, 2006, but there is no time line for implementation, according to an  agency official. In addition, other preparatory work to implement the new  RRAC requirement has begun.  For example, BLM and FS have begun  educating existing advisory councils and the public about recreation fees  and the REA public participation requirements.", "Because BLM and FS generally cannot create new fees or modify existing  fees (per each agency\u2019s interim policy) without the participation of RRACs,  or existing advisory councils, the delay in establishing these advisory  committees has prevented many units from making fee decisions. Agency  officials at 26 percent of BLM and almost 38 percent of FS fee-collecting  units responding to our survey, or 171 units out of 481 total units, said that  the establishment of or changes to recreation fees at their units had been  prevented or delayed to a moderate, great, or very great extent since the  passage of REA in December 2004. For example, the Dillon Ranger District  in the White River National Forest in Colorado is currently considering  modifying its fee structure but has been delayed because the RRACs are  not operational. Because adding new fees or increasing existing fees  generally results in an overall increase in fee revenue, some units may be  losing fee revenue that could be used to further enhance visitor services  without functioning RRACs in place. Some units, however, were allowed to  add or modify fees prior to implementation of the new RRAC requirement if  the fee changes were already in progress, and public notification and  participation requirements had been met. For example, about 25 new  expanded amenity fees have been implemented at FS units since early  2006, most of which are for cabin rentals, according to the FS Fee Program  Coordinator. In addition, in some states there are no units that currently  want to add or modify fees, so the implementation of the RRAC  requirements is not delaying fee changes at any units in those states.", "The organizational structure for the RRACs and use of existing advisory  councils was approved by DOI and USDA in March 2006 via an interagency  organizational agreement that established, among other things, how the  REA RRAC requirement will be met in each state/region. In the majority of  western states, BLM and FS will use joint RRACs or committees, many of  which will be composed of existing BLM advisory councils\u2014REA allows  existing advisory committees or fee advisory boards to perform the RRAC  duties. In addition, five new RRACs are being established nationwide.  Appendix III outlines the organizational structure and membership  requirements for the RRACs.", "Finally, in addition to the specific requirement for BLM and FS to establish  RRACs or use existing advisory councils to review fee issues, REA has  several other provisions for public participation that apply to all agencies,  and these new public participation requirements have also delayed the  implementation of new fees or fee changes at some units. DOI and USDA  issued interagency guidelines on public participation that apply to all  participating agencies in September 2005. The guidelines direct the  Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to publish a Federal Register notice  for establishing each new recreation fee area 6 months prior to its  establishment, as required by REA.  The guidelines also direct the agencies  to identify outreach efforts, such as public meetings, to encourage public  involvement in establishing recreation fee areas and to annually post  notices at each recreation fee area describing the use or anticipated use of  recreation fees collected at that site during the previous year. Some of the  agencies, including NPS, BLM, and FS, have issued agency-specific  guidance for meeting REA public participation requirements. According to  agency officials, the public participation requirements have delayed fee  changes or the establishment of new fees at some units. Agency officials at  almost 17 percent of fee-collecting units within all four agencies  responding to our survey said that the public participation process in  general had delayed or prevented the establishment of or changes to  recreation fees at their unit to a moderate, great, or very great extent since  the passage of REA in December 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interagency Pass Working Group Has Made Progress Preparing for the New Interagency Federal Lands Pass, but Some Issues Remain Unresolved", "paragraphs": ["The Interagency Pass working group has mainly focused on preparations  for the new interagency \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u2014the National Parks and  Federal Recreational Lands Pass.\u201d While the agencies have made progress  in preparing to implement the new pass, some issues remain unresolved.  For example, while the working group has generally determined how  revenues from passes sold centrally will be distributed for the first 3 to 5  years, it is unclear how these revenues will be distributed among all  participating agencies beyond this time frame. In addition, the working  group has not determined the price to charge for the new pass. According  to DOI, the most complex and time-consuming aspect of implementing  REA relates to establishing this new pass. The Interagency Pass working  group has been addressing the various issues involved with the pass,  including the price of the pass, the distribution of revenues from the sale of  the pass, and operational issues like accepting the pass and tracking its use  at recreation sites. The target date for implementing the new pass is  January 1, 2007, with passes available for distribution by November 1, 2006.  According to the working group, this is a very tight time line that will  require the contracting processes to stay on schedule and for subsequent  design, production, and shipping deadlines to be met.", "The standard version of the new pass will be available to the general public;  in addition, there will be versions of the pass available to senior citizens,  persons with disabilities, and volunteers. Table 2 provides a description of  each of the versions of the new pass. The price of the standard pass has not  yet been determined. The Golden Eagle, Age, and Access Passports, and  the National Parks Pass will continue to be sold until the new interagency  passes are available and all existing passes will be valid for the lifetime of  the pass (e.g., 1 year from purchase for National Parks Pass and Golden  Eagle Passport; lifetime of the pass holder for Golden Age and Access  Passports).", "While the price of the new standard pass has yet to be determined as of  August 2006, the pricing decision is critically important because of the  potential impact of the pass on entrance and standard amenity fee  revenues. In particular, agency officials at NPS have emphasized the  importance of pricing and marketing decisions and their potential impacts  on entrance fee revenue. To provide information to help determine the  price of the new pass, the agencies entered into a cooperative agreement  with the University of Wyoming to conduct a pricing analysis. For the study,  researchers conducted six focus groups throughout the nation, collected  benchmarking information from a number of U.S. state parks and Canadian  national parks, and developed and implemented a random telephone  survey of recreation users. According to a NPS headquarters official, the  working group is not considering potential revenue losses due to the new  interagency pass, only what the public is willing to pay for the new pass.  However, in commenting on a draft of this report, NPS headquarters  officials informed us that revenue impacts will be considered in the pricing  decision. According to a DOI official, the price of the new pass was to be  determined in the summer of 2006. As of August 2006, the price of the new  standard (annual) pass had not yet been established.", "The details of the plan for distributing revenues from the sale of new  interagency passes sold centrally, such as through the Internet or outside  vendors, beyond the first 3 to 5 years of the pass program is still uncertain.  All pass revenue from passes sold at units will remain within the agency  where the pass was sold, and it will be up to each agency to determine how  to redistribute pass revenues within the agency. For the first 3 to 5 years of  the pass program, revenues from passes sold centrally will initially be used  to cover administrative costs of the new pass and to reimburse NPS for the  almost $2.4 million it loaned to fund development of the new pass. After  administrative costs for the new pass are covered and NPS is reimbursed,  any remaining central pass revenues will be distributed equally among all  participating agencies for at least the first 3 to 5 years of the program, with  the goal of assisting all agencies in establishing a pass program. However,  this plan may be revisited if central pass sales significantly increase or  decrease or if central pass revenue after 3 years is not adequate to cover  administrative costs of the program or to reimburse NPS for its loan. The  long-term plan for revenue distribution beyond the initial 3 to 5 years is  more uncertain because these plan details have not been agreed upon.  According to an official from the working group, the current long-term plan  is to distribute central pass revenues to the agencies based on a formula  that takes into account pass use, where passes were purchased, and  possible additional factors. However, the details of the formula have not  been determined, and there are some potential problems with the  collection of pass-use data to be used in the formula.", "While units are generally able to track the number of passes sold, it would  be difficult for many units to collect accurate data about use of the pass. At  most NPS and FWS sites, fees covered by the new interagency pass will  generally be collected at staffed entry points, whereas at BLM and FS sites,  fees covered by these new passes will generally be collected at unstaffed  and often remote locations where fee compliance and enforcement will be  irregular and infrequent. One way to track pass usage would be to swipe a  magnetic strip on the passes at recreation site entry gates. However, even  within NPS, whose sites frequently have staffed entry points, only one-third  of the sites with entrance fees are currently capable of reading magnetic  strips at their entry gates. It would likely be difficult and expensive to  install technology to read magnetic strips at many remote and unstaffed  units, and compliance with such systems would be difficult to enforce at  sites without staffed entry booths by January 2007. According to a member  of the working group, the working group is aware of these issues and, while  it has not yet addressed them, the group plans to develop a consistent data  collection strategy that the agencies can use at unstaffed locations to  determine pass usage. Agencies will be responsible for implementing the  strategy and units will be expected to collect data on the use of the pass  after the new interagency pass is released.", "As of August 2006, the agencies are engaged in a contracting process to  acquire the goods and services necessary to implement the new  interagency pass and are planning to issue the pass by the January 2007  target date. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for the contract was published  on June 5, 2006, and, according to agency officials, it is unknown when the  contract will be awarded. The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) will  print the new pass and any accompanying products. Agency officials from  the Interagency Pass working group have acknowledged that they are  working within a very tight time line, but have said that they are committed  to issuing the new pass by January 2007. However, certain critical aspects  in the pass development time line have taken much longer than originally  anticipated. For example, an earlier estimated date for issuing the RFP for  contracting services was fall 2005 before it was pushed back several times  and finally published in June 2006. In addition, interagency guidelines for  the new pass that were estimated in June 2005 to be completed in fall 2005  had not been completed as of August 2006. However, the working group  still has several months to meet their target pass implementation date of  January 2007.", "One goal of the new single interagency pass is to reduce visitor confusion  over which passes can be accepted where, since the various passes  currently offered by the agencies create considerable confusion among the  visiting public. The majority of units responding to our survey, almost 63  percent, were aware that the visiting public was confused about the use of  current national passes, regional passes, or annual passes. The factor most  frequently cited for causing visitor confusion was where the different types  of passes are accepted, with 82 percent of units responding that this factor  causes confusion to a moderate, great, or very great extent. Other factors  cited by more than two-thirds of survey respondents as causing confusion  were the differences in the benefits between passes, the recreation uses  covered by each pass, the differences in the Golden Eagle Passport versus  the National Parks Pass, the difference between federal and nonfederal  units, and understanding the differences between various passes (e.g.,  eligibility, cost, benefits, etc.). Given that there will be overlap between the  current National Parks Pass, the Golden Eagle, Age, and Access Passports,  and the new interagency pass, it will be important for the new pass  guidelines and agency-specific guidance and training on it to address these  issues and provide unit staff with materials and information to better  educate the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fee Collection/Expenditure Working Group Has Issued Final Interagency Guidance in an Attempt to More Clearly Define REA Terminology", "paragraphs": ["The Fee Collection/Expenditure working group was established to address  organizational concerns, implementation issues, and coordination among  the agencies as they relate to fee collections and expenditures.

Overall, the transition from Fee Demo  to REA was easiest for NPS and FWS, both of which charged entrance fees  under Fee Demo, were authorized to charge such fees under REA, and  continued to charge entrance fees. Therefore, the transition for these  agencies to REA did not have much impact. NPS eliminated a day-use fee at  the Exit Glacier site in Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska because of  concerns that it would be perceived as an entrance fee, which is prohibited  under both the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and REA.  FWS eliminated an entrance fee at Gavin\u2019s Point National Fish Hatchery in  South Dakota because fish hatcheries are not allowed to charge entrance  fees under REA.", "The transition from Fee Demo to REA had more of an impact on FS and  BLM since REA provided additional criteria for fee sites and prohibitions  on certain fees at these agencies. Unlike Fee Demo, REA limits the  authority of BLM and FS, authorizing these agencies to collect fees only at  locations with a certain level of infrastructure and/or services and prohibits  charging fees for parking, general access to dispersed areas with little or no  investment, and scenic overlooks, among others. BLM and FS assessed  existing fee programs and either eliminated fees, converted fees, or added  amenities in order to convert entrance or day-use fees to standard amenity  fees. BLM and FS also assessed existing campgrounds and other developed  facilities to ensure that they had at least the minimum number of required  amenities to charge an expanded amenity fee.", "BLM eliminated several fees after passage of REA, including fees for  overlooks at Imperial Sand Dunes in California, fees at undeveloped sites at  Orilla Verde Recreation Area in New Mexico, and youth fees at several  sites, including Cape Blanco Lighthouse in Oregon. For BLM, a key change  was converting existing entrance fees to standard amenity fees where sites  met the new criteria. According to a BLM headquarters official, BLM  converted entrance fees at 10 sites to standard amenity fees. According to  state coordinators, only one of these sites, located in Arizona, did not meet  standard amenity criteria and had to add an informational kiosk. Other  BLM sites converted various fees charged for activities such as camping to  expanded amenity fees. For example, campgrounds at Fisherman\u2019s Bend  Recreation Area in western Oregon had at least the minimum amenities  required by REA to convert a camping fee to an expanded amenity fee.", "FS reviewed its existing recreation fees and stated that it dropped 437 sites,  such as trailheads and picnic areas, from its fee program because they did  not meet the new criteria described under REA. Under Fee Demo, FS  charged fees for entrance into large areas, sometimes entire forests.  However, REA prohibited FS from charging entrance fees and only allowed  FS to charge standard amenity fees if the sites provide the required level of  amenities. In addition to dropping fee sites, numerous FS units added  amenities to bring sites into compliance with REA. According to one FS  regional coordinator, if a developed site was missing one or two amenities,  then the unit added those amenities, otherwise, the site was dropped from  the fee program.", "Concerns about FS compliance with REA criteria have been raised by users  who are critical of the use of High Impact Recreational Area (HIRA)  designations and standard amenity fee areas. While HIRAs are not  specifically mentioned in REA, FS relies on a section of REA that  authorizes standard amenity charges for the use of \u201can area\u201d as authority to  designate HIRAs. The Interagency Implementation Handbook for Federal  Lands Recreation Enhancement Act defines a HIRA as an area of  concentrated recreation use that includes a variety of developed sites  providing a similar recreation opportunity that incur significant  expenditures for restoration, public safety, sanitation facilities, education,  maintenance, and other activities necessary to protect the health and safety  of visitors, cultural resources, and the natural environment. The handbook  also defines limitations on which areas can be designated as a HIRA. For  example, whole administrative units, such as a national forest or a  Reclamation project, cannot be declared a HIRA. During the past few years,  FS identified HIRA sites and has proceeded to charge standard amenity  fees for the use of these areas under REA. According to the agency\u2019s  officials, the HIRA designation is a logical way of categorizing amenities  supporting high levels of recreation use, and collected fees go to maintain  and clean these provided amenities, such as restroom facilities.", "Another concern about the HIRAs is that some access points into parts of  wilderness areas that are not considered part of a HIRA are only accessible  via the HIRA, so visitors must still pay the standard amenity fee to access  these parts of the national forests. In addition, some assert that because  REA prohibits charging a fee \u201csolely for parking\u201d or \u201cdriving through,  walking through, boating through, horseback riding through, or hiking  through\u2026without using the facilities and services,\u201d the standard amenity  fees for HIRAs are prohibited in some cases. For example, a visitor to an  Arizona national forest challenged FS citations issued to her for failing to  display the required day pass permit to travel into a HIRA. The visitor was  cited on two occasions because she parked within a HIRA to hike the area  without having paid for the day pass permit. On September 5, 2006, a  district court held that the REA bars the FS from collecting fees for parking  along roads or trailsides and that the FS acted \u201cfar beyond its legislative  authority\u201d in its attempt to collect the fee. Accordingly, the court dismissed  the citations against the visitor.", "According to FS officials, the agency significantly decreased the size of  many of its HIRAs to only cover areas where required standard amenities  are within reasonable access. For example, the entire Flaming Gorge  National Recreation Area in Utah and Wyoming had an entrance fee under  Fee Demo; now only 4 percent of the recreation area is subject to fees.  Another example is the Los Padres National Forest in southern California,  which reportedly decreased the size of its HIRA from almost 1.5 million  acres to 71,000 acres while also removing 37 fee sites. However, in  testimony before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,  Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, on October 26, 2005,  representatives from the Arizona and Western Slope No-Fee Coalitions  charged that the BLM and FS are using the HIRA and standard amenity  concepts to circumvent the intent of Congress and charge fees for areas  that do not have the amenities required by REA. However, REA does not  provide a definition for \u201carea\u201d and thus the criteria used to define an \u201carea\u201d  are open to the agencies\u2019 discretion. For example, the Arapaho National  Recreation Area in Colorado charges a standard amenity fee for an area it  defines as an HIRA that contains 25 developed sites including picnic areas,  boat launches, campgrounds, and trailheads. Not all six of the amenities  that are required under REA are collocated at each of the developed sites.  However, since all six of the required amenities are somewhere within the  hundreds of acres of their designated HIRA, the FS is charging a standard  amenity fee for the entire area under REA. In the October 26, 2005, Senate  subcommittee hearing, a USDA official acknowledged that FS  implementation of REA is a \u201cwork in progress\u201d and that different local  conditions and characteristics make it difficult to develop HIRA criteria  that fit all circumstances. According to this official, FS has continued to  work on providing consistent signage and to identify areas that may not  meet the criteria for charging fees and plans to have the RRACs comment  on how the agency is applying HIRA criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some BLM and FS Units Do Not Have All Required Amenities to Charge Standard Amenity Fees", "paragraphs": ["We also found that some BLM and FS units still do not meet REA  requirements for charging standard amenity fees.

Two BLM units and 36 FS units  reported that they did not provide all six required amenities. The amenities  that the units were most frequently lacking were a permanent trash  receptacle and interpretive signs, exhibits, or kiosks. Although these units  reported in survey responses that their unit did not have all six required  amenities, BLM state-level officials and FS headquarters officials stated  they believed all of their fee-collecting units were in compliance with REA  criteria. In commenting on a draft of this report, both BLM and FS indicated  their unit officials had likely been confused by the fee terminology in the  survey question and/or may have misunderstood the definitions of the  required amenities, rather than because these units lack amenities such as  picnic tables.", "However, during interviews with agency officials, we learned that some  units charging a standard amenity fee did not have all six required  amenities, but had plans to add these amenities. For example, the Meadow  Creek site at the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado lacked  two of the six amenities\u2014picnic tables and interpretative signage\u2014 required under REA when we visited it in December 2005. The unit has  continued to charge a standard amenity fee since REA passed because unit  officials thought it would be confusing to visitors to temporarily  discontinue the fee while they worked on upgrading the area to meet REA  criteria. The unit received a $20,000 grant in 2005 from the central fee  revenue fund to add picnic tables and signage, as well as fire rings to the  area. According to a unit official, the required amenities were added during  the summer of 2006, and the Meadow Creek site now has all of the required  amenities in place.", "Some FS unit staff also found the standard amenity criteria at odds with  wildlife management practices. For example, several national forests near  the Canadian border are in grizzly bear areas, so FS has instructed the  public to \u201cpack out,\u201d or dispose of their trash outside of camping and day- use areas, rather than install costly bear-proof garbage cans. Now, if these  forests are going to continue charging recreation fees at these sites, REA  requires FS to put trash receptacles in the areas. In another example, picnic  tables were previously removed from Mt. Evans, in the Arapaho-Roosevelt  National Forest, because of wildlife interaction issues. However, in order to  comply with REA, FS must provide all six required amenities, including  picnic tables.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, BLM headquarters officials stated  that they checked with the two units that reported having less than six  required amenities in their response to our survey.

Based on information from FS officials and our  analysis, the status of those units is as follows:  12 units did not have a standard amenity fee but instead had an  expanded amenity fee, which does not have the same amenity  requirements under REA.  11 units did have the required six amenities and did not accurately  report this in their survey response to us.  4 units had a standard amenity fee for a visitor or interpretive center,  which under REA may be charged without having the six required  amenities.  2 units had no standard amenity fee and should have reported this in  their survey response to us.  7 units have not yet responded to the follow up inquiries.", "It should be noted, however, that the results of BLM and FS headquarters  officials\u2019 inquiries have not been verified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reclamation Undecided on Implementing REA", "paragraphs": ["Reclamation has not made a decision to move forward with REA  implementation.

However, cash collection is an area where agencies are particularly  vulnerable to the risk of theft. Some locations, such as BLM\u2019s Gunnison  Field Office, have such limited staff running their recreation fee program  that their program coordinator indicated the appropriate separation of  duties, not to mention using procedures such as two staff jointly counting  fee receipts, is simply not possible. Unfortunately, this circumstance may  not be unusual, especially at smaller units where resource management  staffs\u2014generally with little or no accounting or business operations  experience\u2014are tasked with implementing the fee program, including cash  handling procedures. The staffs at these units face many challenges ranging  from the development of safe and secure procedures for gathering and  transporting fee envelopes from remote campground sites to assuring that  staff with appropriate knowledge and skills are assigned to process and  account for collected fees. In addition, survey respondents indicated a  myriad of other problems such as  security concerns over the delivery of collected cash fees from their unit   local banks not accepting agency procedures for depositing funds to a   local banks and/or post offices charging fees for issuing the money  order or cashier\u2019s check necessary to make deposits in Treasury  accounts,   employees having to pay bank fees for money orders or cashiers checks  with their own funds and then seek reimbursement from the agency, and  the closest local bank sometimes being an inconvenient 30 to 60 miles  away from fee collecting locations.", "According to federal internal control standards, management should strive  to remove the temptation for unethical behavior by avoiding the receiving  and handling of cash by individual staff without a reasonable means of  determining the amount of revenues the employee has received. For  example, at the Tonto National Forest Mesa Ranger District, near Phoenix,  staff members sometimes collect cash fees directly from visitors when the  automated fee machines are broken. Most of the district\u2019s fees are collected  by automated machines that are owned and serviced by a contractor.  However, one or more of the unit\u2019s automated fee machines are often  broken. To avoid a loss of revenues when the machines are not working,  the managers designate staff members as collection officers to work at  busy entry points to collect fees and direct traffic flow. According to  district management, the staff later feed the collected fees into a working  automated machine someplace else in the district. However, the managers  have not developed physical or other compensating controls over these  cash collections (easily amounting to several hundred dollars on a busy  day) that would enable managers to verify that all of the fees collected by  any given staff member are actually fed into a working machine. In  commenting on a draft of this report, FS headquarters officials indicated  that they believe that automated fee machines should rarely be broken and  they also noted that local officials are responsible for reasonable internal  controls over cash collection.", "In addition, the safety of staff involved in collecting the cash could be  jeopardized due to the risk of being targeted for robbery. In another  example, at BLM\u2019s Gunnison Field Office, in western Colorado, one or two  staff members collect the fee envelopes containing campground fees from  a remote self-service fee station and place the envelopes into a bag for  transport back to the office. At the office, the envelopes are placed in a safe  until another employee has an opportunity to open the envelopes, count  the cash, and record the fees collected. However, the manager has not  developed physical controls over the cash collections and accounting to  provide assurance that all of the fee envelopes collected by the first staff  member(s) are turned in at the office or that all of the funds counted by the  second employee are deposited and accurately documented.

According to a NPS  regional fee program coordinator, some NPS regions are aggressive about  audits, such as the Intermountain Region where one staff person is  dedicated to conducting audits. Other regions may not have dedicated  resources to conduct audits. For example, the Northeast Region has only  one fee coordinator available to conduct fee program audits, and she does  not feel she is justified in going to parks unless unit managers ask her to  review how the unit is doing operationally.

The contractor collects the fees (cash and credit  card payments) directly from the machines and then prepares quarterly  reports for the FS unit, stating the amount collected and the amount to be  remitted to FS under the contract. Over the life of the contract, FS staff  members have verified the amount of the contractor\u2019s remittance against  the reported total collected fees to ensure the contractor submitted the  correct percentage of the fees under their contract. Unfortunately, by  simply relying on this approach, FS officials have no way of independently  verifying actual receipts because they have no access to raw data from the  automated machines.

It also limits the use of fee revenues  to not more than an average of 15 percent of total revenues for  administration, overhead, and indirect costs related to the recreation fee  program. Other sanctioned uses of recreation fee revenues include a myriad of things ranging from interpretive signage to law enforcement to  certain limited types of habitat restoration. Specifically, REA mandates that  fee revenues only be used for the following:  repair, maintenance, and facility enhancement related directly to visitor  enjoyment, visitor access, and health and safety;  interpretation, visitor information, visitor service, visitor needs  assessments, and signs;  habitat restoration directly related to wildlife-dependent recreation that  is limited to hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, or photography;  law enforcement related to public use and recreation;  direct operating or capital costs associated with the recreation fee   a fee management agreement or a visitor reservation service.", "In addition to REA guidance, BLM, NPS, and FS have all issued at least  interim guidance on expenditure priorities for projects funded with fee  revenues. BLM guidance emphasizes that fee revenues be used to support  projects or activities related to recreation and stipulates a specific  percentage of funding be spent in this area. NPS has established deferred  maintenance projects as its first priority for recreation fee revenues and  stipulates the percentage of funding that should be spent in support of this.  FS guidance essentially repeats the priorities established in REA.  FWS has  not issued any interim guidance on expenditure priorities, but draft  guidance that has not been finalized also repeats the priorities established  in REA, similar to FS guidance. Each of the agencies\u2019 guidance also  stipulates the amount of fee revenues that can be spent for either (1)  administration, overhead, and indirect costs or (2) collections cost.

These different processes can affect  the types of projects agencies fund and their time lines for project  implementation. At BLM, FWS, and FS, most proposed projects are  approved at the local unit level. Unit staff indicated that most projects  funded with fee revenues are usually approved within a couple of days to a  few weeks or, in some cases, implemented immediately without unit  manager approval. At NPS, however, projects must be reviewed and  approved at the unit and regional levels, as well as at the headquarters or  department level before projects are funded. In commenting on a draft of  this report, NPS noted that its project approval process was put in place by  DOI and the Office of Management and Budget and has been articulated in  congressional appropriations report language.", "BLM, FWS, and FS project approvals generally occur at the local unit level.  The initial project suggestions are typically generated by local unit staff  members who have identified a need that could be filled with fee revenues.  In BLM and FWS units, it is generally a field office or refuge manager that  approves proposed projects. For example, at BLM\u2019s Upper Colorado River  unit, ideas for fee projects are suggested, discussed, and agreed upon by  unit staff members and the field office Manager has final approval on all  recreation fee projects.  This was also the case at FWS\u2019s Back Bay National  Wildlife Refuge, where unit staff members suggest and jointly prioritize fee  projects, while the refuge Manager has final approval. Similarly, the FS  Manager of a ranger district may decide on projects or, in some cases, the  projects are reviewed at a higher level\u2014by the Forest Supervisor or  regional office. At some FS units, a fee board reviews and approves  proposed projects. For example, at the Shasta-Trinity National Recreation  Area within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California, any employee  may propose a fee project, which must be presented to the Recreation  Area\u2019s fee board for approval.", "Suggestions for projects within NPS are also typically generated by local  unit staff, except this is only the first of several steps in an often time- consuming NPS project approval process. NPS project requests are entered  into the Project Management Information System (PMIS) by unit staff in  advance of regional and NPS headquarters\u2014the Washington Office  (WASO)\u2014project call due dates for prioritization by the park management  team, with approval at the park level. After the units submit their project  proposals, the regional official(s) review the project proposals/requests  and generally either approve the proposals or mark them for edits.  According to one regional official, a regional reviewer may occasionally  reject a proposal if the project does not comply with established criteria or  if the requesting unit did not meet their deferred maintenance goal;  however, most projects are forwarded to WASO for approval. In  commenting on a draft of this report, NPS headquarters informed us that  on average, a Fee Demo project remains at the region or park level for 3  years as the data and information are edited and updated. Those projects  that do not have accurate and complete data in PMIS are delayed in the  approval process at all levels.", "The project approval process at WASO was put in place by DOI and NPS to  improve accountability. This process is managed by the NPS Headquarters  Park Facilities Management Division to provide review for consistency to  established policies. According to a Facility Management Specialist within  this division, project approval depends on the dollar amount of the project  because NPS\u2019 Development Advisory Board, DOI, Congress, and the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) all approve projects over certain dollar  amounts. For example, the agency\u2019s Development Advisory Board reviews  and approves all projects over $500,000, and Congress approves projects  over $500,000 and all projects over $100,000 if the money comes from the  central fund. Meanwhile, DOI reviews all projects over $100,000, and  regional and national projects are approved at the national level. The  complexity of the approval process has required parks and regions to be  proactive in getting projects into the process early. However, according to  NPS officials, it can sometimes take 1 year or more to obtain approval to  fund a project under this process. Many agency officials at the unit and  regional levels expressed frustration about the length of time it takes to  obtain approval for funding NPS projects, and some noted that the  approval process has delayed project implementation and/or has  contributed to units having unobligated fee revenue balances. For example,  one park unit official noted in the survey that the lengthy approval process  jeopardizes projects, especially partnership projects that may be time  sensitive. However, others noted that the approval process can be  expedited in emergency situations to enable project approval within a  couple of months.", "According to some unit officials, part of the reason WASO approvals take  so long is that parks\u2019 priorities for fee revenue projects do not always  match WASO priorities and, as a result, WASO may question a project\u2019s  appropriateness and delay or deny its approval, even if it is consistent with  projects allowed by law or under NPS policy. In addition, while WASO  officials sometimes contact regional officials to question or offer  suggestions on a project that has not yet been approved, WASO will, in  other cases, allow projects to remain in the system indefinitely without  approval or disapproval, according to another agency official. NPS  headquarters officials explained that the lack of accurate and complete  data in PMIS is the primary reason for projects remaining in the system  indefinitely and pointed to mistakes by the units and regions as the cause of  this problem.", "According to a Facility Management Specialist, the agency is implementing  a comprehensive plan approach under REA, which should help units and  regions to better manage their projects through an advance 5-year planning  process. According to this official, the Regional Directors can also approve  projects estimated to cost under $500,000, but she still retains the authority  to review these approved projects and related project data to ensure that  projects funded are consistent with REA and to assure accountability. NPS  headquarters officials stated that the 5-year plan of projects, which was  first instituted in fiscal year 2003, requires parks to be strategic and  proactive in submitting projects for approval, and to identify their  sequential needs for compliance, design and planning prior to project  execution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Fund a Variety of Maintenance, Operations, and Capital Improvement Projects with Fee Revenues", "paragraphs": ["Recreational fee revenues are used by the agencies to fund a variety of  maintenance, operations, visitor services, and some capital improvement  projects. The specific types of activities or projects funded with these fees  vary by agency. For example, in fiscal year 2005, NPS spent the majority of  fees they collected under REA on various types of maintenance work,  mostly focusing on deferred maintenance. Meanwhile, FS units spent about  40 percent of the fees collected under REA on maintenance, which  included deferred maintenance, annual maintenance, and capital  improvements. For example, recreation fee revenues at the Sequoia  National Forest in California funded capital improvements including a new  restroom (see fig. 3), paving of a parking lot, and the installation of trash  receptacles, picnic tables, and grills at the Big Meadows Winter Trailhead,  which is heavily used by snowmobile riders and skiers in the winter.  While  BLM and FWS also funded some maintenance work, they spent a large  portion of their revenues on visitor services. BLM spent about 33 percent of  their fee revenues on visitor services, such as increased seasonal staff to  complete trail work and other projects and to help monitor and teach river  safety along the Merced River. FWS also focused a lot of their resources on  providing/enhancing visitor services, almost 44 percent of the total fees  they collected under REA. For example, at Chincoteague National Wildlife  Refuge in Virginia and Maryland, REA fee revenues have funded visitor  services such as the design, development, and installation of interpretive  exhibits along four separate trails.", "Some units are quite creative with their use of recreation fee revenues to  fund fee projects. For example, agency officials at the Shasta-Trinity  National Forest in northern California use recreation fee revenues to  purchase materials to make \u201cpack-out bags\u201d that are given to mountain  climbers to facilitate the removal of human waste from Mount Shasta. The  bags help with resource protection since climbers are able to remove their  waste using the bags rather than leaving it on the mountain, as was done  prior to the inception of the program. Also at the Shasta-Trinity National  Forest, recreation fees funded the lake directional signage on Shasta and  Trinity Lakes pictured in figure 4. The lakes are quite large\u2014Shasta Lake  has about 420 miles of shoreline\u2014so the signs improve visitor services by  helping direct boaters to various locations on the lakes. At Rocky Mountain  National Park in Colorado, recreation fee revenues have been used to fund  campsite improvements, including new tent pads, fire rings, and picnic  tables, as can be seen in figure 5. These improvements enhanced visitor  services by improving the level of amenities while also protecting natural  resources by containing visitor impacts.", "Recreation fee revenues at NPS\u2019s Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in  northern California were used to construct the universally accessible  fishing piers pictured in figure 6, which have improved visitor services and  are heavily used, according to the park Superintendent. Many units within  various agencies have used recreation fee revenues to purchase and install  improved restroom facilities, such as the one pictured earlier in figure 3 at  Sequoia National Forest. Such restrooms improve visitor services while  also enhancing resource protection, according to Sequoia\u2019s Assistant  Recreation Fee Coordinator.", "Many units, especially within BLM and FS, use fee revenue for daily site  maintenance and operations and, while these activities may not be as  visible as capital improvement projects such as new restrooms, officials  noted they still provide valuable services to visitors. For example, at  Desolation Canyon in Utah, which is managed by BLM\u2019s Price Field Office,  the main source of recreation fee revenue is rafting permits. The revenues  are then primarily used to fund ranger staff who fulfill multiple roles  including inspecting rafters\u2019 equipment and permits, patrolling the waters,  providing interpretive information to rafters, and maintaining the launch  and take-out sites along the Green River. Another example of a unit that  funds operations and maintenance activities with fee revenues is  Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia, where recreation fees fund  restroom maintenance, including toilet pumping and supplies. At most  units, a portion of fee revenues are also used to cover other operations,  such as the cost of collecting fees.", "Finally, some units use recreation fee revenues to leverage funds received  from other sources, such as grants or donations. For example, the Klamath  Falls National Wildlife Refuge Complex on the California-Oregon border  worked with a birding group to construct the universally accessible photo  blind pictured in figure 7. The birding group provided funds to construct  the handicapped accessible pathway leading to the blind, while FWS  leveled the ground for the pathway and purchased materials to construct  the photo blind with fee revenues. Another example is NPS\u2019s Antietam  National Battlefield, where recreation fee revenues were leveraged with  other funds to restore a 106-year old monument located at the unit, see  figure 8. The total cost of the project was $300,000\u2014the unit\u2019s largest fee  project to date\u2014with $255,000 of the project cost funded by recreation fee  revenues and the remaining $45,000 leveraged from other sources,  including a $31,000 donation from the state of Maryland, funds from the  \u201cAdopt-a-Monument Program,\u201d and donations from a local newspaper.  Recreation fees have been used to leverage grant funding at BLM\u2019s  Gunnison Field Office in Colorado, which received about $100,000 in grants  in 2006.

The projects and activities  funded with central or regional funds vary by agency and, in some cases, by  region, but generally the central and regional funds are distributed among  the units based on project proposals or are used to cover the administrative  costs of the recreation fee program. For example, FWS Region 2, which has  a 20 percent regional fund, uses a portion of its regional funds to cover  administrative charges and distributes the remaining funds to refuges  within the region based on submitted project proposals. Similarly, FS  Region 5 uses a large portion of its 5 percent regional fund to cover fee  program management costs, and special project expenditures, such as the  RRAC start-up costs, and distributes a portion of the regional funds back to  the units in the form of resource and internship grants.

Park officials said that  unobligated funds accumulated in the early years of the Fee Demo  program when obligations were lower relative to collections.  Obligations have now increased as major projects have passed the  planning and design phase. Another factor in the amount of obligations  for projects funded with recreation fees was that the same Yosemite  staff concurrently managed the 1997 flood recovery work funded by an  appropriation. The flood recovery work occupied the same Project  Managers that manage recreation fee funded projects thereby reducing  the amount of work and obligations under that program.

Park staff reported plans to use the unobligated  balance primarily for an alternative transportation system for park  visitors, involving parking area and road construction, and upgrading  the current shuttle bus system.

In addition, we are providing  information on how recreation fees vary by type, amount, and level of  amenities offered at units with similar recreational opportunities across  and within agencies participating in REA.", "To address the objectives, we obtained and reviewed applicable laws;  regulations; agencywide policies and procedures; regional policies and  procedures; and the fees collected at selected units under the Fee  Demonstration Program and REA in order to determine what changes have  resulted since the implementation of REA. We developed and administered  a nationwide survey to agency officials responsible for fee programs under  REA. We supplemented the survey information with records reviews,  analyses of documents, and testimonial evidence gathered during unit  visits and in meetings with state, regional, and headquarters officials.", "To obtain information on all of our objectives related to the implementation  of REA, the collection and expenditure of recreation fee revenues, we  designed and administered a national survey of units collecting these fees.   We worked to develop the survey instrument with social science survey  specialists to administer to staff at National Park Service (NPS) units,  Forest Service (FS) ranger districts, Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  field offices, and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) refuges. Because this was  not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors. However, the practical  difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly  referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a  particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are  available to respondents, or how the data are entered into a database can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in the  development of the surveys, the data collection, and data analysis to  minimize these nonsampling errors. For example, prior to administering  the survey, we pretested the content and format of the surveys with several  site officials at each agency to determine whether (1) the survey questions  were clear, (2) the terms used were precise, (3) respondents were able to  provide the information we were seeking, and (4) the questions were  unbiased. In addition, we provided a draft of the survey to the national fee  program coordinators at the four agencies and met with them to obtain  comments and corrections to the wording and structure of the questions in  the survey. We made changes to the content and format of the final  questions based on pretest results. We verified some financial information  from a random sample of 25 non-FS units by asking these respondents to  check their answers originally provided to four questions and verify the  reported dollar amounts or provide corrections.  Our analysis showed that  a significant number of units reported they had made errors in providing  the original survey data; however, total dollars reported after correction did  not differ significantly from the dollars reported originally. The revised sum  of the total fees collected differed from the original by less than plus or  minus 2 percent and for unobligated balances, less than plus or minus 4  percent. We also checked a sample of cases to ensure the accuracy of data  entry and made corrections as needed. We performed computer analyses to  identify inconsistencies in responses and other indications of error. We  contacted survey respondents, as needed, to correct errors and verify  responses. In addition, a second independent analyst verified that the  computer programs used to analyze the data were written correctly. It is  our opinion that the data we present is valid and reliable for the purposes  of this report.", "To identify the current fee-collecting units to complete the survey, we  asked the national fee program coordinators at NPS, FS, BLM, and FWS to  provide a full list of these units including phone numbers and e-mail  addresses. The survey was designed to be distributed as a locked MS Word  document attached to a transmittal e-mail, allowing the document to be  saved on unit computers, altered with answers, and returned via  attachment to e-mail messages. Respondents were instructed to complete  one survey per unit to reflect all recreation fee activities managed as a  single unit. Based on phone calls from respondents and returned surveys,  we determined some surveys included responses for more than one unit on  the list provided by the agency. In other cases, surveys were returned for  units that were not on the list. In either case, we contacted the unit to  determine the status of the unit. If we found that the management of a fee  program extended across the boundaries of more than one unit, and its fee  collection and spending were combined, with funds commingled and  project priorities jointly determined, then we accepted a single survey for  more than one unit. Because some units were combined, and because  others indicated that they were not collecting fees, contrary to the lists  provided by agency headquarters, the number of units in the universe for  this survey declined. Table 10 provides the estimated response rates by  agency and overall.", "The number of units identified, 904, reflects the total number of units  remaining in the universe after adjustments, when units reported that they  had been administratively merged with another unit or, in a few cases,  when they were not included on the list provided by the agencies.  The  units identified by the agencies included units that indicated that they did  not collect fees under REA. These respondents were not intended to have  been included in the universe and, therefore, were dropped from the  analysis of responses. Once the surveys were received, logged in, and  printed, they were checked for completeness and logic, and the responses  were then coded into a database for summarization and analysis.", "To assess the accounting and control procedures in place at various fee- collecting units, we conducted unit visits to a sample of unit locations  where we collected documents, observed accounting and control practices,  and interviewed staff. Information that we gathered during our site visits  and during our interviews represents only the conditions present in the  units at the time of our review. We cannot comment on any changes that  may have occurred after our fieldwork was completed. Furthermore, our  fieldwork focused on in-depth analysis of only a few selected units. Based  on our interviews, we cannot generalize our findings beyond the units and  officials we contacted.", "As of 2005, four of the five agencies were actually collecting recreation fees  under REA\u2014the same four that had previously been authorized to collect  fees under the Fee Demo program. The amounts of recreation fee  collections varied substantially among the four agencies. For example,  NPS\u2019s top fee-collecting unit, Grand Canyon National Park, collected  $15,773,239 in Fee Demo revenue in fiscal year 2003, while FWS\u2019s top fee- collecting unit, Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, collected $658,497  in the same fiscal year, and there were only seven units within the entire  FWS agency that collected over $100,000 in recreation fee revenue.  Therefore, in order to ensure that we visited fee units of varying sizes  within each of the four agencies, we created different small, medium, and  large fee categories for each agency. These categories were identified by  sorting the fee-collecting units within each agency from highest to lowest in  fee revenue for fiscal year 2003. After sorting the data by fee revenue, we  analyzed the data to see where natural breaks for small, medium, and large  units fell, in order to determine the categories for each agency. The  resulting categories are shown in table 11.", "Our original plan was to visit at least three large units, two medium units,  and one small unit within each agency. In addition, to address  congressional concerns about large unobligated carryover balances, we  planned to visit at least two more units with very large carryover balances.  We also recognized the importance of visiting units in several different  geographic areas to document possible differences in the implementation  of the fee programs within different states or regions. We completed this  original methodological plan with one exception; we only visited two large  FWS units. However, given the relatively small size of even the largest of  FWS\u2019 fee-collecting units, we believe that our review had already  sufficiently covered their program.

We stand by our description of NPS\u2019 efforts to update its guidance on  accounting and controlling collected fee revenues as \u201cslow.\u201d  NPS\u2019  current guidance on this subject was last published in 1989, which it  recognizes as needing to be revised. In addition, the NPS\u2019 statement  that our report language indicates \u201cNPS does have effective internal  controls in place,\u201d is incorrect. We specifically state that NPS units we  visited, which are only 8 of 390, appear to have implemented  reasonable accounting procedures and effective internal controls.  Thus, we cannot attribute this condition to the entire universe of NPS  units. 3. BLM provided additional detail on the results of their inquiries to units  that responded to our survey that they did not offer all six amenities  required to charge standard amenity fees under REA. We have  summarized this information on pages 27 and 28 of the report. In  essence, BLM officials imply from the results of their inquiries that their  units did offer all six amenities required under REA. This new  information would have to be verified to attest to its accuracy. 4. We agree that \u201cslow\u201d is a relative term but believe that it is used  appropriately in the context of the information presented in the  paragraph pertaining to the development of the RRACs. The  information in the paragraph notes that, according to a June 2005  interagency presentation, the RRACs were expected to be established  with members appointed by the end of 2005. Since none of the  members for any of the RRACs have been appointed, we feel  comfortable in referring to this RRAC development as \u201cslow.\u201d 5. One of REA\u2019s goals was to reduce visitor confusion. We believe that  Reclamation\u2019s approach to allowing each managing partner to make its  own determination of  how REA impacts each unit, to include the  decision of  whether or not to accept the new pass, will create an  inconsistent and more confusing system of fees for the visitors. 6. We disagree with DOI\u2019s contention that evaluating the validity and  interpreting the responses of units to our survey is problematic, since  we have simply reported the survey results. The results we reported are  based on two opinion survey questions that we asked both FS and DOI  field-level officials to respond to. The first question asked if the unit  officials believed recreation fee revenues are being used to fund the  types of projects formerly funded with appropriations at their unit. The  second question sought the officials\u2019 opinions about the extent to  which they believe that recreation fee revenue will be used to fund the  types of projects over the next 5 years at their units that would have  been funded with appropriated dollars. We recognize that individual  units do not have agencywide perspectives on these issues. Also,  including these survey results in our report is not intended to forecast  the future, but rather to share the perspective of the survey  respondents responsible for the on-the-ground implementation of this  program. No GAO conclusions or recommendations were based on  these stated perceptions. 7. The concerns noted in the background are general concerns that are  frequently cited by critics of the fee program. Implementing both Fee  Demo and the recreation fee program under REA has been  controversial and many people and groups, such as the Western Slope  No-Fee Coalition and the Arizona No-Fee Coalition, have spoken out  against recreation fees. 8. Same as comment 4. 9. Since the working group has not determined a formula and how pass  use or other factors will be considered in such a formula, it is still not  clear how revenues will be distributed beyond the first 3 to 5 years of  the pass program. Therefore, the long-term revenue distribution  strategy is unclear. The potential problems with collecting pass use  data are outlined in this report. Accurate pass-use data will be difficult  to collect at remote locations and many units within the agencies do  not have the infrastructure in place to collect pass-use data. This may  lead units to have inaccurate pass-use data or data largely based on  estimates. Since pass use revenue distribution will be tied to the pass-  use data, units and/or agencies may benefit from submitting inflated  pass-use estimates. All of these issues are potential problems with the  collection of pass-use data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Forest Service", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  Forest Service letter dated September 7, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

The GAO survey was sent to 467 FS Ranger District officials directly  responsible for implementation of the fee program, under REA. The  results we reported are based on two opinion survey questions that we  asked both FS and DOI field-level officials to respond to. The first  question asked if the unit officials believed recreation fee revenues are  being used to fund the types of projects formerly funded with  appropriations at their unit.

In addition,  we have added the FS statement that, historically, fee revenues have  not replaced appropriations, and there is no reason to expect this to  change in the future in order to also share the agency\u2019s official  perspective on this issue. 3.

We recognize that the FS interim implementation guidelines for REA  have definitions of the standard amenities; however, these guidelines  have not prevented confusion about amenity criteria. In their  comments on a draft of this report (bottom of page 104), the FS  contends 31 of their unit officials erroneously reported they were out of  compliance with REA\u2019s standard amenity requirements because they  were either confused over the difference between standard and  expanded amenities, or, because \u201cthere was misunderstanding over the  definitions of the amenities.\u201d  Such results further highlight the need for  more specific FS guidance on implementing and managing the fee  program.  5. We believe that for department-level management to have assurance  that collected fees are controlled effectively and accounted for  properly, detailed department- or bureau-level guidance on procedures  are an important tool for local managers and imperative for those who  have little or no formal accounting training or background."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Roy Judy, Assistant Director;  Carolyn Boyce; Elizabeth Curda; John Delicath; Denise Fantone; Doreen  Feldman; Timothy Guinane; Anne Hobson; Susan Irving; Stanley Kostyla;  Diane Lund; Robert Martin; Matt Michaels; Angie Nichols-Friedman; Lesley  Rinner; John Scott; Jack Warner; and Amy Webbink made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
