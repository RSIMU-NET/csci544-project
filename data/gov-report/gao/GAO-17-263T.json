Historically, these investments have frequently failed, incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages, or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Accordingly, in December 2014, IT reform legislation was enacted, aimed at improving agencies' acquisitions of IT. Further, in February 2015, GAO added improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to its high-risk list. Between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations related to this high-risk area to OMB and agencies.", "This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations.

In an effort to reduce the growing number of data centers, OMB launched a consolidation initiative in 2010. GAO reported in March 2016 that agencies had closed 3,125 of the 10,584 total data centers and achieved $2.8 billion in cost savings and avoidances through fiscal year 2015. Agencies are planning a total of about $8.2 billion in savings and avoidances through fiscal year 2019. GAO recommended that the agencies take actions to meet their cost savings targets and improve optimization progress related to their data center consolidation and optimization efforts. Most agencies agreed with the recommendations or had no comment.", "Enhancing transparency. OMB's IT Dashboard provides detailed information on major investments at federal agencies, including ratings from Chief Information Officers (CIO) that should reflect the level of risk facing an investment. GAO reported in June 2016 that agencies had not fully considered risks when rating their major investments on the IT Dashboard. In particular, of the 95 investments reviewed, GAO's assessments of risks matched the CIO ratings 22 times, showed more risk 60 times, and showed less risk 13 times. Several issues contributed to these differences, such as CIO ratings not being updated frequently. GAO recommended that agencies improve the quality and frequency of their ratings. Most agencies generally agreed with or did not comment on the recommendations.", "Implementing incremental development. A key reform initiated by OMB has emphasized the need for federal agencies to deliver investments in smaller parts, or increments, in order to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. Since 2012, OMB has required investments to deliver functionality every 6 months. In August 2016, GAO reported that 22 agencies had reported that 64 percent of 469 active software development projects planned to deliver usable functionality every 6 months for fiscal year 2016. Further, for 7 selected agencies, GAO identified significant differences in the percentages of software projects reported to GAO as delivering functionality every 6 months, compared to what was reported on the IT Dashboard. This was due to, among other things, inconsistencies in agencies' reporting on non-software development projects, and the timing of reporting data. GAO made 12 recommendations to 7 agencies and OMB to improve the reporting of incremental data on the IT Dashboard and the policies for CIO certification of adequate incremental development. Most agencies agreed or did not comment on our recommendations, and OMB did not agree or disagree."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has previously made numerous recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to improve the oversight and execution of the data center consolidation initiative, the accuracy and reliability of the IT Dashboard, and incremental development policies.

In particular, the federal government has spent  billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments, which  often suffered from ineffective management.

Subsequently, FITARA codified a  requirement that agency CIOs certify that IT investments are adequately  implementing OMB\u2019s incremental development guidance.", "In May 2014, we reported that 66 of 89 selected investments at five  major agencies did not plan to deliver capabilities in 6-month cycles,  and less than half of these investments planned to deliver functionality in  12-month cycles. We also reported that only one of the five agencies had  complete incremental development policies. Accordingly, we  recommended that OMB develop and issue clearer guidance on  incremental development and that the selected agencies update and  implement their associated policies. Four of the six agencies agreed with  our recommendations or had no comments; the remaining two agencies  partially agreed or disagreed with the recommendations.", "More recently, in August 2016, we reported that agencies had not fully  implemented incremental development practices for their software  development projects.

Regarding the remaining 169  projects (or 36 percent) that were reported as not planning to deliver  functionality every 6 months, agencies provided a variety of explanations  for not achieving that goal. These included project complexity, the lack of  an established project release schedule, or that the project was not a  software development project.

However, significant differences existed between the delivery  rates that the agencies reported to us and what they reported on the IT  Dashboard. For example, in four cases (Commerce, Education, HHS, and  Treasury), the percentage of delivery reported to us was at least 10  percentage points lower than what was reported on the IT Dashboard.  These differences were due to (1) our identification of fewer software  development projects than agencies reported on the IT Dashboard and  (2) the fact that information reported to us was generally more current  than the information reported on the IT Dashboard. Figure 4 compares  the software development projects\u2019 percentage of planned delivery every  6 months reported on the IT Dashboard and to us.", "We concluded that by not having on the IT Dashboard up-to-date  information about whether the project is a software development project  and the extent to which projects are delivering functionality, these seven  agencies were at risk that OMB and key stakeholders may make  decisions regarding the agencies\u2019 investments without the most current  and accurate information.", "Finally, while OMB has issued guidance requiring agency CIOs to certify  that each major IT investment\u2019s plan for the current year adequately  implements incremental development, only three agencies (the  Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Transportation) had  defined processes and policies intended to ensure that the department  CIO certifies that major IT investments are adequately implementing  incremental development. Officials from three other agencies (the  Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and the  Treasury) reported that they were in the process of updating their existing  incremental development policy to address certification, while the  Department of Defense\u2019s policies that address incremental development  did not include information on CIO certification. We concluded that until all  of the agencies we reviewed define processes and policies for the  certification of the adequate use of incremental development, they will not  be able to fully ensure adequate implementation of, or benefit from,  incremental development practices, as required by FITARA.", "To improve the reporting of incremental data on the IT Dashboard and  policies for CIO certification of adequate incremental development, we  made 12 recommendations to seven agencies and OMB. Five agencies  agreed with our recommendations. In addition, the Department of  Defense partially agreed with one recommendation and disagreed with  another, OMB did not agree or disagree, and the Department of the  Treasury did not comment on the recommendations.", "In summary, with the enactment of FITARA, the federal government has  an opportunity to improve the transparency and management of IT  acquisitions and operations, and to strengthen the authority of CIOs to  provide needed direction and oversight. To their credit, agencies have  taken steps to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations  by implementing key FITARA initiatives, including data center  consolidation, efforts to increase transparency via OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard,  and incremental development; and they have continued to address  recommendations we have made over the past several years. However,  additional improvements are needed, and further efforts by OMB and  federal agencies to implement our previous recommendations would  better position them to fully implement FITARA. To help ensure that these  efforts succeed, continued congressional oversight of OMB\u2019s and  agencies\u2019 implementation of FITARA is essential.
