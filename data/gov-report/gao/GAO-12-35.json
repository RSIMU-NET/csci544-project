The United States has provided over $18 million to support this process to date. GAO was asked to (1) describe any involvement that U.S. officials have had in Kenya's constitutional reform process relating to abortion; (2) describe any support that U.S.-funded award recipients and subrecipients have provided in Kenya's constitutional reform process relating to abortion; and (3) assess the extent to which agencies have developed and implemented guidance on compliance with the Siljander Amendment, which prohibits using certain assistance funds to lobby either for or against abortion. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of State (State), award recipients and subrecipients, and the Kenyan government, and conducted an extensive media search."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between 2008 and 2010, U.S. officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, publicly expressed support for Kenya's constitutional reform process. GAO found no indication that U.S. officials opined on the issue of abortion publicly or attempted to influence the abortion-related provisions of the draft constitution--a finding corroborated by a key Kenyan parliamentarian who served on the committee assisting in the constitutional reform process. U.S.-funded award recipients and their subrecipients supported the constitutional reform process through activities that included civic education and technical assistance, both of which addressed the issue of abortion to some extent. USAID-funded civic education sought to inform Kenyans on the text of the draft constitution, and GAO found that some forums included discussion of abortion- related provisions. Some subrecipients undertook interpretation of the provisions at their forums, including describing scenarios in which abortion might be allowed. Several subrecipients explained to the public that, in their view, future legislation might be required to implement and further articulate the abortion- related provisions. While some subrecipients addressed the abortion-related provisions of the constitution, GAO found no indication that they cited the abortion provisions as a rationale to vote for or against the constitution. USAID also funded a technical assistance award to the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) to support the Committee of Experts (COE), the nongovernmental entity charged with drafting the constitution. In the course of providing comments and advice regarding the entire draft constitution, IDLO made suggestions relating to the issues of fetal rights and abortion during the early stages of drafting. IDLO later commented on broadening the exceptions when abortion would be legal. The COE has indicated that it generally considered IDLO's advice when revising the draft constitution. The final draft of the constitution is consistent with some of IDLO's advice relating to abortion, though GAO could not determine whether the COE made these changes in direct response to IDLO's advice. Neither State nor USAID has clear guidance for compliance with the Siljander Amendment, which makes it difficult for some agency officials and award recipients to determine what types of activities are prohibited. State has not developed any guidance at all on the prohibition. USAID has offered training for its health and legal officers on compliance with family planning-related legislation, including the Siljander Amendment, for years and began offering some training to other officials in 2010. However, USAID's training and other family planning resources do not identify specific types of activities that are prohibited under the amendment. State and USAID attorneys indicated that they are available to provide advice to staff on a case-by-case basis, upon request. However, some State and USAID officials and award recipients GAO spoke to said that they were unclear as to what specific activities were prohibited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State and USAID develop specific guidance on compliance with the Siljander Amendment, indicating what kinds of activities may be prohibited, disseminate this guidance throughout their agencies, and make it available to award recipients and subrecipients.

The  team\u2019s written materials distributed to staff do not provide any  description of the types of activities that Siljander prohibits.  \uf0b7  Family planning compliance training. USAID has offered compliance  training for its health and legal officers on family planning-related  legislation for years, according to USAID officials. In addition to  routine training both in Washington and in the field, USAID has  offered a computer-based course on family planning requirements  since 2006. USAID officials told us they expect health officers to take  the computer-based course or attend a live training session on the  family planning legislative requirements annually. None of the training  materials, however, describes the kinds of activities that might  constitute lobbying under the Siljander Amendment. After the USAID  IG inquiry in 2010, USAID began to incorporate the Kenyan  constitutional reform example as an oral case study in some of its  trainings to alert staff that activities without a family planning focus  could be subject to the Siljander Amendment.  \uf0b7  Global Health intranet resources. USAID\u2019s internal Global Health  website offers a variety of family planning compliance tools, such as a  chart of all family planning-related legislation, key documents related  to family planning requirements, and a compliance plan template. In  general, any mention of the Siljander Amendment within these  resources does little more than repeat the amendment\u2019s text. The  compliance plan template warns staff that non-family planning  programs could violate family planning-related legislation, but none of  the materials on the intranet describes the types of activities that  might be prohibited under Siljander.", "USAID began disseminating these compliance resources beyond health  and legal officials in mid-2010, when it offered some training and general  written guidance to other agency officials. A member of the family  planning compliance team gave a presentation on abortion-related  requirements at the annual DCHA conference for democracy and  governance officers in June of both 2010 and 2011. Additionally, DCHA  officials sent e-mails to all DCHA staff in late July 2010 and in March  2011, alerting them to the existence of the Siljander Amendment and  advising them to seek legal counsel if they are unsure whether a  particular activity complies with the law. Neither e-mail, however, details  the types of activities that might constitute lobbying for or against  abortion. USAID officials acknowledged in the e-mails that determining  whether a particular activity complies with the Siljander Amendment is  complex, and officials later told us that they did not add more detailed  descriptions of the types of activities that might violate the amendment,  because they do not want staff to undertake their own legal analysis.", "USAID award recipients have access to some of USAID\u2019s family planning  compliance resources, including the computer-based training, but these  resources do not include examples of the types of activities prohibited  under the Siljander Amendment. Two award recipients told us that USAID  discussed the Siljander Amendment with them in June 2010\u2014after the  USAID IG inquiry had begun. One award recipient, who managed more  than half of the subrecipients, told us it in turn reminded its subrecipients  to be objective and remain neutral when discussing the proposed  constitution in civic education forums. USAID also requires its award  recipients and their subrecipients to abide by the Siljander Amendment  through the inclusion of mandatory language prohibiting abortion-related  activities in all awards. The language reads in part, \u201cNo funds made  available under the award will be used to finance, support, or be  attributed to . . . lobbying for or against abortion.\u201d The language, however,  does not specify what types of activities would constitute lobbying with  U.S. assistance funds and would thus be prohibited. USAID officials told  us this is consistent with other mandatory prohibition language in USAID  awards. Furthermore, we found that the mandatory language prohibiting  abortion-related activities was missing from some of the awards for  Kenyan constitutional reform.

For example, the State  political officer responsible for tracking the progress of the Kenyan  constitutional reform process in 2010 told us that when he asked for  guidance on the Siljander Amendment, officials in the Office of the Legal  Adviser replied that they would not interpret it for him. As a result, he said  he still did not know what activities would violate the legislative  prohibition. An attorney in the Office of the Legal Adviser told us that the  office\u2019s consistent approach is to work with nonlegal State officials to  determine what activities are proposed and to advise whether those  activities are allowable. She said that with respect to legislative  restrictions on the use of funding, the specific facts are often key, and  abstract legal interpretations can be misapplied. Thus, she said the office  advises nonlegal State officials on how to apply the law based upon  specific facts as to how funds would be used for particular U.S.-funded  activities. However, all of the State officials we interviewed in Nairobi said  that guidance on what lobbying means in the context of the Siljander  Amendment would be useful to help them avoid any potential violation of  the amendment in other situations. In addition, DCHA officials we  interviewed in Kenya told us that even after the USAID IG inquiry they do  not know what types of activities constitute lobbying and therefore would  be a violation of the Siljander Amendment. Moreover, the two award  recipients who together have overseen over 70 percent of the  subrecipients for the constitutional reform process told us they do not  understand the Siljander Amendment and that clearer guidance on what  constitutes lobbying under the amendment would be useful."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The United States has long determined that it is vitally important to  support nations in undertaking democratic reforms, such as Kenya\u2019s  constitutional reform. With the current political upheavals in parts of the  Middle East and Africa, it is likely that several nations will either establish  new constitutions or revise existing ones in the near future. The U.S.  government has already expressed its willingness to assist with these and  other kinds of democratic reforms. State\u2019s political officers and USAID\u2019s  DCHA officers would be at the forefront of that assistance. However,  constitutional reform can involve a wide spectrum of issues, including  abortion and its corresponding U.S. legal restrictions, which are unfamiliar  to some U.S. officials who deal with democracy and governance issues.  Without clear guidance, including a description of what activities would  constitute lobbying overseas, U.S. officials and implementing partners\u2014 award recipients and subrecipients\u2014risk becoming involved in activities  that may be interpreted by some as lobbying for or against abortion.

Specifically, State  agreed that informing employees throughout the department of the  Siljander Amendment would be useful. State implied, however, that such  information would not go beyond providing the text of the Siljander  Amendment and encouraging staff to seek appropriate guidance on  whether proposed activities are subject to the amendment. State does not  believe that developing and disseminating specific guidance indicating the  types of activities that may be prohibited is appropriate. We disagree.  While we respect that State would like its officials in the field to seek  guidance on whether an activity is permitted under the Siljander  Amendment by presenting specific facts on a case-by-case basis, we do  not believe that officials will necessarily know to seek such guidance if  they are unaware of the types of activities that may raise compliance  concerns. We believe that guidance providing examples of the types of  activities that may violate the Siljander Amendment would help officials in  the field better understand how the amendment affects their activities  overseas and would help them better recognize those instances when  they should seek guidance from the relevant State policy or legal office  regarding a proposed activity.", "USAID agreed with our recommendation and indicated that it would  develop additional guidance for USAID and award recipient and  subrecipient staff on the Siljander Amendment. At the same time, USAID  took issue with our graphic representation of the development of the Right  to Life article (fig. 1 on p. 13), expressing the view that it dramatically  overstated the importance of IDLO\u2019s comments in the evolution of that  article. In particular, USAID noted that the figure did not reflect the advice  and comments COE received from other sources, and that it suggested a  causal link between IDLO\u2019s comments and revisions to the draft  constitution. We have revised the title of the figure to more clearly indicate  that it focuses on IDLO\u2019s advice and comments to the COE. This does not  mean that IDLO was the only entity providing advice. In fact, we state in  the text immediately preceding the figure that others also provided advice  and comments on the Right to Life article.

Specifically, we reviewed the reports for key findings  and statements. We also spoke to the IG teams that produced the  reports in order to identify key officials to interview and to clarify each  team\u2019s methodologies.  \uf0b7  We conducted an extensive review of Kenyan, international, and U.S.  media to identify any public statements made by key State, USAID,  and other Administration officials that mentioned the constitutional  reform process, abortion, or reproductive health. Our review used the  Nexis research database, which searched Kenyan media sources  including Kenya Broadcast Corporation, The Nairobi Star, The Nation,  The People, and The Standard and international and U.S. sources  including Africa News, Associated Press, BBC, Federal News Service,  Global Legal Monitor, Los Angeles Times, States News Service, The  East African, The Monitor (Uganda),The Washington Times, and  Xinhua. Search terms included any combination of the official\u2019s full  name, \u201cKenya,\u201d \u201cconstitution,\u201d \u201cabortion,\u201d \u201creproductive,\u201d and  \u201ctermination of pregnancy.\u201d For most officials, this search covered the  period from May 23, 2008\u2014the date that the Kenyan government  signed the Reform Agenda\u2014through late March 2011. However, the  number of results for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and  Secretary of State Clinton exceeded the number of results that Nexis  can return. We therefore limited the searches for these officials to the  period from July 12, 2010\u2014the date that the USAID IG submitted its  preliminary report on support for Kenya\u2019s constitutional reform to the  requesters\u2014through late March 2011. We also searched the  Congressional Quarterly, Congressional Record, the transcripts  database of Lexis Nexis, and executive branch websites using similar  search terms for statements made by officials during the period from  January 2009 through January 2011. These results included  transcripts of congressional hearings, State Department press  releases, and coverage of diplomatic speeches and comments.  \uf0b7  We interviewed key State and USAID officials in Washington, DC, and  we traveled to Kenya to interview key officials at the embassy in  Nairobi to obtain additional data and to discuss their involvement in  the reform process, particularly as regards the issue of abortion. We  interviewed State officials including the former ambassador, the  Deputy Chief of Mission, the Political Counselor and other relevant  political officers, and officials from the Bureau of African Affairs and  the Office of the Legal Adviser. We also interviewed USAID officials  including the Deputy Mission Director and officials from the Offices of  the General Counsel and Acquisition and Assistance, and from the  Bureaus for Africa, Global Health, and Democracy, Conflict, and  Humanitarian Assistance, including the Offices of Transition Initiatives  and Democracy and Governance. These officials have been  responsible for managing and monitoring U.S. support for Kenya\u2019s  constitutional reform process. In addition, we requested an interview  with the chair of the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC), which  assisted Parliament in the constitutional reform process, but embassy  officials were unable to contact him. We did, however, interview  another key parliamentarian who sat on the PSC and is the vice-chair  of the Committee for the Implementation of the Constitution to discuss  U.S. officials\u2019 involvement in the reform process regarding the  abortion-related provisions of the constitution.", "To describe the support provided by U.S.-funded award recipients for the  constitutional reform process relating to the constitution\u2019s abortion-related  provisions, we conducted the following work.  \uf0b7  We asked the USAID IG and other USAID officials to identify the  USAID award recipients and subrecipients that have conducted  constitutional reform work in Kenya. The USAID IG provided us with a  list of award recipients and subrecipients who had received U.S.  funding through the date of the referendum, August 4, 2010. USAID  officials notified us of some new awards and subawards that began in  the implementation phase after the referendum, and award recipients  provided us with information about an additional implementation  award recipient as well as other implementation subawards. Together  these lists identified 9 award recipients, who together received 12  awards, and 124 subrecipients, who together received 182 smaller  awards.  \uf0b7  We reviewed the related USAID IG reports for key findings and data  on USAID award recipients. We also spoke to the IG team that  produced the reports in order to identify key officials to interview and  to clarify the team\u2019s methodology.  \uf0b7  We conducted an extensive review of Kenyan and international media  on all 9 USAID award recipients and their 124 subrecipients. This  media search sought to identify any statements that the award  recipients or subrecipients made mentioning the constitutional reform  process, abortion, or reproductive health. Like our media search for  relevant statements from U.S. officials, this search covered similar  Kenyan and international publications, used similar search terms, and  covered the period from May 23, 2008 through mid-February 2011 for  award recipients and subrecipients identified by the USAID IG.  However, for award recipients and subrecipients who started their  work after the USAID IG produced its report, the search covered the  same Kenyan and international publications, but we adjusted our  search terms to exclude the term \u201cconstitution\u201d since the constitution  had already been enacted and adjusted our search period to cover  the period for which these awards were effective.  \uf0b7  We obtained and reviewed all award documentation for each USAID  award recipient and subrecipient performing constitutional reform  work in Kenya. These documents included the base award and any  modifications, statements of work and project descriptions, progress  reports, final reports, and any supplementary materials produced  under the award.  \uf0b7  We interviewed relevant USAID officials in Washington, DC, and in  Kenya. These officials included the USAID Deputy Mission Director  and officials from the Offices of the General Counsel and Acquisition  and Assistance, and from the Bureaus for Africa, Global Health, and  Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, including the  Offices of Transition Initiatives and Democracy and Governance.  These officials have responsibility for managing USAID\u2019s awards and  for planning, implementing, and overseeing USAID\u2019s Kenyan  constitutional reform awards.  \uf0b7  We interviewed all 9 award recipients\u2014in Kenya if they still had an  office there, or in Washington, DC. In addition to using a standard set  of questions about award recipient activities and guidance received on  complying with the Siljander Amendment, we added specific interview  questions based on our media search results and document review.  \uf0b7  To identify which of the 124 subrecipients to interview during our  limited time in Kenya, we analyzed the results of our media search  and document review to determine which were most likely to have  addressed the issue of abortion during the period leading up to the  referendum. Our media search yielded more than 6,500 results, all of  which we reviewed in order to identify those subrecipients who had  publicly commented on abortion-related topics. These results  identified 13 subrecipients whose names had appeared in media  articles that also included at least one of our search terms. Our  document review identified 26 subrecipients whose award documents  mentioned having discussed abortion, \u201ccontentious issues,\u201d  reproductive health, or women\u2019s issues during the period leading up to  the referendum. Our document review also showed that of the 13  subrecipients identified through our media search, 6 subrecipients  used their USAID funds to conduct civic education on topics that were  unlikely to address abortion at all, such as land reform or  decentralization. We therefore determined that we should request  interviews with the remaining 7 subrecipients identified through our  media search, as their activities were likely to be most relevant to our  review. To come to this determination, one GAO analyst identified  those subrecipients whose activities were most likely to be relevant to  our review, and another GAO analyst independently reviewed them,  resolving any disagreements in the determinations through  discussion. We also determined that we should request interviews  with all 26 subrecipients identified through our document review in  order to clarify how they had addressed abortion during their U.S.- funded activities, if at all. Given some overlap between the 7  subrecipients identified through the media search and the 26 identified  through our document review, and 1 additional subrecipient we  identified based on professional judgment, we identified a total of 29  subrecipients for interview.  \uf0b7  We requested interviews with all 29 subrecipients in Kenya that we  had identified based on our media search and document review, and  we interviewed 24 of them. Of the remaining 5 subrecipients, 4  subrecipients could not meet with us because of scheduling conflicts.  The remaining subrecipient, the Committee of Experts, is now a  defunct entity and no former executive officers would meet with us or  answer written questions. During our subrecipient interviews, we used  a standard set of questions about activities and guidance received on  complying with the Siljander Amendment. In addition, we added  specific interview questions for individual subrecipients based on  issues that we identified through our media search results or  document review.", "To assess the extent to which agencies have developed and  implemented guidance to help ensure compliance with the Siljander  Amendment, which prohibits using certain U.S. assistance to lobby for or  against abortion, we conducted the following work:  \uf0b7  We reviewed USAID program and procurement guidance and  policies, as well as other relevant documents. This helped us  determine what guidance on the Siljander Amendment USAID has  available or requires for agency officials, award recipients, and  subrecipients.  \uf0b7  We obtained and analyzed award documentation for all USAID award  recipients performing constitutional reform work, as well as their  subrecipients, to determine which awards contained USAID\u2019s  mandatory language provision prohibiting abortion-related activities.  USAID considers this language to be a form of guidance on complying  with the Siljander Amendment and requires that all assistance and  acquisition awards contain the language. Award recipients, in turn, are  required to pass this language on to awards with any subrecipients.  To understand why this language was not included in some awards  for the Kenyan constitutional reform process, we conducted interviews  with responsible officials in USAID\u2019s Offices of the General Counsel  and Acquisition and Assistance, and the Bureau for Democracy,  Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, including the Offices of  Transition Initiatives and Democracy and Governance.  \uf0b7  We interviewed high-level State and USAID officials about their  agency\u2019s guidance on complying with the Siljander Amendment.

However, in each of  these 4 awards, the leader award or IDIQ contract was signed before the  abortion-related language requirement took effect and did not include the  language. The associate awards and task orders, therefore, did not  include the language either. The abortion-related language, however,  had not yet become a requirement when the two task orders themselves  were signed. As shown in figure 3, these two acquisition awards were not  modified when the abortion-related language requirement took effect.  USAID contracting officials we interviewed told us the omission of the  abortion-related language from the fifth award was likely due to human  oversight.", "The USAID contracting officials told us they added the mandatory  language to 4 of the awards as quickly as possible. They did so following  the USAID IG inquiry that brought the omission to their attention in mid- 2010, although in three of the four cases they did not add the language  until either the day before the August 4, 2010, referendum or afterward.  According to USAID officials, the delay in adding the language was due to  the nature of the contracting process. They told us USAID contracting  officials cannot modify awards without a requisition for modification from  the technical offices, including programmatic and financial officials.  Furthermore, the contracting officials at the Mission did not have copies of  all of the awards, particularly the IDIQ contracts, as those had been  signed in Washington. The officials told us it was time-consuming to  determine where the awards were located, whether they included the  mandatory language or not, and whether they could modify them at the  Mission or whether the contracting office in Washington had to do the  modifications. They received that information in an e-mail on July 28,  2010, 1 week before the referendum, and made the modifications shortly  thereafter.", "Officials from USAID\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) told us  that USAID\u2019s new web-based procurement information system  automatically includes mandatory provisions in awards, including the  language prohibiting abortion-related activities, although the system is not  foolproof. OAA officials in Washington told us that the Global Acquisition  and Assistance System (GLAAS) procurement information system  includes award templates with standard clauses for each type of award.  They said that GLAAS generates mandatory provisions, such as the  language on prohibiting abortion-related activities, based on the award  type chosen. They went on to say that GLAAS greatly reduces the  possibility of human error in including all mandatory provisions. The OAA  officials we spoke with at the Mission agreed with this assessment, but  they also emphasized that GLAAS is not foolproof. For example, they told  us that GLAAS does not yet capture all types of award mechanisms, nor  have all USAID staff begun using GLAAS. In addition, they said that while  GLAAS automatically includes new mandatory provisions, contracting  officials can copy language from a recently generated similar award and  then upload that language into GLAAS, bypassing the standard and  mandatory inclusions the system would otherwise make.

In the past year, the Agency has also taken steps to  increase awareness of these restrictions among non-health staff, particularly those working in the  area of democracy and governance.

The Right to Life article referred to in your report is  one article among hundreds in the document.  As with several other sections of the draft  constitution, this particular article generated significant discussion within and outside Kenya, and  many entities \u2013 from medical associations to religious groups \u2013 expressed public views on it  throughout the period leading up to the referendum.  As your report notes, however, there is no  indication that U.S. officials gave an opinion publicly on this issue or attempted to influence the  provision.

In 2009, the Kenyan Committee  of Experts (COE), a non-governmental entity charged with drafting the constitution by the  Kenyan government, requested that USAID provide funding to a specific public international  organization (PIO) for purposes of providing advice on the draft constitution.  At the COE\u2019s  request, USAID funded the PIO to provide such advice, and the PIO subsequently contracted  with a group of constitutional scholars who prepared several lengthy reports analyzing the draft  constitution, article by article.  The scholars\u2019 major recommendations related to issues such as  the authorities of the executive and legislative branches, election processes, a proposed ban on  ethnic minorities, and land tenure rights.  Although two of the scholars\u2019 reports included  comments relating to the provisions in the Right to Life article, they did not highlight these  points in particular or make them a focus of their key recommendations.  In fact, we believe that  the GAO\u2019s draft report dramatically overstates the importance of the scholars\u2019 comments on the  evolution of the Right to Life article.  As we noted above, many organizations in Kenya  expressed ardent views on this provision leading up to the referendum, and these opinions may  well have impacted the COE\u2019s decisions on text.  For example, the State Inspector General\u2019s  report on this issue, dated August 2010, found that the COE revised the text after consulting with  Kenyan medical professionals.  However, the chart set forth on page 13 of the draft report  implies that the only entities advising the COE on this issue were the scholars and the  Parliamentary Select Committee.  Indeed, the chart suggests a causal link when the draft report  itself does not find one, as you note that the GAO was \u201cunable to confirm whether the COE  changed the Right to Life article\u201d based on the scholars\u2019 advice.  We therefore request that the  GAO delete the chart in its entirety or indicate substantial input from other sources.", "In any event, we do not believe that the scholars\u2019 two references to the Right to Life article  constituted lobbying for or against abortion.  We considered several factors in arriving at this  conclusion.  First, the scholars were providing advice to the COE upon the COE\u2019s request.  They  did not reach out on their own initiative to express a view on abortion or any other issue related  to the constitution.  Second, the group did not single out the article for focus but rather  commented on it as part of its exhaustive article-by-article review of the draft.  Third, USAID  obtained a legal opinion from Kenyan counsel indicating that the Right to Life article in the draft  constitution would maintain the status quo on the country\u2019s existing abortion law and would not  represent a change.  Finally, the COE was a non-governmental entity, separate and distinct from  the Kenyan government.  In light of these factors, USAID has concluded that there is no  evidence of a violation of the Siljander Amendment in connection with the scholars\u2019 reports.", "Similarly, there is no evidence that any USAID-funded civic education activities violated the  Siljander Amendment.  As your report notes, USAID-funded civic education activities sought to  inform Kenyans on the general contents of the proposed constitution.  In the context of general  civic education, USAID-funded sub-recipients addressed questions from Kenyans on many  provisions of the constitution, including in some cases the Right to Life article.  They were not  lobbying on the issue but rather trying to ensure that citizens were familiar with the text in the  document.", "Recommendation:  To ensure the actions of U.S. officials and implementing partners comply  with the legislative prohibition against using certain U.S. assistance funds to lobby for or against  abortion, we recommend that the Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator develop  specific guidance on compliance with the Siljander Amendment, including what kinds of  activities are prohibited, disseminate this guidance throughout their agencies, and make it  available to award recipients and subrecipients.", "Management Comments:  As noted above, USAID takes compliance with the abortion  restrictions very seriously.  USAID will build upon its existing compliance tools and resources to  develop additional guidance for USAID and implementing partner staff on the Siljander  Amendment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Jacquelyn L.
