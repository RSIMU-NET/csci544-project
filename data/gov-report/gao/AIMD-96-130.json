Since then, the Congress has attempted to control the size of the debt by imposing ceilings on the amount of Treasury securities that could be outstanding. In February 1941, the Congress set an overall ceiling of $65 billion on all types of Treasury securities that could be outstanding at any one time.", "This ceiling was raised several times between February 1941 and June 1946 when a ceiling of $275 billion was set and remained in effect until August 1954. At that time, the Congress imposed the first temporary debt ceiling which added $6 billion to the $275 billion permanent ceiling. Since that time, the Congress has enacted numerous temporary and permanent increases in the debt ceiling. Although most of this debt is held by the public, about one fourth of it or $1.325 trillion, as of October 31, 1995, is issued to federal trust funds, such as the Social Security funds, the Civil Service fund, and the G-Fund.", "The Secretary of the Treasury has several responsibilities relating to the federal government\u2019s financial management operations. These include paying the government\u2019s obligations and investing trust fund receipts not needed for current benefits and expenses. The Congress has generally provided the Secretary with the ability to issue the necessary securities to the trust funds for investment purposes and to borrow the necessary funds from the public to pay government obligations.", "Under normal circumstances, the debt ceiling is not an impediment in carrying out these responsibilities. Treasury is notified by the appropriate agency (such as the Office of Personnel Management for the Civil Service fund) of the amount that should be invested (or reinvested) and Treasury makes the investment. In some cases, the actual security that Treasury should purchase may also be specified. These securities count against the debt ceiling. Consequently, if trust fund receipts are not invested, an increase in the debt subject to the debt ceiling does not occur.", "When Treasury is unable to borrow as a result of reaching the debt ceiling, the Secretary is unable to fully discharge his financial management responsibilities using the normal methods. On various occasions over the years, normal government financing has been disrupted because Treasury had borrowed up to or near the debt ceiling and legislation to increase the debt ceiling had not yet been enacted. These situations are commonly referred to as debt ceiling crises.", "In 1985 the government experienced a debt ceiling crisis from September 3 through December 11. During that period, Treasury took several actions that were similar to those discussed in this report. For example, Treasury redeemed Treasury securities held by the Civil Service fund earlier than normal in order to borrow sufficient cash from the public to meet the fund\u2019s benefit payments and did not invest some trust fund receipts. In 1986 and 1987, following Treasury\u2019s experiences during prior debt ceiling crises, the Congress provided to the Secretary of the Treasury statutory authority to use the Civil Service fund and the G-Fund to assist Treasury in managing its financial operations during a debt ceiling crisis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Authorities", "paragraphs": ["The following are statutory authorities provided to the Secretary of Treasury that are pertinent to the 1995-1996 debt ceiling crisis and the actions discussed in this report. 1.

Suspension of Civil Service fund investments. In subsection (j) of  5 U.S.C. 8348, the Congress authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend additional investment of amounts in the Civil Service fund if such investment cannot be made without causing the amount of public debt to exceed the debt ceiling. This subsection of the statute instructs the Secretary on how to make the Civil Service fund whole after the debt issuance suspension period has ended. 3. Suspension of G-Fund investments.

The subsection contains instructions on how the Secretary is to make the G-Fund whole after the debt ceiling crisis has ended. 4. Issuance of securities not counted toward the debt ceiling. On February 8, 1996, the Congress provided Treasury with the authority (Public Law 104-103) to issue securities in an amount equal to March 1996 social security payments. This statute provided that the securities issued under its provisions were not to be counted against the debt ceiling until March 15, 1996, which was later extended to March 30, 1996.

None of the agency securities held by FFB, and selected by Treasury for the exchange transaction, matured on June 30 and, if redeemed before maturity, the redemption price would be based on market interest rates.", "Because the effects of these differences can be significant, a methodology was needed to determine the proper valuation for the securities that would be exchanged.

The law establishing the Fund authorizes the Secretary to invest Fund balances not needed for program purposes in obligations of the federal government. This law also gives the Secretary the sole discretion for determining when, and if, the excess funds will be invested.

The Secretary notified the Congress that, unless the debt ceiling was raised before the end of February 1996, Social Security and other benefit payments could not be made in March 1996.", "Under normal procedures, monthly Social Security benefits are paid by direct deposit on the third day of each month. Because checks take a period of time to clear, Treasury only redeems securities equal to the amount of benefits paid by direct deposit on this date. The securities necessary to pay the benefits made by check are redeemed on the third and fourth business day after the payments are made. This sequencing is designed to allow the fund to earn interest during the average period that benefit checks are outstanding but not cashed (the so-called \u201cfloat period\u201d). For Social Security payments, the check float period is about 3.6 days.", "According to Treasury officials, they may need to raise the actual cash needed to pay these benefits several days before the payments are made since the check float is an average. For example, some checks may clear the next business day while others may clear several days after the securities are redeemed. Under normal conditions, this is not a problem since Treasury is free to issue the securities to raise the necessary cash without worrying about when the trust fund securities will be redeemed.", "To ensure that these benefits would be paid on time, on February 8, 1996, the Congress provided Treasury with the authority (Public Law 104-103) to issue securities in an amount equal to the March 1996 Social Security payments. Further, this statute provided that the securities issued under its provisions were not to be counted against the debt ceiling until March 15, 1996, which was later extended to March 30, 1996.", "The special legislation did not create any long-term borrowing authority for Treasury since it only allowed Treasury to issue securities that, in effect, would be redeemed in March 1996. However, it allowed Treasury to raise significant amounts of cash. This occurred because March 15, 1996\u2014the date initially established in the special legislation for which this debt would be counted against the debt ceiling\u2014was later than the date that most of the securities would have been redeemed from the trust fund under normal procedures.", "On February 23, 1996, Treasury issued these securities. Following normal redemption policies, Treasury redeemed about $29 billion of Treasury securities from the Social Security fund for the March benefit payments. Since the majority of the Social Security fund payments are made at the beginning of the month, by March 7, 1996, Treasury had redeemed about $28.3 billion of the trust fund\u2019s Treasury securities. This lowered the amount of debt subject to the limit, and Treasury was able to issue securities to the public for cash or invest trust funds receipts\u2014as long as they were issued before March 15, 1996. Therefore, Treasury could raise an additional $28.3 billion in cash because of the difference in timing between when the securities could be issued (March 15, 1996) and when they were redeemed to pay fund benefits and expenses. According to Treasury officials, during the 1995-1996 debt ceiling crisis, this flexibility allowed Treasury to raise about $12 billion of cash. The remaining capacity was used to invest trust fund receipts.", "According to Treasury officials, this was the first time that Treasury had been provided with this kind of authority during a debt ceiling crisis. Providing this legislation was important because during a debt ceiling crisis, Treasury may not be free to issue securities in advance to raise the necessary cash.", "Without this legislation, Treasury would have had at least the following three choices, of which only the first would have been practical. \u2022 Trust fund securities could have been redeemed earlier than normal. This action was used in the 1985 debt ceiling crisis to make benefit payments for the Social Security and Civil Service funds. In exercising this option, securities could have been redeemed on the same day that a like amount of securities were issued to the public for cash; these issues would have had no effect on the amount of debt subject to the debt ceiling. However, since the securities would have been redeemed earlier than normal, the trust fund would have lost interest income. In the case of the Social Security funds, such a loss could not be restored without special legislation. \u2022 The government could have not paid the benefits. This option would have resulted in the government not meeting an obligation, which it has never done. \u2022 Treasury could have issued additional securities, which would have caused the debt ceiling to be exceeded, in violation of the law, and raised legal issues concerning the validity of the securities as obligations of the United States. According to Treasury officials, Treasury has never issued securities that would cause the debt ceiling to be exceeded.

Under the authority provided by this statute, between March 13 and March 29, 1996, Treasury issued about $58.2 billion in Treasury securities to government trust funds as investments of their receipts or reinvestments of their maturing securities. In addition, using its normal redemption policies, Treasury redeemed significant amounts of Treasury securities, which counted against the debt ceiling, held by various government trust funds to pay for benefits and expenses. Thus, Treasury was provided the ability to raise significant amounts of cash because these actions reduced the amount of public debt subject to the debt ceiling.", "To designate government trust fund investments that were not considered subject to the debt ceiling, Treasury issued special Treasury securities. This enabled Treasury, at the time a trust fund redemption was made, to identify whether the redemption lowered the amount of outstanding debt subject to the debt ceiling.", "For example, on March 12, 1996, the Civil Service fund invested about $100 million in Treasury securities that were counted against the debt ceiling and on March 14, 1996, invested about $184 million in Treasury securities that were exempt. Therefore, if on March 19, 1996, using normal procedures, Treasury redeemed the trust fund\u2019s Treasury securities to pay for benefits and expenses, it would know whether, or how much of, the redemption reduced outstanding securities subject to the debt ceiling.", "A similar determination could also be made for securities that were reinvested. For example, on March 12, 1996, the Postal Service fund had about $1.2 billion in maturing securities that were subject to the debt ceiling. These funds were reinvested in securities that matured the next business day and were not subject to the debt ceiling. As a result, the amount of debt subject to the debt ceiling decreased by this amount, thus enabling Treasury to issue additional securities to the public for cash.
