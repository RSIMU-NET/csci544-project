The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) oversees PEPFAR and administers the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) account, the main repository for PEPFAR funds. For our April 2006 report, GAO reviewed PEPFAR prevention funding trends; described the PEPFAR strategy to prevent sexual transmission of HIV; and examined related challenges. The report recommended that the Coordinator collect and report information on the effects of the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement and use it to, among other things, assess whether the requirement should apply only to the GHAI account. OGAC agreed to collect information but disagreed with applying the requirement only to certain funds; GAO modified the recommendation. GAO also suggested Congress use the information to assess how well the requirement supports the Leadership Act's endorsement of both the ABC model and strong abstinence programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As GAO reported in April 2006, PEPFAR prevention funding in 15 focus countries increased by 55 percent between fiscal years 2004 and 2006, rising from about $207 million to $322 million. During this time, the prevention share of PEPFAR funding in these countries fell by about one-third, in accordance with the Leadership Act's recommendation that 20 percent of funds appropriated pursuant to the act support prevention. The PEPFAR strategy for preventing sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS is largely shaped by three elements--the ABC model, the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement, and local prevention needs. In addition to adopting the ABC model, OGAC developed guidance for applying it--for instance, that prevention interventions should be integrated and responsive to local needs and cultural norms. To meet the 33 percent spending requirement, OGAC mandated that country teams (PEPFAR officials in the field) spend at least half of prevention funds on sexual prevention and two-thirds of those funds on abstinence/faithfulness (AB) activities. OGAC permitted certain country teams to seek exemptions from this policy. OGAC also applied the spending requirement to all PEPFAR prevention funding as a matter of policy, although it determined that as a matter of law it applies only to funds appropriated to the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative account. GAO also reported in April 2006 that OGAC's ABC guidance and the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement, while valued by country teams, have presented challenges to most teams. First, two-thirds of focus country teams told us that ambiguities in some parts of the guidance led to uncertainty about implementing the model; OGAC officials commented they were clarifying the guidance for country teams. Second, although several teams indicated that they value the ABC model and noted the importance of AB messages, some teams also reported that the spending requirement can limit their ability to design programs that are integrated and responsive to local prevention needs. Most country teams reported, either in structured interviews or exemption requests, that fulfilling the spending requirement, including OGAC's policies implementing it, presents challenges to their ability to respond to local needs. Seven focus country teams--primarily those with smaller PEPFAR budgets--received exemptions from the requirement, allowing them to dedicate less than 33 percent of prevention funds to AB activities. In general, the nonexempted teams are spending more than 33 percent of prevention funds on AB activities, and OGAC should just meet the overall spending requirement for fiscal year 2006. However, to meet the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement, teams have in some cases reduced or cut funding for certain prevention programs, such as those to deliver comprehensive messages to certain populations. OGAC's decision to apply the spending requirement to all PEPFAR prevention funds may further challenge country teams' ability to address local prevention needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss HIV prevention efforts funded  under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).", "In January 2003, citing the need \u201cto meet a severe and urgent crisis  abroad,\u201d President Bush announced PEPFAR, a $15 billion, 5-year  initiative to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic through prevention,  treatment, and care interventions.

The  majority of HIV infections worldwide are transmitted sexually. About two- thirds of the estimated 40 million people currently living with HIV/AIDS  are in sub-Saharan Africa where, according to the Joint United Nations  Programme on HIV/AIDS, adult HIV prevalence averaged 7.4 percent in  2004.", "As the entity responsible for developing the U.S. global HIV/AIDS strategy  and administering PEPFAR, OGAC has defined five prevention program  areas\u2014abstinence/faithfulness (AB), \u201cother prevention,\u201d prevention of  mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), blood safety, and safe medical  injections.

In our April  2006 report, PEPFAR funding refers to funds appropriated to these four  accounts for the 15 focus countries, as well as bilateral HIV/AIDS funding  for the five additional countries that receive at least $10 million in U.S.  government HIV/AIDS funding. Each year, to receive country-level funding  for the coming fiscal year, country teams submit budgets, or \u201coperational  plans,\u201d to OGAC outlining planned activities and the organizations that will  implement them (implementing partners). These plans are subject to  OGAC\u2019s review and approval.

Although substantial debate  exists about the extent to which each component of the model is  responsible for reducing HIV prevalence in individual countries, there is  general consensus that using the ABC model can have a positive impact in  combating HIV/AIDS. In November 2004, a key consensus statement  authored by leading public health experts and endorsed by more than 125  prominent figures and world leaders observed that \u201call three elements of   are essential to reducing HIV incidence, although the  emphasis placed on individual elements needs to vary according to the  target population.\u201d", "The PEPFAR prevention goal is to avert 7 million infections in the 15 focus  countries by the year 2010. This goal is cumulative; that is, infections  averted in 2004 through 2009 will count toward the final total of infections  averted by 2010. In addition, this goal is to be reached both through  PEPFAR activities and through interventions by other donors and host  nations. OGAC plans, over time, to estimate progress toward this goal by  using a statistical model of epidemiological trends developed by the U.S.  Census Bureau. This analysis will compare \u201cexpected\u201d HIV incidence rates  in particular countries with \u201cactual\u201d incidence rates, using those  comparisons to estimate the number of infections that have been averted  through PEPFAR and other prevention programs. However, it cannot  attribute this change to any specific intervention or to the success of  particular types of programs. The approach involves substantial challenges  and the reliability of the estimates is not known, according to Census  officials. Key challenges include a lack of data on prevalence rates in many  developing countries and the fact that impacts of behavioral change  programs can occur over a period of time. OGAC initially considered using  a different methodology\u2014the Goals model\u2014that links estimates of  infections averted to specific types of prevention programs carried out  under PEPFAR and their spending levels. However, OGAC concluded that  this model could yield misleading results and was not the best method to  adopt.

For example,  although PEPFAR funds may be used to deliver age-appropriate AB  information to in-school youths aged 10 to 14 years, the funds may not be  used to provide information on condoms to these youths. When students  are identified as being at risk, they may be referred to out-of-school  programs that provide integrated ABC information and that provide  condoms.

To show compliance with the  spending requirement, country teams\u2019 operational plans must isolate the  amount of funding dedicated to AB activities. OGAC allows country teams  to request exemption from its 50 percent and 66 percent policies.  However, the guidance cautions that, in a generalized epidemic, a very  strong justification is required for not meeting the 66 percent policy and  adds that OGAC expects all focus country teams, particularly those with  total PEPFAR funding exceeding $75 million, to adhere to the policies.  Finally, OGAC directed country teams to apply the spending requirement  to all PEPFAR prevention funding (about $357 million in fiscal year 2006),  although it determined that, as a matter of law, the requirement applies  only to funds appropriated to the GHAI account (about $322 million in  fiscal year 2006)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ABC Guidance and Abstinence-Until- Marriage Spending Requirement Present Challenges for Country Teams", "paragraphs": ["As our April 2006 report discusses, country teams face challenges related  to both the ABC guidance and the Leadership Act\u2019s abstinence-until- marriage spending requirement.

First, 6 focus country teams expressed uncertainty  regarding the populations that should be considered at-risk in accordance  with the guidance, and 5 of these teams expressed concern that certain  populations that need ABC messages in their countries might not receive  them because they do not fit the ABC guidance definition of at-risk.  Second, teams reported that the ABC guidance does not clearly delineate  permissible condom-related activities, causing confusion about proper use  of PEPFAR funds. For example, 5 focus country teams reported that, in  their understanding, PEPFAR funds may not be used for broad condom  social marketing, even to adults in a generalized epidemic. Third, the ABC  guidance does not discuss how the age cutoff for providing condom  information should be applied to groups that include youths younger and  older than 15.

If, for example, a country  team\u2019s planned funding has less than a 2-to-1 ratio of AB funds to \u201cother  prevention\u201d funds, the team can increase AB funding to reach the required  ratio by reducing funds in \u201cother prevention,\u201d PMTCT, or a combination of  the two.
