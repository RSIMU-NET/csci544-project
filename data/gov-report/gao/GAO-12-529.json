In fiscal year 2011, Treasury further enhanced the SOP to include  procedures for periodically updating the CFS disclosure checklist and  documenting preparer sign-offs and managerial approvals.

Treasury noted that it reduced the risk of error  through the required quarterly IRAS validation process, which provides for  the IRAS administrator to verify randomly selected federal entities\u2019  submitted data for consistency and completeness with IRAS reports. The  process also calls for the IRAS team leader to review and approve the  IRAS administrator\u2019s testing documentation prior to the distribution of  IRAS reports to the federal entities. In addition, the process includes  completing a checklist to document that these procedures have been  performed. If properly designed and effectively implemented, this process  could reduce the risk of error caused by inadequate segregation of duties.
