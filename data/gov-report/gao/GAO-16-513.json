NIST further recommends that agencies implement lessons learned from  ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures,  training, and testing, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.", "While FDA has developed and documented an incident response policy,  the agency did not comply with its own policy of updating its incident  response policy every 3 years. The policy has not been updated since it  was created in January 2007.", "Further, neither FDA\u2019s incident response policy nor its procedures require  or describe steps for coordinating incident response activities with  planning for contingencies or system disruptions. The agency also did not  update its incident response procedures using the results of lessons  learned from prior incident response table top exercises we examined.  For example, results from a 2012 table top exercise indicated that FDA  should better train its employees so that newer, less-experienced staff are  better able to respond to significant cyber incidents, and that FDA should  update its procedures to include training requirements. However, the  lessons learned were not incorporated into FDA\u2019s incident response  procedures. Without effective incident response practices in place, FDA  has reduced assurance that its systems and information are protected  and that it can respond to incidents.", "In response to our findings, FDA staff mentioned that the agency is in the  process of incorporating lessons learned from incident handling activities  into its incident response procedures, training, and testing. In addition, the  agency stated that it is taking various steps to address incident response  based on our feedback from previous surveys and data requests. The  agency stated that it has discontinued its incident response standard  operating procedure and was developing a new one based on NIST SP  800-61. The agency\u2019s staff also mentioned that personnel will undergo  security training and that FDA is piloting various products to improve the  agency\u2019s overall security posture, including incident response. We have  not yet verified that the agency has implemented these actions, but such  actions could improve FDA\u2019s incident response capability."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although FDA has implemented numerous controls and taken steps  intended to protect its information and information systems, pervasive  control weaknesses continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of its sensitive information. In fiscal year 2015, the agency  centralized the management and location of its network and security  operations with intended goals that include establishing real-time network  awareness and improved incident detection. The agency also  immediately resolved some of the weaknesses we identified during this  review. Nonetheless, significant weaknesses in controls for preventing or  limiting unauthorized access to its systems and information, as well as  weaknesses in other controls, such as those for ensuring that software  and hardware are updated and securely configured and that sensitive  media is disposed of, put FDA\u2019s systems at risk. This is significant  considering that these systems handle proprietary business data from  companies in multiple industries and sensitive public health data.", "An underlying cause for many of these weaknesses is that FDA has not  fully implemented its agency-wide information security program, such as  developing and documenting appropriate policies and procedures,  ensuring security controls are tested effectively, remediating weaknesses  in a timely manner, and planning for contingencies or system disruptions  and effectively managing risks. The widespread weaknesses in technical  controls and the incomplete implementation of program elements suggest  that the agency has not made effective information security a high  enough priority. Until FDA implements these practices and controls, it will  have limited assurance that its information and information systems are  adequately protected against unauthorized access, disclosure,  modification, or loss."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To effectively implement key elements of the Food and Drug  Administration\u2019s (FDA) information security program, we are  recommending that the Secretary of Health and Human Services direct  the Commissioner of FDA to implement the following 15  recommendations:  1.  Complete a risk assessment and authorization to operate for one FDA  system.  2.  Ensure that completed risk assessments for six systems reviewed  address the likelihood and impact of threats to FDA.  3.  Develop a policy for system maintenance.  4.  Develop procedures for the following 8 security control families: Audit  and Accountability, Identification and Authentication, Maintenance,  Media Protection, Physical and Environmental Protection, Security  Planning, Systems Communication and Protection, and System  Information and Integrity.  5.  Enhance procedures for the following 7 security control families:  Access Control, Awareness and Training, Security Assessment and  Authorization, Configuration Management, Program Management,  Personnel Security, and System and Services Acquisition.  6.  Review and update as needed per FDA\u2019s frequency, the policies for  the following 11 security control families: Access Control, Audit and  Accountability, Contingency Planning, Identification and  Authentication, Incident Response, Media Protection, Physical and  Environmental Protection, Security Planning, Personnel Security,  System and Services Acquisition, and System and Information  Integrity.  7.  Develop and document a security plan for one system supporting  FDA\u2019s scientific research.  8.  Update security plans to ensure the plans fully and accurately  document the controls selected and intended for protecting each of  the six systems.  9.  Review and approve security plans for the six systems reviewed at  least annually.  10. Implement a process to effectively monitor and track training for  personnel with significant security roles and responsibilities.  11. Ensure that personnel with significant security responsibilities receive  role-based training.  12. Test controls at least annually for the two systems that support FDA\u2019s  scientific research and IT infrastructure.  13. Implement remedial actions in accordance with FDA\u2019s prescribed time  frames or update milestones if actions are delayed.  14.

In the comments  (reprinted in appendix II), the department stated that FDA concurred with  our recommendations, has begun implementing several of them, and is  actively working to address all the recommendations as quickly and  completely as possible. The department also stated that FDA has  acquired third-party expertise to assist in these efforts to immediately  address the recommendations in our report.", "The department emphasized its commitment to protecting the public  health and proprietary business information at FDA, including by  implementing layered defenses and other compensating controls. HHS  further noted that FDA has not experienced a major cybersecurity-related  breach that exposed industry or public health information and that  information security remains a high priority at FDA. The department  added that since hiring its CIO in 2015, FDA has undertaken steps to  better ensure the prevention, detection, and correction of incidents. These  include the development of an IT strategic plan and the restructuring of  cybersecurity leadership, among other initiatives.", "In addition, HHS noted that we did not identify an elevated risk of  exposure and/or exfiltration of trade secret and/or other sensitive  information. However, this does not accurately reflect the results of our  review. As stated in the report, we identified a significant number of  weaknesses in technical controls\u2014including access controls, change  controls, and patch management\u2014that jeopardize the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of the seven moderate- and high-impact systems  we reviewed. Moreover, several of these weaknesses affected FDA\u2019s  general support systems, which are connected to numerous systems  beyond the ones we reviewed. As previously mentioned, these  weaknesses place the seven FDA systems, including those that receive,  process, and maintain sensitive industry and public health data, at  increased and unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, use, or  modification.", "The department also made additional comments regarding our report and  methodology. In particular, it stated that our methodology did not use an  industry-standard approach to assessing risk, defined as the likelihood of  a given threat source exploiting a particular vulnerability and the resulting  significance of the impact of that adverse event on the organization, or  quantify this risk in our overall assessment. We did not perform a  comprehensive risk assessment of FDA\u2019s information systems and  information because that is FDA\u2019s responsibility, not ours. However, we  did consider the elements of risk to agency systems and information  during our review. For example, as stated in the report, in selecting the  seven systems we reviewed, we considered FDA\u2019s categorization of the  impact or magnitude of harm to the agency\u2019s operations, assets, and  individuals should the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the  systems and the information they contain be compromised. Six of the  seven systems we selected were assigned a Federal Information  Processing Standard rating of moderate or high impact by FDA, indicating  that the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of these systems or  the information they contain would have either a serious or  severe/catastrophic impact on the organization. We also considered how  each control weakness, vulnerability, or program shortcoming we  identified could impair or diminish the effectiveness of a security control or  be exploited to facilitate unauthorized system activity. Our report identifies  numerous weaknesses and vulnerabilities along with their potential  impact if the vulnerabilities are exploited. It is also noteworthy that our  work determined that for the reviewed systems, FDA had not determined  the likelihood and impact of threats to those systems.", "HHS also stated that our report did not consider other FDA tools,  resources, and capabilities designed to prevent, detect, and correct  incidents, such as its ability to prevent or mitigate breaches like the one  that occurred in October 2013. We recognize that FDA has implemented  numerous security controls and key elements of its information security  program; however, the weaknesses we identified nevertheless pose  increased and unnecessary risk to its systems and information. For  example, as noted in our report, FDA had not updated its incident  response policy since 2007 or incorporated other key elements. Having a  complete and up-to-date incident response capability is essential to  ensuring that FDA staff have the knowledge and tools to effectively  respond to security incidents, such as breaches.", "Finally, the department stated that our report does not consistently or  clearly distinguish which of the systems reviewed contained sensitive  information and which do not. It noted, for example, that FDA\u2019s Scientific  Network is a research and development network that does not contain  trade secret information. However, as we noted in our report, FDA\u2019s  systems operate in an interconnected and networked environment, and  the agency had not ensured that the Scientific Network, for example, was  adequately isolated from other systems containing sensitive data, nor had  it developed and implemented risk management controls for this system.  These weaknesses could provide an attacker with a pathway from this  less-secure system to other systems containing sensitive public health or  proprietary business data. Such weaknesses therefore pose an increased  risk to the sensitive information FDA collects and maintains.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
