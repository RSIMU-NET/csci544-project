Nevertheless, while the task of implementing the civil aspects of the Dayton Agreement had begun, Bosnia remained politically and ethnically divided due principally to the failure of the political leaders of Bosnia\u2019s three major ethnic groups to embrace political and social reconciliation and to fulfill their obligations under the Dayton Agreement. Many western observers told us that based on the current pace of political and social change in Bosnia, some sort of international military force would likely be needed there for many years to deter an outbreak of hostilities while Bosnians continue the reconciliation process.", "In June 1998, we reported that the pace of implementing the Dayton Agreement had accelerated beginning in mid-1997, due to a renewed commitment and level of effort\u2014both political and military\u2014by the international community.

DOD officials believed that the rise of a relatively moderate Bosnian Serb leadership under Republika Srpska President Plavsic beginning in mid-1997\u2014including the election of a relatively moderate Republika Srpska parliament and moderate Prime Minister in November 1997 and mid-January 1998, respectively\u2014and the resulting reduction in power of Bosnian Serb hard-liners had improved conditions such that U.S. forces in Bosnia could safely be drawn down to 6,900 troops.", "A December 1997 options document prepared by the Joint Staff, which was the basis for the January 1998 drawdown decision, presented information on the force structure and associated force levels required for a range of potential missions for the SFOR follow-on force. In describing the option that was selected by the National Command Authority, the document indicated that the U.S. military could accomplish the current SFOR mission with two combat battalions in the country rather than its existing three combat battalions, thereby allowing the United States to reduce forces there to 6,900 troops.", "In the decision-making process, DOD had considered an operational assessment done by the U.S. European Command in late October 1997. This assessment\u2014based on troop-to-task analyses for various mission options\u2014showed that (a) if the SFOR follow-on force were to continue SFOR\u2019s current mission, the United States would have to maintain its current force levels of about 8,500 troops and its current force structure in Bosnia, particularly its combat capability that included three U.S. combat battalions and two aviation task forces; and (b) if security conditions in Bosnia substantially improved and SFOR\u2019s mission were to be reduced to providing restricted support for civil implementation, the United States could withdraw one of the three U.S. combat battalions from Bosnia and thereby reduce the number of U.S. troops there to 6,900.", "DOD had also considered SACEUR\u2019s military judgment that to do the current SFOR mission with a 6,900 U.S. force level for Bosnia, the United States would have to maintain three combat battalions in the country and relocate some units nearby to Croatia. While this would have shifted some U.S. troops from Bosnia to Croatia, the overall U.S. SFOR force levels in theater would have remained about the same.", "After the decision was made, the U.S. military spent February through April 1998 identifying ways of reducing U.S. force levels in Bosnia to 6,900 troops while still maintaining three combat battalions in the country\u2014the option of moving some units to Croatia was no longer being considered. In early March 1998, SACEUR explained to us that three U.S. combat battalions were still needed in Bosnia because (1) although the situation on the ground in Bosnia had changed and the risk had been reduced somewhat, the situation had not altered sufficiently to draw down the number of U.S. combat battalions from three to two; and (2) the Multinational Specialized Unit is not a replacement for SFOR\u2019s combat units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NATO Lowered Some Operational Requirements After the U.S. Drawdown Decision", "paragraphs": ["On February 20, 1998, NATO decided that the SFOR follow-on force would continue SFOR\u2019s existing mission, and soon after, the U.S. military and NATO began the troop-to-task analysis and force generation process for that force. To reach the 6,900 U.S. force level in Bosnia, DOD determined during this process that the U.S. military would maintain its three combat battalions in the country and instead reduce the number of other combat, combat support, and combat service support units. In planning for the drawdown, DOD expected other countries to contribute resources to make up for some of the U.S. force reductions, but other countries generally did not commit to do so.", "Instead, to achieve the reduced troop level objective, the SFOR Commander\u2014a U.S. Army general officer\u2014reassessed the force\u2019s operational requirements during March and April 1998 and determined that the force could perform its mission with the lower-than-expected number of resources. This included, for example, consolidating two U.S. aviation task forces and reducing the number of U.S. attack helicopters from 40 to 16. After another NATO country agreed to contribute an additional two attack helicopters, the SFOR Commander determined that the force could accomplish its mission with only 18 attack helicopters in the consolidated task force.

Senior international officials in Bosnia told us that European countries with troops in Bosnia believe that they had no operational requirement for such a unit; they believe their soldiers are already trained for and capable of dealing with civil disturbances faced by SFOR. On the other hand, SACEUR said that European countries are reluctant to provide resources because they view the unit as an effort by the United States to remove U.S. troops from Bosnia while European troops remained behind.
