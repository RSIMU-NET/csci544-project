This report describes (1) how federal agencies and selected states identify drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs; (2) how federal agencies have supported selected states' planning for future conditions that may affect needs; and (3) the extent to which federal and state agencies have coordinated in funding projects, and any challenges they faced. GAO reviewed eight federal agencies that provide assistance for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and selected a nongeneralizable sample of six states\u2014Alaska, California, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, and Tennessee\u2014on the basis of federal infrastructure funding amounts and geography. For the six states, GAO reviewed infrastructure planning and program documents and interviewed federal and state officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal and selected state agencies collect information to identify drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs through surveys, the administration of agency programs, and studies. EPA's most recent surveys estimated approximately $655 billion of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs nationwide over the next 20 years. The seven other agencies GAO reviewed\u2014the departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Economic Development Administration, Indian Health Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\u2014collect information on these needs by administering their programs. For example, the Corps collects information on congressionally authorized water projects. Of the six states GAO selected for review, all but Alaska and California had collected data on their needs such as through surveys of communities. For example, North Dakota biennially collects information on drinking water projects from its communities.", "The Corps, Reclamation, and FEMA provide technical assistance and funding to support efforts in the six selected states to plan for future conditions that may affect drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs. For example, the Corps helped Minnewaukan, North Dakota, identify alternatives for reducing flood risks to the city's drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, and Reclamation worked with Santa Fe, New Mexico, to study its projected water supply and demand. The remaining five agencies have at times been involved in long-term planning but do not have established programs for such purposes.", "Federal and state agencies in the six selected states have taken actions to coordinate funding for projects while facing several challenges. For example, agencies in most of the selected states had established interagency coordinating groups that reached out to communities needing funding for projects. In some cases, agencies developed written agreements for their coordinating groups, with such goals as simplifying the application process and encouraging agencies to fund projects together. However, agencies in the selected states faced challenges, such as difficulty in developing a set of specific projects that were ready for funding, despite having infrastructure needs. For example, in the six selected states, USDA did not have enough applicants with projects that were developed to the extent needed to receive funding; therefore, USDA did not loan a total of about $193 million in available loan funds for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to communities in those states. GAO found that federal and state agencies within selected states had taken some actions to help address challenges they faced in funding projects; these actions included conducting joint outreach to develop a set of projects ready for funding. EPA and USDA also have taken actions. For example, in February 2017 in response to a GAO recommendation in a prior report, EPA and USDA issued a joint memorandum outlining five practices to help improve interagency collaboration at the state level on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects; these practices include using common application materials and conducting joint marketing or outreach."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

Such infrastructure includes drinking water  treatment plants and distribution pipelines; wastewater treatment plants  and sewers; and a system of wells, dams, and reservoirs to hold the  water supply. Across the country, according to Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) documents, there are about 52,000 community water  systems and 16,000 public wastewater treatment systems that provide  drinking water and wastewater services to the majority of the population.  In addition, the federal government owns a system of about 3,400 dams  to manage and supply water for communities across the country, among  other purposes. Local communities also own and manage their own dams  and reservoirs.", "Local governments and their utilities plan investments to repair, replace,  and upgrade drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and pay the  majority of the costs, primarily by charging rates for drinking water and  wastewater services. Communities and utilities can receive funding and  planning assistance from the federal government and their respective  states to repair, replace, and upgrade their drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure. In 2014, the most recent year for which data were  available, state and local governments spent approximately $104.6 billion  on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects, and the federal  government spent $4.4 billion, according to 2015 Congressional Budget  Office data.", "Federal funding and assistance are available for local drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure projects through programs administered by  eight federal agencies: EPA and the Departments of Agriculture (USDA),  Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland  Security, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Interior. The  programs administered by these agencies have different purposes and  varying eligibility criteria that may focus funding or assistance to  communities on the basis of population size, economic conditions, or  geographic location. For example, USDA\u2019s Rural Utilities Service provides  water and waste disposal grants and direct and guaranteed loans to rural  communities with populations of 10,000 or fewer, while EPA\u2019s Drinking  Water and Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs can  provide funding to communities of all sizes. The eligibility criteria can  focus on particular program goals or geographic areas. For example,  EPA\u2019s Clean Water SRF program prioritizes funding on the basis of water  quality goals, and Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration  has established formal nationwide criteria for selecting infrastructure  projects to fund, such as criteria that prioritize projects located in an  economically distressed area. In contrast, Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Reclamation and Defense\u2019s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have not  historically had drinking water and wastewater infrastructure programs  with specific eligibility criteria; instead, they have generally provided  funding to water projects under specific congressional authorizations.  Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) and EPA provide grant funding for projects  that improve the disaster resiliency of drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure.", "Federal agencies can also provide assistance to local communities to  help them plan for future conditions that may affect drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure needs. Such conditions include changes in  population or land use, which can affect demand for services, or changes  in climate, which can cause droughts or flooding, among other things.", "You asked us to review the federal programs that provide funding for  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

Our  review included interviews with officials from federal agencies\u2019 regional or  state offices and state agencies responsible for overseeing and  administering these programs in a nonprobability sample of six states:  Alaska, California, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, and  Tennessee. To obtain a diverse sample of states with a range of  coordination experience on drinking water and wastewater funding, we  selected these states on the basis of geographic diversity, number of  federal agencies that provided funding in the state for drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure projects, and the presence or absence of a  formal funding coordination group. State coordination groups were  identified in a 2015 report prepared on behalf of the Small Community  Water Infrastructure Exchange, a network of water funding officials. The  sample of states is not generalizable, and the results of our work do not  apply to all 50 states; however, they provide illustrative examples of state  infrastructure programs. We also interviewed federal and state officials  administering funding from congressionally authorized regional economic  development authorities such as the Appalachian Regional Commission,  Denali Commission, and Delta Regional Authority, as appropriate.", "To describe how federal agencies and selected states identify drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure needs, we identified federal  requirements directing EPA and Indian Health Service to collect  information on needs and reviewed these agencies\u2019 most recent reports  on needs, as well as any national, regional, or state reports on needs  issued over the last 10 years by the other six federal agencies and the six  selected states.

We then interviewed federal  and state agency officials on project funding and coordination, as well as  on challenges they face in funding projects. We also compared actions  the agencies took with key considerations for implementing interagency  collaborative mechanisms and practices to enhance and sustain  collaboration identified in our previous work. We reviewed a report by  EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General on the status of Drinking Water SRF  program funding. We obtained and analyzed fiscal year 2016 funding  data on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure from each of the  federal agencies and assessed the reliability of the data by obtaining  information from agency officials.

USDA uses this system to track funded projects and to collect and  track information on projects that were submitted but not funded. As of  fiscal year 2016, USDA officials we interviewed said they maintained  a backlog of $2.5 billion in projects that have not yet received funding  through the Water and Waste Disposal Program. In addition, in July  2015, the Rural Community Assistance Partnership\u2014a contractor  hired by USDA\u2014published a one-time assessment that described,  ranked, prioritized, and identified potential improvements to drinking  water and wastewater needs of 2,177 colonias in 35 border counties  in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. According to the  report, the assessment was the first colonias-level evaluation of  drinking water and wastewater needs along the U.S.-Mexico border;  the report did not estimate the cost or number of projects to address  the needs identified.", "HUD. The agency collects information on projects it funds or partially  funds through its administration of the Community Development Block  Grant program, including drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  projects to support community development, primarily in low- and  moderate-income communities.

The agency  also collects information on needs through feasibility studies  conducted for potential rural water supply projects, including studies  on drinking water supply needs. In addition, Reclamation collects  information on needs to modify dams for dam safety purposes.  Specifically, as of May 2017, Reclamation manages 492 dams and  has identified 15 dams as high- and significant-risk dams that are in  need of modification to reduce risk to communities below the dams, at  a cost of approximately $1.25 billion. According to Reclamation  officials we interviewed, the agency estimates an additional 6 to 10  dams will require modification for dam safety purposes within the next  3 to 4 years, but Reclamation has not developed the overall cost  estimate to address the safety modifications for these dams.", "FEMA.

The workgroup was part of a larger effort  created by the Governor in 2007 to lead the preparation and  implementation of an Alaska climate change strategy to respond to  risks to infrastructure, including water and wastewater infrastructure,  from permafrost degradation, erosion, and flooding. From 2005 to  2009, the Corps conducted a baseline erosion assessment to  determine the vulnerabilities of Alaskan communities to coastal  erosion that helped inform the workgroup\u2019s action plan. The  assessment identified 26 communities whose viability was threatened  by erosion. As a result, in 2009, the workgroup recommended  developing a methodology to prioritize state and federal funding for  projects to protect existing infrastructure, including drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure, from risks due to permafrost degradation,  erosion, and flooding. To address the recommendation, as of March  2017, using funding provided by the Denali Commission, the Corps  was collaborating with the University of Alaska-Fairbanks to collect  additional data on erosion and flooding.

For example,  Reclamation partnered with the state and several local authorities to  examine the impact of rising sea levels, drought, and increasing  population, among other conditions, on future water supply and water  quality in the Sacramento River Basin, the San Joaquin River Basin,  and the Tulare Lake Basin. The basins study completed in March  2016 found that the San Joaquin and Tulare Lake basins faced the  risk of future deficits in water supply, and that sea level rise would  pose a threat to municipal water supply and water quality. In addition,  Reclamation has helped fund planning, design, and construction of  local projects to reuse wastewater through its Title XVI program. For  example, Reclamation has provided $20 million to plan and construct  a water recycling effort by the City of Watsonville, California, and the  Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency. By providing recycled  water for irrigation, the project is intended to reduce overdrawing of  groundwater from aquifers, which can lead to contamination of the  aquifers if seawater intrudes into the groundwater. The recycled  water blends discharge from the city\u2019s wastewater treatment plant with  higher-quality water and distributes it to irrigate a portion of more than  6,000 acres of farm land.", "In New Mexico, Reclamation also assisted with several basin studies.  For example, the agency helped the City and County of Santa Fe in  New Mexico complete a basin study in 2015 to assess variations in  available water supply stemming from climate change and other  factors. The study found that the Santa Fe area\u2019s population is  expected to increase by about 80 percent by 2055 and faces a water  shortfall if actions are not taken. The study also identified potential  adaptation strategies to help meet the projected demand for water  over the next 40 years. Following up on a project identified in the  basin study, Reclamation\u2019s Title XVI program provided funding to the  City and County of Santa Fe for a 2016 study of the feasibility of  reusing wastewater as drinking water and for replenishing aquifers for  future water supply. In addition, Reclamation and USDA provided  technical assistance to the state and communities as they updated  New Mexico\u2019s regional water plans.

We identified several types of coordination actions that some  federal and state agencies had undertaken since 2011 in some selected  states. These actions are consistent with key considerations for  implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms and practices to  enhance and sustain collaboration that we have identified in our previous  work. Examples of coordination actions taken by the six selected states  and various federal agencies include the following:  Including all relevant participants. Participation by all relevant  participants in an interagency coordinating group is one of the key  considerations we have identified for implementing such a  collaborative mechanism. With the exception of Tennessee, five of  the selected states had coordinating groups. Certain federal and state  agencies have participated in interagency coordinating groups that  met at least once annually. For example, California\u2019s group meets  quarterly, according to federal and state officials, and includes officials  from USDA, Reclamation, the state\u2019s SRF and Community  Development Block Grant programs, the state\u2019s Department of Water  Resources, and other state programs. Alaska\u2019s group focuses on  funding programs for small communities (those with less than 1,000  people), which are primarily tribal funding programs for Alaska Native  villages. The group meets monthly, according to federal and state  officials, and includes USDA, Indian Health Service, EPA, the Alaska  Native Tribal Health Consortium\u2014a statewide tribal organization that  manages most of the design and construction of sanitation facilities in  rural Alaska\u2014and Alaska\u2019s Department of Environmental  Conservation, which also manages the SRF program.", "Documenting written agreements between the agencies. Having  written guidance and agreements documenting how agencies will  collaborate is a key consideration of interagency collaborative  mechanisms identified in our prior work. In three of the selected  states\u2014California, New York, and North Dakota\u2014federal and state  agencies developed written agreements for their coordinating groups.  For example, the 1998 agreement between federal and state  agencies in California sought to encourage more efficient use of funds  and reduce administrative costs for the agencies and their funding  recipients. Federal and state agencies agreed to, among other things,  provide staff and leadership to form the state\u2019s coordinating group,  meet regularly to foster cooperation in project funding, remove as  many barriers as possible in program regulations, and jointly fund  projects when feasible and efficient. Similarly, New York\u2019s 2003  agreement between federal and state agencies sought to simplify the  application process and formalize coordination of jointly funded  drinking water and wastewater activities. Among other things, the  participating agencies agreed to establish an interagency coordinating  group to meet regularly, facilitate exchange of information among  agencies, jointly fund projects when feasible and appropriate, and  provide outreach on funding programs to potential recipients.  Agencies in North Dakota signed a memorandum of understanding  with federal agencies in 1997 with the purpose of establishing greater  communication and coordination on water supply development  funding in the state. The memorandum stated that the agencies would  meet at least biannually but did not include other agreements about  how they would coordinate.", "Sustaining leadership for the group. Sustaining leadership is  another key consideration of interagency collaborative mechanisms  we previously identified. According to agency documents and officials,  federal and state agencies had established leadership for the  interagency coordinating groups in three of the selected states\u2014 California, New Mexico, and New York. According to federal and state  officials, a state agency provided leadership for North Dakota\u2019s  coordinating efforts.", "Bridging organizational cultures. Bridging organizational cultures is  a key consideration of interagency collaborative mechanisms we  identified. One way agencies can bridge organizational cultures is to  adopt common application requirements or procedures. Federal and  state agencies in five states\u2014Alaska, California, New Mexico, New  York, and Tennessee\u2014had taken at least one action toward adopting  common application requirements or procedures. For example, in  California and New York, agencies developed a common income  survey for determining funding eligibility.", "Identifying resources. Identifying the resources needed to initiate or  sustain the collaborative effort is a key consideration of interagency  collaborative mechanisms we identified. Some agencies in the  selected states took actions consistent with this key consideration. For  example, federal and state agencies conducted joint marketing and  outreach to communities and utilities about the agencies\u2019 funding  opportunities in five of the states\u2014Alaska, California, New Mexico,  New York, and North Dakota. In addition, officials from federal and  state agencies in all of the selected states said they shared some  information among themselves on infrastructure project applications  that were funded or being considered for funding, either through their  coordinating groups or informally between individual programs. For  example, agencies in Alaska shared information on projects for small  Alaska villages, and in California agencies shared information on  jointly funded projects. In New Mexico, USDA and the state\u2019s  Community Development Block Grant programs began sharing  information when they joined the state\u2019s coordinating group in 2014  and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, agencies in some selected  states jointly funded projects with other federal or state agencies. For  example, according to federal and state officials in New York,  agencies often worked together to make projects more affordable to  communities by combining grant and loan funds from multiple  agencies. In Tennessee, USDA and the SRF programs have jointly  funded projects with the state\u2019s Community Development Block Grant  program, but state and federal officials said their agencies generally  try to fully fund projects, or phases of them, themselves.", "Not all federal and state agencies in selected states took action to  coordinate for various reasons, such as timing and resources, according  to federal and state agency officials. For example, some of the federal  agencies that provide funding for drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure did not participate in all state coordinating groups.  Reclamation officials, for instance, did not participate in New Mexico\u2019s  coordinating group because the state coordinating group was in the  process of being organized and Reclamation had not been asked to  participate, according to agency officials. In another example, the Indian  Health Service did not participate in California\u2019s coordinating group  because the group primarily identifies and addresses needs in nontribal  communities, according to agency officials. The Economic Development  Administration, state agencies managing FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant  program funds, and the Corps also did not participate in any of the  groups, in part because they have limited roles or funding for drinking  water or wastewater infrastructure. In addition, some selected states did  not develop formal written agreements for their coordinating groups or  use common procedures or surveys. For example, New Mexico was in  the process of organizing its coordinating group and planned to consider  a written agreement once the group was established, according to state  officials. In addition, while some states had developed common  procedures or surveys, not all agencies used them. For example, state  officials said that California\u2019s common income survey was not used by the  state\u2019s Community Development Block Grant program because of  differences in survey requirements and the Community Development  Block Grant\u2019s definition of low- and moderate-income persons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Challenges to Funding Projects Make It Difficult for Agencies to Provide All Available Federal Funds in Selected States", "paragraphs": ["In the selected states, four key challenges can make it difficult for federal  and state agencies to provide all federal funds available for drinking water  and wastewater infrastructure projects: limited community demand for  loan funding, limited technical or financial capacity of some communities,  differing requirements among federal and state funding programs, and  difficulty developing a set of projects ready for funding.", "Federal and state officials face the following key challenges to funding  projects.", "Limited community demand for loan funding. USDA officials we  interviewed in all of the selected states, as well as state program  officials in five of the selected states, said that communities prefer  grants, which do not need to be repaid, and are reluctant to take on  loans and pay interest on them. Because the USDA Water and Waste  Disposal loan and grant program and state SRF programs do not  usually fund projects entirely with grants, finding applicants for state  and federal programs can be difficult. In addition, USDA officials in  New Mexico, New York, and California cited competition from state- funded grant programs as a challenge for federal and state agencies  to use available loan and grant funding. For example, according to  USDA funding data and a USDA official in New York, USDA\u2019s New  York state office did not obligate $3.5 million of the grant funds  available in 2015 and 2016 because a state program provided grants  to four communities that had already been funded with a combination  of USDA loan and grant funds.", "Communities\u2019 limited technical or financial capacity. In five of the  selected states, some of the federal and state officials said that some  communities have limited technical or financial expertise or capacity  for loans, which is a challenge for agencies because it can prevent  communities from identifying projects or applying to state and federal  agencies for project funding. For example, state SRF program officials  in New Mexico and state Community Development Block Grant  program officials in New York noted that many small communities do  not have the technical capacity to evaluate their drinking water or  wastewater systems and to plan projects. State SRF program officials  in Tennessee also said that many communities do not have the  financial capacity to repay loans and therefore may not qualify for  federal and state loan programs.", "Differing requirements among funding programs. In five of the  selected states, federal or state officials said that differing application  requirements and processes among funding programs are a  challenge. For example, differing requirements can make it difficult for  federal and state agencies to jointly fund projects or for applicants to  apply to multiple programs for funding. A USDA official in New  Mexico, for example, noted that differing requirements for applicants\u2019  preliminary engineering reports have been a challenge, as did officials  from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, which administers  parts of Indian Health Service\u2019s program in Alaska. In addition, an  Indian Health Service official in North Dakota and state Community  Development Block Grant program officials in California and  Tennessee described challenges with agencies\u2019 differing  requirements for environmental reviews. They each identified projects  they funded between fiscal years 2011 and 2016 that involved some  duplication of environmental analysis\u2014either an additional  environmental review or additions to other programs\u2019 environmental  reviews; this duplication can increase the length and cost of projects,  according to officials.", "Difficulty developing a set of projects ready for funding. Federal  and state officials we interviewed in four states noted that even  though communities in those states may have drinking water or  wastewater infrastructure needs, they may not have identified specific  projects or developed them to the extent needed to apply for funding.", "For example, state SRF program officials in California and Alaska and  USDA officials in Tennessee said that it is hard for communities to put  together the plans they need to get a project ready for funding, and  that this can be more difficult than construction of the project.  Similarly, Indian Health Service officials in California noted that it is  challenging for communities to develop projects that Indian Health  Service or other agencies are likely to fund. For example, tribal  projects may be constrained by the need to obtain easements across  nontribal lands, as well as concerns about water rights.", "These challenges can make it difficult for federal and state agencies to  provide all funds available for loans and grants to communities. For  example, USDA state offices in the selected states did not have enough  applicants with projects that were ready to fund, and the offices did not  lend a total of about $193 million in loan funding available for drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure projects from fiscal years 2012  through 2016 to communities in those states. Specifically, in fiscal year  2016, USDA\u2019s state office for California was unable to lend about $21  million in available USDA loan funding to communities. USDA\u2019s state  offices for New Mexico, New York, and Tennessee each were unable to  lend about $10 million to $11 million in available USDA loan funding, and  Alaska was unable to lend about $6 million in loan funding. North  Dakota\u2019s state office, however, lent all of its available loan funding to  communities, as well as an additional $7 million for loans in fiscal year  2016. Unlike other programs we reviewed that allocate funding directly to  states, such as EPA\u2019s SRF and HUD\u2019s Community Development Block  Grant programs, USDA\u2019s Water and Waste Disposal Program allocates  funding to its state offices, which in turn loan or grant funding for projects  in local communities. The state offices must return funds that are not  obligated by August to the agency\u2019s headquarters for reallocation to other  state offices. According to USDA officials, the purpose of this process is  to ensure funds are used nationwide in an effective, timely, and efficient  manner for projects that are ready to receive funding, and the program  maintains a nationwide backlog of applications at any given time. USDA  headquarters officials said that in general, state offices return funds in  part because there are not enough projects in a state that are ready to be  funded in that fiscal year and not because of lack of need for the funding.", "Two of the selected states also had difficulties using all available SRF  program funding in recent years. In a 2014 report, EPA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General found that in California and New Mexico\u2014two of the  five states the Office of Inspector General reviewed\u201423 percent and 26  percent, respectively, of the programs\u2019 cumulative federal funding  remained unspent or unliquidated as of September 2013. According to  the report, EPA considers any state with a balance above 13 percent to  have a high unliquidated obligation balance. California\u2019s and New  Mexico\u2019s programs had $401 million in obligated funds that remained  unspent\u2014$358 million and $43 million, respectively, in unliquidated  obligations\u2014according to the report. Among other challenges, according  to the report, the Inspector General indicated that unliquidated obligations  result from states not having projects that are ready for loan execution or  from states funding projects that are not ready to proceed. Staff in all five  states reviewed indicated that they had had difficulty in the past getting  projects from applicants that were ready to proceed for funding. In  addition, EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General cited the availability of other,  more attractive funding options for potential applicants as a reason for the  difficulties issuing loans in these states. The Office of Inspector General  also found that when loans are not issued and hundreds of millions of  SRF dollars remain idle, states miss opportunities for improvements to  their communities\u2019 drinking water infrastructure.", "USDA and EPA have taken some steps at the national level to increase  the use of their funds within states. For example, USDA officials told us  that the agency offered training in 2016 for several USDA state offices  that were not using their full allocations, and USDA has started working  with EPA\u2019s national SRF program staff to improve coordination in states  that are not using their full USDA allocations. The officials also said that  they are planning further outreach to additional USDA state offices in  2017 and plan to work with some EPA regional offices. In 2014, EPA  issued a national strategy for reducing unliquidated obligations under the  Drinking Water SRF. The strategy outlined six practices for states to use  to help liquidate past years\u2019 funds and maintain lower levels of  unliquidated obligations in future years. The practices include focusing on  projects that are ready to proceed. EPA\u2019s strategy also emphasized the  importance of states\u2019 (1) solicitations of water infrastructure projects to  protect public health, (2) proactive efforts to help get projects ready to  proceed to financing, and (3) efforts to ensure that water systems within  their jurisdictions are well informed of the financing opportunities available  through the Drinking Water SRF. In 2016, EPA reported that California\u2019s  Drinking Water SRF program had made substantial progress in its effort  to quickly and efficiently expend funds; however, EPA remained  concerned about the extent of unliquidated obligations for New Mexico\u2019s  Drinking Water SRF.", "Federal and state agencies within selected states have also taken some  actions to help address some of the challenges they face in funding  projects. For example, in New York, agencies have helped address  communities\u2019 preferences for grant funding and limited financial capacity  for loans by coordinating to jointly fund projects with a combination of  grant and loan funds from different agencies. In addition, agencies have  worked together through coordinating groups to help address  communities\u2019 limited technical capacity. For example, EPA and USDA  have jointly funded training and technical assistance in Alaska to address  the technical capacity of rural drinking water and wastewater utilities.", "Furthermore, agencies have developed common application requirements  or procedures to help them address the challenge of differing  requirements among funding programs. For example, California\u2019s  coordinating group uses a common funding inquiry form, which a USDA  official said is one of the group\u2019s most effective actions and saves  applicants time. Finally, agencies have shared information and conducted  joint outreach to help address difficulties with developing a set of projects  ready for funding. For example, North Dakota\u2019s State Water Commission  takes the lead on conducting outreach to communities to identify drinking  water infrastructure projects in the state. The Commission then shares its  prioritized list of drinking water projects with other agencies, which work  together informally to discuss funding and projects. According to USDA  program officials we interviewed in North Dakota, these actions have  helped them identify and prioritize projects and provide nearly all of their  available funding to communities.", "Most recently, to help improve state-level coordination between state SRF  programs and USDA state offices on drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure project funding, EPA and USDA issued a joint  memorandum in February 2017 that outlined five coordination practices  that states\u2019 SRF programs and USDA state offices are encouraged to  use. These practices include participating in a statewide coordinating  group, conducting joint marketing or outreach, adopting common  application materials, adopting a common environmental review process,  and periodically reexamining internal processes to identify opportunities  for streamlining and increasing coordination."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Third-Party Views", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to all eight agencies for comment.

We reviewed our previous reports to  identify the agencies that provide funding or planning assistance to states  or communities for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and  identified eight agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Rural Utilities Service, the  Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration, the  Department of Defense\u2019s Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 Indian Health Service, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the  Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation. The programs  provide funding or planning assistance to states or communities for  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.", "We reviewed these programs in a nonprobability sample of 6 states\u2014 Alaska, California, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, and  Tennessee. We selected these states based on the number of federal  agencies that provided funding in the state for drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure projects, presence or absence of a formal  coordination group, and geographic diversity. Specifically, we determined  whether four federal agencies\u2014Reclamation, Corps, Indian Health  Service, and Economic Development Administration\u2014funded drinking  water and wastewater projects in each of the 50 states from fiscal years  2011 through 2015. We chose these agencies for our selection process  because EPA and USDA provide funding in all 50 states and the Federal  Emergency Management Agency and HUD could not provide state-level  data for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects. We then  identified whether states had coordinating groups. To obtain a sample of  states with geographic diversity, we sorted states by the four regions of  the United States as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. We then  selected states that either had the most federal agencies that provided  funding for projects or did not have a coordinating group, and we selected  at least 1 state from each Census region.", "The sample of states is not generalizable, and the results of our work do  not apply to all 50 states; however, they provide illustrative examples of  state infrastructure programs. Some of these federal programs are  administered directly by the federal agencies through their regional or  state offices, while others are administered by state agencies. Therefore,  our review included the federal offices and state agencies responsible for  overseeing and administering these programs. We conducted site visits to  interview federal and state officials in Alaska, California, New Mexico, and  Tennessee, and held teleconferences to interview officials in North  Dakota and New York. In addition, we interviewed federal officials from  the Denali Commission, as well as selected state officials administering  federal funds from the Appalachian Regional Commission and Delta  Regional Authority.", "To describe how federal agencies and selected states identify drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure needs, we identified federal  requirements directing EPA and Indian Health Service to collect  information on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs,  reviewed these agencies\u2019 most recent reports on needs, and interviewed  EPA and Indian Health Service officials about these efforts. We also  reviewed any national, regional, or state reports on needs issued over the  last 10 years by the other six federal agencies and the six selected states.  Specifically, we reviewed the report of a joint USDA-EPA effort to identify  the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs of certain  communities in the U.S.-Mexico border region, as well as reports on  needs issued by 4 of the selected states: New Mexico, New York,   North Dakota, and Tennessee. To conduct this work, we did not define  the concept of need or conduct an independent review of the studies that  identify needs for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, and we  did not evaluate the legitimacy of the claims. We assessed the reliability  of data in EPA\u2019s reports by reviewing documentation on data collection  and interviewing agency officials. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of estimating national needs for  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects that fall within the  scope of EPA\u2019s reports. We also assessed the reliability of data from the  Indian Health Service\u2019s report by interviewing agency officials about the  data. We determined the data were reliable for our purposes of reporting  total needs.", "To describe how the eight federal agencies have supported the selected  states in planning for future conditions that may affect drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure needs, we reviewed federal and selected state  program and planning documents, including basin studies, erosion and  sea-level rise studies, and flooding and drought response plans, and we  conducted semi-structured interviews with or obtained written responses  from federal officials and selected state officials. State agencies included  state water boards and commissions, infrastructure funding agencies, and  emergency management agencies as appropriate. We used these  documents and interviews to identify examples where federal agencies  have assisted selected states and local communities in planning for future  conditions that might affect their drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure needs.", "To describe the extent to which the eight federal agencies and selected  states have coordinated in funding projects and any challenges they face,  we reviewed federal and state program documents, interagency  agreements, and project data and interviewed federal and state agency  officials on project funding and coordination, as well as on challenges  they face in funding projects. We used this information to (1) assess  whether and how federal and state agencies have implemented leading  collaboration practices and key considerations for collaborative  mechanisms in the selected states, (2) examine whether coordination has  helped agencies efficiently use available federal funding for projects, and  (3) identify challenges to funding projects. We used key considerations  from our previous work on interagency collaborative mechanisms:  including all relevant participants, documenting written guidance and  agreements, sustaining leadership, clarifying roles and responsibilities,  bridging organizational cultures, identifying resources, and defining  outcomes and accountability. We identified actions that agencies had  taken consistent with these key considerations. We also used leading  collaboration practices from our previous work, such as identifying and  addressing needs by leveraging resources, as appropriate. To examine  whether coordination has helped agencies use available federal funding  for projects efficiently, we looked for and analyzed examples of projects  jointly funded by multiple federal programs and unfunded or delayed  projects. We obtained and analyzed funding data for fiscal year 2016 for  the eight agencies and assessed the reliability of the data by obtaining  information from agency officials. In some cases, agencies provided  obligation data, while other agencies provided budget allocation data. We  determined the data were reliable for our purposes of reporting total  funding available by agency. We reviewed a report by EPA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General on the unliquidated obligations in five state Drinking  Water SRFs.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2016 to September  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Selected States\u2019 Assessments of Their Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Needs", "paragraphs": ["Four of the six states that we selected for review developed assessments  of their drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs.

The New Mexico Department of Finance and  Administration annually collects 5-year capital improvement plans  from local governments and tribes through a web-based process. The  purpose of collecting these plans is to establish planning priorities for  anticipated capital projects and encourage entities to plan for, fund,  and develop infrastructure at a pace that sustains their activities. The  plans include time frames, estimated costs, and the details of each  proposed capital improvement project for drinking water or  wastewater infrastructure, including repair or replacement of existing  infrastructure and the development of new infrastructure. The plans  also include projects for dams and water infrastructure for agriculture,  which are excluded from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s  (EPA) assessments. The state lists the projects on its Infrastructure  Capital Improvement Plan website. In 2016, the New Mexico  Legislative Finance Committee analyzed the state and local  infrastructure capital improvement plans for 2017 to 2022 and  identified $3.2 billion in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  projects.", "New York. In 2008, New York\u2019s Departments of Health and  Environmental Conservation conducted one-time assessments of the  state\u2019s drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs over the  next 20 years. The departments conducted the drinking water study  because EPA\u2019s drinking water needs survey underreported valid  projects, and they conducted the wastewater study because of the  need to develop a sustainable infrastructure funding program at the  federal, state, and local levels. The assessments included needs that  were part of EPA\u2019s drinking water and wastewater assessments. They  also included estimates of the costs of certain other needs that EPA  excludes because they are not eligible for the EPA\u2019s State Revolving  Fund program; these include the costs to repair and replace dams  and private wells. Specifically, New York\u2019s drinking water needs  assessment estimated a cost of $533.6 million to rehabilitate the  state\u2019s approximately 511 dams used for water supply purposes, as  well as a cost of $1.8 billion to replace or rehabilitate almost all of the  state\u2019s 1.5 million private drinking water wells over the next 20 years.  In addition, the state\u2019s wastewater needs assessment estimated a  cost of $693 million to replace faulty residential septic systems in 150  municipalities with community wastewater treatment systems.  Together, the state\u2019s assessments estimated a total of $74.9 billion to  repair, replace, and update New York\u2019s existing drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure over the next 20 years.", "North Dakota. North Dakota\u2019s State Water Commission surveys  communities on their planned drinking water infrastructure projects for  the commission\u2019s biennial State Water Plan.
