A successful attack on a major seaport could potentially result  in a dramatic slowdown in the international supply chain with impacts in  the billions of dollars. Therefore, the United States and its trading  partners, have a common interest to facilitate maritime commerce and to  protect against maritime-related terrorist, criminal, or other hostile acts.", "The federal government has been active in seeking to enhance maritime  security through legislation, presidential directives, and international  agreements. As a result, the federal government has implemented  numerous programs and initiatives to help secure our nation\u2019s maritime  infrastructure, harbors, seaports, and international waterways. One of  these efforts, and the focus of this report, is Homeland Security  Presidential Directive-13 (HSPD-13), which directs the coordination of  maritime security policy through the creation of a National Strategy for  Maritime Security and supporting implementation plans. Issued in  December 2004, HSPD-13 aims to establish U.S. policy and implementation  actions to further reduce the vulnerability of the maritime domain. These  efforts are monitored by the Maritime Security Working Group, an  interagency group tasked with monitoring the implementation of the  supporting plans.

(2) Problem definition and risk assessment: addresses the particular  national problems and threats the strategy is directed towards.  (3) Goals, subordinate objectives, activities, and performance  measures: addresses what the strategy is trying to achieve and the  steps to achieve those results, as well as the priorities, milestones, and  performance measures to gauge results.  (4) Resources, investments, and risk management: addresses what the  strategy will cost, the sources and types of resources and investments  needed, and where resources and investments should be targeted by  balancing risk reductions and costs.  (5) Organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination: addresses  which organizations will be implementing the strategy, what their roles  will be compared to others, and mechanisms for them to coordinate  their efforts.  (6) Integration and implementation: addresses how a national strategy  relates to other strategies\u2019 goals, objectives, and activities, and to  subordinate levels of government and their plans to implement the  strategy.", "We believe these characteristics can assist responsible parties in further  developing and implementing national strategies, as well as enhance their  usefulness in resource and policy decisions and to better assure  accountability.

If a characteristic or an  element of a characteristic was missing from the national strategy, then we  reviewed the eight supporting implementation plans for evidence of the  characteristic in a majority of these plans. We also reviewed the plans to  determine if they provided more detail on the characteristics examined  than could be found in the national strategy, for example, what component  or agency will implement a specific recommendation. If a characteristic or  an element of a characteristic was missing from the national strategy, our  methodology required that the characteristic or element be present in at  least five of the supporting plans for the characteristic to be considered  \u201caddressed.\u201d An assessment of partially addressed meant that the  characteristic or element be present in at least one of the supporting plans.  To answer our second question, we relied on documents provided by the  Maritime Security Working Group that detailed the status of actions taken  to implement the supporting plans and the overall status of the  implementation of the plans. We also interviewed officials from key  agencies and the co-chair of the Maritime Security Working Group. We did  not independently evaluate any of the actions monitored for the  implementation of these plans.

In our 2007 review of DHS\u2019s  progress in management and mission areas, we reported that DHS had  made substantial progress in maritime security in that it had generally  achieved 17 out of 23 performance expectations. Specifically, we  reported that DHS had developed national and regional plans for DHS\u2019s  maritime security and response and a national plan for recovery, and it  had ensured the completion of vulnerability assessments and security  plans for port facilities and vessels. DHS had also developed programs for  collecting information on incoming ships and was working with the  private sector to improve and validate supply chain security. Additionally,  we reported that DHS (1) had improved security efforts by establishing  committees to share information with local port stakeholders, (2) was  taking actions to establish interagency operations centers to monitor port  activities, (3) was developing port-level plans to prevent and respond to  terrorist attacks, (4) was testing such plans through exercises, and (5) was  assessing security at foreign seaports. We further reported that DHS had  strengthened the security of cargo containers through enhancements to its  system for identifying high-risk cargo and expanding partnerships with  other countries to screen containers before they are shipped to the United  States. However, we also reported that DHS faced challenges in  implementing certain maritime security responsibilities including, for  example, a program to control access to seaports\u2019 secure areas and to  screen incoming cargo for radiation.", "In October 2007, we updated our findings when we testified on DHS\u2019s  overall maritime security efforts as they related to the Security and  Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006.

However, five of the eight supporting plans do contain information on the  methodology for how the plans were developed, and the Domestic  Outreach Plan documents that eight working groups of maritime security  stakeholders developed the eight plans supporting the national strategy\u2014 providing additional insight into the methodological development of the  plans. For example, the Maritime Security Policy Coordination Committee  is cited in the Maritime Domain Awareness and Maritime Commerce  Security plans as having the responsibility for developing the supporting  plans. This characteristic is important because if a national strategy does  not contain a complete description of the purpose, scope, and  methodology, this could reduce the document\u2019s usefulness to the  organizations responsible for implementing the strategy, as well as  organizations seeking to exercise oversight, such as the Congress.  Although the purpose and scope are described generally in the national  strategy, they are more specifically described in the supporting plans.

Without necessarily  prescribing a detailed solution, better problem definition and risk  assessment provide greater latitude to responsible parties to develop  innovative approaches that are tailored to the needs of specific regions or  sectors and can be implemented as a practical matter given fiscal, human  capital, and other limitations. The introduction to the national strategy  identifies the problem stating that the oceans support commerce and are a  source of food, resources, and recreation for the United States, and that  they also act as a barrier and a conduit for threats to our nation. All of the  supporting plans with the exception of the Domestic Outreach Plan  further define the problem relative to their own purpose.

It  also states that terrorists can develop effective attack capabilities against  maritime targets relatively quickly. The International Outreach and  Coordination Strategy and the Plan to Achieve Maritime Domain  Awareness also discuss the threats to maritime security in a manner  similar to the National Strategy for Maritime Security.

The  inclusion of this characteristic in a national strategy helps agencies and  other stakeholders to coordinate their efforts. It also helps clarify specific  roles, particularly where there is overlap, and thus can enhance both  implementation and accountability. Regarding organizational roles and  responsibilities, the national strategy indicates that the public and private  sectors share responsibility for the protection of critical infrastructure and  key resources, with DHS in the lead role. However, the strategy does not  identify the more specific roles of DHS components such as Customs and  Border Protection or the Coast Guard in the protection of critical  infrastructure or key assets.

While the national strategy does not specifically use the  term \u201cgoals\u201d in its description, it does provide a list of principles that serve  as the equivalent of goals and a hierarchy of objectives and subordinate  objectives. For example, the stated principles of the maritime security  strategy are to (1) preserve freedom of the seas, (2) facilitate and defend  commerce to ensure the uninterrupted flow of shipping, and (3) facilitate  the movement of desirable goods and people across our borders while  screening out dangerous people and material. The strategy also outlines  the steps for achieving these with subordinate objectives such as to  protect maritime-related population centers and critical infrastructures.  Furthermore, the strategy includes five strategic actions\u2014such as to  embed security into commercial practices\u2014intended to achieve further  coordination of maritime security efforts.

For example, the strategic action to \u201cEmbed Security into  Commercial Practices\u201d discusses the need to conduct vulnerability  assessments to identify defenses that require improvement and procedures  that are used to identify terrorist threats in cargo containers, but the  strategy does not contain an investment strategy for implementing this  strategic action nor does it determine how costs will be borne among the  involved parties. With the exception of the National Plan to Achieve  Maritime Domain Awareness, none of the other seven supporting plans  address the resources issue and three do not address investments. In a  November 2007 briefing regarding the status of the implementation of the  national plan, the working group identified resources and investments as  challenges in implementing the strategy. This briefing also included  recommendations to address the resource issue.

Within the goal to protect our nation from dangerous  people and goods, the FYHSP discusses several maritime security  programs that are part of the National Strategy for Maritime Security or  it supporting plans. Among these are the Container Security Initiative to  screen cargo containers for weapons before the cargo is shipped to the  United States, the C-TPAT program which works with the private sector to  improve the security standards for supply chain and container security,  and research into the development of technology to improve container  security."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Maritime Security Working Group Reports that the Implementation of Supporting Plans Varies", "paragraphs": ["Documents provided to us by the Maritime Security Working Group  indicate that the implementation of the supporting plans varies and the  working group reported one plan had been completed, another has  reached the assessment phase, a third has reached the execution phase,  and the other five plans remain primarily in the planning phase.

The working group  briefing also included recommendations to the Maritime Security Policy  Coordination Committee to address these challenges. For example, to  address the first challenge, it recommended an analysis of uncoordinated  strategies with maritime components to identify gap-closing strategies. In  response to the second challenge, the working group recommended that  additional analysis of the maritime security strategy\u2019s implementation and  coordination be conducted. The working group also identified the need to  prioritize task recommendations and develop an implementation plan  which integrates tasks into the individual plans. The working group  suggested addressing the third obstacle by evaluating the feasibility of  developing interagency priorities or an investment strategy for efforts that  are mutually supportive of implementing the National Strategy for  Maritime Security.

To answer this question, we first analyzed the National Strategy  for Maritime Security and determined whether it contains the desirable  characteristics for an effective national strategy that we identified in  February 2004. We also analyzed the unclassified versions of the strategy\u2019s  eight supporting implementation plans to determine if they provided  evidence of the characteristics contained within or missing from the  national strategy. If a characteristic or an element of a characteristic was  missing from the national strategy, our methodology required that the  characteristic or element be present in at least five of the supporting plans  for the characteristic to be considered \u201caddressed.\u201d An assessment of  \u201cpartially addressed\u201d meant that the characteristic or element was present  in at least one of the supporting plans. In our past work, we did not assess  supporting plans as part of our evaluation of the national strategies.  However, we believe it is proper to include the eight supporting plans in  our analysis of the National Strategy for Maritime Security because  Homeland Security Presidential Directive-13 (HSPD-13) directed that this  strategy and its supporting plans be produced together. Two analysts  independently reviewed the strategy and each of the supporting plans to  determine whether the National Strategy for Maritime Security  addressed each of the characteristics of an effective national strategy. Any  differences between each analyst\u2019s determinations were resolved through  discussion and a comparison of evidence.", "Our second objective was to determine the reported status of the  implementation of these plans. To describe the reported status of the  implementation actions, we reviewed spreadsheets and briefing charts  detailing the actions taken to implement the supporting plans that were  obtained from representatives of DHS, DOD, and State who, in turn, had  received them from the Maritime Security Working Group. We also  conducted interviews with officials representing lead implementation  agencies including DHS, DOD, and State, and the co-chair of the Maritime  Security Working Group. These officials provided us with the same  information on the actions taken to implement the supporting plans that  we had received from the Maritime Security Working Group. We did not  independently evaluate any of the actions reported for the implementation  of these plans; however, we have published numerous reports regarding  selected maritime security programs and initiatives that are included in the  National Strategy for Maritime Security and its supporting plans. A list of  related GAO products is included at the end of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 to June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["The report was prepared under the direction of Dawn Hoff, Assistant  Director.
