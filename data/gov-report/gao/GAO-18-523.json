The Navy originally intended to dismantle  the entire CVN 65, both nuclear and non-nuclear components, at Puget  Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (hereafter  referred to as Puget Sound Naval Shipyard), which is its usual facility for  this type of activity.

Further, the Navy has been  working on plans to address the ship-specific needs of CVN 65 for many  years. If the Navy chooses the naval shipyard option for CVN 65, it  expects to adapt and use these well-established processes to dismantle  the 28,000-ton nuclear propulsion space section at Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard. This section would contain the 8 defueled reactors and all other  nuclear-related material that remains on the ship. To separate the  propulsion space from the ship, a commercial company would perform  \u201cship-shaping\u201d to create a dedicated ship section for all of the nuclear- related work.

Officials we interviewed from companies with potential  interest in the work stated that because the Navy has not communicated  its CVN 65 requirements for a full commercial option, any commercial  approach described for the work would be hypothetical at this point,  relying on their extensive prior experience with nuclear materials  handling, packaging, shipping, and disposal\u2014including nuclear ship  maintenance and decommissioning of commercial reactors\u2014or ship  recycling.

The Navy\u2019s notional estimates  for the commercial option are a first step in establishing expectations and  will evolve as requirements for the work are better understood. The Navy  awarded a contract in July 2018 to the Center for Naval Analyses\u2014a  federally funded research and development center serving the Navy and  other defense agencies\u2014to complete a cost analysis for the full  commercial option. This effort is expected to provide the Navy with a cost  estimate for CVN 65 in October 2018, followed by a model through which  the Navy can develop cost estimates for future Nimitz-class  dismantlement and disposal efforts. The findings from the CVN 65  environmental impact statement may contribute to the final cost and  schedule estimates for either option.", "Better Fidelity in Existing Naval Shipyard Option Estimates  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard officials explained that as their planning has  progressed, they have refined their cost and schedule estimates for CVN  65 dismantlement and disposal. Overall, the Navy\u2019s cost estimates have  increased significantly from initial estimates but have been relatively  stable since 2016. The schedule went through similar fluctuations but has  steadied. Table 2 outlines changes in the shipyard\u2019s plans and how they  affected cost and schedule.", "The schedule for starting the work at the naval shipyard also changed.  Navy officials stated that as a result of the Navy\u2019s decision in early 2017  to reassess its options for CVN 65, it delayed the expected start date for  the naval shipyard option from 2019 to 2034 based on analysis of the  workload at the naval shipyard, which we discuss below.", "Although Puget Sound Naval Shipyard officials noted their cost estimate  includes some margin to account for CVN 65 being the first project of its  kind, it may not adequately account for the extent of unknown facts or  circumstances that could affect cost. For example, unrecognized  hazardous materials may exist in inaccessible areas of the CVN 65  propulsion space section that will only be discovered once the work is  underway, which could affect cost and schedule. Execution of the work in  support of a new dual reactor compartment package design also could  lead to unanticipated challenges that cause deviations from estimates.", "No Formal Estimates for Full Commercial Option  The Navy has notionally estimated cost and schedule for a full  commercial option to be $750 million to $1.4 billion and about 5 years to  complete. These estimates suggest that the commercial option could cost  less and take less time to complete than the naval shipyard option. Navy  officials stated that the notional cost estimate is derived from data  reported by nuclear power plant operators, with differences in size and  scope for the nuclear reactors incorporated. They also said that the  notional estimate will be updated once it receives additional information  from industry during the planning process.", "Navy officials told us they expect the cost per reactor for CVN 65 would  be significantly less than the NRC decommissioning average for a  commercial facility because CVN 65 reactor compartments are smaller,  the reactors are more compact, and they have already been through the  costly defueling activity. A 2016 international study on the cost of  decommissioning nuclear power plants identified several high-level  categories and their contribution to total costs for reactors  decommissioned in the United States, such as project management, site  restoration, and waste packaging, transportation, and disposal.  According to this study, about 25 percent of decommissioning costs can  be attributed to reactor decontamination and dismantling. Using this  percentage and the average cost to decommission a commercial nuclear  reactor, we estimate the cost to dismantle the eight CVN 65 defueled  reactors to range from $1.2 billion to 1.3 billion, which is at the higher end  of the Navy\u2019s notional estimated range for the full commercial option.", "In addition to the potential cost, the Navy initially projected about a 5-year  period of performance for the full commercial option based on limited  industry input. Navy officials told us the full commercial option start date,  beginning no earlier than 2024, is contingent on the finalization of the  environmental impact statement and a record of decision that chooses  this option as the Navy\u2019s path forward. The Navy\u2019s intent would be to  award a contract shortly after the environmental impact statement is  completed if the Navy decides to pursue the full commercial option.  Commercial officials told us they do not anticipate a need for significant  lead time before starting work, though the need will be better understood  once the Navy outlines requirements for the work.", "Finally, the cost for a full commercial option could be influenced by the  contract type selected by the Navy. Contract type selection is a key factor  in determining how cost risk is shared between the Navy and the  contractor. Firm-fixed-price contracts are suitable for situations where the  risk involved is minimal or can be predicted with an acceptable degree of  certainty. Conversely, cost-type contracts are used when either  requirements are not sufficiently defined or uncertainties with contract  performance do not permit costs to be sufficiently estimated to use a  fixed-price contract. Although no decision has been made, Navy officials  told us they are interested in using a firm-fixed-price contract\u2014a contract  type that has been used for commercial reactor decommissioning. Under  a firm-fixed-price contract, the contractor agrees to perform the work for a  price that is not subject to change based on the contractor\u2019s cost  experience in performing the contract, placing full responsibility for all  costs and resulting profit on the contractor. Navy officials stated that  because CVN 65 is the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to be  disposed of, the scope of the effort will need to be better defined before  they could reliably conclude that firm-fixed-price contracting would be  appropriate. Specifically, insufficiently understood risks may make  potential contractors unwilling to accept the risks associated with a firm- fixed-price contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy\u2019s Priorities for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Present Challenges Not Expected for Full Commercial Option", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has stated its priority for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is the  work associated with maintaining nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and  submarines currently in the fleet.

These delays resulted in 4,720 lost operational days  for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines. The addition of  CVN 65 would contribute to challenges in the naval shipyard\u2019s ability to  meet workload demands and further constrain its available facilities. In  comparison, despite the lack of detail about the Navy\u2019s requirements,  commercial company officials we interviewed stated they currently do not  anticipate any major workload challenges or conflicts with other ongoing  or future work in completing the work on CVN 65 based on their existing  workforce and potential facilities for performing the work.", "Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Workload and Facility Challenges  Based on our analysis of workload and resources data from Puget Sound  Naval Shipyard, we found that the shipyard consistently operates at its  maximum annual workload level and this likely will continue regardless of  the Navy\u2019s decision for CVN 65. A Naval Reactors analysis of the  shipyard\u2019s workload data also shows the workload meeting or exceeding  capacity for the foreseeable future. The shipyard\u2019s workload projections  that we reviewed show it will be working at or near capacity through fiscal  year 2025\u2014the last year for which data were available. Adding the work  associated with dismantlement and disposal of CVN 65 would put the  shipyard over current workload capacity.", "Shipyard officials explained that historically, the workload projection for a  given year matures as that year approaches, and the dips that sometimes  are depicted in future-year workload projections generally vanish.  Workload maturity or growth can be attributed to changes in the Navy\u2019s  maintenance plans, deferred maintenance, growth from the previous  year, and overall shipyard productivity. The condition of a ship when it  arrives for maintenance can also contribute to growth if inspections of  systems or components reveal a need for unplanned repairs. To account  for historical variability and improve projections of overall workload, in  2015 shipyard officials began including 10 percent in unallocated  workload to projections.", "In reviewing the shipyard workload and resources data, we also found  that the shipyard regularly underestimates workload for future years\u2014 especially 5 years or more out\u2014with workload growth for future years  consistently exceeding 15 percent. Even without the CVN 65 work at the  naval shipyard, projections show its workload with average notional  growth will meet or exceed the workforce available to complete the work,  as shown in figure 6.", "According to the Navy, it is typical for naval shipyards to continually shift  resources across projects to align worker-specific trade skills to the type  of work executed on any hull in the shipyard, at any particular time. To  achieve a level and sustainable workforce across the fiscal years, the  number of full-time employees required to support planned work is sized  as part of the total workforce. The shipyard mitigates peaks in workload  (above the available workforce) through the use of additional overtime,  loans from other naval shipyards, and contracting. When that cannot  occur, the shipyard will defer workload until it can be executed.", "The CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal work could affect the shipyard\u2019s  ability to complete active fleet maintenance. We found that the addition of  the CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal would add almost a year\u2019s worth  of work across the estimated 10-year dismantlement and disposal period  to an already busy shipyard that has demonstrated difficulties in  accurately projecting its future work. The Navy prioritizes maintenance of  the active fleet, but the scale of the CVN 65 work would reduce the  shipyard\u2019s ability to delay or reprioritize dismantlement and disposal.  Shipyard officials noted that the Navy often defers planned dismantlement  and disposal to address higher-priority active fleet maintenance. For  example, smaller submarines prepared for dismantlement can instead be  stored at the shipyard until workforce and space are available to complete  the work. However, an aircraft carrier\u2014even when reduced to a  propulsion space section as proposed for CVN 65\u2014would not offer the  same level of flexibility to defer work. CVN 65 would involve a more  extensive resource commitment because of its increased size relative to  past ship dismantlement projects and would occupy limited facilities at the  shipyard. Specifically, current plans require 3 years pier side to prepare  the propulsion space section for dismantlement and reactor compartment  disposal and about 5 years in a dry dock for the actual dismantlement.", "Further, the shipyard expects a significant increase in its submarine  inactivation and reactor compartment disposal and hull recycling workload  due to the end of service for an additional class of submarines\u2014 specifically, the Ohio-class submarines starting in 2027. The estimated  increase in inactivation and reactor recycling workload would overlap with  the planned start for CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal in 2034, if the  Navy elects to pursue this option. In addition, the shipyard already has a  backlog of 10 submarines and the ex-USS Long Beach cruiser in storage  awaiting disposal and recycling at its long-term storage facility for  defueled, decommissioned, and inactivated nuclear-powered ships.  Another 3 submarines are pier-side at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. This  backlog is not expected to subside as submarines continue to be retired,  and each vessel represents thousands of workdays that the shipyard has  to commit to its dismantlement and disposal.", "Navy and Industry Expect Full Commercial Option to Face Fewer  Challenges  While the Navy has not established specific requirements for the full  commercial option, Navy officials maintain that it does not present the  same workload and facility challenges that exist for the naval shipyard  option.

These include facilities for radioactive waste processing  and decontamination of materials for recycling. Additionally, company  officials said they anticipate that a substantial amount of the work could  be performed with the ship in the water\u2014similar to the traditional  approach used to dismantle non-nuclear vessels for recycling\u2014and  existing contractor facilities likely would not require major upgrades or  improvements other than to provide for the radiological-based waste  handling and packaging considerations.", "Commercial company officials told us that they would not expect  significant additional hiring needs based on their limited understanding of  the potential CVN 65 work and their existing workforce capacity. They  added that the nuclear dismantlement and disposal industry has an  available, qualified workforce that could easily be employed if additional  workforce were needed. Given the early stage of the Navy\u2019s planning for  CVN 65 and the Navy\u2019s lack of formal engagement with commercial  companies at the time of our review, we did not assess the current or  future commercial workforce capacity.

Budget exhibits are  prepared to justify appropriation requests and are key documents that can  be used to support congressional oversight. DOD acquisition training  materials state that well prepared budget exhibits make programs more  defensible. However, in assessing the OMN budget exhibits associated  with dismantlement activities for fiscal years 2007-2018, we found they  provide little ship-specific detail that could be used to monitor a significant  project such as the planned effort for CVN 65 dismantlement and  disposal, which may begin requesting funding as soon as fiscal year  2023.", "Specifically, we reviewed the dismantlement and disposal funding  requests from the past several years, which reside within the Navy\u2019s OMN  budget exhibits under the Ship Activations/Inactivations sub-activity group  of the Mobilization budget activity. In doing so, we found these exhibits  generally contain high-level information with a summary of funding  changes for the current fiscal year and the requested funding estimate for  the budget year.

We  found that, although not required, this information was not reflected in the  budget exhibit documents we reviewed. As another example we  previously noted, Navy officials stated that CVN 65 inactivation\u2014already  completed in December 2017\u2014cost $863 million. We could not track this  cost from the budget exhibits because of their limited detail.

Navy officials stated  that they fully fund dismantlement and disposal efforts that span multiple  fiscal years. They added that for CVN 65, the Navy may divide the work  into multiple discrete phases that are separately funded due to the  lengthy projected schedule. This approach could require the Navy to seek  OMN appropriations in several non-consecutive years. Such an approach  could make tracking CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal funding  challenging, as the total cost and any changes would be obscured among  the multiple funded activities that collectively compose the total  dismantlement and disposal effort. Navy officials acknowledged that they  could provide further information, such as total project cost and an overall  schedule for CVN 65, in the OMN budget exhibits. However, without  direction from DOD leadership or Congress, Navy officials stated that  they have no plans to deviate from providing the traditional OMN budget  exhibit information. Providing additional information in the CVN 65 budget  exhibit could enable decision makers to track total cost, any cost  changes, schedule progress, and general performance for the CVN 65  dismantlement and disposal.", "Navy Could Provide More Budget Details for CVN 65  While the Navy funds ship dismantlement and disposal from the OMN  account, budget exhibits for other accounts\u2014such as the Shipbuilding  and Conversion, Navy (SCN) account typically used for major investment  items\u2014offer examples of how to provide decision makers with more  detailed information. Budget exhibits for SCN appropriations are  structured to identify major elements of cost and track those costs over  time, consistent with DOD Financial Management Regulations. For  example, the SCN budget exhibits typically contain specific information  for each ship being procured with a distinct funding line for major cost  categories such as basic construction, propulsion, and electronics.  Additionally, these budget exhibits describe the program with specific  plans for the upcoming budget year and estimate across 5 fiscal years  (known as DOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Program), including the total  cost to complete the program. While some of the SCN budget exhibit  elements are not applicable to dismantlement and disposal, others could  be adapted and used in an OMN budget exhibit for CVN 65 to provide  information that would enable better oversight, such as work activities planned and performed by fiscal year; prior years\u2019 funding data;  future years\u2019 funding plans;  cost to complete dismantlement;  schedule of key events; and  information on the contractor(s), contract type, and contract award  and completion dates.", "Navy officials said they typically would not provide the level of detail found  in SCN budget exhibits or the exhibits for other DOD acquisition programs  because OMN exhibits are not designed to support the same level of  oversight. Unlike DOD acquisition programs, DOD projects completed  with operation and maintenance funds typically are not investment  programs and generally do not require the same level of oversight.  However, as we previously indicated, Navy officials noted that if DOD  leadership or Congress provided clear direction on what additional details  related to CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal should be included in  OMN budget exhibits, it could provide that additional information to  support oversight. Navy officials stated that given the considerable  funding needs and congressional interest with CVN 65, they were assessing options for providing specific detail in the OMN budget exhibit  for its dismantlement and disposal activities.

Officials from Naval Reactors and the Naval Sea Systems  Command confirmed that there is no reporting requirement for  performance of dismantlement and disposal of Navy ships. Navy officials  noted that dismantlement and disposal activities are included in their  annual briefings to Congress that support the Navy\u2019s budget requests, but  acknowledged that the typical comparatively low-cost ship dismantlement  and disposal activities are generally of less interest when combined with a  briefing on shipbuilding and other high-dollar acquisition investments.  This approach may be appropriate for submarine dismantlement and  disposal activities that have lower costs, shorter periods of performance,  and a well-established history. However, the magnitude of CVN 65\u2019s  anticipated cost of dismantlement and disposal is comparable to that of  large DOD acquisition programs. Such programs generally are expected  to provide more information to decision makers within DOD and Congress  through formal reporting on plans, activities, and performance to support  accountability than what has traditionally been provided with respect to  Navy dismantlement and disposal activities.", "The precedent-setting nature of the CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal  adds a level of risk and heightens the importance of having sufficient  accountability measures to facilitate oversight. There is greater potential  for unexpected challenges to arise because a nuclear-powered aircraft  carrier has not been dismantled and disposed of before. Additionally,  CVN 65 provides an opportunity to establish a foundation for  management and oversight of future aircraft carrier dismantlement and  disposal efforts, with the first of 10 Nimitz-class carriers expected to reach  the end of its service life in the next decade. Standards for internal control  in federal government state that in order to identify and mitigate risk,  program objectives such as a baseline for cost and schedule, should be  clearly defined in measurable terms so performance in attempting to  achieve those objectives can be assessed. Doing so would also provide  the Navy with the ability to collect important historical cost data that could  be used to inform cost estimates for future aircraft carrier dismantlement  and disposal efforts.", "DOD acquisition programs could serve as a model to identify appropriate  cost and schedule objectives for the CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal,  even though it is not an acquisition program and not subject to these  requirements. DOD acquisition programs with significant resource  commitments comparable to that expected of CVN 65 are generally  subject to structured oversight and have reporting requirements to  support performance transparency and accountability. As discussed  earlier, preliminary cost estimates for CVN 65 dismantlement and  disposal may exceed $1 billion, regardless of the option the Navy  ultimately selects. While many requirements for DOD acquisition  programs are not relevant to dismantlement and disposal, even when  costs may reach similar levels, we found elements of the reporting  requirements associated with larger DOD acquisition category (ACAT)  programs that the Navy could leverage to facilitate oversight of CVN 65  dismantlement and disposal. For example, ACAT II programs\u2014which  have estimated costs comparable to CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal  cost expectations\u2014are required by DOD policy to establish a program  cost and schedule baseline prior to program start and report any  significant deviations from the established baseline. They also are  required by statute to provide information on risk management. Table 3  highlights some DOD acquisition program reporting elements that could  support oversight of CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal.", "For example, once a cost baseline is established, comparison to an  independent cost estimate or assessment could provide greater  assurance that the risks associated with performing CVN 65\u2019s large-scale,  first-of-a-kind dismantlement activities were adequately considered and  appropriately estimated. GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide  states an independent review of a program\u2019s cost estimate is crucial to  establishing confidence in the estimate. It provides an unbiased test of  whether the program cost estimate is reasonable and can be used to  identify risks related to budget shortfalls or excesses. The Naval Center  for Cost Analysis is responsible for developing independent cost  assessments for ACAT II Navy programs, while the Office of the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s Office of Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation develops independent cost estimates for major defense  programs.", "As noted earlier, the Navy continues to refine its cost estimate of the  naval shipyard option and expects to receive an estimate for the full  commercial option from the Center for Naval Analyses in October 2018.  The Navy stated it considers the anticipated cost estimate and model  from the Center for Naval Analyses to be the independent cost estimate  for the full commercial option. We view this estimate as a valuable step in  establishing cost expectations for the full commercial option, but believe it  is inadequate because it will determine the Navy\u2019s cost expectations as  opposed to validating an existing estimate\u2014the intent of having an  independent assessment. For the naval shipyard option, the Navy  suggested no plans for an independent cost estimate as it continues to  refine the current cost estimate prior to a decision for CVN 65.  Completing an independent cost estimate for both CVN 65 options prior  to a Navy decision on its dismantlement and disposal approach would  provide additional information to inform a decision that could have  repercussions for carrier dismantlement and disposal activities for years  to come. Adapting certain acquisition program requirements to the CVN  65 effort, as described above, would help the Navy establish baselines  that can be tracked by decision makers to assess cost and schedule, and  help identify deviations, if any.

For example, Naval Reactors officials noted  they commonly have used facilities licensed by NRC or agreement states   for a range of manufacturing, processing, and disposal activities available  for naval nuclear materials. Naval Reactor officials specifically assert that,  as CVN 65 has already been defueled, such a facility should be able to  process the byproduct material on the ship. However, NRC stated its  disagreement that it or an agreement state is able to serve as the  regulatory authority for CVN 65, emphasizing that regulatory responsibility  for the safe processing and disposal of Navy ships falls to Naval Reactors  under its Department of Energy authority.

Without a resolution, the Navy could face challenges in  estimating the cost and completing a comprehensive business case  analysis of costs, benefits, and risks for the full commercial option if it is  unsure of which regulatory authority will be responsible for enforcement.  Furthermore, companies with potential interest in the CVN 65 work may  not be able to effectively estimate the workload and associated cost  without a clearly identified regulatory authority.

Naval Reactors noted this  facility is now obsolete, with no further use  planned, and the Navy is interested in  dismantling and disposing of it commercially.    According to Naval Reactors officials, the  barge contains very low radioactivity in the  water pool and fluid systems, which requires  appropriate dismantlement and disposal  measures.   The Navy halted its pursuit of a contract  award to dismantle and dispose of the barge  in early 2017 based on NRC formally stating  it has no regulatory authority over the  dismantlement and disposal of naval vessels.  A Naval Reactors official stated a request for  information may be issued in 2018 to solicit  input from commercial companies for  dismantlement and disposal of this barge, but  plans remain unsettled.", "Naval Reactors could use its own authority to regulate a full commercial  dismantlement of CVN 65.

In  particular, Naval Reactors officials stated that for the full commercial  option, their responsibility to provide for processing and disposal of the  byproduct material\u2014which Naval Reactors indicated is what remains on  CVN 65\u2014can be best met by contracting with commercial companies  licensed by NRC or an agreement state.", "According to Naval Reactors officials, even if NRC maintains that it  cannot regulate material from CVN 65, some states may do so under their  own authority. Specifically, Naval Reactors\u2019 position is that states that had  agreements with the old Atomic Energy Commission prior to its  abolishment and the creation of NRC in 1974 were granted\u2014and  continue to maintain\u2014authority to process naval nuclear propulsion  waste. Accordingly, Naval Reactors officials stated that these states could  serve as the sole regulatory authority over commercially-performed CVN  65 dismantlement and disposal.", "Naval Reactors officials also asserted specific potential advantages of  having NRC or an agreement state regulate commercial dismantlement  and disposal of CVN 65. First, they said the regulatory structure that NRC  and agreement states apply to commercial nuclear-related activities  includes an enforcement process to impose fines for violations, which  Naval Reactors does not have.", "Additionally, Naval Reactors officials noted the Navy\u2019s contract strategy  options could be improved if NRC or an agreement state serves as the  regulatory authority for CVN 65. Specifically, they stated that a reason for  the Navy\u2019s interest in using NRC or agreement state authority is the  possibility of emulating the firm-fixed-price contract currently being used  to decommission a commercial nuclear power plant. In this example, the  operating license was transferred from the utility that owns the plant and  site to a dismantlement contractor to more quickly complete the  decommissioning. This effectively gave a dismantlement and disposal  company the power plant owner\u2019s responsibility for the safe  dismantlement and disposal of the power plant, with NRC continuing to  act as the regulatory authority. According to Naval Reactors, the firm- fixed-price contract used in this case was viable because the  dismantlement contractor had total responsibility independent of the plant  owner to perform the work in accordance with the regulations and  requirements of NRC. Naval Reactors officials stated that the firm-fixed- price contract created an incentive for the company to thoroughly  understand what the work entailed and perform the work efficiently to  maximize its profit.", "Naval Reactors officials stated that a total separation of the owner from  regulatory decisions and interpretations, like the one currently being used  for the commercial nuclear power plant, is the Navy\u2019s best means to  facilitate the potential use of a firm-fixed-price dismantlement contract for  CVN 65. They further stated that an approach wherein Naval Reactors  retained regulatory authority could undercut the prospect of a firm-fixed- price contract by eliminating the clear division between regulator and  owner. In taking this position, Naval Reactors officials suggest that a  conflict of interest exists in being both the owner who wants to establish a  fixed price for the work as well as the regulator with the potential to affect  costs. Naval Reactors officials also noted that if Naval Reactors were the  regulator, with no experience in regulating this type of work, commercial  companies could have difficulty pricing such regulatory risk. In contrast,  they stated that in NRC-regulated commercial plant dismantlement, as  well as agreement state-regulated, large-scale radioactive waste  processing work, commercial companies have demonstrated that they are  willing to accept this regulatory risk, agreeing to contracts on a fixed-price  basis.", "Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s Position  In February 2017, NRC formally stated its position in a letter responding  to a congressional inquiry that it has no regulatory authority for Navy  ships, such as CVN 65. NRC said that under the Atomic Energy Act it is  the responsibility of the Department of Energy, and accordingly Naval  Reactors, to provide for processing and disposal of naval nuclear  propulsion waste. NRC stated that agreement states also lack  jurisdiction because their authority derives from NRC\u2019s authority. NRC  officials we interviewed also disputed Naval Reactors\u2019 position that states  have independent authority to process naval nuclear propulsion waste for  two reasons. First, they stated that regulation of reactor dismantlement is  not an activity that can be relinquished to the states. Second, they  pointed out that the authorities that can be relinquished to the states  under the Atomic Energy Act are licensing activities conducted under  specific provisions of the act, and that the responsibility to safely process  and dispose of naval nuclear propulsion waste is conducted under a  different set of provisions which are not subject to licensing.", "NRC officials acknowledged that naval nuclear propulsion waste has  been processed at facilities licensed by NRC or an agreement state, but  distinguished such examples from CVN 65. Specifically, they noted that  no additional regulatory oversight was required to process incidental  amounts of such waste at facilities licensed to process commercial waste,  but CVN 65 is not licensed by NRC or an agreement state and would  involve only naval nuclear propulsion waste. NRC officials emphasized  that the additional work that would be required to regulate the  dismantlement of CVN 65\u2014an unlicensed facility\u2014puts it beyond NRC\u2019s  jurisdiction. Additionally, NRC stated that while such work could be  carried out by a contractor, including a contractor with an NRC or  agreement state license, the work would not be covered by that license,  as NRC and agreement states do not have authority to regulate such  activity. Essentially, NRC\u2019s position is that while Naval Reactors can  contract to have the dismantlement and disposal performed by a  commercial entity, Naval Reactors would retain its own regulatory  responsibility for enforcing that contract.", "NRC stated that if Naval Reactors desired technical support in regulating  a commercial dismantlement, NRC or an agreement state could provide  such services through a contract. This approach, according to NRC  officials, would offer Naval Reactors a regulatory consultant familiar with  commercial dismantlement while maintaining Naval Reactors as the  regulatory enforcement authority. In such an arrangement, NRC or an  agreement state could identify regulatory concerns, but Naval Reactors  would be responsible for determining what corrective action is taken to  address those concerns. Naval Reactors officials stated they are in  ongoing discussions with NRC about this potential approach.

It also cannot rely on the organizational structure and practices in  place at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to support a commercial CVN 65  dismantlement that will be conducted at an offsite facility.

This  process, which is commonly used to dismantle commercial nuclear power  reactors, involves segmenting reactor components (i.e., cutting to reduce  in size) so the pieces can be put in standardized containers for transport  and disposal. This process is a contrast to the traditional dismantlement  approach that Nuclear Reactors uses at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard\u2014 an approach that would leave CVN 65\u2019s reactors largely intact by  encasing them in packages for disposal. As noted by Naval Reactors  officials, commercial dismantlement practices potentially could require the  Navy to decide whether to adjust its standard radiological work practices  to better align with different dismantlement and disposal activities or use  the same practices it uses for work performed at Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard. Using the same practices could affect cost expectations for the  Navy and commercial companies by changing the way the work is  performed.

We interviewed Navy officials and reviewed documentation  from the Naval Sea Systems Command, which includes Naval Reactors,  and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility  (hereafter referred to as Puget Sound Naval Shipyard). To obtain an  understanding of the full commercial dismantlement and disposal  approach, including work practices and potential work sites, we  interviewed officials and reviewed documentation from commercial  companies that the Navy identified as having involvement in shipbreaking  or nuclear-related industries and potential interest in CVN 65. These  companies include Atkins Global; EnergySolutions; Huntington Ingalls  Industries (HII \u2013 Nuclear); International Shipbreaking Limited; NorthStar  Group Services; and Waste Control Specialists.", "For CVN 65 cost and schedule estimates, the Navy considers all  estimates to still be preliminary because the Navy has yet to formally  begin the environmental impact statement process and remains years  away from a decision on its dismantlement and disposal approach. As a  result, we did not formally evaluate the reasonableness of any cost or  schedule estimates. However, we did review the initial estimates to gain  insight on historical and current cost expectations. To assess the Navy\u2019s  preliminary cost estimates for the naval shipyard option, we reviewed  Navy data on the basis for the cost estimates, particularly estimates since  2011. This included reviewing the cost factors that contributed to each  estimate to understand how the shipyard\u2019s increasing knowledge of CVN  65\u2019s ship characteristics and changes to the planned dismantlement  approach fed into the different estimates. For the Navy\u2019s notional cost  estimate of the CVN 65 full commercial option, we reviewed the data and  approach used by the Navy to develop initial cost information. This  included commercial decommissioning data, which the Navy used to  establish a rough order of magnitude cost estimate based on the limited  information available that is comparable to CVN 65 dismantlement and  disposal.", "We used the same data to generate our own notional estimated cost  range based on a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) cost formula,  as well as published data from the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development\u2019s Nuclear Energy Agency. This included  analysis of costs reported by operating power reactor licensees in NRC\u2019s  2015 decommissioning funding status report to comply with  decommissioning financial assurance reporting requirements. Our review  of historical data from the Nuclear Energy Agency and a 2011 report on  nuclear decommissioning by an independent panel established by the  California Public Utilities Commission helped us identify cost drivers and  categories of costs attributed to specific activities that occur when  decommissioning commercial power plants.", "To assess workload and facility considerations related to CVN 65, we  analyzed Puget Sound Naval Shipyard workload and resource  requirements data for fiscal years 2006 through 2025, and facility data for  fiscal years 2018 through 2035. To assess the reliability of these data, we  interviewed knowledgeable officials and reviewed documentation to verify  the controls and measures used to validate and maintain the data. We  determined these data to be reliable for our purposes of discussing the  existing and planned workload at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. We  compared projections to actual workload when available to identify  differences and compared the average amount of annual projected  workload to the average amount of annual projected workforce available.  We also reviewed a 2018 report on the Navy\u2019s strategic plan for  addressing the infrastructure deficiencies at the public naval shipyards as  well as the Navy\u2019s long-range shipbuilding plans for fiscal years 2011,  2016, and 2019.

We also  reviewed Federal Acquisition Regulations, Office of Management and  Budget guidance on budget information, and the Department of Defense  and Navy acquisition regulations. We interviewed officials from Naval  Reactors and the Program Executive Office for Aircraft Carriers. Based  on these efforts, we evaluated the Navy\u2019s historical approach for funding,  conducting oversight, and reporting on dismantlement and disposal  activities. We assessed the Navy\u2019s approach against federal standards  for internal control. Additionally, we assessed how funding and typical  reporting requirements for Department of Defense acquisition programs  align with the potential need to facilitate oversight for CVN 65  dismantlement and disposal.", "To determine the effect that nuclear regulatory authority considerations  have on dismantlement and disposal for CVN 65, we examined applicable  laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, and guidance documents  related to nuclear-powered ships.
