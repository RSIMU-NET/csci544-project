The act requires that tobacco manufacturers submit information to be reviewed by FDA in order to market new tobacco products and established tobacco user fees to fund FDA's tobacco-related activities. The act represents the first time that FDA has had the authority to regulate tobacco products.", "Manufacturers have raised concerns about the progress of CTP, the FDA center established by the act to implement its provisions. GAO was asked to examine CTP's review of new tobacco product submissions, responses to meeting requests, and use of funds. This report examines (1) the status of CTP's reviews of new tobacco product submissions; (2) how CTP responded to manufacturers' and other entities' meeting requests, and the length of time CTP took to hold the meetings; and (3) the extent to which FDA has spent its tobacco user fee funds. GAO analyzed data regarding submissions received by FDA as of January 7, 2013; reviewed data on meeting requests, spending plans, and amounts obligated; and interviewed CTP and tobacco industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of January 7, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) had finished initial, but not final, review steps for most of about 3,800 submissions for new tobacco products (those not on the market on February 15, 2007). Ninety-nine percent of the submissions received by FDA were made under the substantial equivalence (SE) pathway. CTP determines whether the new tobacco product in an SE submission has the same characteristics as a predicate tobacco product (a product commercially marketed in the United States on February 15, 2007, or previously found by FDA to be substantially equivalent) or has different characteristics that do not raise different questions of public health. Initial review steps include CTP's determination of whether the new product is a type regulated by FDA and whether the submission is missing information. For most SE submissions, CTP took more than a year and a half from the date a submission was received to the date these initial steps were completed. Of the 3,788 SE submissions, 3,165 were received by FDA prior to a statutory deadline (March 22, 2011) allowing the product to be marketed unless CTP finds that they are not substantially equivalent. SE submissions received after that date cannot be marketed until CTP determines they are substantially equivalent. In late June 2013, CTP made a final decision on 6 of the 3,788 SE submissions, finding that 2 of the products were substantially equivalent and that 4 were not; the remaining submissions were still undergoing CTP review. CTP officials and manufacturers told GAO that several factors (such as CTP requests for additional information from manufacturers for submissions and having to hire and train new staff) impacted the time it took CTP to review SE submissions. While CTP is working to address these factors by, for example, disseminating information to manufacturers to improve submission quality and developing training for staff, CTP does not have performance measures that include time frames for making final decisions on submissions by which to assess its progress. Without time frames, CTP is limited in its ability to evaluate policies, procedures, and staffing resources in relation to its review process and, in turn, is limited in its ability to reasonably assure efficiency and effectiveness.", "A variety of outside entities (such as manufacturers) have requested meetings with CTP to discuss new tobacco product submissions, public health activities, and other issues, and four CTP offices have received meeting requests. Those offices granted more meetings (72) than they denied (22) of all the meeting requests they received through January 7, 2013. The number of calendar days from the date a meeting was requested to the date it was held ranged from 1 to 262 days, and the averages among the four offices ranged from 51 to 97 days.", "FDA spent (obligated) less than half of the nearly $1.1 billion in tobacco user fees it collected from manufacturers and others through the end of fiscal year 2012; $603 million of these user fees remained unspent and, thus, remained available to CTP. CTP spent substantially less than planned in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. CTP had planned on spending a total of $611 million for fiscal year 2012; instead, the center spent $272 million for that year. CTP officials told GAO that the time it took to award contracts contributed to the center spending less than planned. For example, CTP planned to award a $145 million contract in fiscal year 2012 for a public health education campaign, but most of that amount was not awarded until the first quarter of fiscal year 2013."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA establish performance measures that include time frames for making decisions on new tobacco product submissions and that the agency monitor performance relative to those time frames.

We calculated the number of calendar days to  complete key steps in the review process and the number of days a  submission was pending in a particular step in the process. In addition,  we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents (such as  guidance documents and draft standard operating procedures) and we  viewed CTP webinars on new tobacco product submissions. We also  interviewed OS officials to learn about the process for tracking and  reviewing submissions, and to identify factors that contributed to the time  CTP took to review new tobacco product submissions. We compared  CTP\u2019s review processes against internal control standards, which specify  that performance measures such as time frames and the monitoring of  actual performance against measures are an integral part of operating  efficiently, achieving effective results, and planning appropriately.

For each of the four offices, we analyzed data  provided by officials from the office on meeting requests received as of  January 7, 2013, including the date requests were received and the date  meetings were held. We analyzed the data from each of the four offices  separately because the data maintained by each office varied. For  example, OS officials only maintain data on the date the meeting request  was received by FDA while OP officials maintain data on the date the  meeting request was received by FDA and by OP. We analyzed the  number of meeting requests granted, denied, transferred, withdrawn, and  pending. We also analyzed the number of calendar days from the date  the request was received by FDA or a specific CTP office, depending on  available data, to the date the meeting was held. Finally, we reviewed a  relevant FDA guidance document, and interviewed officials from each of  the four CTP offices to learn about the processes for scheduling and  holding meetings.", "To examine on the extent to which FDA has spent its tobacco user fee  funds, we reviewed FDA\u2019s data, including information from CTP on  tobacco user fees from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, such as the amounts collected by FDA  and the amounts spent by all seven CTP offices: Office of Management, Office of Regulations, and Office of Health  Communication and Education. We analyzed these data to determine  how collection related to spending over time. Further, we reviewed FDA  and CTP documents, such as FDA budget justification documents, CTP\u2019s  spend plan (which is used by CTP to identify its plans for spending user  fee funds on staffing, acquisitions, and operational needs), and CTP  quarterly reports to Congress (which describe CTP\u2019s implementation of  the Tobacco Control Act provisions).", "OS, OCD, OCE, OP,  We assessed the reliability of FDA data we received by reviewing related  documentation, performing data reliability checks (such as examining the  data for missing values), and interviewing CTP officials.

There are two types of  submissions made under the SE pathway\u2014provisional and regular\u2014 that are defined by the date that the product came on the market and  when the manufacturer made the submission. For provisional SE  submissions, a manufacturer may market the new product that is the  subject of the submission while CTP conducts its review of the  submission, but for regular SE submissions, a manufacturer may not  market the new product until CTP completes its review and  determines that the product meets the SE requirements. (See   table 2.)", "Exemption from SE pathway: Manufacturers make a submission  under the Exemption from SE pathway if (1) the new product is a  minor modification (adding, deleting, or changing the quantity of an  additive) of another tobacco product marketed by the same  manufacturer; (2) an SE submission is not necessary to ensure that  permitting the tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate  for the protection of public health; and (3) an Exemption from SE is  otherwise appropriate.", "Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) pathway:  Manufacturers make a submission under the PMTA pathway if the  new tobacco product does not meet the criteria of the SE or  Exemption from SE pathways\u2014that is, the new tobacco product is not  substantially equivalent to a predicate product or is not a minor  modification of an appropriate product for modification.

These scientists work to determine whether the product is substantially  equivalent to a product already on the market\u2014that is, has the same  characteristics as a predicate tobacco product, or has different  characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health.  During scientific review, OS may issue scientific AI letters to request  additional information that the scientists determine is needed to make a  final determination (such as clarification of ingredients and additional  testing results). In these letters, CTP officials told us that OS requests  that manufacturers respond within 60 days. If OS determines that the SE  criteria have been met, then CTP will issue an SE order, and the product  may continue being marketed by the manufacturer (if it was a provisional  SE submission) or may be legally introduced into the U.S. market (if it  was a regular SE submission). If neither of these criteria is met, then CTP  will issue an order that the product is not substantially equivalent and the  manufacturer must remove the product from the market (if it was a  provisional SE submission) or cannot introduce the product into the  market under the SE pathway (if it was a regular SE submission).", "According to CTP officials, reviews of Exemption from SE and PMTA  submissions also include jurisdiction, completeness, and scientific review  steps.

CTP has provided additional direction to  manufacturers in an attempt to decrease delays due to agency requests  for more information through AI letters. Specifically, it has held webinars  and published frequently asked questions to provide more guidance to  manufacturers that prepare submissions. Additionally, CTP officials told  us that in November 2012 CTP began alerting manufacturers of  upcoming scientific review of their submissions by issuing a notification to  manufacturers 45 days prior to starting scientific review. According to  CTP officials, this notification reminds manufacturers of the option to  amend their submissions as needed prior to the start of scientific review,  to facilitate higher quality submissions, and potentially avoid delays in  scientific review due to the issuance of scientific AI letters. CTP also  noted that it is working on a standardized form for manufacturers to use  when submitting new tobacco product information for review. According  to CTP officials, this form may take time to develop as it will require FDA  to issue regulations, but CTP officials anticipate that, when implemented,  a standardized form should improve review times. To address the  shortage of staff available for reviews, CTP officials told us they have  increased OS staff from 12 staff in June 2010 to more than 100 staff in  January 2013, including scientists and project managers involved in  submission reviews.

They also reported that CTP plans to transition to a new IT system in late  2013.", "Our analysis of data provided by CTP found that for regular SE  submissions the length of time from the end of jurisdiction review through  the end of completeness review improved over time. Among regular SE  submissions received by FDA in fiscal year 2011 and for which CTP had  finished completeness review as of January 7, 2013, the length of time  from the end of jurisdiction review to the end of completeness review  ranged from about 3 months to 1.5 years, with a median length of time of  about 8 months. In contrast, the length of time for these steps for regular  SE submissions received in fiscal year 2012 ranged from less than 1 day  to 11 months, with a median of about 2 months. CTP officials reported  that actions such as hiring review staff and providing training for review  staff have resulted in improved review times.", "While CTP is moving forward with its reviews of SE submissions and  efforts to improve review times, CTP does not have time frames for  reaching a final decision on submissions. Time frames would allow CTP  to evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness and help it make appropriate  adjustments. Under federal standards for internal control, control activities  that establish performance measures, such as time frames, and the  monitoring of actual performance against measures are an integral part of  operating efficiently, achieving effective results, and planning  appropriately. There are no time frames set by statute for the SE  pathway, and CTP has not established performance measures that  include time frames for making final decisions on the review of SE  submissions. Although CTP officials agreed that establishing time frames  would be useful for performance evaluation, CTP has not identified  specific plans to establish such time frames. According to CTP officials,  they have not yet established time frames because they first need to  collect and analyze information about how long each review step should  take. Yet without time frames, CTP is limited in its ability to evaluate  policies, procedures, and staffing resources in relation to its review  process and this, in turn, limits CTP\u2019s ability to reasonably assure  efficiency and effectiveness. As a result, CTP is limited in its ability to  determine the adjustments needed to make improvements. For example,  CTP is limited in its ability to evaluate whether OS staff are performing  efficiently and effectively in relation to specific review steps, and as a  result, CTP may not appropriately make adjustments such as changing  an individual staff member\u2019s responsibilities or increasing the number of  available staff."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CTP Granted Most Meeting Requests, but the Time from Request to Date Held Varied Widely", "paragraphs": ["As of January 7, 2013, CTP granted more meetings than it denied.

Specifically, they reported that the time it took to award contracts resulted  in CTP not spending the funds that the center planned to spend for a  given fiscal year. For example, according to CTP officials, CTP\u2019s Office of  Health Communication and Education had planned to award a $55 million  contract for communications support services for part of its public  education campaign for fiscal year 2011.

However, most of the planned $200 million  total was not awarded until the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.officials told us that both contracts were not awarded at these amounts in  fiscal year 2011 or 2012 as planned because CTP and FDA spent  significant amounts of time to determine the structure of the contract as  FDA had never conducted a public education campaign of this  magnitude.", "Spending for other contracts for both fiscal years 2011 and 2012 was  lower than expected for a number of reasons, according to CTP officials:  fewer than expected contracts were awarded, the scope of a contract  changed, or CTP was short of staff to support the work of the contract.", "For fiscal year 2011, CTP\u2019s OCE had planned to award $55 million in  contracts with states to ensure compliance with tobacco regulations,  but CTP awarded a total of $24 million for that fiscal year because  fewer states participated than expected.", "For fiscal year 2012, CTP\u2019s OS entered into an interagency  agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  develop analytical methods and establish baseline levels of harmful or  potentially harmful constituents in tobacco products for $20 million  less than planned because of a change in scope of the activities for  this contract.", "For fiscal year 2011, CTP\u2019s Office of Health Communication and  Education entered into an interagency agreement with the National  Institutes of Health to support regulatory communications activities.  The agreement was $3.5 million less than initially planned because  the Office of Health Communication and Education was just being  established at the time and it did not have enough staff to support this  joint effort. As a result, the office reduced the scope of the contract.", "In addition to issues related to contracting, CTP officials said that plans to  hire more staff than it did and planned management related activities that  were not undertaken were other reasons why the amounts spent were  lower than planned. According to CTP officials, for fiscal years 2011 and  2012, CTP had planned to hire more staff than it did and this accounted  for $6 million and $10 million of the differences between amounts planned  to be spent and spent, respectively. Further, according to CTP officials,  lower than planned spending for other management activities (such as  computer updates and planning potential reorganization) is another  reason why the amounts spent by CTP were lower than planned. For  example, for fiscal year 2011, the CTP spend plan included $35 million for  planning associated with establishing two new offices within CTP.  According to CTP officials, this amount was expected to cover  contingencies, such as computer updates or management development,  if they were needed.

Although CTP has finished initial review steps for most of these  submissions, as of June 2013, the center made a final decision on only   6 submissions and the time taken on reviews has been significant.  Certainly, insufficient information provided by manufacturers in  submissions, the prioritization of regular SE submission reviews over  provisional SE submissions, and other factors have contributed to the  time CTP has taken in its reviews. Yet, as CTP moves forward with its  work, the lack of performance measures like time frames for reviews of  SE submissions will limit CTP\u2019s ability to evaluate policies, procedures,  and staffing resources in relation to CTP\u2019s submission review process  and, in turn, limit CTP\u2019s ability to reasonably assure efficient operations  and effective results.
