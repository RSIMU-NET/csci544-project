In addition to base closures, many recommendations involve realignments, such as returning forces to the United States from bases overseas and creating joint bases. However, anticipated savings remained an important consideration in justifying the need for the 2005 BRAC round. The House report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed GAO to monitor BRAC implementation. Therefore, GAO assessed (1) challenges that might affect timely completion of recommendations, (2) any changes in DOD's reported cost and savings estimates since fiscal year 2008, and (3) the potential for estimates to continue to change. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the services' BRAC offices, and the Army Corps of Engineers; visited installations implementing some of the more costly realignments or closures; and analyzed BRAC budget data for fiscal years 2008 and 2009."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has made progress in implementing the BRAC 2005 round but faces challenges in its ability to meet the September 15, 2011, statutory completion deadline. DOD expects almost half of the 800 defense locations implementing BRAC recommendations to complete their actions in 2011; however, about 230 of these almost 400 locations anticipate completion within the last 2 weeks of the deadline. Further, some of these locations involve some of the most costly and complex BRAC recommendations, which have already incurred some delays and thus have little leeway to meet the 2011 completion date if any further delays occur. Also, DOD must synchronize relocating about 123,000 personnel with an estimated $23 billion in facilities that are still being constructed or renovated, but some delays have left little time in DOD's plans to relocate these personnel by the deadline. Finally, delays in interdependent recommendations could have a cascading effect on other recommendations being completed on time. OSD recently issued guidance requiring the services and defense agencies to provide status briefings to improve oversight of issues affecting timely implementation of BRAC recommendations. However, this guidance did not establish a regular briefing schedule or require the services to provide information about possible mitigation measures for any BRAC recommendations at risk of not meeting the statutory deadline. DOD's fiscal year 2009 BRAC budget submission shows that DOD plans to spend more to implement recommendations and save slightly less compared to the 2008 BRAC budget. DOD's 2009 estimate of one-time costs to implement this BRAC round increased by $1.2 billion to about $32.4 billion. Net annual recurring savings estimates decreased by almost $13 million to about $4 billion. Also, GAO's calculations of net present value, which includes both expected cost and savings over a 20-year period ending in 2025 and takes into account the time value of money, show that implementing the 2005 BRAC recommendations is expected to save $13.7 billion. This compares to an estimated $15 billion in net present value savings based on last year's BRAC budget and the BRAC Commission's reported estimate of about $36 billion. Although DOD is about 3? years into the 6-year implementation period, the potential remains for BRAC cost estimates to continue to increase, but the potential for changes in savings estimates is unclear. Greater than expected inflation and increased market demands for construction materials could cause estimated construction costs to increase, although the extent of this increase is uncertain given today's economic market conditions. However, the potential for changes in savings estimates is unclear because BRAC headquarters officials at both the Army and the Air Force told us they do not plan to update their savings estimates regardless of factors that may cause those estimates to change, and OSD is not enforcing its own regulation requiring them to do so. Hence, congressional and defense decision makers could be left with an unrealistic sense of the savings this complex and costly BRAC round may actually produce, an issue that could be important in considering whether another round of BRAC may be warranted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This dollar amount is based on DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget submission to Congress to  pay for continuing implementation of recommendations from prior BRAC rounds   (BRAC 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995). This amount does not include other BRAC associated  costs such as costs to complete environmental cleanup at BRAC bases in future years and  costs incurred by other DOD and federal agencies to provide assistance to communities  and individuals impacted by BRAC. DOD\u2019s budget submission is reported in current dollars  (i.e., includes projected inflation).", "The relocation of about 15,000 U.S. military personnel from various overseas locations to  the United States is included in the BRAC 2005 recommendations.

Moreover, both DOD and the  BRAC Commission reported that their primary consideration in making  recommendations for the BRAC 2005 round was military value. As such,  many of the BRAC 2005 recommendations involve complex realignments,  such as designating where military forces returning to the United States  from overseas bases would be located; establishing joint military medical  centers; creating joint bases; and reconfiguring the defense supply,  storage, and distribution network. DOD is required to implement all BRAC  2005 recommendations by September 15, 2011.", "However, anticipated savings resulting from implementing  recommendations remained an important consideration in justifying the  need for the 2005 BRAC round. In 2001 testimony before Congress, the  Secretary of Defense stated that another BRAC round would generate  recurring savings the department could use for other defense programs,  and that the BRAC Commission expected that the round would save about   $36 billion over a 20-year period ending in 2025. Nonetheless, to realize  savings from BRAC, DOD must first invest billions of dollars in facility  construction, renovation, and other up-front expenses to implement the  BRAC recommendations to produce the projected savings that DOD could  then redirect to other priorities.", "Because of concerns about the progress DOD is making in implementing  the BRAC 2005 recommendations, the House Armed Services Committee  report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2008 directed the Comptroller General to monitor the  implementation of recommendations for the 2005 round of closures and  realignments of military installations made pursuant to section 2914 of the  Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. We prepared this  report to (1) assess the challenges DOD faces that might affect the  implementation of the BRAC recommendations by the statutory  completion deadline in 2011, (2) analyze how DOD\u2019s reported cost and  savings estimates have changed in the fiscal year 2009 BRAC budget  request compared to the fiscal year 2008 budget request, and (3) evaluate  the potential for BRAC cost and savings estimates to continue to change as  DOD proceeds with BRAC implementation.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant documentation  including business plans, DOD presentations on BRAC implementation  status, and prior GAO reports, and interviewed officials in the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment)  responsible for overseeing BRAC implementation and associated BRAC  implementation offices in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. To assess  the challenges DOD faces that might affect the implementation of the  BRAC recommendations by the statutory completion deadline in 2011, we  focused our work on recommendations that have significant actions such  as construction and movement of personnel scheduled to occur near the  statutory deadline. To analyze how DOD\u2019s reported cost and savings  estimates have changed in the fiscal year 2009 BRAC budget submission  compared to the fiscal year 2008 budget submission, we obtained budget  data for both fiscal years and compared dollar amount differences for cost  and savings estimates for each BRAC recommendation. To calculate the  20-year net savings estimates, we used DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 BRAC  budget data using the same methodology DOD used to report its estimate  to the BRAC Commission. Finally, to evaluate the potential for BRAC cost  and savings estimates to continue to change as the department proceeds  with BRAC implementation, we interviewed officials from the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment)  responsible for overseeing BRAC implementation and associated BRAC  implementation offices for the service departments to discuss plans and  procedures for updating these estimates. Further details on our scope and  methodology can be found in appendix I.", "Overall, we determined that the data for this report were sufficiently  reliable for comparing cost and savings estimates and identifying broad  implementation challenges. We conducted this performance audit from  February 2008 to December 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD has undergone four BRAC rounds since 1988 and is currently  implementing its fifth round. In May 2005, the Secretary of Defense made  public more than 200 recommendations that DOD estimated would  generate net annual recurring savings of about $5.5 billion beginning in  fiscal year 2012. Ultimately, the BRAC Commission forwarded a list of   182 recommendations for base closure or realignment to the President for  approval and estimated that BRAC could save DOD annually about   $4.2 billion after the recommendations had been implemented. After the  BRAC Commission forwarded to the President its list of closure and  realignment recommendations, the President was required to review and  prepare a report approving or disapproving the BRAC Commission\u2019s  recommendations by September 23, 2005. On September 15, 2005, the  President approved, and the recommendations were forwarded to  Congress, which had 45 legislative days or until adjournment of Congress  to enact a joint resolution disapproving of the recommendations on an  all-or-none basis; otherwise, the recommendations became effective.  The BRAC Commission\u2019s recommendations were accepted in their entirety  by the President and not disapproved by Congress and became effective  November 9, 2005. The BRAC statute requires DOD to complete  recommendations for closing or realigning bases made in the BRAC 2005  round within a 6-year time frame ending September 15, 2011, 6 years from  the date the President submitted to Congress his approval of the  recommendations.", "In making its 2005 realignment and closure proposals, DOD applied legally  mandated selection criteria that included military value as the primary  consideration, as well as expected costs and savings, economic impact to  local communities, community support infrastructure, and environmental  impact. Military value\u2014which includes such considerations as an  installation\u2019s current and future mission capabilities, condition, ability to  accommodate future needs, and cost of operations\u2014was the primary  criteria for making recommendations as mandated by BRAC law and as  reported by both DOD and the Commission. Additionally, in establishing  goals for the 2005 BRAC round, the Secretary of Defense, in a November  15, 2002, memorandum initiating the round, expressed his interest in   (1) reducing excess infrastructure, which diverts scarce resources from  overall defense capability, and producing savings; (2) transforming DOD  by aligning the infrastructure with the defense strategy; and (3) fostering  jointness by examining and implementing opportunities for greater  jointness across DOD.", "The 2005 round is unlike previous BRAC rounds because of OSD\u2019s  emphasis on transformation and jointness, rather than just reducing  excess infrastructure. For example, as part of the Army\u2019s efforts to  transform its forces, the Army included actions to relocate forces from  Europe and Korea to domestic installations, which were part of its larger  review of bases worldwide. The 2005 round also differs from previous  BRAC rounds in terms of the number of closure and realignment actions.  While the number of major closures and realignments is a little greater  than individual previous rounds, the number of minor closures and  realignments is significantly greater than those in all previous rounds  combined. DOD plans to execute over 800 closure and realignment  actions as part of the 2005 BRAC round, which is more than double the  number of actions completed in the prior four rounds combined. The large  increase in the number of minor closures and realignments is primarily  attributable to the more than 500 actions involving the Army National  Guard and Army Reserve, representing over 60 percent of the BRAC  actions.", "To implement BRAC recommendations, DOD typically must incur various  up-front investment costs during the 6-year implementation period in  order to achieve long-term savings associated with the recommended  actions. Such costs generally include, for example, one-time costs for  actions such as military construction and personnel and equipment  movement, as well as recurring costs for increased operation and  maintenance of facilities and information systems. While savings from this  investment may begin to accrue over the implementation period,  additional savings typically occur annually on a longer-term basis beyond  the implementation period ending in fiscal year 2011. One-time savings  may include, for example, reduced costs associated with inventory  reduction or elimination of planned military construction. Recurring  savings may include for example, reduced sustainment costs associated  with maintaining less warehouse space. Net annual recurring savings after  the implementation period are calculated by subtracting the annual  recurring costs from the annual recurring savings. Expected 20-year  savings, also referred to as 20-year net present value savings, takes into  account all one-time and recurring costs and savings incurred over the  fiscal year 2006 through 2025 time period.", "For the BRAC 2005 round, the OSD BRAC Office\u2014under the oversight of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics)\u2014 has monitored the services\u2019 and defense agencies\u2019 implementation  progress, analyzed budget justifications for significant differences in cost  and savings estimates, and facilitated the resolution of any challenges that  may impair the successful implementation of the recommendations within  the 6-year completion period. To facilitate its oversight role, OSD required  the military departments and certain defense agencies to submit a detailed  business plan for each of their recommendations.

Many of these  recommendations are also complex in that they involve movement of a  large number of personnel, large construction projects, and  synchronization with other recommendations. Some of the most costly  recommendations that have experienced delays are as follows:    Close National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency leased locations and  realign others to Fort Belvoir, Virginia. DOD officials told us that  construction of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s new   $1.5 billion building at Fort Belvoir is currently on schedule.

In September 2005, the BRAC Commission  originally estimated annual recurring savings to be about $4.2 billion. This  amount included the savings associated with military personnel  eliminations. Some recommendation savings estimates have decreased  while others have increased, but the cumulative effect is an overall  decrease in estimated annual recurring savings.

Discussions with  agency officials involved with implementing this recommendation indicate  that the savings could decrease further in the future. In contrast, the  largest increase in net annual recurring savings was about $58 million for  the recommendation to establish the San Antonio Regional Medical Center  and realigning enlisted medical training to Fort Sam Houston, Texas,  which increased from about $91 million in savings in the fiscal year 2008  budget submission to $149 million in the fiscal year 2009 budget  submission.

The one-time implementation cost estimates for BRAC 2005 rose by  about $1.2 billion from fiscal years 2008 to 2009 primarily because of  increases in the cost of military construction. The potential for additional  cost increases is particularly important to the Army, as it is expected to  incur the majority of the military construction costs related to base  closures and realignments. For example, our analysis of DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2009 BRAC budget data shows that the Army\u2019s estimated cost of about   $13 billion for BRAC military construction accounted for nearly 60 percent  of the total BRAC military construction estimate of about $22.8 billion.  Moreover, the factors that drove the military construction costs up in  fiscal year 2007 continued to exert upward pressure on prices through the  end of fiscal year 2008. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  officials, the prices of steel, concrete, and copper rose considerably from  2005 to 2008 because of worldwide demand. Our analysis of producer  price index data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the  price of steel rose by about 40 percent over that period. The price of  concrete rose by about 18 percent, while copper rose over 124 percent  from 2005 to 2008. In addition, fuel prices rose steadily from 2007 until  August 2008, when they started to drop.", "Another factor that could drive up construction prices is the increased  demand for construction in some markets. Specifically, BRAC  implementing officials expressed concern that construction costs have the  potential to increase in areas already experiencing high commercial  construction demands such as the National Capital Region, Washington,  D.C., and San Antonio, Texas. Army Corps of Engineers officials told us  they are concerned about what effect construction demand might have on  bids given the sizable amount of construction to take place in a limited  amount of time to meet the BRAC statutory completion time frame.  Additionally, service officials at various installations expressed concern  about the potential for increases in construction costs because of ongoing  reconstruction because of damage caused by natural disasters such as  hurricanes and flooding, coupled with the large volume of anticipated  BRAC construction that could also affect bids.", "Further, we reported in December 2007 that the inflation rates prescribed  by DOD and the Office of Management and Budget for developing BRAC  budget estimates had been lower than the actual rate of construction  inflation for the last several years; therefore, the use of these rates could  underestimate actual construction costs. To the extent that the actual rate  of inflation continues to exceed the budgeted rate as implementation  proceeds, and construction material costs are higher than anticipated,   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials have said that they would either  have to redirect funding from other sources to provide for construction  projects or resort to a reduction in the scope of some construction  projects.", "Although the economy slowed down and fuel prices began to drop in   mid-to-late 2008, several bids for construction contracts that had been  advertised prior to these events have come in at levels higher than  programmed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For example, the  construction bids to build a general instruction complex associated with  the BRAC recommendation to create a Maneuver Center at Fort Benning,  Georgia, were $16 million over budgeted amounts. In another case, the  estimate for building a defense media center is currently $65 million, while  the programmed amount is $44 million\u2014a difference of $21 million.  Although bids have been above budgeted amounts for some projects,   the difference has been offset to some extent by other bids that had come  in under budgeted amounts for other projects.", "Furthermore, as a result of the increasing construction prices, higher than  expected construction bids, and revisions to facility designs and scope, the  Army identified a potential BRAC cost increase of approximately   $2.6 billion, with military construction accounting for about $1.4 billion  and various operation and maintenance costs accounting for the remaining  $1.2 billion. In the summer of 2008, Army officials told us that a high-level  meeting was held with Army leadership, known as the Stationing Senior  Review Group, to discuss ways to resolve the potential BRAC cost  increases. Subsequently, the Army\u2019s Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff  for Installation Management made clear in an August 2008 memorandum  that further growth in BRAC 2005 implementation must be avoided. BRAC  officials told us that the results of these discussions on potential cost  increases would be reflected in the fiscal year 2010 budget submission to  Congress.

Fuel prices, for  example, had dropped precipitously compared to where they had been  earlier in the year. The price of copper and concrete had also begun to  decline, but prices of these two commodities nonetheless remained above  2007 levels.
