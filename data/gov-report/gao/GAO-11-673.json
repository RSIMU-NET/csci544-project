However, several factors, such as limited training time between deployments, the large number of training requirements, and the current focus on counterinsurgency operation training have been preventing units from completing all desired training prior to the culminating training event. For example, based on GAO's site visits, 7 of 13 units were not able to complete all of the desired individual and collective training (e.g., company-level live fire training) prior to arriving at the combat training centers. Further, officials from all of the units GAO spoke with stated that they planned to delay certain training until they were at the combat training centers since resources--such as theater-specific equipment like mine resistant ambush protected vehicles--were more readily available there. GAO found that some units had to train to improve proficiency levels at the combat training centers prior to beginning the culminating training events, and therefore were not always able to take full advantage of the training opportunities available to them at the combat training centers to conduct complex, higher-level training. Still, according to trainers at the combat training centers, while units arrive with varying levels of proficiency, all forces leave with at least the platoon level proficiency required to execute the counterinsurgency missions required for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over the past decade, continuous overseas deployments have reduced training timeframes and resulted in senior leaders assuming training management responsibilities from junior leaders. Specifically, leaders at higher headquarters have taken responsibility for much of the training management function--planning, preparing, and assessing training--while junior leaders have focused primarily on training execution. However, changing conditions, such as increased competition for resources in a constrained fiscal environment, increased time at home station, and a return to training for a fuller range of missions, make it imperative that all leaders possess a strong foundation in training management. The services are developing various initiatives to restore and develop training management skills in their leaders, but neither service has developed results-oriented performance metrics to gauge the effectiveness of their efforts to restore these skills. As GAO has previously reported, establishing metrics can help federal agencies target training investments and assess the contributions that training programs make to improving results. Without a means of measuring the effectiveness of their efforts, the Army and Marine Corps will not have the information they need to assess the extent to which their leaders have the training management skills needed to plan, prepare, and assess required training."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the services develop results-oriented performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of their training management initiatives and support any adjustments that the services may need to make to these initiatives.

In addition, we reviewed service guidance to identify the  extent to which specific training had to be completed prior to the  culminating training events and interviewed service officials to discuss  this guidance. We also interviewed service training officials to discuss any  differences between training requirements for combat arms and combat  support forces. We selected eight Army and Marine Corps locations for  site visits based on deployment and training dates to allow a review of  multiple units trained at the location. For the Army, we used readiness  information from the Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army to  identify the universe of units for site selection purposes, and we selected  the installations with the largest number of combat arms and combat  support brigades present during our site visit time frames. We found this  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of site selection. For the  Marine Corps, we focused on battalion-sized combat arms and combat  support units; these units conduct their culminating training events at the  service\u2019s combat training center at Twentynine Palms, California.  Findings from the site visits with the Army and Marine Corps are not  generalizable to all units.

Service policies do not specify where annual training  should be completed, and commanders can prioritize this training to align  it with other training the units are conducting to develop units\u2019 combat  capabilities.

Army and Marine Corps  predeployment training, which can be conducted at home station or other  locations, begins with individual and small unit training and progresses to  larger scale collective training exercises that are designed to build  proficiency in the skills required for deployment and the culminating  training event. The requirements for this training come from a variety of  sources. The Commander of U.S. Central Command has established  baseline individual and collective training requirements for units deploying  to Iraq and Afghanistan. Required individual training requirements  include, but are not limited to, basic marksmanship, high-mobility  multipurpose wheeled vehicle and mine resistant ambush protected  vehicle egress assistance training, and first aid. Each service secretary is  responsible for training their forces to execute the current and future  operational requirements of the combatant commands. Accordingly, U.S.  Army Forces Command, as the Army\u2019s force provider, and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps have also issued training requirements  for forces deploying in support of missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Other Army and Marine Corps commands at various levels have also  imposed predeployment training requirements and increased the required  number of repetitions for certain training tasks.

In the past, units used  the initial week at the combat training centers to replicate their arrival in  theater and prepare to commence combat operations by conducting tasks  such as receiving and organizing equipment; however, over the past  decade, units have had to incorporate other types of training into this first  week. For example, training officials at the National Training Center  stated that it was necessary for soldiers that were new to the units to  complete individual weapons qualifications during the first 5 days of the  combat training center rotation because these soldiers often arrived after  their unit\u2019s home station ranges were completed, failed to qualify on their  weapon, or were not available on the day their unit was at the range.

We also interviewed officials from these offices  to discuss these documents. In addition, we interviewed trainers from the  Army\u2019s two maneuver combat training centers in the continental United  States at Fort Irwin, California and Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the Marine  Corps single combat training center at Twentynine Palms, California, to  discuss the desired training, if any, that units could not complete prior to  the culminating training event. We also reviewed service training  guidance such as U.S. Army Forces Command Regulation 350-50-1,  Training at the National Training Center, and U.S. Army Forces  Command Regulation 350-50-2, Training at the Joint Readiness Training  Center, to identify the extent to which the guidance established  requirements for training to be completed prior to the culminating training  events and interviewed trainers from the combat training centers to  discuss this guidance.", "Further, we reviewed unit training documents and interviewed officials  from 19 Army and 10 Marine Corps units to discuss training information  such as: (1) the training that units were completing, (2) any training that  units were unable to complete prior to the culminating training events, (3)  any factors that impacted units\u2019 abilities to complete training prior to the  culminating training events, and (4) the impact that not completing  training prior to the final culminating training event might have on those  events. For the Army, we used readiness information from the Defense  Readiness Reporting System-Army from November 2010, to identify the  universe of all deployable brigade-sized units, since these units may  conduct their culminating training event at a combat training center. We  then selected the installations with the largest number of combat arms  and combat support brigades present during our site visit timeframes. We  found this data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of site selection.  Based on the data, we selected Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Hood,  Texas; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington; and Schofield Barracks,  Hawaii, where we held discussions with 10 Army brigade combat teams  and 9 Army support brigades. For the Marine Corps, we focused on  battalion-sized combat arms and combat support units; these units  conduct their culminating training events at the service\u2019s combat training  center at Twentynine Palms, California. Specifically, we identified those  units who would be conducting their culminating training events at the  combat training center between November 2010 and February 2011. We  held discussions with 5 Marine Corps ground combat units, and 5 Marine  Corps support units from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; Camp  Pendleton, California; Twentynine Palms, California; and Marine Corps  Base Hawaii. Findings from the Army and Marine Corps site visits are not  generalizable to all units. We also spoke with Army and Marine Corps  officials from Fort Shafter, Hawaii, and Okinawa, Japan, respectively, to  discuss any factors that impacted units\u2019 abilities to complete training prior  to the culminating training events.", "To assess the extent to which leaders are positioned to plan and manage  training as forces resume training for a fuller range of missions, we  reviewed service policy and guidance that provided information on the  return to training for a fuller range of missions, such as the U.S. Army  Forces Command Training and Leader Development Guidance for Fiscal  Year 2011-2012, Army Field Manual 7-0, Training Units and Developing  Leaders for Full Spectrum Operations, the Marine Corps\u2019 Commandant  Planning Guidance, and the Marine Corps Posture Statement for 2011.  We interviewed service and unit officials to discuss these documents and  how training for a fuller range of missions might be impacted by changing  conditions, such as the drawdown of forces from Iraq. We interviewed  installation management officials from both Army and Marine Corps  installations to discuss challenges that may exist for units as more units  are stationed at home for longer periods of time, and reviewed installation  policies and plans regarding the scheduling of home station resources,  such as ranges, centrally managed equipment, and simulators. We also  examined service plans and strategies to develop and restore training  management skills amongst Army and Marine Corps leaders, and  discussed these plans with service officials. For example, we reviewed  the U.S. Army Forces Command Inspector General\u2019s Office Training  Management Assessment, Army Field Manual 7-0, Marine Corps MCRP  3-0A, Unit Training Management Guide, the Marine Corps Posture  Statement and the Marine Corps Task 9 Vision and Strategy 2025. We  also discussed current and future initiatives to restore and develop  training management skills with officials from the Army\u2019s Training and  Doctrine Command and the Marine Corps\u2019 Training and Education  Command. Furthermore, we participated in an online demonstration of  the Army\u2019s Digital Training Management System and reviewed the online  trainings available through the Army Training Network. Table 2 outlines all  of the organizations we contacted and interviewed during the course of  our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 to July 2011, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, key contributors to this report  were Michael Ferren (Assistant Director), Jerome Brown, Kenya Jones,  Ashley Lipton, Lonnie McAllister, Terry Richardson, and Erik Wilkins- McKee."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
