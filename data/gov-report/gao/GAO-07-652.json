Controlling the virus in poultry is key to reducing the risk of a human pandemic. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for planning for AI outbreaks in poultry, with states' assistance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating the federal response for certain emergencies and developing policy documents that serve as a basis for national emergency planning. GAO described the steps USDA is taking to prepare for highly pathogenic AI and identified key challenges. GAO reviewed response plans, statutes, and regulations; visited poultry operations; interviewed federal, state, and industry officials in five states that experienced outbreaks; and reviewed 19 state plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USDA is taking important steps to prepare for highly pathogenic AI. For example, the department has established mechanisms to prevent infected poultry and products from being imported and has developed several surveillance programs to detect AI. In addition, USDA is developing response plans specific to highly pathogenic AI and has begun conducting exercises to test these plans. Moreover, USDA is building a National Veterinary Stockpile to maintain critical supplies, including equipment to protect responders. Finally, USDA has launched various AI research projects, including one to explore why the virus causes disease and death in some domestic poultry and wild birds but not in others. While USDA has made important strides, incomplete planning at the federal and state levels, as well as several unresolved issues, could slow response. First, USDA is not planning for the lead coordinating role that DHS would assume if an outbreak among poultry occurred that is sufficient in scope to warrant various federal disaster declarations. GAO's prior work has shown that roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined and understood to facilitate rapid and effective decision making. Moreover, USDA response plans do not identify the capabilities needed to carry out the critical tasks associated with an outbreak scenario--that is, the entities responsible for carrying them out, the resources needed, and the provider of those resources. Furthermore, some state plans lack important components that could facilitate rapid AI containment, which is problematic because states typically lead initial response efforts. Finally, there are several unresolved issues that, absent advance consideration, could hinder response. For example, controlling an outbreak among birds raised in backyards, such as for hobby, remains particularly difficult because federal and state officials generally do not know the numbers and locations of these birds. In addition, USDA has not estimated the amount of antiviral medication that it would need during an outbreak or resolved how to provide such supplies in a timely manner. According to federal guidance, poultry workers responding to an outbreak of highly pathogenic AI should take antiviral medication to protect them from infection."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 avian influenza has, over the past few  years, spread to nearly 60 countries, resulting in the death and destruction  of millions of wild and domestic birds throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and  the Middle East. Serious concerns exist that it could reach North America  at any time via migrating birds or smuggled imports of diseased birds and  bird products. Although primarily an avian disease, this virus has also  infected 291 humans\u2014most of whom had close contact with infected  poultry\u2014and more than half of them have died. Health experts are  concerned that should highly pathogenic H5N1 (or another subtype), to  which humans have no immunity, develop the capacity to spread easily  from person to person, a pandemic could occur. According to the World  Health Organization, controlling the virus in poultry is the principal way to  reduce opportunities for human infection and, therefore, reduce  opportunities for a pandemic to emerge.", "Avian influenza (AI) viruses are classified as either \u201clow pathogenic\u201d or  \u201chighly pathogenic\u201d based on their genetic features and the severity of the  disease they cause in poultry. Most AI viruses are low pathogenic and  usually result in mild or asymptomatic infections in birds. In the United  States, these viruses are common in wild waterfowl and shorebirds. Highly  pathogenic AI viruses are associated with high morbidity and mortality in  poultry and are considered foreign animal diseases because they rarely  occur in the United States. Despite the relative mildness of low pathogenic  AI, some of these strains are worrisome because they have the potential to  mutate into highly pathogenic AI. This happened most recently in 2004 in  British Columbia, Canada, resulting in the death of 17 million birds.", "The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for acting to prevent,  control, and eradicate foreign animal diseases in domestic livestock and  poultry, in coordination with a number of other entities. For example,  USDA typically partners with states and industry in eradicating such  diseases, with the agency\u2019s level of involvement dependent upon states\u2019  preparedness and the size of the outbreak. If humans become infected, the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leads the federal medical  response. In the event of an outbreak serious enough for the President to  declare an emergency or major disaster or for the Secretary of Homeland  Security to declare an Incident of National Significance, the Secretary of  Homeland Security assumes responsibility for coordinating the federal  response. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has  been charged with developing policy documents that provide the  foundation for emergency planning for all levels of government.", "A well-planned, coordinated emergency response is essential when dealing  with highly pathogenic AI in order to mitigate financial losses to the $28  billion U.S. poultry industry. The United States is the world\u2019s largest  producer and second largest exporter of poultry meat, accounting for  nearly 35 percent of global trade valued at more than $2 billion annually.  Once certain strains of low pathogenic AI or any strain of highly pathogenic  AI are found in domestic poultry in the United States, trading partners are  notified, and exports of poultry and poultry products from within the  affected area are halted. To control the spread of the disease and to  ultimately resume trade, USDA, often with assistance from states and the  poultry industry, typically destroys\u2014depopulates\u2014exposed and infected  birds, including those raised in commercial operations and in backyards.", "USDA provides compensation to owners\u2014indemnifies them\u2014for losses  incurred when USDA depopulates birds.", "USDA has had some experience working with states and the poultry  industry to eradicate highly pathogenic AI. For example, USDA worked  with Pennsylvania to control an outbreak of highly pathogenic AI in 1983,  leading to the depopulation of 17 million birds. However, the agency has  never confronted the challenge of an AI strain with the unique  characteristics of highly pathogenic H5N1: the unprecedented speed with  which it has spread, its human health implications, and the extensive  scrutiny it has received as a result of coverage in the world media.  Moreover, the possibility exists that terrorists could introduce highly  pathogenic AI at multiple locations, instilling fear in the public about the  safety of the food supply and disrupting the economy.", "Given the intense global concern about highly pathogenic AI, we (1)  described the steps USDA has taken to prepare for highly pathogenic AI in  domestic poultry and (2) identified any challenges that could affect USDA\u2019s  ability to prepare for highly pathogenic AI. A list of congressional  committees that requested this report appears on the last page of this letter.", "To describe the steps USDA has taken to prepare for outbreaks of highly  pathogenic AI in domestic poultry, we reviewed presidential directives and  national emergency planning documents, relevant statutes and regulations,  and USDA documents and programs related to AI. To identify any  challenges that could affect USDA\u2019s ability to prepare for outbreaks of  highly pathogenic AI, we conducted structured interviews with federal,  state, and industry officials in California, Delaware, Maryland, Texas, and  Virginia. We selected these states because they have experience responding  to an outbreak of AI or another highly infectious avian disease in the past 5  years and because of their varying poultry demographics. We also  interviewed USDA emergency management and industry officials,  including those personnel specifically charged with helping states develop  AI response plans, to identify strengths and weaknesses in state plans and  to characterize their state\u2019s level of readiness for an outbreak. In addition,  we performed our own review and assessment of 19 state plans to  corroborate identified strengths and weaknesses from the interviews.  Furthermore, we attended a USDA and state AI training exercise and  visited live bird markets and numerous types of poultry operations. Finally,  we interviewed DHS officials to discuss emergency planning and DHS\u2019 role  in outbreaks of AI. Additional details about our scope and methodology are  presented in appendix I. We conducted our review between May 2006 and  June 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In November 2005, the President of the United States released the  Homeland Security Council\u2019s National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza to  guide the country\u2019s overall effort to address the threat that highly  pathogenic AI could create a human pandemic influenza. The strategy  identified four lead agencies, each responsible for developing a plan to  implement a component of the strategy: USDA is responsible for the  veterinary response, HHS is responsible for the medical response, the  Department of State is responsible for international activities, and DHS is  responsible for overall domestic incident management and federal  coordination. In May 2006, the Implementation Plan for the National  Strategy for Pandemic Influenza was issued to describe how the strategy  would be implemented. Specifically, this implementation plan describes  more than 300 critical actions that the appropriate federal agencies must  carry out to address the threat of pandemic influenza. The department has  responsibility for nearly 100 of these critical actions.", "The U.S. poultry industry consists, in large part, of a relatively small  number of large companies that own all aspects of the production  process\u2014from the hatchery to the processing facility. The most common  types of poultry raised commercially are chickens for consumption (called  broilers) and chickens that lay eggs (called layers), as well as turkeys (see  fig. 1). Broilers represent 93 percent of poultry produced in the United  States (see fig. 2) and almost three-quarters of poultry and poultry products  by value sold to consumers (see fig. 3). There are also commercial birds  that are genetic breeding stock whose main function is to produce  offspring that facilitate mass production and are economical to raise.  Commercial poultry operations typically raise tens of thousands of birds in  confined poultry houses. Such operations can include multiple houses  located close to each other. Because of the environment in which  commercial birds are raised, if one bird becomes infected with highly  pathogenic AI, hundreds of thousands of birds can be exposed and need to  be depopulated.", "In addition to poultry raised commercially, numerous types of birds are  raised in backyards, with flocks up to 1,000 birds. These \u201cbackyard\u201d birds  are typically chickens used for personal egg production and consumption;  game fowl used for fighting; and game birds, such as quail and pheasant.  These birds may run loose or be confined to a poultry house. In addition,  there are birds in live bird markets\u2014facilities that sell live poultry, which is  often slaughtered on-site, to the general public\u2014and some are sold at  auctions and swap meets.", "When poultry become infected with AI, it may be spread by the movement  of contaminated people and equipment to and from a site where the  infected birds are located (see fig. 4). For example, a poultry worker enters  one bird house containing birds infected with AI but does not disinfect  boots or change clothing before entering another house, carrying the virus  and causing the disease to spread. As a precaution, commercial producers  often implement biosecurity measures. For example, the number of people  entering a bird house is restricted, and these people must dress in special,  sometimes disposable, clothing. Moreover, vehicles arriving at a farm are  usually required to be disinfected upon entry and exit. The workers\u2019 boots  and hands are also disinfected. For highly valuable birds, such as genetic  breeding stock, biosecurity may be higher\u2014for example, visitors may be  required to shower before entering and leaving the facility.", "Despite biosecurity measures, outbreaks among commercial poultry have  recently occurred (see table 1). For example, in 2002, Virginia experienced  an outbreak of low pathogenic AI that resulted in the depopulation of  nearly 5 million birds in order to control the disease. In 2003, Connecticut  had an outbreak of low pathogenic AI that affected more than 3 million  commercial laying hens. While low pathogenic AI is detected from time to  time in domestic poultry, highly pathogenic AI is known to have occurred  only three times in the United States: in 1924, 1983, and 2004. It is believed  that all three of these highly pathogenic outbreaks originated in live bird  markets. The Pennsylvania outbreak in 1983 began as a low pathogenic AI  virus but mutated into a highly pathogenic strain, leading to the  depopulation of 17 million birds. Although diagnostic testing confirmed  that a virus in Texas in 2004 was technically highly pathogenic, the virus did  not cause high mortality in the infected birds, as would be typical with  highly pathogenic AI.", "An outbreak of AI can have serious trade repercussions. The World  Organization for Animal Health is an international animal health group  with 167 member countries, including the United States. Members agree to  notify the organization of outbreaks in domestic poultry of all highly  pathogenic AI and some low pathogenic strains\u2014those with H5 and H7  proteins\u2014because they have the capacity to mutate into highly pathogenic  AI. Consequently, when a country\u2019s poultry tests positive for \u201cnotifiable\u201d  AI, its international trading partners are likely to restrict trade with that  country until the partners believe the virus is eradicated\u2014an outcome that  can take many months to achieve. For example, when a single farm in  Texas was infected with highly pathogenic AI in 2004, more than 50  countries instituted complete or partial bans on U.S. poultry; Mexico has  yet to lift its ban. Therefore, when a flock is infected with AI, the goal  becomes controlling and eradicating the disease as rapidly as possible in  order to prevent the spread of the disease and to regain the confidence of  U.S. trading partners that any future imports will be disease free. This is  accomplished by acting quickly in the affected area to, among other things:  (1) quarantine susceptible animals; (2) implement biosecurity measures;  (3) depopulate infected and exposed birds; (4) dispose of contaminated  and potentially contaminated materials, including animal carcasses; and  (5) clean and disinfect the infected premises. Once the disease is  eradicated, USDA, states, and the poultry industry continue to test birds to  monitor for AI.", "USDA derives its authority to carry out operations and measures to  prevent, detect, control, and eradicate AI from the Animal Health  Protection Act. The act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to hold,  seize, treat, destroy, or dispose of any animal, vehicle, or object that can  harbor the disease, or to restrict their movement in interstate commerce.  The act also authorizes the Secretary to transfer funds from other USDA  appropriations or available funds to manage an emergency in which a  disease of livestock threatens any segment of agricultural production in  the United States. In addition, the act authorizes the Secretary to declare  an \u201cextraordinary emergency\u201d when it has been determined that a state\u2019s  actions are inadequate to control or eradicate a livestock disease that  threatens domestic livestock. Under this declaration, the Secretary\u2019s  authority to regulate includes any animal, vehicle, or object that can harbor  the disease in intrastate, as well as interstate commerce.", "Within USDA, a number of agencies have responsibility for protecting U.S.  poultry from AI. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)  operates the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, the only laboratory  in the United States recognized by the World Organization for Animal  Health to perform confirmatory testing for AI. Also, APHIS\u2019 Smuggling,  Interdiction, and Trade Compliance unit conducts activities to prevent  smuggled and prohibited agricultural goods from entering and being  distributed throughout the country. In addition, the Agricultural Research  Service conducts research on endemic and exotic poultry diseases,  including highly pathogenic AI; the Food Safety and Inspection Service  works to ensure that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and  egg products is safe for human consumption; the Office of  Communications coordinates public information from USDA program  agencies.", "In the past few years, USDA\u2019s total obligations for AI preparedness efforts  have increased from approximately $3.2 million in fiscal year 2004 to $74.1  million in fiscal year 2006. In 2005, USDA received $91.35 million from the  2-year Emergency Supplemental Appropriation to Address Pandemic  Influenza. The bulk of USDA\u2019s supplemental funding ($80.3 million) was  allocated to APHIS, which in turn obligated $43 million for AI surveillance  of domestic wildlife, commercial poultry, and live bird markets in fiscal  year 2006. In addition, USDA obligated portions of the remaining  emergency supplemental funding to areas such as AI research and public  communications. According to USDA officials, the department is  requesting $82 million for fiscal year 2008 to support its ongoing AI  programs.", "While USDA has for many years been responsible for protecting livestock  and poultry from foreign animal diseases, it now does so under new  authorities and has additional roles and responsibilities. Following the  terrorist attacks of 2001, the Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of  2002, establishing DHS as the chief coordinating agency for efforts to  protect the United States from terrorist acts and disasters, including those  that affect the agriculture sector. As such, DHS undertook major policy  initiatives to promote emergency preparedness, including developing the  National Incident Management System, the National Response Plan, and  the National Preparedness Goal.", "The National Incident Management System is intended to provide a  consistent framework for incident management at all jurisdictional levels  regardless of cause, size, or complexity of the situation and to define the  roles and responsibilities of federal, state, and local governments during an  emergency event. A key component of this system is the Incident  Command System, designed to coordinate the communications, personnel,  and procedures of different agencies and levels of government within a  common organizational structure during an emergency.", "The National Response Plan is an all-hazards plan built on the template of  the National Incident Management System. It established a single,  comprehensive approach to domestic incident management to prevent,  prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters,  and other emergencies. The National Response Plan is stated to always be  in effect. Under the National Response Plan, resources are grouped into  Emergency Support Functions that would most likely be needed during a  domestic incident. Under Emergency Support Function #11, which  addresses the protection of agriculture, APHIS is responsible for  implementing an integrated federal, state, tribal, and local response to an  outbreak of a highly contagious or economically devastating animal  disease, such as highly pathogenic AI. A fundamental principle of the  National Response Plan is that incidents are first handled at the lowest  possible level of government. If an incident overwhelms local and state  capabilities, a state may request resources from other states through  mutual aid agreements, or may request federal assistance. The Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  established the  process for states to request supplemental resources from the federal  government when state and local resources have been or will be  overwhelmed. The President invokes a federal response under the Stafford  Act by declaring an \u201cemergency\u201d or a \u201cmajor disaster.\u201d", "Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 required the Secretary of  Homeland Security to coordinate the development of a national domestic  all-hazards preparedness goal to establish measurable readiness priorities  and targets that appropriately balance the potential threat and magnitude  of terrorist attacks and major disasters with the resources required to  prevent, respond to, and recover from them. The goal was to include  standards for preparedness assessments and strategies and a system for  assessing the nation\u2019s overall preparedness to respond to major events. To  implement this directive, DHS developed the National Preparedness Goal  using 15 emergency event scenarios whose purpose was to form the basis  for identifying the capabilities needed to respond to a wide range of  emergency events. One of the defined scenarios was an outbreak of a  foreign animal disease.", "Finally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 established a national  policy to defend the agriculture and food system against terrorist attacks,  major disasters, and other emergencies. Specifically, it directs the  Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland  Security, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human  Services and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,  to work with state and local governments and the private sector to develop  a National Veterinary Stockpile containing sufficient amounts of animal  vaccine, antiviral, or therapeutic products to appropriately respond to the  most damaging animal diseases affecting human health and the economy  within 24 hours of an outbreak."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Is Implementing Important Measures to Help the Nation Prepare for Outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza", "paragraphs": ["USDA has taken important steps to prepare for highly pathogenic AI.

Specifically, during  fiscal year 2006 and the first 2 months of 2007, it conducted a total of 54  special AI operations. For example, at the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach,  this unit conducted an operation that targeted poultry and associated  products that were being brought into the United States for the Asian New  Year, when Asian imports typically increase. A total of 15 cargo inspections  were conducted, and 4,324 kilograms of prohibited poultry products  (including products from China and Japan, which were experiencing  outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 at the time of this report) were  discovered. USDA has recently hired more than 20 field officers and eight  analysts that specialize in AI to enhance surveillance and target potential AI  shipments.

For example, APHIS\u2019 long-standing  voluntary program, the National Poultry Improvement Plan, tests  participating commercial poultry flocks to ensure they are free from  diseases, including AI. If flocks test negative for AI, USDA provides  certification that the flock is free of the disease, thereby assisting with  interstate and international trade, which provides an incentive for  commercial industry participation. Forty-eight states participate in this  program. In addition, APHIS\u2019 Biosecurity for the Birds program  encourages, among other things, surveillance of backyard birds. APHIS  works closely with state departments of agriculture, USDA\u2019s Cooperative  Extension Service, and private veterinarians to make information available  to backyard bird owners on the risks and signs of disease and good  biosecurity practices. While this program does not include a testing  component, APHIS offers the public a toll-free number to notify authorities  when backyard birds become sick and die. USDA is also expanding its  surveillance programs as required in the Implementation Plan for the  National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza. For example, among other  efforts, APHIS is working with the Department of the Interior, state  wildlife agencies, and others to increase surveillance of wild birds in  Alaska and the 48 continental states. Moreover, USDA is working with  states and industry to conduct surveillance of birds at auctions, swap  meets, flea markets, and public exhibitions. Furthermore, in 2002, USDA  established the National Animal Health Laboratory Network as part of a  national strategy to coordinate and link the testing capacities of the federal  veterinary diagnostic laboratories with the extensive infrastructure of state  and university capabilities.

Specifically, a presidential  declaration of an emergency or major disaster is made by the President of  the United States at the request of state governors via the Stafford Act, and  such declarations require the Secretary of Homeland Security to assume  responsibility for directing the federal response. State officials told us that  their governors would consider making such a request. For example, in  2000, a presidential declaration of emergency was declared for the West  Nile virus outbreak in New York state. DHS lawyers are in the process of  determining the applicability of a declaration to an outbreak of highly  pathogenic AI; therefore, this possibility should not be disregarded.", "Moreover, the Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion to declare  an Incident of National Significance.

However, the Secretary is not limited to  these criteria and may consider other factors when making this decision.  The determining factor is whether the incident is of such severity,  magnitude, or complexity that it requires the Secretary of Homeland  Security to manage the federal response. DHS officials told us that if highly  pathogenic H5N1 arrived in the United States, the Secretary of Homeland  Security would, in consultation with the White House and cabinet  members, consider declaring an Incident of National Significance if its  impact warranted one. DHS officials further noted that the economic  impact to the agriculture industry would be huge if the virus spread across  multiple states, making it imperative to prevent this from happening. DHS  officials told us that they hope that USDA will have the ability to contain  the disease if an outbreak occurs. Nevertheless, DHS officials told us that  this does not obviate the need to plan for such an event.

Although some of the capabilities  associated with foot-and-mouth disease could translate to responding to an  outbreak of highly pathogenic AI, there are differences between addressing  disease outbreaks in livestock and in poultry. In addition, unlike foot-and- mouth disease, highly pathogenic AI can infect humans, so capabilities  must be identified in advance for protecting human health. USDA has also  started planning for various scenarios with its draft interagency playbook.  However, this playbook does not identify the capabilities for the various  tasks, and it excludes key players, including state and industry officials.

In addition, the plan should specify time  frames and completion status for each critical task. DHS officials told us  that a plan of this nature is essential to identify gaps in capabilities. As we  reported in 2006, emergency preparedness and response should be  characterized by measurable goals and effective efforts to identify key gaps  between those goals and current capabilities, with a clear plan for closing  those gaps.

Three of the 19 plans did not include a  discussion about response activities for backyard birds. USDA officials  told us that the development of some state plans was heavily influenced  by the poultry industry, which may be the reason this response  component was omitted. This is troublesome because an outbreak must  be contained among backyard birds, as well as in commercial  operations. In addition, a recent USDA survey estimates that about 40  percent of backyard birds are located within 1 mile of at least four  commercial poultry facilities. This close proximity could allow the  virus, if not quickly contained, to spread from backyard birds to  commercial operations\u2014as has occurred in previous poultry disease  outbreaks.", "Biosecurity. We found that one state plan had no discussion about  biosecurity. USDA recommends implementing biosecurity measures to  keep flocks free from disease during an outbreak. In addition, our site  visits to commercial and backyard facilities found varying levels of  biosecurity\u2014from very stringent to very lax. Further, a recent USDA  survey found that backyard bird owners do not always implement basic  biosecurity measures. For example, 89 percent do not require visitors to  wash their hands before handling birds, and only 40 percent require  hand washing after handling birds.", "Public communications. Four of 19 state plans did not address public  communications. Federal and state officials told us that clear public  communications are essential during an outbreak to manage the media,  avoid public confusion, and disseminate a clear public health message.  In addition, the required Incident Command System calls for a Joint  Information Center and a Public Information Officer (who is responsible  for media outreach) to ensure clear and accurate public information,  none of which were mentioned in these four plans.", "Public health. Five of the 19 plans did not address the role of local, state,  or federal public health authorities during an outbreak. USDA\u2019s draft  summary plan recommends that public health authorities initiate  appropriate health measures (e.g., identify those potentially exposed  and in need of antiviral medication) and help ensure accurate public  communications.", "USDA and state officials told us there are several reasons why planning at  the state level is not more complete. First, although USDA officials review  state response plans, the agency does not have the authority to do more  than offer comments and recommendations. It is up to the state to make  any changes that USDA recommends. Second, USDA and state officials told  us that there are no established federal criteria for what a state response  plan for highly pathogenic AI should include, which has made developing  and assessing the plans more difficult. In the absence of such criteria,  USDA and state officials we interviewed told us they are relying on  experience from past outbreaks or applying criteria from other programs.  Third, state officials said that state emergency planning resources are  limited. Despite recognizing the need for such planning, officials said they  do not have the resources and staff to devote to such a planning effort.  Similarly, these same officials told us that because APHIS officials who  assist in planning cover several states simultaneously, their resources are  also spread too thin to meet each state\u2019s AI planning needs. State officials  told us that because of these resource limitations and other considerations,  some states have formed cooperatives in order to pool limited planning  resources and work together regionally to integrate AI and other foreign  animal disease emergency planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unresolved Issues Could Delay Response", "paragraphs": ["We have identified several unresolved issues that, if not addressed, could  hinder response efforts. Moreover, some could pose a particular challenge  for states that have never encountered an outbreak. These unresolved  issues are as follows:  The location and number of backyard birds. According to USDA, state,  and industry officials from all five states that we visited, containing an  outbreak among backyard birds remains a challenge because their  numbers and location are still unknown. For example, a 2002 outbreak  of exotic Newcastle disease in California took almost a year to contain  because the disease spread as responders spent valuable time trying to  locate potentially infected birds in urban areas. State and USDA officials  told us they were surprised by and unprepared for the large number of  backyard birds that existed in such areas. This difficulty was  exacerbated by the heavy automobile traffic, slowing responders\u2019 ability  to reach each potential bird owner\u2019s home. Further complicating  matters, many of these birds were expensive game fowl bred for illegal  cockfighting and, as a result, owners sometimes moved the birds into  hiding to avoid authorities and prevent the birds from being  depopulated. This contributed to the spread of the disease.", "While the numbers and locations of backyard birds within the state may  never be definitively known, state officials told us there are steps that  can be taken to help mitigate this problem. California formed a group of  state and USDA officials whose goal is to minimize the risk of disease  spread through local outreach and education. In addition, the group  performs regular testing and voluntary surveillance of backyard  premises, live bird markets, feed stores, pet stores, auction yards, and  swap meets.", "To prevent  possle orek of highly pthogenic  AI, USDA recommend tht poltry prodcer nd  deler usioecrity precaution t live ird  mrket.

Because it is not known where backyard bird  owners are located, epidemiological teams must go door-to-door to  survey surrounding residences. To help overcome this tracking  problem, Delaware and Maryland\u2014both with dense commercial  poultry operations\u2014have introduced mandatory registration for all  poultry owners, including those with backyard flocks. Further, some  state officials, such as those in Texas, are working with USDA to do  extensive outreach to game fowl owners. A recent USDA survey shows  that game fowl represent the third largest population of birds raised in  backyard environments. Texas officials told us that game fowl are  particularly prevalent in the state because of its proximity to Mexico,  Louisiana, and New Mexico. Cockfighting is legal in Louisiana and had  been legal in New Mexico until March of 2007. Consequently, state  officials are trying to locate these bird owners to brief them about the  importance of reporting birds that die or appear diseased with highly  pathogenic AI. Officials have also briefed these owners on the risks  highly pathogenic AI poses to game fowl handlers.", "Diagnostic laboratory response. Officials from all five states we visited  cautioned that diagnostic laboratory capacity could be quickly  overwhelmed during an outbreak. In particular, the large number of  samples that would need to be tested and the limited number of  laboratory personnel available remain problematic. These tests are  necessary to identify the extent of the disease spread, as well as to track  the success of eradication efforts and prove to trading partners that  poultry products are safe for export. Laboratory officials told us that  within days of an outbreak\u2014sometimes even hours\u2014their diagnostic  laboratories were running at capacity, with exhausted employees  working overtime, usually for several months, to meet the testing needs  during the outbreak. To accommodate the increased volume of samples,  laboratory officials in two states told us they relied on support from  USDA\u2019s National Veterinary Services Laboratories or neighboring  laboratories. However, these same laboratory officials told us that while  USDA was very generous with its support, they are concerned that the  agency may not be able to provide such support in the event of multiple  outbreaks. Officials in another state overcame this problem by  accepting volunteers from various agencies to run samples but noted  that, because these volunteers were unskilled in laboratory procedures,  valuable time was lost in training them.", "Another problem encountered during past outbreaks was transporting  samples to the laboratory in a timely manner, especially in large states.  For example, in one state, the laboratory running the diagnostic AI tests  was located 3 hours from the site of the outbreak. Laboratory officials  told us it was resource-intensive for personnel to drive 3 hours each  way to collect samples. Moreover, because samples were collected and  delivered to the laboratory at the end of the day, a bottleneck  developed, requiring laboratory technicians to work overtime to  complete tests. The laboratory has since put in place a \u201cpony express\u201d  system, in which samples will be delivered to and collected from a drop- off point midway between the infected premises and the laboratory.  Laboratory officials in California that dealt with these challenges  throughout the yearlong exotic Newcastle disease outbreak advocate  developing an advance emergency response plan specifically for  diagnostic laboratory operations that covers, for example, rotating  work schedules for laboratory workers, protocols for receiving  samples, and an Incident Command System specific to a laboratory  setting to facilitate emergency response.", "Depopulation. Mass depopulation of infected birds is a continuing  challenge because of the number of workers needed to depopulate a  commercial poultry house, the time required to do so, and the risk to  human health as a result of workers\u2019 direct exposure to the virus. State  and industry officials estimate that it takes 20 to 30 workers to  depopulate a single commercial broiler house using a common method  of mass depopulation, carbon dioxide gas. Because of the large number  of birds involved\u2014tens of thousands in a commercial broiler house\u2014 this process can take several hours. This method, therefore, puts  workers\u2019 health at risk by exposing them for prolonged periods of time  to potentially high concentrations of the virus within a confined space.", "Recently, USDA conditionally approved the use of a new water-based  foam method for mass depopulation that requires only two or three  workers to administer, thereby minimizing the number of workers  exposed to the virus. Despite the availability of this new method, there  are still two issues of concern related to its use. First, USDA\u2019s approval  of this method is conditional. For example, it cannot be used to  depopulate many types of poultry, such as ducks, geese, and quail,  because the necessary testing to prove that the birds are not suffering  during the depopulation process has yet to be conducted. USDA  officials told us that they have begun working with the University of  Delaware and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and  Consumer Services to investigate the effects of using foam to  depopulate these populations. Second, this method cannot be applied in  all environments, such as in houses where birds are raised in cages,  which is the most challenging commercial environment to depopulate.  USDA, state, and industry officials told us that depopulating layers  raised in cages is a particularly time-consuming process because a  commercial layer house can contain hundreds of thousands of birds,  and each bird must be removed from its cage before it can be killed.", "Disposal. State officials told us that disposal remains a problem for  three reasons. First, although there are several disposal options\u2014such  as burial on-site or in a landfill, and incineration (see fig. 6)\u2014the  feasibility of each option is largely dependent on environmental  conditions within that state. For example, officials in one state told us  that while burial is allowed under state law, the existence of shallow  bedrock in some parts of the state renders that option physically  impossible.", "Second, disposal requires coordination among various state agencies,  including animal health, environment, and transportation to identify  acceptable locations and methods. For example, during one state  outbreak, response stood still for several weeks while the state animal  health agency negotiated with the state environmental quality agency on  permissible disposal sites. Animal health officials in the state told us  that they had customarily used on-site burial for disposal, but that  during the outbreak, the environmental agency prohibited that option  because residents worried about water contamination. For nearly a  month, the animal health agency worked to identify major municipal  landfills that would accept the birds and establish protocols for  transporting the carcasses there. During this time, they could not  dispose of any birds, and 40 more flocks became infected,  overwhelming state and industry resources.", "Third, given the heightened public awareness and concerns about highly  pathogenic H5N1, disposal options may be limited. Officials in one state  told us that landfill owners who once accepted AI-infected poultry and  material are now refusing to accept poultry carcasses infected with  either low pathogenic or highly pathogenic AI because of public fears  about the human health risks. Officials in another state are beginning  to experience the same problem. State and USDA officials told us that  on-site composting is a preferred method because it kills the virus  without moving the infected material off the infected premises. But this  option is not always available because, for example, some poultry  houses are too small to accommodate the equipment needed to  compost. State and industry officials also told us that ensuring the  infected materials are completely composted requires careful attention  and maintenance. Failure to dispose of infected carcasses in a timely  manner increases the risk of disease spread and allows the virus to  remain in the environment.", "Movement of birds through the mail. DHS and some state officials  remain concerned that birds shipped through the mail or on commercial  airlines do not all have health certificates to ensure they are free from  disease. As a result, birds infected with highly pathogenic AI could be  delivered to unsuspecting owners, causing the disease to spread long  distances to once healthy flocks. For example, poultry are often moved  through the U.S. Postal Service for distribution and breeding purposes.  Most states require that birds brought into the state be health-certified  via USDA\u2019s National Poultry Improvement Plan or accompanied by a  veterinary health certificate issued in the state of origin. However,  concerned state officials told us that the U.S. Postal Service does not  always check for the state-required documentation, and they are  concerned that many birds are entering states undocumented, illegally,  and potentially diseased. In 2003, agriculture officials in North Carolina  tracked shipments of birds at three postal facilities for 9 days. Of the  5,113 birds entering the state via the U.S. Postal Service, 72 percent, or  3,127 birds did not have the necessary health documentation certifying  they were free from disease. In addition, birds without health  certification were collocated in the same room as birds with health  clearances, possibly spreading disease from infected to certified healthy  birds.", "DHS and state officials told us that this problem could affect  commercial airlines as well. Birds are transported on commercial  aircraft, but, according to state officials, airlines do not consistently  check for health certification. In light of this concern, state officials in  North Carolina interviewed airline representatives and found that  airline policies for accepting birds varied widely. While some airlines  required health documentation, others did not. These officials told us  they do not know the extent of this problem because they were  restricted from entering airline cargo holding areas.", "Personal protective equipment. State and industry officials who have  used personal protective equipment in past outbreaks caution that,  although necessary, equipment to protect workers remains problematic  and, under various conditions, could encumber and delay response. In  2006, the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health  Administration released updated guidance for protecting poultry  workers in the event of a suspected or confirmed AI outbreak at a  poultry facility. Specifically, it recommends that animal health  responders wear protective clothing, such as an impermeable apron or  surgical gown with long, cuffed sleeves; disposable protective shoe  covers or rubber or polyurethane boots that can be cleaned and  disinfected; safety goggles to protect the mucous membranes of the  eyes; and, at a minimum, disposable, particulate respirators (e.g., N95).  Responders who cannot wear a disposable, particulate respirator,  because of facial hair or other limitations, should wear a loose-fitting  (i.e., helmeted or hooded) powered air purifying respirator equipped  with high-efficiency filters.", "State officials told us that in poultry houses that have been sealed to  prevent the virus from spreading, temperatures can become extreme in  hot weather, slowing down responders wearing this type of equipment.  In addition, state officials told us goggles can become fogged, making it  impossible to see. Moreover, the minimum required disposable  particulate respirator is difficult to breathe through, yet it is commonly  used because of its low cost. For these reasons, workers have, at  times, removed the protective equipment while carrying out their  duties. Furthermore, officials told us it is difficult and dangerous for  responders to attempt to climb ladders to reach birds in cages several  stories high wearing heavy boots, thick gloves, and hooded respirators.", "Finally, federal, state, and industry officials told us that respirators pose  other challenges. Specifically, the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration\u2019s standards require that respirators be used in the  context of a complete respiratory protection program. This program  involves, among other things, selecting an appropriate respirator,  conducting medical evaluations to determine an employee\u2019s ability to  use a respirator, providing training, and checking to ensure that  respirators fit properly. To be effective, tight-fitting respirators must  have a proper sealing surface on the wearer's face. USDA officials told  us that, although they are diligently working to medically evaluate and  fit responders with respirators at this time, it is expected that some of  this will still need to occur at the time of an outbreak, slowing down the  response process. Another concern involves the use of powered air  purifying respirators. Some state officials told us they are expensive  and impractical. It takes many hours to depopulate a house, but the  batteries to operate this kind of respirator last only for specified  periods of time, potentially delaying response. These respirators are  also heavy. One state official told us that, as an alternative, the state  department of agriculture is planning to use a full-face respirator for a  variety of reasons. A full-face respirator is lighter and less expensive  than a powered respirator and, because it does not require batteries,  there is no time limit for use. Also, it has an advantage over goggles  because it is less prone to fogging. According to Occupational Safety  and Health Administration guidelines, all respirators have pros and  cons.", "Antiviral medication. USDA has not estimated the amount of antiviral  medication that it would need in the event of an outbreak of highly  pathogenic AI or resolved how to provide such supplies within the first  24 hours of an outbreak. According to Occupational Safety and Health  Administration guidelines, poultry workers responding to an outbreak  of highly pathogenic AI should take antiviral medication daily while  working at the site of an outbreak and each day for 7 days after leaving  the site. Further, the National Veterinary Stockpile is required to contain  sufficient amount of antiviral medication to respond to the most  damaging animal diseases that affect human health and the economy,  and it must be capable of deployment within 24 hours of an outbreak.", "Despite these requirements, stockpile officials have not estimated how  much antiviral medication would be needed during a particular  outbreak scenario. In addition, the National Veterinary Stockpile has not  yet obtained any antiviral medication for highly pathogenic AI. Stockpile  officials cite several reasons for this. First, since the National Veterinary  Stockpile is responsible for many animal diseases, not just highly  pathogenic AI, it faces competing priorities. According to these officials,  the first priority is to build the infrastructure to acquire, maintain, and  deliver veterinary supplies for critical animal diseases, including highly  pathogenic AI. Second, although this infrastructure could be used to  deliver antiviral medication for highly pathogenic AI, stockpile officials  told us that, to prevent duplication of efforts and limit costs, the best  strategy would be to gain access to HHS\u2019 Strategic National Stockpile of  16 million doses of the same antiviral. Presidential Directive 9  emphasizes that the National Veterinary Stockpile should leverage,  where appropriate, the mechanisms and infrastructure that have been  developed for the management, storage, and distribution of the  Strategic National Stockpile. However, HHS officials told National  Veterinary Stockpile officials that the antiviral medication in the  Strategic National Stockpile is reserved for use during a human  pandemic and is not to be used to protect responders to an outbreak of  AI among poultry. Third, as an alternative, National Veterinary Stockpile  officials told us they are in the process of contracting with a  manufacturer of antiviral medication to provide, within 24 hours of an  outbreak, antiviral medication for 3,000 responders for 6 weeks.  However, according to stockpile officials, this contract is not yet in  place.", "Although the National Veterinary Stockpile does not yet have antiviral  medication on hand, another unit within APHIS\u2014the Safety, Health, and  Employee Wellness Branch\u2014currently has 34,800 doses and has been  working to secure more. In fact, the branch recently entered into an  agreement with HHS\u2019 Federal Occupational Health agency to, among  other things, provide medical professionals at the site of an outbreak  who would supply and distribute antiviral medication to responders, as  well as monitor their health. However, the agreement does not specify  how many doses will be provided or when they will be delivered.  According to branch officials, delivery can be guaranteed only if APHIS  purchases a set amount of antiviral medication in advance of an  outbreak. Given the current situation, Federal Occupational Health will  supply whatever amount of antiviral medication it has in stock at the  time of an outbreak, which may or may not be sufficient, and then  pursue additional doses. In the meantime, according to branch officials,  the branch will provide responders the 34,800 doses it currently has on  hand. However, this supply is set to expire at the end of 2007, and the  branch has no funds to replace it.

Second, unless USDA identifies capabilities for a  defined outbreak scenario, creates a response plan based on this  information with the appropriate performance measures, and then tests  this plan, USDA and its response partners will not be well-informed on  their level of readiness. Third, until USDA develops a standard set of  criteria that state response plans should contain, state-level plans will  continue to have shortcomings that could impede efforts to contain future  outbreaks. Fourth, unless USDA provides additional assistance to states to  address unresolved issues, USDA and the states will face real-time  challenges as an outbreak unfolds; a potentially devastating scenario.

Nevertheless, USDA accepted the need to clarify  roles during such an event and further supported the need to test this  coordination in formal exercises. USDA also stated that it will work with  DHS, states, and other agencies to identify the best interagency mechanism  to accomplish this planning.

Specifically, we reviewed the Animal  Health Protection Act; the Stafford Act; regulations for indemnification  applicable to highly pathogenic AI, Part 53 of Title 9 of the Code of Federal  Regulations, and those for low pathogenic AI, Part 56 of Title 9 of the Code  of Federal Regulations; Homeland Security Presidential Directives 5, 8, and  9, which respectively address management of domestic incidents, national  preparedness, and the defense of agriculture and food; the National  Response Plan with revisions issued in May 2006; and recently developed  presidential documents, including the National Strategy for Pandemic  Influenza and the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for  Pandemic Influenza. We also reviewed USDA\u2019s National Poultry  Improvement Plan, documents in the National Animal Health Emergency  Management System, as well as those being drafted for highly pathogenic  AI specifically. Furthermore, we interviewed USDA officials from the  Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Agricultural Research  Service, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, as well as officials from  the offices of the Executive Secretariat, Communications, Budget and  Program Analysis, and General Counsel. We also interviewed Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) officials from the Office of the Chief Medical  Officer, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Preparedness  Directorate. Moreover, we interviewed officials from the National  Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the American Veterinary  Medical Association, the National Turkey Foundation, the National  Chicken Council, the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, and the Food and  Water Watch. We also attended a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza  Workshop that was jointly sponsored by the U.S. Poultry and Egg  Association and USDA, with attendees from academia, the poultry industry,  state governments, and the federal government. Finally, we attended a 3- day AI tabletop exercise involving representatives from USDA, industry,  and the state of Georgia.", "To identify any challenges that could affect USDA\u2019s ability to protect  domestic poultry from highly pathogenic AI, in addition to the activities  described above for objective one, we conducted structured interviews in  person and via telephone with officials from five states that have  experienced and responded to an outbreak of AI or a comparable highly  infectious avian disease in the past 5 years. These states also represent  varying poultry demographics. Specifically, we interviewed state animal  health and APHIS officials; poultry industry representatives; and animal  health diagnostic laboratory personnel in California, Delaware, Maryland,  Texas, and Virginia. We also visited several commercial and one backyard  poultry operation, as well as live bird markets that kept animals indoors in  cages, as well as those markets with animals housed in outdoor pens. We  also interviewed avian health specialists whom we selected for their  technical expertise on avian health and emergency avian disease response.  In particular, we sought to obtain their comments on the virology and  epidemiology of highly pathogenic AI, including H5N1, as well as current  research in mass poultry depopulation and disposal methods.", "To better understand challenges associated with planning at the state level,  we interviewed the officials noted above as well as, at the recommendation  of DHS, officials from the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and  Consumer Services and officials representing 21 states from the Multi-State  Partnership for Security in Agriculture and the Southern Agriculture and  Animal Disaster Response Alliance. We also conducted structured  interviews with APHIS\u2019 Regional Directors and Area Emergency  Coordinators who are responsible for working directly with the states.  Among other things, we asked the Area Emergency Coordinators, who are  specifically charged with helping states develop AI response plans, to  identify strengths and weaknesses in their state plans and to characterize  their state\u2019s level of readiness for an outbreak. We also performed our own  review and assessment of 19 state plans to corroborate identified strengths  and weaknesses from the interviews.

Our report acknowledges that USDA has a preliminary estimate  regarding the amount of antiviral medication needed based on the  exotic Newcastle disease outbreak. However, as our report also states,  this number does not reflect a calculated estimate of those exposed to  the virus in need of medication. Furthermore, our report acknowledges  that National Veterinary Stockpile officials are in the process of  contracting with a manufacturer of antiviral medication to provide,  within 24 hours of an outbreak, antiviral medication for 3,000  responders for 6 weeks.
