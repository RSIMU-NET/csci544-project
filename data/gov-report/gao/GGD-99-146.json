This number accounts for (1) about one-tenth of 1 percent of all inmates in custody as of June 30, 1998, (or approximately 1.2 million) and (2) about 2 percent of all inmates participating in correctional industry work programs (approximately 61,500). Almost all of the inmates who had access to personal information were being held in federal or state-run facilities (1,332 inmates) as opposed to privately run facilities (25 inmates).", "The number of inmates with access to personal information in each of the 19 states ranged from 6 in New Jersey to 426 in California. The types of information to which the largest number of inmates had access were (1) names and dates of birth or (2) Social Security numbers. About 30 percent of the inmates had access to names and (1) drivers\u2019 license numbers or (2) vehicle makes and models.

Over half of the inmates with access to personal information were involved in data entry work. Another about 25 percent of the inmates were duplicating or scanning documents. Types of information processed in these work programs included medical records; state, county, or local licenses; automobile registrations; unemployment records; student enrollment data; and accident reports.", "The length of time the contracts that resulted in inmates having access to personal information had been in effect ranged from less than 1 year to 19 years. About 1 quarter of the contracts had been in place from 10 to 19 years; the remainder were more recent. The reasons BOP and states most commonly identified for selecting the contracts that resulted in inmates having access to personal information were the contracts provided valuable job skills training, satisfied a need or demand for a service, were needed to provide work for more inmates, were profitable, and provided work that was relatively easy for training inmates.", "Questionnaire respondents from 11 states said they planned to add and/or expand existing correctional industry work programs that allow inmates access to personal information. Respondents from 29 states said they did not plan to add or expand existing work programs that would allow inmates access to personal information, and respondents from 8 states said they did not know whether their states had plans to add and/or expand existing correctional industry work programs that would allow inmates access to personal information.", "In response to our survey, 29 states indicated that inmates did not have access to personal information on September 30, 1998.

The federal government and seven states in which inmates had access to personal information were identified as having either enacted statutes or had bills pending that related to limiting which inmates could perform work involving personal information.", "The safeguards most frequently reported as being used when inmates had access to personal information were close supervision; selective hiring (e.g., excluding inmates convicted of sex offenses or fraud); confidentiality agreements; and security checks at the work area exits.

Appendix III provides additional information on the safeguards cited by questionnaire respondents.", "BOP and most of the 19 states in which inmates had access to personal information reported that they had prison procedures that placed limitations on which inmates could perform work that would give them access to personal information. Questionnaire respondents from BOP and 18 states said that they screened inmates before hiring them for work programs involving personal information. For example, one state respondent said that inmates who were convicted of rape or who have life sentences were ineligible to work on contracts where they would have access to personal information. In addition, in the course of our work, statutes or proposed legislation related to this issue were identified in seven of the states as well as the federal government in which inmates had access to personal information.

Each of these incidents was associated with a different contract. Six of the incidents involved inmates contacting individuals identified through a work program by telephone or by mail (in one of these instances, the inmate in the work program passed information on an individual to another inmate, who then contacted the individual). Two incidents involved inmates using credit card numbers that they obtained through participating in a work program. The other incident involved two inmates\u2019 attempts to smuggle copies of documents out of the prison through the U.S. mail.", "Five of the contracts related to these incidents were terminated after the incident occurred.

In the remaining incident, the prison\u2019s procedures remained the same. For more information on these incidents, see appendix IX.", "Questionnaire respondents also provided information on four additional incidents that did not meet the previously described criteria for misuse of personal information. On the basis of one or more of the following reasons, these four incidents were not included in appendix IX: no reported injury, a court finding of no wrongdoing, or termination of the inmate from the work program on the basis of an allegation or suspected wrongdoing. These incidents, however, resulted in some type of program change. The types of program changes ranged from adding or reinforcing policies and safeguards to program termination. Briefly, these incidents, as reported by the respondents, consisted of the following:", "An inmate was processing accident reports in a data entry work program.", "He told another inmate, not in the work program, about an individual involved in one of the accident reports he processed. The other inmate contacted the individual involved in the accident. The questionnaire respondent reported that nobody was harmed, safeguards did not fail, and no sanctions were taken. After this incident, the state reportedly reinforced its policies and safeguards associated with this contract.", "An inmate working in a data entry work program saw, reportedly by accident, a state document that had information about one of his family members. He spoke with another member of his family about the information he saw. A member of his family filed a lawsuit claiming that the inmate should not have had access to this information. The questionnaire respondent reported that the case was dismissed because the information was covered by an open record regulation whereby birth records are considered to be public records. The state, however, canceled the contract for processing this type of information.", "An inmate working in a telemarketing work program was accused of harassing a customer. The inmate was terminated and transferred to maximum security on the basis of the allegation alone. The state reportedly implemented additional safeguards after the alleged incident was reported.", "An inmate wrote a letter to an individual, and it was suspected that the inmate obtained the individual\u2019s name and address through the work program.

However, it took two exceptions with the report. First, the Association said that the information on inmates\u2019 access to personal information is presented largely out of context. We disagree. Our draft report said that of approximately 1.2 million inmates, about 1,400 in BOP and 19 state prison systems had access to personal information through correctional industry work programs. We noted that less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of BOP\u2019s and no more than 22 percent of any state\u2019s fiscal year 1998 gross correctional industry income was generated from contracts that resulted in inmates having access to personal information. Further, we pointed out that about a quarter of the contracts that resulted in inmates having access to personal information had been in place from 10 to 19 years.", "Second, the Association said that a benchmark is needed against which the success or failure of correctional industries to control access issues can be measured. We did not judge whether the correctional industries have succeeded or failed in their attempt to prevent the misuse of personal information to which inmates had access as the result of work programs because we are not aware of criteria by which to make such a judgment.", "However, given that the inmates with access to personal information are individuals who have been incarcerated for crimes, and given that the institutional settings permit work program officials to exercise close scrutiny over the inmates and work places, breaches of security and misuses of personal information are a cause for concern.

We then contacted the individuals whom we had identified as overseeing work programs at privately run facilities to ensure that they had responsibility for each facility that met our criteria. If they stated that they did not have responsibility, we asked them who did and repeated this procedure until we reached the appropriate party.", "We mailed a total of 63 questionnaires: 1 to BOP, 1 to each state and the District of Columbia, 1 to a youth authority, 1 to a joint venture program, and 1 each to 9 privately run facilities that had been identified by the method described above.
