GAO found that no comprehensive national data exist on the extent to which medication synchronization has been used or its potential effects. However, limited information suggests that the use of medication synchronization has increased in recent years and that it may have benefits. According to a study published in the American Journal of Managed Care that examined survey data on retail pharmacies, the number of pharmacies using medication synchronization increased from 3,324 in 2013 to 5,534 in 2014. Most of the studies that GAO identified found positive effects from medication synchronization, primarily on patients. For example, a 2018 study reported a 3 percent improvement in medication adherence among patients using medication synchronization than those who were not. Several stakeholders also identified potential limitations of using medication synchronization. For example, some patients may not be able to afford paying all the copayments for their medications at one time each month, and some patients prefer the social interaction of multiple trips to the pharmacy each month.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a regulation and some states enacted laws that may help support the use of medication synchronization. While CMS does not have a formal medication synchronization policy for Medicare, a CMS regulation allows for reduced beneficiary cost sharing (for example, a lower copayment) when the beneficiary receives less than a month's supply of a medication. Similar laws pertain to private health plans that provide prescription drug coverage for patients in the five states GAO selected\u2014Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Texas, and Washington. Such measures support medication synchronization because initially aligning the refill dates of multiple medications may require one or more of these medications to be refilled with a quantity that is less than a month's supply. Officials from CMS and four of the selected pharmacies said that lowering the copayments for these refills reduces the financial burden on patients when they first have their medications synchronized.

The last study reported that 56 percent of  patients surveyed stated that they would be more adherent to their  medications if their refills were synchronized. In addition, eight of  these studies evaluated the effects of medication synchronization for  patients with different chronic conditions and found differences by  type of chronic condition. According to the studies, medication  adherence improves as a result of medication synchronization  because it simplifies the refilling process.", "Improved medical outcomes. One peer-reviewed study reported  that medication synchronization may also lead to improved medical  outcomes for patients. The study found that rates of hospitalization  and emergency department visits and rates of outpatient visits were 9  percent and 3 percent lower, respectively, among patients using  medication synchronization compared with those who were not.", "Stakeholders also cited improved medication adherence and medical  outcomes as potential benefits for patients, and also identified additional  benefits that may result from medication synchronization. Specifically, 14  of the 15 stakeholders representing patient and pharmacy organizations  and selected pharmacies we interviewed said that medication  synchronization may help improve patients\u2019 medication adherence, and  12 of these stakeholders said that it may improve patients\u2019 medical  outcomes. These stakeholders also indicated other potential benefits for  patients:  Improved convenience. Medication synchronization improves  convenience for patients\u2014for example, by reducing the number of  trips patients need to make to the pharmacy or making it easier to  manage their medications, according to 10 of the 15 stakeholders  representing patient and pharmacy organizations and selected  pharmacies. Fewer trips to the pharmacy help to minimize the need  for transportation arrangements, which is particularly important for  older patients, patients who live in rural areas, and patients who lack  reliable transportation. Five of the 10 stakeholders added that  medication synchronization simplifies patients\u2019 experience with  managing their medications\u2014patients no longer need to keep track of  multiple refill dates for all their medications. Under medication  synchronization, the pharmacists proactively perform this work and  send reminders to the patients.", "Increased interaction between pharmacists and patients. Seven  of 15 stakeholders representing patient and pharmacy organizations  and selected pharmacies told us that medication synchronization  increases the interaction patients have with their pharmacists, which  may help patients better manage their medication regimens and  improve their overall health. For example, a stakeholder representing  pharmacies said that prior to the medication synchronization date,  pharmacies generally contact patients to confirm that their  medications should be filled; as part of this outreach, they also inquire  about any changes in the patients\u2019 medical history or therapy. If such  changes are identified, pharmacists follow up with patients, and their  physicians if necessary, to ensure that patients receive refills  reflecting any necessary medication changes. In addition, according  to some stakeholders, if a consultation is also provided on the  medication synchronization date, pharmacists have more  opportunities to answer patients\u2019 questions about medication use,  provide counseling, and offer patients other auxiliary services. For  example, some stakeholders told us that pharmacists may provide  screenings for blood pressure and diabetes, or recommend  immunizations to patients when they pick up their medications.  Because pharmacists regularly assess patients\u2019 medical history in  preparing for medication synchronization, they can target patients who  may be at high risk for medical problems or immunization-preventable  diseases.", "Regarding pharmacies, some studies and stakeholders identified the  following potential benefits of medication synchronization.", "Operational efficiencies. Three peer-reviewed studies reported that  medication synchronization can lead to operational efficiencies. For  example, one study reported that medication synchronization can help  pharmacists better manage inventory and personnel costs and  improve workflow. Nine out of 12 stakeholders representing  pharmacy organizations and selected pharmacies also said that  medication synchronization can lead to improvements in operational  efficiencies. For example, officials from one organization representing  pharmacies said that pharmacists save time when they can dispense  all of a patient\u2019s medications at one time instead of several times  throughout the month.", "Increased marketability of pharmacies to health plans. According  to one peer-reviewed study and five of the 12 stakeholders  representing pharmacy organizations and selected pharmacies, the  extent to which a pharmacy\u2019s medication synchronization program  improves patient care, such as by improving medication adherence,  may make the pharmacy more desirable to health plans. For example,  according to the study and officials from one organization  representing pharmacies, health plans may include pharmacies with  highly adherent patients in the plans\u2019 preferred pharmacy networks.  Pharmacies in preferred pharmacy networks can offer lower  medication prices, attracting more customers.", "Increased revenue. Three peer-reviewed studies and five of the 12  stakeholders representing pharmacy organizations and selected  pharmacies reported that, to the extent that medication  synchronization can improve patients\u2019 medication adherence, it can  also lead to increased pharmacy revenues generally because of an  increase in filled prescriptions. For example, one of the three peer- reviewed studies reported that medication synchronization resulted in  an average increase in medication adherence of almost 5 percent  over the first 6 months of its use. Similarly, an industry study found  that medication synchronization leads to an additional 20 fills per  patient per year, and may lead to an average of $1,120 of additional  revenue per enrolled patient annually. The three peer-reviewed  studies and the industry study did not examine the causes of the  increase in prescription fills, but their authors generally attributed the  increase to the improved adherence of patients using medication  synchronization. Two of the three studies reported that medication  synchronization can increase pharmacy revenues generally because  of an increase in filled prescriptions. In addition, officials from four  stakeholders representing pharmacy organizations and selected  pharmacies told us that pharmacies that use medication  synchronization can leverage these opportunities to speak with  patients and offer additional services, such as immunizations; these  services can further help increase pharmacy revenue.", "Regarding health plans, some studies and stakeholders identified the  following potential benefits of medication synchronization.", "Higher Medicare quality performance scores. Three peer-reviewed  studies reported that medication synchronization can potentially  improve health plans\u2019 Medicare quality performance scores. CMS  assesses the quality performance of Part D plans using information on  various measures, such as adherence to medications for diabetes,  high cholesterol, or hypertension. Specifically, CMS rates the plans\u2019  performance using a star rating system, which gives each plan a  score of between one and five stars, with five stars being the highest  rating. Medication adherence measures are triple weighted in the  calculation of a plan\u2019s overall rating. Plans with the highest star  ratings are rewarded with member enrollment incentives, while plans  with lower star ratings are penalized. In addition, Medicare Advantage  plans with high ratings may also receive financial bonuses from  Medicare. To the extent that there are improvements in  beneficiaries\u2019 medication adherence as a result of medication  synchronization, health plans may experience improved performance  ratings and the commensurate financial benefits. However, only one  of the four stakeholders representing health plan organizations and  selected health plans indicated improved Medicare quality  performance scores as a potential benefit of medication  synchronization.", "Reduced medical costs. Medication synchronization may also  benefit health plans by reducing their overall medical costs, according  to one peer-reviewed study. The study found that medication  synchronization can result in significant savings in medical costs for  health plans, despite the increase in medication costs to the health  plan. Specifically, the study reported that medical savings per  additional dollar spent on medications under medication  synchronization ranged from approximately $1 to $37, depending on  the medication. According to the study, health plans could potentially  experience such reduced medical costs as a result of medication  synchronization because when patients are adherent to their  medications, they may decrease their utilization of healthcare  services. However, only one of the four stakeholders representing  health plan organizations and selected health plans cited this as a  potential benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies and Stakeholders also Identified Potential Limitations of Medication Synchronization for Patients, Pharmacies, and Health Plans", "paragraphs": ["A small number of studies and several stakeholders indicated that there  are some potential limitations associated with medication synchronization.

In addition, one  stakeholder said that some patients prefer going to the pharmacy  regularly or consider trips to the pharmacy as opportunities for social  interaction and may not be interested in medication synchronization.", "Pharmacies. One peer-reviewed study reported that using medication  synchronization is time- and labor-intensive for pharmacies.  Specifically, the study reported that almost 60 percent of pharmacists  surveyed indicated that implementing medication synchronization  involves a significant change in a pharmacy\u2019s workflow. Seven of 12  stakeholders representing pharmacy organizations and selected  pharmacies said this was because of several challenges. For  example, it may be complicated to set up the initial synchronization,  determine the best anchor medication and synchronization date, or  adjust patients\u2019 medication synchronization because of changes in  their medical needs or therapy. In addition, pharmacists may have to  conduct extensive follow-up with health plans because health plans  may not be consistent in how they process pharmacies\u2019 claims that  involve short fills. For example, private health plans may initially deny  coverage of short fills; such denials may require the pharmacist to  expend additional resources to follow-up with the health plan to obtain  approval for the short fill.", "Health plans. Officials from the two selected health plans told us that  they do not require their Part D network pharmacies to use medication  synchronization, nor do they compensate pharmacies for providing  these services. While all stakeholders representing health plan  organizations and selected health plans said that they view  medication synchronization as having the potential to improve  patients\u2019 medication adherence and health outcomes, two of these  stakeholders noted the lack of data explicitly tying medication  synchronization to improved patient medication adherence, medical  outcomes, and overall medical costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A CMS Regulation and Laws in Selected States May Support the Use of Medication Synchronization, Such as By Reducing Patient Cost Sharing", "paragraphs": ["Our review shows that a CMS regulation and laws related to prescription  drug coverage in five selected states may support the use of medication  synchronization.

Specifically, CMS issued a regulation that, starting in 2014,  required Medicare Part D plans to establish a daily cost-sharing rate (for  example, a prorated copayment) when a beneficiary receives less than a  month\u2019s supply of a prescription medication\u2014generally referred to as a  short fill. According to CMS, the primary goal of the regulation was to  reduce medication cost and waste\u2014such as by allowing beneficiaries to  initially receive a short fill of a new medication so that they can assess, in  consultation with their providers, the efficacy of the medication and any  associated adverse side effects.", "Because short fills may be needed to initially synchronize multiple  medications to the same refill date, the prorated copayment may reduce  the financial burden on beneficiaries who require these fills, according to  CMS officials. In addition, officials from a selected pharmacy and officials  from a technology vendor added that from a value perspective,  beneficiaries may be reluctant to enroll in medication synchronization if  they had to pay a full copayment for less than a month\u2019s supply of  medication. For example, as illustrated in figure 2, to initiate medication  synchronization for a beneficiary taking three medications, each with a  different refill date, the pharmacist may dispense short fills for two of the  three medications. In this case, the pharmacist may dispense 8 days\u2019  supply of one medication and 3 days\u2019 supply of another medication.

These laws may also support medication  synchronization by allowing health plans and pharmacies to work  around certain plan policies that may impose limits on medication  refills. Specifically, officials from a technology vendor told us that  some health plans may impose limits on the number of refills that can  be dispensed in a month. For example, if a patient is taking five  medications and is limited to five refills a month, a short fill would  count towards that limit and the patient may not then be able to get all  of his or her medications covered by the health plan that month. Such  laws allow the health plan and pharmacy to work around these  quantity limits so that the patient can receive the needed short fills to  synchronize all of his or her medications. Additionally, two states\u2014 Maine and Texas\u2014specifically require their health plans to allow  pharmacies to override denials related to refilling a prescription too  soon. A pharmacy may receive such denials when refilling a  prescription after having just filled it\u2014for example, dispensing a short  and full refill of a medication too close together.

Laws in four of the  five selected states prohibit health plans in their state from paying  pharmacies a prorated dispensing fee for medication short fills.  Pharmacies receive a dispensing fee from health plans for each  prescription they fill to cover the pharmacies\u2019 administrative costs of  preparing and dispensing a fill. The dispensing fee is in addition to the  reimbursement pharmacies receive from health plans for the costs of  the medications. In states without this law, health plans may prorate  the dispensing fee for short fills\u2014that is, pay a lower fee because a  smaller quantity of medications (for example, 10 pills rather than 30  pills) is dispensed. Officials from a technology vendor and an  organization representing pharmacies told us that ensuring that a  health plan pays a full dispensing fee provides an incentive for  pharmacies to use medication synchronization.
