The recent emergence of concierge care has prompted federal concern about how the approach might affect beneficiaries of Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the aged and some disabled individuals. Concerns include the potential that membership fees may constitute additional charges for services that Medicare already pays physicians for and that concierge care may affect Medicare beneficiaries' access to physician services. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 directed GAO to study concierge care and its relationship to Medicare. Using a variety of methods, including a nationwide literature search and telephone interviews, GAO identified 146 concierge physicians and surveyed concierge physicians in fall 2004. GAO analyzed responses from 112 concierge physicians. GAO also reviewed relevant laws, policies, and available data on access to physician services and interviewed officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of Medicare beneficiary advocacy groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Concierge care is practiced by a small number of physicians located mainly on the East and West Coasts. Nearly all of the 112 concierge physicians responding to GAO's survey reported practicing primary care. Annual patient membership fees ranged from $60 to $15,000 a year, with about half of respondents reporting fees of $1,500 to $1,999. The most often reported features included same- or next-day appointments for nonurgent care, 24-hour telephone access, and periodic preventive care examinations. About three-fourths of respondents reported billing patient health insurance for covered services and, among those, almost all reported billing Medicare for covered services. Two principal aspects of concierge care are of interest to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries: compliance with Medicare requirements and its effect on beneficiary access to physician services. HHS has determined that concierge care arrangements are allowed as long as they do not violate any Medicare requirements; for example, the membership fee must not result in additional charges for items or services that Medicare already reimburses. Some concierge physicians reported to GAO that they would like more HHS guidance. The small number of concierge physicians makes it unlikely that the approach has contributed to widespread access problems. GAO's review of available information on beneficiaries' overall access to physician services suggests that concierge care does not present a systemic access problem among Medicare beneficiaries at this time. In comments on a draft version of this report, HHS agreed with GAO's finding on concierge care's impact on beneficiary access to physician services and indicated it will continue to follow developments in this area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Concierge care is an approach to medical practice in which physicians  charge their patients membership fees in exchange for enhanced services  or amenities. Concierge physicians typically care for fewer patients than do  doctors in conventional practice, and they are more readily available to  member patients, for example, by cell phone or same-day appointments.  The approach has attracted media attention in recent years. Critics contend  that concierge care makes health care more lucrative for a few physicians  and more convenient for some patients, but less accessible to patients who  cannot or choose not to pay a membership fee. Proponents, in contrast,  describe concierge care as both a rational response to patient demand for  more personal care and a way for physicians to regain control of their  medical practices and their lives. They say the approach allows concierge  physicians to spend more time with their families, enhance their incomes,  and spend more time on research and other professional activities.  Because concierge care has gained attention only recently, little is known  about how many concierge physicians there are or about how the approach  could affect access to physician services.", "Concierge care has also generated attention within Congress, the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and state governments.  Federal attention has centered on how membership fees might affect  beneficiaries of Medicare, the federal health insurance program for  individuals aged 65 and older and certain persons with disabilities. Of  particular concern is the potential that membership fees may constitute  additional charges for services that Medicare already pays physicians for  and that concierge care may affect Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to  physician services. Members of Congress introduced bills that, if enacted,  would have prohibited physicians from imposing membership fees on  Medicare beneficiaries as a condition for the provision of a Medicare- covered item or service. A few states are monitoring concierge care to  ensure compliance with state insurance laws.", "Given the concerns about how concierge care might affect Medicare  beneficiaries, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 required us to study and report on the practice.  As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, this report addresses the  following questions: 1. What are the characteristics of concierge care? 2. What aspects of concierge care are of interest to the Medicare program  and its beneficiaries?", "To obtain information on the characteristics of concierge care, we surveyed  concierge physicians about their practices and the types of services and  financial arrangements they offer. Because no comprehensive directory of  concierge physicians was available, we identified concierge physicians  through a variety of methods, including a nationwide literature search,  telephone interviews, and referrals from other concierge physicians. We  identified as concierge physicians those who (1) had established a direct  financial relationship with patients in the form of a membership or retainer  fee and (2) provided enhanced services or amenities, such as same-day  appointments or preventive services not covered by patient health  insurance. We located a total of 146 concierge physicians practicing in the  United States. We received survey responses from 112 physicians who  practiced concierge care in October 2004. Because these 112 respondents  were not selected at random from a larger population of known concierge  physicians, the information they provided cannot be projected to any other  concierge physicians. We did not attempt to verify the accuracy of their  responses.", "To review the aspects of concierge care that are of interest to the Medicare  program and its beneficiaries, we reviewed documents and interviewed  officials from two HHS entities responsible for administration and  oversight of the Medicare program: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). We also  reviewed relevant sections of Medicare law and regulations; interviewed  concierge physicians and their representatives; and in our survey, asked  concierge physicians for their views on the guidance available from HHS on  concierge care. To assess what is known about how concierge care may  affect Medicare beneficiary access to physician services, we reviewed  nationwide sources of information on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 overall  access to physician services, for example, reports by the Medicare Payment  Advisory Commission. While we did not contact Medicare beneficiaries  who were patients of physicians who converted to concierge practices, we  contacted organizations that Medicare beneficiaries were likely to call with  concerns or questions about concierge care, such as the 1-800-MEDICARE  call line. We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards from May 2004 through July 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Physician practices that charge membership or retainer fees and provide  enhanced services or amenities are referred to as concierge care or retainer-based medicine. The origins of this practice approach are often  traced to a medical practice founded in Seattle, Washington, in 1996.  Physicians in this practice provide comprehensive primary care to no more  than 100 patients each and currently charge annual retainer fees of $13,000  for individuals. These physicians do not bill any form of patient health  insurance. As more physicians have begun concierge practices, concierge  care has become more diverse, comprising physicians who bill patient  insurance, charge lower membership fees, and see more patients than the  original Seattle practice.", "The American Medical Association (AMA) has described concierge care as  one of many options that patients and physicians are free to pursue. AMA  in 2003 adopted ethics guidelines for physicians who have concierge care  contracts\u2014which AMA calls retainer contracts\u2014with their patients. These  guidelines specify, for example, that physicians should facilitate the  transition to new physicians for patients who choose not to join their  concierge practices and that they must observe relevant laws, rules, and  contracts.", "The Medicare program was established by title XVIII of the Social Security  Act, which governs how physicians bill for services that the program  covers. Limits on what physicians may charge their Medicare patients  depend on (1) the relationship between the physician and the Medicare  program and (2) the type of service provided.", "Physicians who provide services to Medicare beneficiaries may choose one  of three ways to relate to the program: participating, nonparticipating, or  opted out.", "Participating: Participating physicians agree to accept Medicare\u2019s fee  schedule amount as payment in full for all covered services they provide  to beneficiaries. In accordance with the Medicare participation  agreement, these physicians receive reimbursement directly from the  Medicare program and agree to charge beneficiaries only for any  applicable deductible or coinsurance. More than 90 percent of the physicians and others who billed Medicare agreed to participate in  Medicare in 2004.", "Nonparticipating: Nonparticipating physicians do not agree to accept  the Medicare fee schedule amount paid to participating physicians as  payment in full for all covered services they provide to beneficiaries.  They are still subject to limits on what they may charge, however, and  those limits depend on whether they seek reimbursement directly from  Medicare. When a nonparticipating physician files a claim to be  reimbursed directly from Medicare, he or she must accept the Medicare  fee schedule amount for nonparticipating physicians, which is 95  percent of the fee schedule amount for participating physicians, as  payment in full and may charge the beneficiary only for any applicable  Medicare coinsurance or deductible. When a nonparticipating  physician does not request reimbursement directly from Medicare, he or  she may charge the Medicare beneficiary up to 115 percent of the fee  schedule amount for nonparticipating physicians.", "Opted-out: Physicians who opt out of Medicare are not subject to any  limits on what they may charge their Medicare beneficiary patients, even  for services that Medicare would otherwise cover. Physicians who opt  out of Medicare must agree not to submit for 2 years any claims for  reimbursement for any of the services they provide to Medicare  beneficiaries. Contracts between opted-out physicians and their  beneficiary patients allow them to make their own financial  arrangements for services that would otherwise be covered by  Medicare, effectively taking those services outside the program. These  contracts must be in writing and they must clearly state that the  beneficiary also agrees not to submit claims to Medicare and assumes  financial responsibility for all services provided by that physician.", "In addition to a physician\u2019s Medicare participation status, the type of  service provided also determines whether limits apply to physician  charges. Physicians and beneficiaries are free to make private financial  arrangements for the provision of services that Medicare does not cover.", "General standard for Medicare coverage: Medicare law states that, to  be covered, services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis  or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a  malformed body member. The scope of coverage and the exact type of  service that may be reimbursed depend on the circumstances of each  case. This medical necessity standard can result in situations where the  same service\u2014for example, a comprehensive office visit\u2014is considered  medically necessary and reimbursable by Medicare in some  circumstances but not others.", "Specific inclusion in Medicare coverage: Medicare law also establishes  coverage for certain specific services. For example, Medicare covers an  initial preventive physical examination for beneficiaries who become  eligible for Medicare on or after January 1, 2005. Other examples of  specific preventive benefits established by statute include  immunizations against pneumonia, hepatitis B, and influenza and  periodic screening tests for early detection of certain cancers.", "Specific exclusion from Medicare coverage: Medicare law specifically  excludes certain items or services\u2014for example, personal comfort  items, purely cosmetic surgery, hearing aids, and routine physical  checkups except for the initial preventive examination for newly eligible  beneficiaries.", "Table 1 summarizes the limits on physician charges depending on their  Medicare participation status and the type of service provided.", "Physicians who impose charges on beneficiaries beyond the Medicare  limits may be subject to civil monetary penalties. The Secretary of HHS  has delegated enforcement of Medicare limits to two different entities  within HHS. CMS, which administers the Medicare program, has  enforcement authority over the limits that apply to nonparticipating  physicians. HHS OIG has enforcement authority over participating  physicians\u2019 compliance with the terms of the participation agreement.", "The Medicare law\u2019s limits on physician charges protect beneficiaries from  additional charges for services they are entitled to receive under Medicare.  The law does not, however, provide that a beneficiary has the right to  receive services from any particular physician. Physicians are free to  choose how they will interact with the Medicare program.

According to HHS OIG, these contracts included at least some services that  were already covered and reimbursable by Medicare. The alert advised  participating physicians that they could be subject to civil monetary  penalties if they requested payment from Medicare beneficiaries for those  services in addition to the relevant deductibles and coinsurance charged  for these services. In addition, the alert noted that nonparticipating  physicians may also be subject to penalties for overcharging beneficiaries  for covered services.", "Unless a concierge physician opts out of Medicare, the question of  Medicare coverage is central to whether a concierge care agreement  complies with the program\u2019s limits on patient charges. HHS OIG\u2019s March  2004 alert provided three examples of services offered by the physician in  Minnesota: coordination of care with providers, a comprehensive  assessment and plan for optimum health, and extra time spent on patient  care. HHS OIG did not indicate which, if any, of those three services were  already covered by Medicare. The resulting uncertainty, about which  features of the Minnesota physician\u2019s concierge agreement formed the  basis for HHS OIG\u2019s allegation that he violated the Medicare program\u2019s  prohibition against charging beneficiaries more than the applicable  deductible and coinsurance, generated concern among some concierge  physicians.", "According to HHS OIG officials, HHS OIG has not issued more detailed  guidance on concierge care because its role in this area is to carry out  specific delegated enforcement authorities, not to make policy. HHS OIG  addresses each situation in its specific context. Physicians with questions  about their own concierge care agreements may obtain guidance specific to  them from HHS by requesting an advisory opinion. HHS OIG\u2019s Industry  Guidance Branch issues advisory opinions on matters that fall within its  enforcement authority. It covers provisions of Medicare law that prohibit  knowingly presenting a beneficiary with a request for payment in violation  of a physician\u2019s participation agreement. Consequently, any participating  physician who operates or is considering starting a concierge practice  could request an advisory opinion. Advisory opinions are legally binding on  HHS and the requesting party as long as the arrangement is consistent with  the facts provided.

According to CMS officials in the agency\u2019s Seattle regional office, that  office has received a small number of calls about concierge care from  physicians and beneficiaries, mainly asking whether concierge care is  permitted under Medicare law. Seattle regional office officials said they  respond in accordance with CMS guidelines: they do not review specific  concierge care agreements but help beneficiaries by providing a list of local  physicians who participate in Medicare. The CMS Seattle regional office  has not found indications that beneficiaries who choose not to pay their  physician\u2019s membership fees have had problems locating new primary care  physicians.", "We did not contact Medicare beneficiaries who were patients of physicians  who converted to concierge care to determine how many of them had  sought or found new physicians. We did, however, contact organizations  that Medicare beneficiaries might call with problems or concerns, including AARP and the Medicare Rights Center. Like CMS, officials with  these organizations reported receiving a few calls from beneficiaries about  concierge care, and none reported complaints from beneficiaries about  finding a physician or about access to services because of concierge care.  Officials with these groups also reported that they have not developed a  formal system to track the issue. According to officials from these  organizations, calls from beneficiaries about concierge care are usually  requests for help interpreting the letters from their physicians explaining  the physicians\u2019 conversion to concierge care."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Although the number of physicians practicing concierge care has grown in  recent years, the total number remains very small. Available measures of  Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 overall access to care, while not directly addressing  concierge care, indicate widespread availability of physicians to treat them.  The small number of concierge physicians at the time of our review, along  with information from available measures of access to services, suggests  that concierge care does not present a systemic access problem for  Medicare beneficiaries at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comment to HHS.

Because no comprehensive directory of  concierge physicians was available, we compiled our own list of concierge  physicians to survey. We focused our survey on physicians who, as of  October 2004, (1) had established a direct financial relationship with  patients in the form of a membership or retainer fee and (2) provided  enhanced services or amenities, such as same-day appointments or  preventive services not covered by patient health insurance.", "We identified concierge physicians through a variety of methods, including  a nationwide literature search, telephone interviews, and referrals from  other concierge physicians. With the assistance of a contractor, we  compiled an initial list of potential survey participants, contacted them to  confirm that they met the criteria for inclusion in our survey, and requested  referrals to additional concierge physicians. We used a variety of sources to  establish our initial list of potential survey participants, including a  nationwide Internet search of articles in newspapers, business journals,  and medical publications; attendance at the first annual meeting of the  American Society of Concierge Physicians (now known as the Society for  Innovative Medical Practice Design); and a list of physicians affiliated with  a consulting firm that helps physicians establish and maintain concierge  practices. This process yielded a final mailing list of 187 individuals.", "We mailed the questionnaires in November 2004, after pretesting it with  concierge physicians and incorporating suggestions from several reviewers  familiar with concierge care; we followed up with nonrespondents during  December 2004 and January 2005. Two questionnaires were returned as  undeliverable; we removed those names from our total count of potential  concierge physicians. The total we used to calculate the response rate for  our survey was therefore 185.", "We received responses to our survey from 129 physicians, yielding an  overall response rate of 70 percent. Of the respondents, 112 physicians  confirmed that they practiced concierge care\u2014that is, they reported that  they charged a retainer or membership fee for enhanced services or  amenities\u2014as of October 2004. We analyzed only the information provided  by these 112 physicians. Because these 112 respondents were not randomly  sampled from a larger population of known concierge physicians, the  information they provided cannot be projected to any other concierge  physicians. We did not attempt to verify the accuracy of their responses.", "In addition to the 112 physicians practicing concierge care in October 2004  and responding to our survey, we confirmed\u2014through, for example,  telephone interviews conducted by us or our contractor\u2014the concierge  status of an additional 34 physicians who did not return our questionnaire.  This process yielded a total of 146 confirmed concierge physicians. To  analyze the geographic practice locations of these 146 physicians, we  assigned the physicians\u2019 zip codes to larger geographic units called  metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) or primary metropolitan statistical  areas (PMSA), as defined in 1999 by the Office of Management and Budget.", "To review the aspects of concierge care of interest to the Medicare program  and its beneficiaries, we reviewed relevant provisions of Medicare law and  documents from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  including Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) policy manuals  and internal memorandums, information posted on the CMS Web site, an  alert published by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), and  correspondence between interested parties and HHS officials regarding  concierge care. We also interviewed CMS officials at CMS headquarters and  in the Seattle regional office, officials with HHS OIG, and concierge  physicians and their representatives and, in our survey, asked concierge  physicians for their views on the guidance available from HHS on concierge  care.", "To assess what is known about how concierge care might affect Medicare  beneficiary access to physician services, we reviewed national surveys and  reports on overall Medicare beneficiary access. Because so few physicians  and beneficiaries are affected by concierge care, concierge physicians or  their patients are unlikely to be randomly chosen to participate in surveys  on access to physicians by Medicare beneficiaries. National surveys and  analysis on beneficiary access to physician services are also not sufficiently  detailed to address concierge care, but they can provide information about  physician availability and beneficiary access to care overall.
