The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, enacted in 2007, enables the  department to identify chemical facilities and assess the security risk  posed by each, categorize the facilities into risk-based tiers, and inspect  the high-risk facilities to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements  and reduce the risks associated with chemicals of interest (COI). As of  September 30, 2015, DHS had designated 3,127 facilities in the United  States as high-risk chemical facilities subject to CFATS. We previously  reported on CFATS and identified challenges that DHS was experiencing  in implementing the program. We recommended, among other things,  that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all  elements of risk, conduct a peer review of the program to validate and  verify DHS\u2019s risk assessment approach, verify that certain data reported  by facilities are accurate, and document processes and procedures for  managing compliance with site security plans.

Regarding our recommendation that DHS  develop a documented process and procedures to address and  investigate whistleblower retaliation reports that could include existing  practices, such as OSHA\u2019s recommended practices, DHS stated that due  to the construction of the CFATS-authorizing legislation, developing  formal processes and procedures for investigating whistleblower  retaliation reports will require modifications to the CFATS regulations.  According to DHS, rulemaking typically involves multiple steps over a  considerable length of time and developing a thorough whistleblower  retaliation investigation process and procedures will likely take a number  of years. DHS noted that the OSHA guidance with recommended  practices for addressing whistleblower retaliation complaints is not yet  final, so establishing a formal whistleblower retaliation investigation  process prior to the publication of OSHA\u2019s guidance on the subject may  be premature. However, DHS stated that while awaiting finalized  guidance from OSHA, NPPD\u2019s ISCD will begin moving forward to initiate  the whistleblower retaliation-related rulemaking activities, and develop an  interim process and procedures that will enable the department to  consistently handle any whistleblower retaliation complaints received  during the rulemaking process.

Specifically, we reviewed the  content of the 105 reports that ISCD received on the telephone tip line  and by e-mail to identify the types of issues reported. We also interviewed  ISCD officials, who were responsible for vetting and deciding what to do  with these reports, about any actions taken to address the reports. In  addition, we reviewed documentation from ISCD, such as the electronic  spreadsheet for recording and tracking the reports, and documentation  between the individuals who submitted the reports and ISCD, to evaluate  ISCD\u2019s actions from initial receipt of the reports to determining whether or  not CFATS violations had occurred. We assessed the reliability of the  data for the reports by, for example, reviewing ISCD\u2019s standard operating  procedures for receiving and documenting CFATS reports received on  the telephone tip line and by e-mail, and interviewing knowledgeable  officials to identify internal controls to ensure the completeness and  accuracy of the information in the electronic spreadsheet. We determined  the data to be sufficiently reliable for purposes of determining the number  and types of reports received by ISCD.", "Although we focused on analyzing reports that DHS received since June  16, 2015, for context, we reviewed the CFATS telephone tip line calls that  ISCD received from February 2009, when the telephone tip line started, to  June 15, 2015\u2014the day prior to ISCD\u2019s implementation of the  whistleblower procedure required under the Protecting and Securing  Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 (CFATS Act of  2014). We analyzed the tip line calls to identify the types of issues  reported and any DHS actions to address the calls. Specifically, we  reviewed the transcriptions for 345 telephone tip line calls received and  analyzed the content of the calls to identify those that may have been  related to a potential CFATS violation, and to summarize the types of  issues reported. We identified the key characteristics of the calls and  categorized them as either not related to a CFATS violation or involving a  potential CFATS violation. For those categorized as involving a potential  CFATS violation, we categorized them into two sub-categories\u2014either  they potentially involved CFATS non-compliance, or they involved  suspicious or illegal activity related to a chemical facility. Our analysis  was limited to the content of the transcribed calls. ISCD has limited  documentation on actions taken to address the calls received prior to  June 16, 2015. Therefore, we were unable to review ISCD\u2019s decisions on  these calls, and our analysis does not include actions taken or decisions  made by ISCD. However, our analysis is intended to provide perspective  on the extent to which the calls were CFATS related and some examples  of the types of issues that were reported to DHS prior to the  implementation of the whistleblower process in response to the mandate  in the CFATS Act of 2014. We assessed the reliability of the data for the  calls by, for example, reviewing ISCD\u2019s standard operating procedures for  receiving and documenting CFATS tip line calls and interviewing  knowledgeable officials and reviewing guidance to understand how the  calls are received and transcribed.

We used  this information to evaluate ISCD\u2019s efforts to implement the process and  procedures to address each provision of the CFATS Act of 2014,  including, for example, acknowledging receipt of the report and informing  individuals of their whistleblower rights. We also analyzed information and  interviewed DHS officials about factors that could affect how reports were  addressed, such as the process for addressing reports received from  individuals who did not meet DHS\u2019s definition of a whistleblower, and  reports that did not involve CFATS violations, as well whether there were  any reports of retaliation against whistleblowers and how DHS would  process such reports. In addition, we interviewed the lead official for  ISCD\u2019s telephone tip line and analyzed documents for the tip line at Oak  Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee about the process used to  receive calls, transcribe them, and e-mail them to ISCD headquarters  since February 2009.", "We compared ISCD\u2019s interim process against Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government to identify the extent to which DHS\u2019s  process was in alignment with these standards.

Specifically, any facility that possesses  any of the 322 chemicals of interest (COI) in quantities that meet or  exceed the screening threshold quantities established by DHS for those  COI are required to use ISCD\u2019s Chemical Security Assessment Tool  (CSAT)\u2014a web-based application through which owners and operators of  facilities with COI are to provide information about the facility\u2014to  complete a Top-Screen.

Facilities with toxic  release chemicals are to calculate and report in their Top-Screen  submission the Distance of Concern\u2014which represents the radius  of an area in which exposure to a toxic chemical cloud from a  release event could cause serious injury or fatalities from short- term exposure. ISCD uses the Distance of Concern to estimate  the number of fatalities from an intentional toxic release and to  categorize the risk posed by this facility. The Top-Screen directs  respondents to use an online tool called RMP*Comp to calculate  the Distance of Concern. RMP*Comp takes inputs such as the  quantity of chemical that could be released and the surrounding  terrain type to determine the Distance of Concern.", "Theft or diversion: For theft or diversion, the approach assumes  that a terrorist will steal or have the COI diverted to him or herself  and then estimates the risk of a terrorist attack using the COI to  cause the most harm at an unspecified off-site location.", "Sabotage: For sabotage, the approach assumes that a terrorist  will cause water to be mixed with a COI that is shipped from the  facility, creating a toxic release at an unspecified location, and  then estimates the risk to a medium-sized U.S. city.", "If, according to ISCD\u2019s automated assessment of information provided via  the Top-Screen, the facility is preliminarily categorized to be high-risk it  becomes a \u201ccovered chemical facility,\u201d and ISCD is to notify the facility of  its preliminary placement in one of four risk-based tiers\u2014tier 1, 2, 3, or 4.  If ISCD does not categorize the chemical facility as high-risk, ISCD does  not assign the facility to one of these four risk-based tiers and the facility  is not subject to additional requirements under the CFATS regulation.  Facilities that ISCD preliminarily categorizes to be high-risk\u2014covered  chemical facilities\u2014are required to then complete the CSAT security  vulnerability assessment, which includes the identification of potential  critical assets at the facility, and a related vulnerability analysis. ISCD is  to review the security vulnerability assessment to confirm and notify the  facility as to whether the facility remains categorized as high-risk and, if  so, about its final placement in one of the four tiers.", "Once a covered chemical facility is assigned a final tier, the facility may  use CSAT to submit a site security plan (SSP) or submit an Alternative  Security Program in lieu of the CSAT SSP. The security plan is to  describe the existing and planned security measures to be implemented  to address the vulnerabilities identified in the security vulnerability  assessment, and identify and describe how existing and planned security  measures selected by the facility are to address the applicable risk-based  performance standards. To meet risk-based performance standards,  covered facilities may choose the security programs or processes they  deem appropriate to address the performance standards so long as ISCD  determines that the facilities achieve the requisite level of performance on  each of the applicable areas in their existing and agreed-upon planned  measures.", "To determine whether facilities achieve the requisite level of performance  for each of the applicable areas, ISCD is to conduct a preliminary review  of the facility\u2019s security plan to determine whether it meets the risk-based  regulatory requirements. If these requirements appear to be satisfied,  ISCD is to issue a letter of authorization for the plan, and conduct an  authorization inspection of the facility to determine whether to approve the  plan. Upon inspection of the facility, if ISCD determines that the plan  satisfies the CFATS requirements, it will issue a letter of approval to the  facility, which is to then implement the approved SSP. If ISCD determines  that the plan does not satisfy CFATS requirements, ISCD then notifies the  facility of any deficiencies and the facility must submit a revised plan for  correcting them.", "Following ISCD\u2019s approval of a facility\u2019s SSP, in order to assess  compliance with CFATS requirements as addressed through the  approved SSP, ISCD conducts a compliance inspection (CI) of the  covered facilities. CIs are to follow specific standard operating  procedures that focus on verifying existing measures and the  implementation and effectiveness of planned measures, including dates  implemented, as well as verifying and reviewing any significant changes  in the facility\u2019s security posture. If through a compliance inspection it is  determined a facility has not fully implemented security measures as  outlined in its approved site security plan, ISCD is to provide the facility  with written notification that clearly identifies the deficiencies in the SSP  and will work with the facility toward achieving full compliance or, if  warranted, take enforcement action. For example, the CFATS regulation  provides that an order compelling a facility to take appropriate action may  be issued if the facility was found to be in violation of any part of the  regulation. If a facility were to violate this initial order, an order assessing  a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day or to cease operations, or both,  may be issued. According to ISCD guidance, inspectors conducting a CI  are to document in a CI report any necessary enforcement actions that  may result from the inspection, including, among others, security  measures not implemented in accordance with the SSP. ISCD guidance  further provides that inspectors are not to recommend enforcement  actions where issues identified during a CI are quickly remedied on-site;  however, inspectors are to document their finding in the CI report.  Inspection teams are to submit their CI report to ISCD management for  review and approval within 25 business days from the inspection  completion. ISCD management is to then determine whether a facility is  in compliance with their approved SSP or whether to take enforcement  actions.
