TVA's financing obligations include statutory debt, which it plans to reduce by $6.7 billion, and alternative financing obligations such as energy prepayments, which it plans to reduce by $0.4 billion. Overall, GAO's review found TVA's approach to developing its plan to reduce financing obligations reasonable. TVA performed detailed competitive analyses and modeled different market scenarios to estimate its future competitive environment, then used its internal budget process to project annual cash flows and refine its goal with a cash-based accounting model. Many of the variables used in the models were based on recognized data sources. Augmenting these sources with prices from options markets could provide more accurate estimates in volatile markets. TVA also made fixed assumptions about actions it would take, such as building new power generation, and events, such as the advent of new environmental regulations. While these assumptions are reasonable, they carry uncertainty that is not reflected in the model. Modeling them as variables might better reflect that uncertainty and provide broader information for planning purposes. GAO identified several key factors that could impact TVA's ability to successfully carry out its plan. Factors such as the timing of electricity industry restructuring, potential increases in interest rates, and costs associated with meeting potential new environmental requirements, are key factors that are difficult for TVA to control. TVA has more control over other key factors, such as its decisions on whether or not to construct new power generating facilities before 2015 and to limit operating and maintenance expenses, but these are also affected by outside forces and contain an element of uncertainty. Future rate increases and a fuel-cost adjustment clause are factors that should help cover any unforeseen costs, capital expenditures, or revenue shortfalls. TVA's plan includes the capital expenditures it believes will be needed to expand capacity of existing generating facilities to meet the growing demand for power in its service area through 2015; however, any new or unplanned expenditures prior to 2015 could lessen TVA's ability to achieve the $7.1 billion goal. By 2015, TVA has estimated that it will need more baseload generation to meet growth in demand. TVA officials are considering a number of options to meet this projected increase in demand for power, including partnering with outside parties to build new generation. TVA's current projections assume that it will not invest in any new generation through 2015 other than restarting Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 1; however, any new or unplanned capital expenditures could use cash otherwise intended to be used to reduce financing obligations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Competition in the electricity industry is expected to intensify, and  restructuring legislation may dramatically change the way electric utilities  do business in the future. To remain competitive, the Tennessee Valley  Authority (TVA) needs to have low fixed costs and the flexibility to meet  market prices for power. Recognizing this, in 1997, TVA embarked on a  plan to reduce its debt by one half to about $13.2 billion by 2007. It will not  meet this goal, however, and in fiscal year 2004 it issued a strategic plan  that included a target to reduce debt by $3 to $5 billion from 2004 through  2015. TVA continues to carry a relatively high level of debt, currently about  $23.1 billion, and acknowledges that reducing debt is critical to improving  its financial condition and competitive prospects.", "Because of concerns that TVA might not meet the targets in its debt  reduction plan and that this could negatively impact its future  competitiveness, you asked us to (1) describe how TVA plans to meet the  debt reduction goal identified in its 2004 strategic plan, (2) assess the  reasonableness of TVA\u2019s approach in developing its debt reduction plan,  (3) identify key factors that could impact TVA\u2019s ability to successfully  carry out its debt reduction plan, and (4) identify how TVA\u2019s plans for  meeting the growing demand for power in the Tennessee Valley may  impact its ability to meet its debt reduction goal.", "In performing our work, we interviewed officials from TVA, TVA\u2019s  inspector general\u2019s office, the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association,  the Congressional Budget Office, and the Knoxville Utilities Board. We  also reviewed TVA\u2019s 2004 strategic plan, budget submissions, annual  reports, and documents and analyses supporting the debt reduction plan.  To determine the types of revenue and costs TVA had reported, we  reviewed TVA\u2019s audited financial statements. In addition, we reviewed  prior GAO reports. We conducted our work from June 2005 through  August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["TVA is an independent, wholly owned federal corporation established by  the TVA Act of 1933 (TVA Act), as amended. The act established TVA to  improve the quality of life in the Tennessee River Valley by improving  navigation, promoting regional agricultural and economic development,  and controlling the floodwaters of the Tennessee River. To those ends,  TVA built dams and hydropower facilities on the Tennessee River and its  tributaries. To meet the subsequent need for more electric power, TVA  expanded beyond hydropower to other types of power generation such as  natural gas, coal, and nuclear plants. As of September 30, 2005, TVA sold  electricity at wholesale rates to 158 retail distributors that resell electricity  to consumers, and sold electricity directly to 61 large retail customers. As  illustrated in figure 1, TVA\u2019s service territory includes most of Tennessee  and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and  Virginia. The area covers 80,000 square miles with a population of more  than 8.6 million.", "From its inception in 1933 through fiscal year 1959, TVA received  appropriations to finance its internal cash and capital requirements. In  1959, however, the Congress amended the TVA Act to provide TVA the  means to self-finance its power program and required it to repay a  substantial portion of appropriations it had received to pay for its capital  projects. At the same time, the Congress required that TVA\u2019s power  programs be self-financing through revenues from electricity sales. For its  capital needs in excess of funds generated from operations, TVA was  authorized to borrow by issuing bonds and notes. TVA\u2019s authority to issue  bonds and notes is set by the Congress and cannot exceed $30 billion  outstanding at any given time.", "Until recently, TVA had been administered by a three-member board of  directors appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed  by the U.S. Senate. An Executive Committee worked with the board to  determine TVA\u2019s strategic mission and future direction, provide  management oversight, and ensure policies of the board were carried out.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, which was signed into law in  December 2004, changed the structure of TVA\u2019s management. The act  contained provisions that restructured the board from three full-time  members to nine part-time members, established the position of Chief  Executive Officer (CEO) to be appointed by the board, required TVA to  begin filing financial reports with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), and required TVA\u2019s new board to create an Audit  Committee to be composed solely of board members independent of  management. The audit committee will be responsible for reviewing  inspector general and external audit reports and making recommendations  to the board. The legislation specifies that seven of the nine board  members must be legal residents of TVA\u2019s service area and that the  members will be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  After a transition period, members will serve 5-year rather than the current  9-year terms. In general, the board will establish TVA\u2019s strategic direction  and policies while the CEO will oversee their implementation as well as  TVA\u2019s overall operations. The new board became effective on March 31,  2006, when six new board members took the oath of office and joined two  existing members to hold the first board meeting under the new  governance structure.", "Along with annual reporting to the SEC, in fiscal year 2006 TVA will also  be required to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002, including the requirement that its officers certify annual and  quarterly financial reports and report on the effectiveness of internal  controls over financial reporting. TVA\u2019s external auditor, in addition to  auditing and issuing an opinion on TVA\u2019s financial statements, will be  required to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of TVA\u2019s internal controls  over financial reporting. Based on the current guidance from the SEC, TVA  will file the first report on internal controls with its September 30, 2007,  financial statements.", "Under the TVA Act, as amended, TVA has not been subject to most of the  regulatory oversight requirements that commercial utilities must satisfy.  Legislation has also limited competition between TVA and other utilities.  When the TVA Act was amended in 1959, it prohibited TVA, with some  exceptions, from entering into contracts to sell power outside the service  area that it and its distributors were serving on July 1, 1957. This is  commonly referred to as the \u201cfence\u201d because it limits TVA\u2019s ability to  expand outside its July 1, 1957, service area. In addition, the Energy Policy  Act of 1992 (EPAct) exempted TVA from being required to allow other  utilities to use its transmission lines to send power to customers within its  service area, effectively reducing the opportunities for TVA\u2019s wholesale  customers to choose other suppliers. This exemption is often referred to  as the \u201canti-cherrypicking\u201d provision. TVA is still subject to some forms of  indirect competition common to all utilities. For example, the cost of  power would affect decisions by TVA\u2019s customers to move or expand  outside TVA\u2019s service area or by businesses to move into its service area.  In addition, customers can decide to generate their own power for on-site  use. However, as long as the legislative framework continues to insulate  TVA from direct competition for its wholesale customers, it will remain in  a position similar to that of a regulated utility monopoly.", "For more than 20 years, the federal government has been taking a variety  of steps to restructure the electricity industry with the goal of increasing  competition in wholesale markets and thereby increasing benefits to  consumers, including lower electricity prices and a wider variety of retail  services. Electricity restructuring is evolving against a backdrop of  constraints and challenges, including shared responsibility for  implementing and enforcing local, state, and federal laws affecting the  electricity industry and an expected substantial increase in electricity  demand by 2025, which will require significant investment in new power  plants and transmission lines.", "Prior to this restructuring, electricity was generally provided by electric  utilities that exclusively served all customers within a specific geographic  region. Under these conditions, the federal government, through the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and its predecessors,  regulated wholesale electricity sales (sales for resale) and interstate  transmission by electric utilities and set prices at cost-based rates.  Because the utilities were monopolies, states regulated retail markets,  approving utility company investments and rates paid by customers. In  1978, the federal government laid the groundwork for restructuring and  competition in the electricity industry with the Public Utility Regulatory  Policies Act, which opened wholesale power markets to electricity  producers that were not regulated utility monopolies. In the 1990s the  federal government greatly expanded these efforts. First the EPAct  provided for broader participation in wholesale electricity markets by  nonutilities and allowed these entities to produce and sell electricity at  market prices. Second, in 1996 the FERC issued Orders 888 and 889, which  greatly expanded opportunities for competition by requiring utilities to  provide access to their transmission lines to all users under the same  prices, terms, and conditions. This change allowed the new nonutilities to  compete with utilities and others for the opportunity to sell electricity in  wholesale markets on more equal terms. By 2002 a number of states had  made efforts to introduce competition to the retail markets that they  oversee, allowing nonutilities to compete with utilities and others for the  opportunity to sell electricity directly to consumers.", "Beginning in 2000, some restructured wholesale and retail electricity  markets encountered a number of problems. From the summer of 2000  through early 2001, California saw a sharp increase in wholesale electricity  prices, electricity shortages leading to rolling blackouts, and the  deteriorating financial stability of its three major investor-owned utilities.  These problems, along with the largest blackout in U.S. history along the  East Coast in 2003, drew attention to the need to examine the operation  and direction of the industry. Efforts to expand restructuring slowed down  as many states analyzed the factors that contributed to these problems,  among them failure to meet increasing demand for electricity with new  generation and transmission capacity.", "TVA management and many industry experts, however, expect that TVA  will eventually be drawn into the restructuring of the electric utility  industry and will eventually lose its legislative protections from  competition. There have already been some indications of such changes.  For instance, S.1499, introduced in July 2005, would remove any area  within Kentucky from coverage by the \u201canti-cherrypicking\u201d provision in  the EPAct. If the bill becomes law, TVA would be required to transmit  power from another supplier over its transmission lines for use inside the  Kentucky portion of its service area without being able to similarly expand  its service area. The bill was referred to the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, where it remained as of August 15, 2006.", "Our prior reports have indicated that TVA\u2019s high debt and related interest  expense could place it at a disadvantage in continuing to offer  competitively priced power if it were to lose its legislative protections  from competition. TVA\u2019s management has also recognized the need to  reduce its debt and other financing obligations to increase its flexibility to  meet competitive challenges. In July 1997, TVA issued a 10-year business  plan with steps necessary to improve its financial position for an era of  increasing competition. Two key strategic objectives of the plan were   (1) to reduce the cost of power by reducing debt and the corresponding  financing costs, and (2) increase financial flexibility by reducing fixed  costs. To help meet these objectives, the plan called for TVA to reduce its  debt by half over a 10-year period to about $13.2 billion by increasing its  electricity rates beginning in 1998, reducing certain expenses, and limiting  capital expenditures.", "TVA did not meet the 1997 debt reduction goal because it used cash  intended for debt reduction to cover greater than estimated annual  operating costs and capital expenditures. In fiscal year 2000, TVA began  entering into alternative financing in the form of lease-leaseback  arrangements to obtain a lower cost of capital than it could by selling  bonds. TVA entered into these arrangements in fiscal years 2000, 2002, and  2003 to refinance 24 existing power generators that were designed for use  during periods of peak power demand. TVA financed and built the  generating units and leased them to investors in exchange for cash. It then  leased the generators back and is making payments to investors. TVA also  implemented other alternative financing arrangements that allowed its  customers to prepay for power in exchange for discounted rates. For  example, in November 2003, TVA entered into an energy prepayment  agreement with its largest customer, Memphis Light, Gas, and Water  Division (MLGW). Under this agreement, MLGW prepaid TVA $1.5 billion  for electricity to be delivered over a 15-year period. TVA also offered a  discounted energy units program in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, under  which TVA customers could purchase power, usually in $1 million  increments, in return for a discount on a specified quantity of power over  a certain period of years. TVA did not offer the DEU program in 2005.  During our review, TVA\u2019s management told us they have no current plans  to enter into additional alternative financing arrangements.", "Generally accepted accounting principles require that lease-leaseback and  other alternative financing arrangements be classified as liabilities. In 2003  we reported that the lease-leaseback arrangements, while not considered  debt for purposes of financial reporting, had the same effect on TVA\u2019s  financial condition as traditional debt financing. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) treats the cash proceeds TVA receives  from private parties at the inception of lease-leaseback arrangements as  borrowing. Accordingly, in the President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2004,  OMB began classifying TVA\u2019s lease-leaseback arrangements as debt. Table  1 shows that although TVA reduced its outstanding statutory debt by about  $4.3 billion from fiscal years 1997 through 2005, its use of alternative  financing arrangements rose, adding nearly $2.5 billion to its total  financing obligations as of September 30, 2005, resulting in a net reduction  of about $1.8 billion.", "In fiscal year 2004, burdened with total financing obligations of almost $26  billion, TVA\u2019s board adopted a new strategic plan for reducing debt that  called for increasing revenue, controlling costs, and reducing the growth  of capital expenditures. However, TVA also began measuring its debt  reduction more realistically and transparently in terms of TFOs, which, as  shown in table 1, are comprised of its statutory debt as well as its  liabilities under alternative financing arrangements.", "Since issuing its strategic plan in 2004, TVA has raised its power rates  twice\u2014a 7.52 percent increase in firm wholesale electric rates effective  October 1, 2005, and a 9.95 percent increase effective April 1, 2006. On July  28, 2006, TVA\u2019s board approved a 4.5 percent decrease in firm wholesale  power rates in conjunction with a fuel-cost adjustment clause. Utilities  surrounding the Tennessee Valley also increased rates in 2005, and 12 of  the 14 surrounding utilities have fuel-cost adjustment clauses that allow  them to pass increases in the price of fuel to customers automatically. TVA  is working with distributors and the Tennessee Valley Public Power  Association (TVPPA) to develop future wholesale pricing options and  new long-term contract options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine how TVA plans to meet the debt reduction goal identified in  its 2004 strategic plan, we: (1) interviewed TVA officials, (2) reviewed  documentation and analyses supporting TVA\u2019s debt reduction plan  including its 2004 strategic plan and budget submissions for fiscal years  2006 and 2007, and (3) reviewed TVA\u2019s fiscal years 2004 and 2005 annual  reports, information statements, and audited financial statements.", "To assess the reasonableness of TVA\u2019s approach in developing its debt  reduction plan, we interviewed TVA officials responsible for developing  the 2004 Strategic Plan and performing analyses with the Competitive Risk  Model and the Enterprise Risk Model.

Subsequently, TVA expanded the scope of its debt  reduction efforts to include debt-like transactions such as lease-leasebacks  and energy prepayment arrangements, referred to in this report as  alternative financing. TVA calls this larger group of obligations total  financing obligations, or TFOs. In its 2007 budget, TVA increased its TFO  reduction goal to $7.1 billion. This includes reducing statutory debt by  $6.7 billion and alternative financing obligations by $0.4 billion. TVA plans  to meet this goal by increasing revenue, controlling the growth of its  operating expenses, and limiting capital expenditures. TVA projects it will  gain additional revenue through its October 2005 rate increase, a fuel-cost  adjustment clause to adjust rates up or down automatically when fuel  prices change, and increased sales from growth in the demand for  electricity.

About $9.6 billion of this  additional revenue will come primarily from increased sales from growth  in demand. TVA also projects that about $5.7 billion will come from the  October 1, 2005, rate increase. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, TVA  expects about $1.4 billion to come from the fuel-cost adjustment (FCA)  clause that will be added to customer contracts in fiscal year 2007. The  FCA will automatically increase or decrease rates to cover changes in the  cost of fuel and purchased power. TVA plans to use the budgeted fuel and  purchased power estimates for fiscal year 2006 as the baseline for fuel and  purchased power prices it pays. In subsequent years, it will compare those  prices to the baseline and automatically adjust rates upward or downward  for changes in these expenses.

The model  calculated the potential impact of each market scenario on TVA assuming  that distributors could choose other suppliers and modeled the potential  for loss of load using three pricing scenarios:    holding prices flat at current levels,    setting prices equal to TVA\u2019s projected costs, and    setting prices equal to the projected average competitor price.", "The results were then used to produce probabilities of different potential  financial outcomes to identify types of market conditions under which  load loss was likely to occur.", "TVA included the following assumptions in the CRM:  it would begin facing competitive pressures in 2008;  its contracts would include provisions for distributors to satisfy some  of their power needs from sources other than TVA, referred to as  partial requirements; and  it could sell power elsewhere.", "TVA conducted its competitive risk analysis in 2003. In a little less than  one-third of the scenarios, the CRM showed that TVA could lose load if  other utilities had both cheap natural gas and high reserve margins, or  unused available capacity. Because natural gas prices have risen and  movement toward electricity competition has slowed, TVA has not  considered it necessary to run the model again.", "TVA used the results of its competitive risk analysis as well as professional  judgment in developing its 2004 strategic plan and the initial range of $3  billion to $5 billion for its statutory debt reduction goal. The plan looks at  the larger picture of what TVA needs to do to succeed in a more  competitive environment. It concluded that TVA needs to concentrate on  four areas over the next few years. These are:    developing new, more differentiated pricing structures, services, and  contract terms that more closely tie the cost and risk of TVA\u2019s products  to their terms and pricing;    addressing issues related to wholesale market design and transmission  pricing, including how it will interface with surrounding markets to  ensure reliable power and how it will charge for transmitting power  inside its service area when distributors can choose other suppliers;    accelerating debt reduction to increase financial flexibility; and    maintaining and operating company assets to continue to meet  electricity supply obligations safely and reliably."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TVA Uses an Accounting Model to Refine Its TFO Reduction Targets by Determining Likely Cash Flow", "paragraphs": ["TVA uses the Enterprise Risk Model (ERM) as part of its annual internal  budgeting process to refine its TFO reduction targets by determining likely  cash flow in given situations. The ERM is a simplified cash-based  accounting model that can project key financial data by modeling TVA\u2019s  system based on a power supply plan and a long-range financial plan. The  ERM uses Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probable range of  uncertain inputs, or variables, such as interest rates or coal prices,  redispatch the TVA system, and recalculate cash flows multiple times  while showing a range of probable values for each variable.", "The ERM\u2019s Monte Carlo simulations use 13 variables that include key costs  and key determinants of revenue:    electricity market peak ($/MWh)    electricity market off-peak ($/MWh)    natural gas prices ($/mmBtu)    coal prices ($/mmBtu)  long-term interest rates (%)    short-term interest rates (%)  total operating and maintenance expenses    capital expenditures    selling, general and administrative expenses    benefits expense    coal plant availability    nuclear plant availability    hydro generation For example, a simulation might use key costs such as prices for coal and  natural gas, and combine this information with key determinants of  revenue, such as peak and off-peak electricity prices, and quantities sold at  those prices. The output of the model is an estimate of the annual net cash  flow for TVA. For each scenario estimated, the model shows net cash  flows and financing obligations repayment over each of the next 20 years  for the values assumed in that scenario. Assuming that this net cash flow is  applied to reducing financing obligations, the model provides an estimate  of the level of obligations at the end of the simulation, which can then be  used to refine projections used in coming up with its goals.", "The model uses a variety of reliable sources for estimates of the key input  variables. For instance, the variability of rainfall for hydropower is  calculated using historical data. Interest rates are based on forecasts from  Global Insight and the Wall Street Journal. The volatility of commodity  prices for coal or natural gas is estimated with a combination of historical  data and projected trends. Other sources may also provide reasonable  estimates for key variables in the model, however. For example, some of  the commodities used in the model, such as natural gas, have active  options markets, which could help identify more accurate estimates of the  range of possible future prices in volatile markets. For example, when  Hurricane Katrina destroyed a large number of natural gas rigs in the Gulf  of Mexico, there was an enormous increase in implied volatility for natural  gas prices. This was because no one knew how long it would take to repair  the rigs or what the market consequences would be of a sudden  withdrawal of a large percentage of the natural gas supply. In such a case,  the options market may provide a more accurate estimate of price  volatility than historical activity and might result in a more comprehensive  characterization of the distribution of possible TFO reduction levels.", "In designing the ERM and using its output to devise its current goal for  reducing financing obligations, TVA made the following key business  assumptions:    Brown\u2019s Ferry Nuclear Unit 1 will be completed on time,    TVA will not self-fund any new baseload generation,    distributors who have given notice they will not be renewing contracts    TVA will meet or exceed current environmental regulations,    TVA\u2019s credit rating remains AAA, and    distributors do not gain rights to partial requirements or transmission.", "TVA has generally made reasonable assumptions concerning the level and  variability of the key inputs to its Monte Carlo model. As with any  modeling effort, there are some inherent limitations, and areas in which  the modeling may be improved. TVA\u2019s key business assumptions, while  reasonable, limit the range of outcomes from the model by making certain  events appear more fixed or settled than they are. Allowing the range of  possible outcomes attached to some of the fixed assumptions to be  modeled as variables may better reflect the uncertainty attached to TVA\u2019s  TFO reduction estimates. For example, TVA could determine a range of  likely dates for the completion of Brown\u2019s Ferry Nuclear Unit 1, and use  these dates as part of the Monte Carlo simulation. Another example might  be to use the range of possible costs from potential environmental  legislation as inputs to the model.

Building new capacity  itself provides two potential key benefits for TVA. First, TVA would likely  be able to generate power at a lower cost than purchasing a like amount of  power from other utilities, thereby reducing its cost of power. Second, a  decision to build new generating capacity would give TVA control over its  source of power and remove the uncertainty of having to rely on other  utilities for power. It would reduce the chances that TVA would need to  purchase power from the market when there may be limited excess  capacity and high prices, but increases the risk that its generating costs  could be higher than market prices.
