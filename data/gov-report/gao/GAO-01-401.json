GAO concludes that Task Force Hawk's deep attacks against Serbian forces in Kosovo was consistent with doctrine, but was not typical in that the task force was supporting an air campaign rather than its more traditional role of being used in conjunction with Army ground forces to engage massed formations of enemy armor. The Army identified 107 items that require remedial action. As of January 2001, 47 of the 107 items had been recommended for closure. Action is in process for the remaining 60 lessons. Finally, the Army and the Air Force experienced significant problems in their ability to work together jointly and the interoperability of the command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence equipment used during the operation. The Army is working on both issues aggressively.

We will report separately on other matters  involving Operation Allied Force."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Task Force Hawk deployed to Albania in April 1999 as part of Operation  Allied Force. Originally, the task force was to deploy to the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, the government of Macedonia  would not allow combat operations to be conducted from its territory. The  United States subsequently obtained approval from the government of  Albania to use its territory to base Task Force Hawk and conduct combat  operations. (See fig. 1.) Albania did not have any previously established  U.S. military base camps as Macedonia did and was not viewed as having a  stable security environment. According to Army officials, the size of the  Task Force had to be increased to provide more engineering capability to  build operating facilities and provide force protection.", "The task force was a unique Army organization. It was comprised of 1  attack helicopter battalion with 24 Apache attack helicopters; 1 Corps  aviation brigade with 31 support helicopters; 1 Multiple Launch Rocket  System battalion with 27 launchers; a ground maneuver element for force  protection; and other headquarters and support forces. (See fig. 2 for a  picture of an Apache helicopter.) It ultimately totaled about 5,100  personnel. Its planned mission was to conduct deep attacks against Serbian  military and militia forces operating in Kosovo using Apache helicopters  and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems. The task force deployed to Albania  and trained for the mission but was not ordered into combat. Ultimately, its  focus changed to using its radar systems to locate enemy forces for  targeting by other aircraft. Additionally, the task force assumed  responsibility for the protection of all U.S. forces operating out of Tirana  Airfield, its staging base, which included Air Force personnel providing  humanitarian assistance to Kosovo refugees.", "Concerned about the combat readiness of Apache helicopters and their  experience in Task Force Hawk, the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s  Subcommittee on Readiness held a hearing on July 1, 1999. That hearing  focused on pilot shortages, the lack of pilot proficiency, and unit combat  training. In addition, it discussed equipment that was not fully fielded at the  time of the operation, such as aircraft survivability equipment and  communication equipment. Our work was designed to address other  matters associated with Task Force Hawk and how the services plan to  address them for future operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Task Force Hawk Not a Typical Army Operation", "paragraphs": ["Doctrine is the fundamental principle by which the military services guide  their actions in support of national objectives. It provides guidance for  planning and conducting military operations. In the Army, doctrine is  communicated in a variety of ways, including manuals, handbooks, and  training. Joint doctrine, which applies to the coordinated use of two or  more of the military services, is similarly communicated. Doctrine provides  commanders with a framework for conducting operations while allowing  flexibility to adapt operations to specific circumstances.", "According to Army and Joint Staff doctrine officials, the concept of  operation that was planned to be used by Task Force Hawk, the use of  Apache helicopters for a deep attack mission as part of an air campaign,  fell within established Army and joint doctrine. Typically, attack helicopters  are used in conjunction with Army ground forces to engage massed  formations of enemy armor. They were used in this manner in the Gulf  War. In the Kosovo air campaign, Task Force Hawk\u2019s planned deep attacks  differed in that they were intended to be part of an air campaign, not an  Army led combined arms land campaign. Additionally, the aircraft\u2019s  planned attacks principally would have engaged widely dispersed and  camouflaged enemy ground forces instead of massed formations.  According to Army doctrine officials, doctrine is broad and flexible enough  to allow a combatant commander to employ his assets in the manner that  was planned for the task force. However, Army officials agree that this  planned usage differed from the employment typically envisaged in Army  doctrine. Furthermore, Army officials said that the Task Force Hawk  experience was not something the Army routinely trained for and was  considered to be an atypical operation.", "Although Task Force Hawk\u2019s mission and operations were consistent with  both Army and joint doctrine in the broadest sense, changes to doctrine at  both the Army and joint levels are being made that will address some of the  operation\u2019s lessons learned. A total of 19 Army doctrine publications will be  developed or modified to better address the experience gained from Task  Force Hawk. Examples of new or revised doctrine include a new handbook  on deep operations; an update to the Army\u2019s keystone warfighting doctrinal  publication on conducting campaigns, major operations, battles,  engagements, and operations other than war; and an update to the Army  aviation brigade field manual that expands the role of aviation brigades and  task forces with a heavier emphasis on tactics, techniques, and procedures  for task force, combined arms, and joint operations. Modifications to Army  doctrine are being made as part of the on-going established process for  reviewing and revising doctrinal publications.", "A total of five joint doctrine publications will be developed or modified  based at least in part on the Task Force Hawk experience. A new joint  publication is being developed to cover the role of the Joint Force Land  Component Commander, detailing his role and responsibilities in a  \u201csupported\u201d and \u201csupporting\u201d role. (See our discussion of this role in the  Joint Operations section of this report.) Updates to four remaining joint  publications, including close air support and fire support, will be made  during the normal 21-month joint doctrine publication and review cycle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Working to Implement Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["The Army has a large effort underway to collect and resolve lessons  learned pertaining to Task Force Hawk. A total of 146 Task Force Hawk  lessons learned were collected at three different sources. The U.S. Army  Europe developed 64 lessons and forwarded them to the Army\u2019s Deputy  Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans for remedial action. The Army\u2019s  Training and Doctrine Command developed a listing of 76 lessons and has  assigned them to their different proponent schools for remedial action.  Hundreds of joint action items were collected at the European Command  on Operation Allied Force and forwarded to the Joint Warfighting Center.  Of these items, six were specifically associated with Task Force Hawk and  were sent to the Joint Staff for remedial action.", "We analyzed the 146 Task Force Hawk lessons and determined that a  number of them submitted by different organizations were the same. Of the  76 lessons raised by the Training and Doctrine Command, 38 were similar  to those submitted by U.S. Army Europe. Of the six European Command  lessons, we determined that one was similar to an issue submitted by U.S.  Army Europe. Deleting the 39 duplicates resulted in a total of 107 unique  lessons submitted for remedial action.", "We categorized the 107 lessons into five broad themes that in our judgment  characterize the type of needed remedial action. The five themes are as  follows.", "The need for revisions to Army and joint doctrine, as discussed earlier.", "We identified 19 such lessons. See appendix I.", "Improvements in command, control, communications, computers, and  intelligence (C4I) equipment or procedures. We identified 20 such  lessons. See appendix II.", "Areas needing additional training. We identified 30 such lessons. See  appendix III.", "The need for additional capability in areas other than C4I. We identified  24 such lessons. See appendix IV.", "Potential force structure changes. We identified 14 such lessons. See  appendix V.", "We determined the status of each of the 107 lessons learned as of January  2001. We did not evaluate the merit of the actions proposed or completed.  We placed them into one of two status categories:  Recommended for closure: We placed 47 items in this category.", "However, there are varying degrees of closure within this category. First,  there are items that specifically have had actions completed, such as  procuring night vision goggles for Apache pilots. According to Army  officials, the goggles have been procured and fielded. Twenty-three of  the 47 lessons fell into this subgroup. Second, there are lessons that  have had actions taken, but will require a long lead-time for  implementation, such as the procurement of survival radios and a  deployable flight mission rehearsal system for aviation units. For  example, while approval for the survival radios has been obtained, they  will not begin fielding until fiscal year 2003. In addition, the Army has  recommended an interim fix for a mission rehearsal system, but it is  costly. The far-term solution is the joint mission planning system, which  will not be fielded until 2007. Fifteen of the 47 lessons fell into this  subgroup. Finally, there are items that Army officials are recommending  for closure because, upon further review, they determined the lessons  should not have been submitted or events have overtaken the initial  lesson and they are no longer applicable. The remaining nine lessons fell  into this subgroup. Lessons learned that were recommended for closure  are indicated as such in appendixes I-V.", "In progress: We placed 60 lessons in this category. These items are still  considered open issues by the Army officials tracking Task Force Hawk  lessons learned and they have been assigned to responsible bodies for  resolution. Seventeen of the 60 in progress lessons reside with the  Department of the Army\u2014Headquarters, 10 with the Joint Staff or Joint  Forces Command, 27 with the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command,  and 6 with U.S. Army Europe. Many issues remain open because they  require efforts that are being incorporated into much larger overall  Army projects, such as transformation or Flight School XXI, that will  require a much longer time frame to implement. Other lessons learned  remain open because efforts to address them are just beginning. Lessons  learned where solutions are in progress are indicated as such in  appendixes I-V.", "Figure 3 shows the 107 lessons learned issues by category and by status  grouping.", "The Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe has emphasized the need to  capitalize on the lessons learned from Kosovo and to focus on partnership  with the Air Force. He is personally involved with the lessons learned  process and considers the process and follow-up a personal commitment to  U.S. Army Europe soldiers. During our visit to U.S. Air Forces in Europe,  we were told that their commanding general has also placed a high priority  on working together with the Army to address the lessons learned in  conducting joint operations. While both commands have taken steps to  resolve the issues, some of the remedial actions will require years to  complete. In addition, over time the services assign new commanders and  reassign the current commanders. We reported in 1999 that while the Army  had established a program to validate that remedial action on past lessons  learned were implemented, the program has not been very successful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned Highlight Problems With Joint Operations and Equipment Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["Two key themes emerged from the lessons learned collected. One was the  need for the Army and the Air Force to work together better jointly. The  other theme was the interoperability of the two services\u2019 command,  control, communications, computers, and intelligence equipment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improvements Are Being Made in the Ability to Conduct Joint Operations", "paragraphs": ["The Task Force Hawk experience highlighted difficulties in several areas  pertaining to how the Army operates in a joint environment. One area was  determining the most appropriate structure for integrating Army elements  into a joint task force. Doctrine typically calls for a Joint Force Land  Component Commander or an Army Force Commander to be a part of a  joint task force with responsibility for overseeing ground elements during  an operation. The command structure for the U.S. component of Operation  Allied Force did not have a Joint Force Land Component Commander. Both  Army officials and the Joint Task Force Commander in retrospect believe  that this may have initially made it more difficult to integrate the Army into  the existing joint task force structure. The lack of an Army Force  Commander and his associated staff created difficulties in campaign  planning because the traditional links with other joint task force elements  were initially missing. These links would normally function as a liaison  between service elements and coordinate planning efforts. Over time, an ad  hoc structure had to be developed and links established. The Army has  conducted a study to develop a higher headquarters design that would  enable it to provide for a senior Army commander in a future Joint Task  Force involving a relatively small Army force. This senior commander  would be responsible for providing command, control, communications,  computers, and intelligence capability to the joint task force. The study  itself is complete, but testing of the design in an exercise is not scheduled  until February 2002.", "A second area that the Army had difficulty with during its mission training  was including its aircraft in the overall planning document that controls air  attack assets. The plan, called an air tasking order, assigns daily targets or  missions to subordinate units or forces. Air Force officials in Europe told  us that they had difficulty integrating the Army\u2019s attack helicopters into the  air tasking order. According to U.S. Army Europe officials, there were no  formalized procedures for how to include Army aviation into this planning  document and they had little or no training on how to perform this  function. The Army and the Air Force in Europe are developing joint  tactics, techniques, and procedures for integrating Army assets into the air  tasking order and are beginning to include this process in their joint  exercises.", "A third area that the Army and the Air Force had difficulty with was  targeting. As previously discussed, once the decision was made that Task  Force Hawk would not conduct deep attacks, its resources were used to  locate targets for the Air Force. According to U.S. Army Europe  documentation, Army analysts in Europe had little or no training in joint  targeting and analyzing targets in a limited air campaign. As a result, in the  early days of the Army targeting role, mobile targets nominated by the  Army did not meet Operation Allied Force criteria being used by the Air  Force for verifying that targets were legitimate and, therefore, were not  attacked. As the operation progressed, the two services learned each  other\u2019s procedures and criteria and worked together better. The Army and  the Air Force in Europe are now formalizing the process used and are  developing tactics, techniques, and procedures for attacking such targets  and sharing intelligence. They are including these new processes in their  joint exercises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements Are Needed in Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["The second major theme that emerged from the lessons learned was the  interoperability of the command, control, communications, computers, and  intelligence equipment. The Army is transitioning from a variety of  battlefield command systems that it has used for years to a digitized suite  of systems called the Army Battlefield Command system. During Operation  Allied Force, Army elements used a variety of older and newer battlefield  command systems that were not always interoperable with each other. The  mission planning and targeting system used by the Apache unit in Albania  during Task Force Hawk was one of the older systems and was not  compatible with the system being used by the Army team that provided  liaison with the Air Force at the air operations center. The Army liaison  team used the new suite of Army digitized systems that will ultimately be  provided to all Army combat forces. However, at the time of Task Force  Hawk, the suite of systems was not fully fielded and not all the deployed  personnel were trained on the new systems. Consequently, the Apache unit  in Albania used the older systems, making it difficult to communicate with  the liaison team and requiring the manual as opposed to electronic transfer  of data.", "The older mission planning and targeting system used by the Apache unit in  Albania was also not compatible with the Air Force system. The Air Force  has a single digital battlefield command system. The Apache unit in  Albania, using its older equipment, could not readily share data directly  with the Air Force. In addition, the intelligence system being used by the  Army at the unit level and at the liaison level could not directly exchange  information with the Air Force. As was the case within the Army, personnel  had to manually transfer data. This was time consuming and introduced the  potential for transcription errors.", "The Army is continuing to field the new suite of systems. We have  previously reported that the schedules for fielding these systems have  slipped and the Army in Europe is not scheduled to receive the complete  suite of new systems before 2005. When it is eventually fielded, this new  suite of systems is expected to reduce if not eliminate the inability of the  Army\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s systems to work together."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The commanding generals of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Forces in Europe  have made resolving the lessons learned identified from Task Force Hawk a  high priority.
