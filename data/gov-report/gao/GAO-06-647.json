Agencies identified most projects as high risk because their delay or failure would impact the essential business functions of the agency. In addition, agencies reported that about 35 percent of the high risk projects--or 79 investments--had a performance shortfall, meaning the project did not meet one or more of these four criteria: establishing clear baselines, maintaining cost and schedule variances within 10 percent, assigning a qualified project manager, and avoiding duplication with other investments. Although agencies, with OMB's assistance, generally evaluated their IT portfolio against the criteria specified by OMB to identify their high risk projects, the criteria were not always consistently applied. Accordingly, GAO identified several projects that appeared to meet OMB's definition for high risk but were not determined by agencies to be high risk. In addition, OMB does not define a process for updating high risk projects. As a result, agencies had inconsistent updating procedures. Regarding oversight of these projects, agencies either established special procedures or used their existing investment management processes. OMB staff stated that they review the projects' performance and corrective actions planned. However, OMB has not compiled the projects into a single aggregate list, which would serve as a tool to analyze and track the projects on a governmentwide basis. High risk projects and Management Watch List projects are identified using different criteria. The former is meant to track the management and performance of projects, while the latter focuses on an agency's project planning. Both sets of projects require attention because of their importance in supporting critical functions and the likelihood that their performance problems could potentially result in billions of taxpayers' dollars being wasted if the problems are not detected early."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government increasingly relies on information technology (IT)  systems to provide essential services affecting the health, economy, and  defense of the nation.

The  memorandum also required agencies to begin, in September 2005, to  provide quarterly reports to OMB on identified high risk projects that had  performance shortfalls, meaning that they did not meet one or more of  four performance evaluation criteria. The performance criteria are (1)  establishing baselines with clear cost, schedule, and performance goals;  (2) maintaining the project\u2019s cost and schedule variances within 10  percent; (3) assigning a qualified project manager; or (4) avoiding  duplication by leveraging interagency and governmentwide investments.", "To gain insight into the processes for identifying and overseeing these high  risk projects, our objectives were to (1) provide a summary of high risk  projects that identifies by agency the number of high risk projects, their  proposed budget for fiscal year 2007, agency reasons for the high risk  designation, and reported performance shortfalls; (2) determine how high  risk projects were identified and updated and what processes and  procedures have been established to effectively oversee them; and (3)  determine the relationship between the high risk list and OMB\u2019s  Management Watch List. To address these objectives, we reviewed  quarterly performance reports on high risk projects from each of the 24  chief financial officer (CFO) departments and agencies.

This may result in OMB\u2019s asking the agency to  submit a remediation plan to address the weaknesses identified in the  agency\u2019s business case.", "While the criteria for identifying the Management Watch List projects and  high risk projects differ, Management Watch List projects can also be high  risk. For example, of the 226 total number of high risk projects, agencies  identified 37 of these projects as being on OMB\u2019s Management Watch  List, with 19 of these projects having performance shortfalls. According  to OMB staff, identifying and addressing poorly planned projects as part of  the Management Watch List process could result in fewer projects with  performance shortfalls over time. Nevertheless, both types of projects  require close attention because of their importance in supporting critical  functions and the likelihood that performance problems associated with  them could potentially result in billions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars being wasted  if they are not detected early."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OMB and agencies\u2019 efforts to identify 226 high risk projects are important  steps in helping focus management attention on critically important IT  projects. Although many projects were appropriately identified as high  risk initiatives consistent with OMB\u2019s guidance, OMB\u2019s criteria were not  always consistently applied. As a result, projects that appear to be high  risk were not always identified as such. Further, because OMB has not  provided guidance on how the initial set of high risk projects list should be  updated, agencies do not have a consistent process for doing so.", "Agencies and OMB have both taken actions to ensure oversight of the high  risk projects. Specifically, agencies are using existing oversight  procedures or ones they have specifically established for the high risk  projects and OMB is reviewing quarterly reports. However, weaknesses  remain: agencies need to implement specific recommendations we have  previously made to improve their practices for overseeing projects.  Finally, OMB has not developed a single aggregate list of high risk projects  to track progress, perform governmentwide analysis, and report the  results to Congress.", "While the criteria for high risk projects and those on the Management  Watch List differ, both types of projects support critical business functions  and could experience performance problems that could become costly to  address if they are not detected early.

OMB could consider using the information we have developed in appendix  III as a starting point for developing this single list.  In implementing these recommendations, OMB should consider working  with the CIO Council to help ensure governmentwide acceptance of these  actions.", "Because we have outstanding recommendations aimed at (1) improving  agencies\u2019 investment management practices and (2) using the  Management Watch List as a tool for analyzing, setting priorities, and  following up on IT projects, we are not making any new  recommendations in this report regarding these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s Administrator for the E-Government and Information Technology  provided written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in app. II).  In these comments, OMB stated that it appreciated our careful review of  OMB\u2019s process for identifying and overseeing high risk projects. However,  the agency disagreed with our recommendations and made other  observations.", "In its comments, OMB stated that it is concerned about our interpretation  of the goals and intent of the high risk process in comparison to GAO\u2019s  high risk list. Our intent is not to confuse the goals and intent of the two  efforts. Nevertheless, as noted in our report, some major programs and  operations have been placed on our high risk list because of weaknesses  in key agency management practices, and this is consistent with OMB\u2019s  first criterion for high risk designation\u2014the agency has not demonstrated  the ability to manage complex projects.", "In its comments, OMB also observed that the policy for identifying and  overseeing high risk projects is separate and apart from OMB\u2019s  Management Watch List and presents oversight authorities with  information that differs in focus, timing, and expected results. While we  agree with OMB that the two policies are different and acknowledge this  in our report, we also noted in the report that Management Watch List  projects can also be high risk. We believe projects from both lists warrant  close attention because of their importance in supporting critical functions  and the likelihood that performance problems associated with them could  potentially result in billion of taxpayers\u2019 dollars being wasted if they are  not detected early.", "Regarding our recommendations to direct agencies to consistently apply  the criteria for designating projects as high risk and to establish a  structured, consistent process to update the initial list of high risk  projects, OMB stated that the process and criteria for designating projects  as high risk are clear and that some flexibility in the application of the  criteria is essential. While some flexibility in the application of the criteria  may be appropriate, we believe these criteria should be applied more  consistently so that projects that clearly appear to meet them, such as  those we mention in the report, are identified.", "OMB also disagreed with our recommendation to develop a single  aggregate list of projects and their deficiencies to perform adequate  oversight and management. As noted in the report, we believe that, by not  having this list, OMB is not fully exploiting the opportunity to use the  agencies\u2019 quarterly reports as a tool for analyzing high risk projects on a  governmentwide basis and for tracking governmentwide progress. In  addition, OMB is limiting its ability to identify and report on the full set of  IT investments across the federal government that requires special  oversight and greater agency management attention.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the  date of this letter.

All 24  agencies responded to our structured questionnaire. We did not verify the  accuracy of the agencies\u2019 responses; however, we reviewed supporting  documentation that selected agencies provided to validate their responses.
