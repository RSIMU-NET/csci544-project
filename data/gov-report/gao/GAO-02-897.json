Accordingly, in preparation for CCDF\u2019s reauthorization, you asked us to examine (1) what quality improvement initiatives states have undertaken with the 4 percent set-aside and other funding sources and (2) what evidence has been gathered, if any, about the effectiveness of states\u2019 initiatives.", "To determine what initiatives states have conducted, we surveyed CCDF lead state agencies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia about the use of CCDF and other funds in fiscal year 2000. We received responses from 42 states. We asked them to classify their quality improvement initiatives into nine general categories, which include the major activities identified in the law, HHS\u2019s regulations, and in the child care literature and to identify the funding sources for each initiative category and the amount spent. We also conducted case studies of five states\u2014California, Massachusetts, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin\u2014to gather data that would amplify information on states\u2019 initiatives collected by the survey. We selected states that were diverse geographically and in population density and that represented a variety of child care quality improvement initiatives. We also considered the state\u2019s income distribution, licensing caseloads, use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds and whether state licensing requirements reflected child-to- staff ratios recommended by national child care accrediting bodies. To examine the evidence of effectiveness, we asked state lead agencies for evaluations of their initiatives, contacted HHS and researchers regarding their work, and assessed the evaluations we identified. We also reviewed major summaries and methodological critiques of the research literature on child care quality. Appendix I provides additional details about our scope and methodology. We conducted our work between December 2001 and June 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Child care services are supplied by providers operating in varied settings: in center care, a child is cared for in a nonresidential setting and in family child care, a child is cared for in the home of a provider.

Some child care centers and family child care homes also offer school-aged care for children before and after school. (See table 1.) Generally, children in center-based care and family child care have not yet started school and after-school care is offered to children in kindergarten through age 12.", "Research on child care quality identified two broad sets of attributes that pertain to quality in all child care settings: structural attributes of the child care environment and children\u2019s daily interactions with their caregivers. Structural attributes of child care include characteristics such as child-to- staff ratios, the number of children per caregiver in a classroom; group size, the number of children assigned to a team of caregivers in a classroom; caregiver formal education; caregivers\u2019 specialized training; caregiver wages; staff turnover; the amount of floor space per child; and health and safety features, such as frequent staff and child hand washing. Child-caregiver interactions refers to actual experiences that occur in child care settings, and include such attributes as caregiver sensitivity and responsiveness, caregiver participation in children\u2019s play and learning activities, and language stimulation by caregivers.", "State and local governments are responsible for the oversight of child care providers that operate in their state. Each state establishes its own child care standards, determining the areas and types of providers that the standards will cover and the specific criteria that will be used to determine provider compliance. Most child care providers are required to meet a state\u2019s standards to obtain a license to operate legally in a state. State child care standards primarily focus on the structural attributes of care.", "States can turn to organizations such as the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) in HHS\u2019s Public Health Service that have developed standards based on research and professional practice. NAEYC, the nation\u2019s largest association of early child professionals, was formed to improve professional practice in early childhood care and education and increase public understanding of high quality early childhood programs. NAEYC also accredits, through a voluntary system, early childhood centers and schools. In 1998, we reported that state licensing standards varied in the extent to which the standards reflected those of NAEYC and MCHB. For example, we found that only two states had standards for caregiver education and training that matched NAEYC standards. Typically, state standards tended to require significantly fewer years of education than the standards set by NAEYC. Thus, to achieve accreditation by a national accrediting body, child care providers may have to meet higher standards than those they would meet to obtain and keep a state operating license."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CCDF Structure and Spending Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Title I of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) overhauled the nation\u2019s welfare system by replacing the legal entitlement to cash assistance under the previous welfare program with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. Title VI of PRWORA amended the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBG) and combined CCDBG funds with the funding of three other federal child care programs. HHS named the combined set of funds the CCDF.", "Each state receives an annual CCDF allocation composed of funds from three separate funding streams: discretionary, mandatory and matching. Assessing the portion of CCDF funds states spend on quality improvement is complicated to some extent by the distinct set of rules covering each stream that determine the time period allowed for obligating and spending the funds. (See table 2.)", "Each state receives a share of the total amount of money in the discretionary funding stream, which is determined each year by the congressional appropriations process. A state\u2019s share of discretionary funds is based on a formula stipulated in the statute.  A state must obligate discretionary funds within 2 fiscal years after a grant award and spend the funds by the end of the following fiscal year.", "A state\u2019s share of mandatory funds is based on the amount of funds the state received from a set of federal child care programs in a base year. Mandatory funds are available until they are spent. However, to receive federal matching funds, a state must obligate all mandatory funds by the end of the fiscal year in which they were awarded; maintain program spending of state funds at a specified level, referred to as a state\u2019s maintenance of effort (MOE); and spend additional state funds above that level. States may spend more of their own funds on child care than the amount actually accounted for under CCDF\u2019s MOE and matching requirements. Federal and state matching funds must be committed by the end of the fiscal year in which they are received and spent by the end of the following fiscal year.", "Finally, funds transferred from the TANF block grant represent an additional source of funds for the CCDF. PRWORA allowed states the flexibility to transfer up to 30 percent of TANF funds to the CCDF. Transferred TANF funds are treated as part of the discretionary funding stream and are subject to CCDF rules.", "States must spend at least 4 percent of their CCDF funds\u2014of discretionary, mandatory and matching, but not of state MOE funds\u2014for a given fiscal year on activities intended to improve the quality and availability of child care. Specifically, the law requires that states use at least 4 percent of these funds for activities to provide comprehensive consumer education to parents and the public, activities that increase parental choice, and activities designed to improve the quality and availability of child care. As stated earlier, HHS, through its regulations, has provided illustrative examples of activities designed to improve the quality of child care. In addition, the regulations permit other expenditures that are consistent with the intent of the regulation. This provision of PRWORA is known as the 4 percent set-aside. Congress also has earmarked money in CCDF\u2019s discretionary fund for resource and referral services and school-age care, infant and toddler care and quality-related activities.  Any funds expended for the activity beyond the designated earmarks can be used to meet the 4 percent set-aside requirement. Earmarked funds must be tracked and reported separately from 4 percent set-aside expenditures. For fiscal year 2001, Congress provided $19,100,000 for the resource and referral services and school-age care earmark, $100,000,000 for the infant and toddler earmark, and $172,600,000 for the quality-related activities earmark. These earmark amounts were continued for fiscal year 2002.

HHS also requires states to report total expenditures of 4 percent set-aside funds annually but does not require separate reporting for the quality improvement initiatives the states undertake. Thus, to examine states\u2019 quality improvement expenditures, we developed a framework to guide data collection and analysis. Beginning with examples of the allowable activities included in the 4 percent set-aside provision and HHS regulations, we specified nine categories to characterize states\u2019 initiatives.", "The categories are based on several sources. (See table 3.) Most categories\u2014caregiver compensation, meeting state standards, safety equipment or improvement, caregiver education and training and resource and referral\u2014are based on examples in the law and regulations. Because our analytic framework includes the full range of states\u2019 quality improvement initiatives, including those funded by sources other than CCDF, we identified additional categories based on child care quality literature. On-site training and enhanced inspections were included as categories based on the Department of Defense\u2019s child development program, which has been widely recognized as a model of high quality care. Incentives for achieving accreditation or exceeding standards is a category based on several studies of child care quality improvement strategies that look beyond the scope of activities cited in the law. The final category for other quality-related activities included initiatives that may be unique to a state and those that may foster the availability of high quality care, such as strategies that provide consumer education or increase parental choice. Because activities to provide comprehensive consumer education to parents and the public and increase parental choice were not included among the activities noted by the law or HHS regulations as designed to improve child care quality, we did not include these activities in our framework. However, states were free to report these or other quality-related activities when they construed them as such.", "Prior to and since CCDF\u2019s creation, a large body of research on child care that included an analysis of its effects on children\u2019s development has been accumulating. In 1990, the National Research Council assessed this research, focusing on the costs, effects and feasibility of child care policies and programs. As part of this assessment, the council concluded that child care quality is linked to children\u2019s development. The council emphasized that it would be important for future research to examine exactly how the various components of quality affected children\u2019s development, what magnitude of improvement in development could be expected from measured improvements in quality and, most importantly, whether the quality of child care has an effect on children\u2019s development that is separate from that of family characteristics.", "Noting that studies using random assignment of children to differing child care arrangements of varying quality provide the most rigorous evidence of whether child care quality has an effect that is separate from family characteristics, the council also found that random assignment had been used rarely in studies of community-based child care settings. Pointing out the contributions of experimental designs, the term given to studies that employ random assignment, to research on early interventions for children from disadvantaged families, the council urged that experimental designs be used in future research on child care quality. Other reviews of the research on child care quality, while agreeing on the importance of looking at the effects of child care quality separately from the effects of family characteristics, acknowledged the practical difficulties of random assignment and recommended an alternative approach that uses advanced statistical methods and a comparison group, an approach known as quasi- experimental design. In conducting our assessment of research on the effectiveness of states\u2019 quality improvement initiatives, we also used the criterion that to determine a program\u2019s effect, an evaluation should employ an experimental or quasi-experimental design.

(See fig. 2.) Resource and referral services are identified in the CCDBG Act as an example of activities for which states may make expenditures for quality improvement.  Two of the states we visited described the use of resource and referral agencies to deliver technical assistance to providers.  In South Dakota, the state\u2019s five resource and referral agencies provided child care providers with technical assistance needed to meet regulatory requirements.  In Massachusetts, the child care agency used resource and referral agencies to assist providers in caring for children with special needs, such as a child with a disability.  In collaboration with the state\u2019s Department of Public Health, the Massachusetts child care agency developed a consultation program for special needs children.  Consultation program representatives helped resource and referral agencies understand what a child\u2019s needs were when placing the child with a provider.  Three states described the use of resource and referral agencies as a vehicle for training.  The South Dakota and California child care agencies used resource and referral agencies to deliver all training for child care providers.  In Massachusetts, the state\u2019s resource and referral agencies trained providers in using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale for self-assessments of quality, in using information technology and in early literacy.  Providers who then implemented early literacy initiatives for their staff were offered rate increases.", "Initiatives received different proportions of total reported expenditures for quality improvement, using all funding sources. In addition to being the most frequently undertaken, states reported that resource and referral activities received a larger share of reported expenditures on quality improvement than did any other initiative, about 20 percent of all expenditures. (See fig. 3.)", "States reported undertaking several initiatives to improve caregiver qualifications and compensation. Eighty-two percent of the states funded an off-site caregiver training initiative. One example is the Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (TEACH) program, which provides caregivers with scholarships to attend college classes related to child development. TEACH began in North Carolina and has been replicated in 17 states. One-third of the states undertook initiatives to improve caregiver compensation through increased wages or benefits. For example, child care officials in Massachusetts use Quality Awards to reward child care staff and family child care providers with one-time bonuses for excellence in their work. A similar number of states reported funding on-site caregiver training, which provides caregivers with training and education opportunities at their place of employment. Officials in Wisconsin reported funding caregiver training for increased safety in family child care homes. Taken together, these initiatives received about 25 percent of the expenditures states reported.", "Most states also reported undertaking initiatives to assist providers in meeting state standards and to reward providers for exceeding state standards. Thirty of the 42 responding states reported providing funding to assist child care providers in meeting state licensing standards, such as California\u2019s provision of funding to assist child care providers with health and safety standards and a variety of training requirements. Additionally, 29 of the 42 responding states reported funding safety improvements. For example, South Dakota\u2019s health and safety funding offers child care providers up to 75 percent of the cost of safety equipment, such as windows designed to provide an escape route in the event of an emergency. Over half the states reported providing incentives for child care providers to become accredited or exceed state standards. Under its child care program, Wisconsin did so by setting the maximum reimbursement rate for providers that met accreditation standards, which exceed licensing standards, 10 percent higher than the regular reimbursement rate. Initiatives to assist providers in meeting state standards received about 13 percent of states\u2019 reported quality improvement expenditures. However, although many states reported funding safety improvements and offering incentives for accreditation or exceeding standards, these initiatives received the smallest shares of funding.", "Half the states reported initiatives devoted to enhancing inspections of child care facilities, either by increasing the frequency or the thoroughness of such inspections. Although less commonly reported than several other initiatives, these inspection efforts received the second largest proportion of quality funds.", "Finally, over half the states reported undertaking initiatives in the all other activities category. These included consumer education campaigns and improvement of the quality and availability of care for special populations, such as infants, toddlers, and children with special needs. California, for example, reported funding a variety of other activities including school- age curriculum and material development and a program for infant/toddler caregiver training coordinators.", "The CCDF 4 percent set-aside funded nearly half of all state-reported expenditures on quality. (See fig. 4.) State funds were the next largest funding source, constituting almost one-third of all expenditures on quality improvement initiatives.

Officials in four of the five states we visited cited the views of state officials and previous research as two key factors in their selection of initiatives. In four states, decisions on how child care funds are allocated among the various quality initiatives are determined through the legislative process. For example, in Massachusetts, the state legislature\u2019s perspective and previous research were cited as reasons that most quality initiative funds were devoted to caregiver compensation. Officials we spoke with said the state legislature supported early literacy, which led officials to offer rate increases to providers that implemented early literacy initiatives. In addition, research led state officials to believe that improving caregiver compensation would increase child care quality. Therefore, these rate increases were meant to enable providers to improve caregiver compensation. (See fig. 5.)", "Officials in Tennessee explained that several factors\u2014recent events in the child care community, the state legislature\u2019s perspective, and research\u2014 influenced the state\u2019s emphasis on enhanced inspections. The Tennessee lead agency director told us that in 1999, the accidental deaths of two children in a child care van prompted the legislature to focus on quality improvement initiatives. Subsequently, Tennessee instituted a policy of criminal background checks and an increase in the number of unannounced inspections of child care facilities. Tennessee\u2019s distribution of funds emphasized this focus on inspections, as seen in figure 6. Tennessee now conducts six unannounced inspections of each facility per year. In addition, Tennessee officials consulted research on child care quality to inform their decisions but did not sponsor evaluation, pointing to the trade-off between funding evaluations and direct services to improve quality.", "Wisconsin officials told us that research and gubernatorial proposals influenced the selection of a range of quality improvement initiatives. State officials said they analyzed data on quality improvement programs, and consulted experts in the child care field. The state legislature and the governor also influenced priorities. For example, in January 1999, the governor put forth a proposal to direct $15 million into an Early Childhood Excellence Commission to develop high quality child care in low income neighborhoods.", "In South Dakota, the decision to emphasize resource and referral agencies was guided by previous research and the governor\u2019s perspective. State officials relied on existing child care quality research for making choices about how to improve quality because they believed that sponsoring evaluations would be too resource intensive. On the basis of previous research findings, state officials believed training caregivers to be the central mechanism through which child care quality could be improved. After obtaining the governor\u2019s support, child care officials directed funding to resource and referral centers to train caregivers. (See fig. 7.)", "By contrast in California, officials in the Department of Education, the CCDF lead state agency in that state, said that they have more discretion than other states in deciding which quality initiatives to fund. According to these officials, because the California Department of Education has its own constitutional officer, who is independent of the governor, California child care officials have more autonomy in their selection of initiatives. Department of Education officials explained that the department\u2019s priorities\u2014health and safety, best practices in early development and learning, and professional development\u2014influenced the selection of a range of quality improvement initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States Spend More Than 4 Percent on Quality Improvement", "paragraphs": ["While HHS requires that states spend at least 4 percent of the CCDF on quality improvement, the majority of states reported expenditures for quality in excess of this minimum requirement in fiscal year 2000.

(See fig. 8.) However, nationwide, 55 percent of all children whose care involves CCDF assistance are attending child care centers and 32 percent of all children are in center- based care. Thus, centers receive a larger share of quality improvement expenditures targeted to providers than the share of CCDF-subsidized children in their care. In addition, while there was insufficient information in states\u2019 responses to analyze initiatives devoted to informal care, the policy research community has expressed interest in quality improvement initiatives targeted on these providers because we have the least information about them and a significant number of children are cared for in informal settings.", "When we looked at expenditures on individual initiatives by the thirty-four states, we saw the same pattern of emphasis on centers. (See table 5.) For the six initiatives, centers received the majority of funds, followed by family child care. Moreover, for initiatives related to meeting standards, the proportion of expenditures devoted to centers was smaller than for other initiatives, but still greatly exceeded the proportion devoted to family child care and after-school care.", "However, when we examined expenditures on initiatives by individual states, the proportion of expenditures on quality improvement activities devoted to each provider type varied. (See table 6.) For example, Minnesota, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Washington reported devoting 90 percent or more of quality expenditures to centers, and Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, North Dakota, and Oregon reported devoting less than one-third of quality expenditures to centers.", "These differences can be explained in part by state-to-state differences in the proportion of children receiving CCDF subsidies that attend each type of provider. For example, in Michigan, 19 percent of children receiving CCDF subsidies attend centers, while in Tennessee, 73 percent of children receiving CCDF subsidies attend centers. Given the variation in the proportion of subsidized children attending center-based care, it would be reasonable for Michigan to devote relatively less of its quality expenditures to centers and for Tennessee to devote relatively more of its quality expenditures to centers.

Improvements in attributes of child care quality can be seen as an intermediate step toward strengthening children\u2019s development One of the three studies with conclusive findings, sponsored by Florida, analyzed how Florida\u2019s implementation of more stringent child-to-staff ratios and caregiver education requirements in child care centers was related to children\u2019s cognitive and socio-emotional development over time. The two other studies with conclusive findings, sponsored by Massachusetts and Washington state, examined caregiver compensation and caregiver recruitment and retention rates.", "Taking measures of child care quality and children\u2019s development before and after Florida instituted more stringent teacher-to-child ratios and caregiver education requirements, Florida\u2019s study found that a reduction in child-to-staff ratios and an increase in early education requirements for center providers contributed to gains in children\u2019s development and the quality of early education and care they received. The study\u2019s design allowed the contribution of child-to-staff ratios and caregivers\u2019 education to children\u2019s development to be examined, but, without a comparison group, was unable to isolate their effects completely. However, this limitation did not compromise the study\u2019s findings.", "Massachusetts\u2019s recruitment and retention study examined caregiver compensation, conducting a survey of providers regarding the reasons for the shortage and high turnover of providers in child care centers across Massachusetts. The study confirmed findings of other studies that caregivers who receive low wages are difficult to hire and retain. However, the study design it employed did not rule out explanations other than low salaries for the association between high turnover rates and workers receiving low wages. Washington State also evaluated caregiver compensation and retention, using a quasi-experimental design, but found no effect of the compensation on retention.", "It is important to acknowledge that while we looked at all of the studies we identified for evidence of the effectiveness of state initiatives, the studies that states sponsored may not always have been designed for that purpose and in some cases provided useful data on other issues that they were intended to address. For example, when the data sources used in nonexperimental studies meet data quality standards, as did data collected for the Massachusetts recruitment and retention study, state-sponsored studies can provide reliable information that is needed to address program design issues, such as setting reimbursement rates; to assess program implementation, such as examining the number of caregivers that have acquired training in child development; or to understand the child care market, such as determining the number of providers that offer health benefits to their caregivers. Studies that collect this type of descriptive information also help in planning research that employs rigorous designs. We also recognize that more definitive studies are labor and resource intensive; studies that employ experimental designs are difficult and expensive to conduct. Similarly, surveys that involve low-income families, which may be needed for studies using quasi-experimental designs, require special procedures, such as the use of financial incentives or several rounds of follow-up with nonrespondents, to achieve a response rate that meets minimum data quality standards. Moreover, while state child care agencies may partner with universities or contract research organizations to conduct such studies as CCDF funding sources permit, officials in four of the five states we talked to explained that states must make trade-offs between serving more families and conducting evaluations of their own quality improvement initiatives.", "The remaining studies we identified did not meet our criteria for data quality, because of low survey response rates or self-selected samples. California conducted a comprehensive study of caregiver compensation, and Massachusetts conducted a second study of caregivers\u2019 salaries, but both studies had very low response rates. North Carolina examined the reliability of criteria used in the state\u2019s incentive for accreditation initiative, but the sample of providers they studied was self-selected and included few centers with low quality ratings.

While the findings of this research suggest that some states\u2019 initiatives are attempting to influence aspects of child care that have demonstrable effects on children\u2019s development, this is not sufficient to determine that these initiatives are necessarily effective as implemented.", "In 2000, the National Research Council conducted a second methodological review of research on early childhood development that included research on child care quality. The council, like a team of reviewers sponsored by HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and a team of reviewers sponsored by a foundation, examined the relationship between the structural attributes of quality and child-caregiver interactions on children\u2019s developmental progress. (See table 7.) The reviewers found that structural attributes, such as caregiver qualifications, child-to-staff ratios and smaller group size, lead to developmental gains directly or fostered supportive and responsive caregiver behavior. All reviewers concluded that child- caregiver interactions that are responsive and supportive have positive effects on children\u2019s developmental progress. Each of these reviews also emphasized that studies of the effect of child care quality on child development should employ study designs and statistical methods that separate the effects of family characteristics on children\u2019s development from the quality of the child care setting. The third review in table 7 includes a detailed discussion of the study designs and statistical methods, other than experimental design, that can be used to isolate the effect of child care quality. Among the large number of studies that were reviewed, the findings of those that met these criteria are summarized in appendix III.", "These studies have shown relationships between structural attributes, child-caregiver interactions and children\u2019s developmental progress that suggest many state initiatives are targeted on aspects of child care settings that have the potential for enhancing developmental outcomes. However, this is not sufficient to conclude that states\u2019 initiatives are necessarily effective in enhancing child care quality. Such a conclusion would presume that they are not only targeted on aspects of child care quality with the potential to improve developmental outcomes, but that they are reaching providers in need of help and reflect the individual attributes and the context in which they were studied originally. For example, because many studies were conducted at an earlier time period, the qualifications of the caregivers studied may differ from the pool of caregivers available in the current labor market. In addition, the populations of providers that were drawn at the state or substate level are not necessarily similar to the populations of other states. Thus, while existing research findings help states plan their initiatives, rigorous evaluations of initiatives actually implemented by the states are needed to provide evidence of the initiatives\u2019 effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019s Role in Supporting Studies of States\u2019 Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Using CCDF funds set aside for research, demonstration and evaluation by the 2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act, HHS has developed a research agenda that includes studies of child care quality and a commitment to rigorous evaluation.

The goals are (1) improve the capacity to respond to policy questions, (2) strengthen data collection and analysis systems for child care research, and (3) increase knowledge about the effectiveness of child care policies and programs on child development and in helping low- income families obtain and retain work.

The regulations state that activities to improve the quality of child care may include, but are not limited to, the following: Improving resource and referral programs   Making grants or loans to providers to assist in meeting child care standards Improving compliance with and enforcement of state and local licensing requirements   Providing training and technical assistance to providers in health and safety, nutrition, child abuse detection and prevention, and care of children with special needs Improving salaries and compensation for staff who provide child care services.", "The regulations also include a provision that allows expenditures for any other activities that are consistent with the intent of the 4 percent set-aside section, which grants states considerable discretion.", "Because of the discretion that the law and HHS regulations allow states in selecting quality improvement initiatives, collecting information on quality improvement across all states required a common set of categories. The starting point for constructing categories for states\u2019 quality improvement initiatives was the CCDBG Act and its regulations. However, the quality improvement activities specified in the law and regulations did not include all of the initiatives states are undertaking to improve the quality of care children receive. To ensure that our study analyzed all state spending for child care quality improvement, we developed nine categories for states\u2019 child care quality improvement initiatives and asked states in which categories they funded activity, how much they spent, and the funding source.", "We developed the categories by combining federally designated activities with initiatives from contemporary child care quality analyses. To address the limitations of the federal activities, to create a more complete picture of state child care quality initiatives and to capture innovations in child care improvement, we added three categories to the federal categories. Two were derived from quality improvement initiatives undertaken by the Department of Defense\u2019s military child development program and one category was derived from literature analyzing child care quality improvement. An \u201cother quality-related activities\u201d category was added because the regulations were not exhaustive and permitted states to develop initiatives not listed in regulations, provided that they were consistent with them. Thus, the category for other quality-related activities included initiatives that may be unique to a state and those that may foster the availability of high quality care, such as strategies that provide consumer education or increase parental choice. Because activities to provide comprehensive consumer education to parents and the public and increase parental choice were not included among the activities noted by the law or HHS regulations as designed to improve child care quality, we did not include these activities in our framework.

To isolate the program\u2019s influences, an evaluation studies two groups: those receiving program services and a similar group not receiving program services. Researchers compare the relevant outcomes of these two groups, such as children\u2019s socioemotional development, to determine the program\u2019s effect.", "The criteria for study design in table 9 apply to two types of evaluations: an experimental design and a quasi-experimental design. The two designs differ primarily in the way that the comparison groups are developed. In an experimental design, because comparison group members are selected randomly, researchers can compare outcomes to determine the program\u2019s effect without using statistical controls for other factors that could have influenced the program. In a quasi-experimental design, the comparison group is composed of individuals who share characteristics with program participants, but who have not been randomly selected and who have not received program services. With this design, statistical controls, such as those provided by a multivariate analysis procedure, are needed to isolate the program from other factors that could influence outcomes. While there can be substantial practical difficulties in implementing experimental designs of social programs because program staff may be reluctant to participate and because of the tendency for comparison group participants to leave the study, there is no substantial debate about the desirability of a comparison group of some type in drawing conclusions about program effects.", "The criteria for assessing the administrative and survey data used in the evaluations were the same data quality criteria we discussed above. The criteria for data analysis in table 9 refer to the need to control for factors other than the program when program participants and comparison group members are not randomly selected. They also encompass additional analyses that may be needed if the group receiving program services and the comparison group were not randomly selected or to determine if missing data affect the reliability of the estimates of the program\u2019s effect.", "Finally, several of the studies we assessed and the reviews of child care research we examined made reference to scales for measuring child care quality. In child care quality research, the structural attributes of quality are measured directly by, for example, counting the number of children per caregiver in classrooms or the years of education that a caregiver has attained. However, because child-caregiver interactions must be observed and recorded for research purposes, researchers have developed various scales to measure it. These scales contain numerous items that evaluate the areas of personal care routines, furnishings, language reasoning experiences, motor activities, creative activities, social development, and staff needs. Three of the most well known scales used in measuring process quality are the Early Care Environment Rating Scale (ECERS), the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS), and the Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS). The ECERS and ITERS scales measure child- caregiver interactions at center-based care while FDCRS measures process quality in child care homes.", "One of the reviews assessed the scales\u2019 strengths and limitations. The strengths of these three scales are their ease of use, reliability, good psychological measurement properties, and ability for cross-study comparisons. However, the reviewer pointed out, these scales also have some limitations. For example, their global composite scores combine features of various environments and influences when some of these areas may have greater influence on children\u2019s development as compared to others. Additionally, these scales are setting-specific which means it is not possible to make simple comparisons across types of care or to combine scores in meta analyses.
