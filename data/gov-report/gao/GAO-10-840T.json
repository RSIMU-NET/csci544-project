My statement today is based on our report,  Secure Border Initiative: DHS Needs to Reconsider Its Proposed  Investment in Key Technology Program, which is being released at this  hearing.", "As you know, SBI is intended to help secure the 6,000 miles of  international borders that the contiguous United States shares with  Canada and Mexico. The program, which began in November 2005, seeks  to enhance border security and reduce illegal immigration by improving  surveillance technologies, raising staffing levels, increasing domestic  enforcement of immigration laws, and improving physical infrastructure  along the nation\u2019s borders.

Recently, in September 2008, we reported that  important aspects of SBInet were still ambiguous and in a continuous state  of flux 3 years after the program began, making it unclear and uncertain  what technology capabilities were to be delivered when. In addition, the  program still lacked an approved schedule to guide its execution, and key  milestones continued to slip. This schedule-related risk was exacerbated  by the absence of a clearly defined approach used for developing and  deploying SBInet. Furthermore, different levels of SBInet requirements  were not properly aligned, and not all requirements had been properly  defined and validated. Also, the program office was not effectively  managing early test events. We thus emphasized at that time that the  program was not on a path for success and that change was needed. In  March 2010, we reported that recently completed test events were not  adequate, as illustrated by poorly defined test plans and numerous and  extensive last-minute changes to test procedures, and we reported on a  growing number of system performance and quality problems, which we  said was not indicative of a maturing system. We have also reported  multiple times on the impact that SBInet performance limitations have had  on Border Patrol operations. In particular, we reported that the instability  of the cameras, mechanical problems with the tower-mounted radar, and  the sensitivity of the radar have limited system reliability and contributed  to significant delays in system deployment along the southwest border. As  a result, Border Patrol agents have been forced to rely on existing  technologies that have their own limitations, such as cameras mounted on  towers that intermittently lose signals.", "My statement today summarizes our most recent report on SBInet, which  is being released publicly at this hearing. In summary, the report provided  a timely and compelling case for DHS to rethink the plans it had in place at  the beginning of this year for investing in SBInet. In this regard, we  showed that the scope of the initial system\u2019s capabilities and areas of  deployment have continued to shrink, thus making it unclear what  capabilities are to be delivered when.

The SBI  Program Executive Office, which is organizationally within CBP, is  responsible for managing key acquisition functions associated with  SBInet, such as requirements management and risk management. Within  the Executive Office, the SBInet System Program Office (SPO) is  responsible for managing the day-to-day development and deployment of  SBInet.", "In September 2006, CBP awarded a 3-year contract to the Boeing Company  for SBI, with three additional 1-year options. As the prime contractor,  Boeing is responsible for designing, producing, testing, deploying, and  sustaining the system. In September 2009, CBP extended its contract with  Boeing for the first option year. CBP is acquiring SBInet incrementally in a  series of discrete units of capabilities, referred to as \u201cblocks.\u201d Each block  is to deliver one or more system capabilities from a subset of the total  system requirements. The first block, known as Block 1, is to include a mix  of surveillance technologies (e.g., cameras, radars, and sensors) and C3I  technologies that are to produce a common operating picture\u2014a uniform  presentation of activities within specific areas along the border. Block 1 is  to be initially deployed within the Tucson Sector to the Tucson Border  Patrol Station (TUS-1) and to the Ajo Border Patrol Station (AJO-1). As of  May 2010, the TUS-1 system is scheduled for government acceptance in  September 2010, with AJO-1 acceptance in November 2010.", "In January 2010, the DHS Secretary ordered a departmentwide  reassessment of the program to include a comprehensive assessment of  alternatives to SBInet to ensure that the department utilizes the most  efficient and effective technological and operational solutions to secure  the border. Pending the results of the assessment, the Secretary also froze  all Block 1 expenditures beyond those needed to complete the  implementation of the initial SBInet deployments to TUS-1 and AJO-1.  Further, in March 2010, the department announced its plans to redeploy  $50 million from its American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  funding to purchase currently available, stand-alone technology, such as  remote-controlled camera systems called Remote Video Surveillance  Systems, and truck-mounted systems with cameras and radar, called  Mobile Surveillance Systems, to meet near-term operational needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Block 1 Capabilities, Geographic Coverage, and Performance Standards Have Continued to Decrease", "paragraphs": ["In order to measure system acquisition progress and promote  accountability for results, organizations need to establish clear  commitments around what system capabilities will be delivered, and when  and where they will be delivered. In September 2008, we reported that the  scope of SBInet was becoming more limited without becoming more  specific, thus making it unclear and uncertain what system capabilities  would be delivered when and to what locations. Accordingly, we  recommended that DHS establish and baseline the specific program  commitments, including the specific system functional and performance  capabilities that are to be deployed to the Tucson, Yuma, and El Paso  Sectors, and establish when these capabilities are to be deployed and are  to be operational.", "To its credit, the SPO subsequently defined the scope of the first  incremental block of SBInet capabilities that it intended to deploy and  make operational; however, these capabilities and the number of  geographic locations to which they are to be deployed have continued to  shrink. For example, the number of component-level requirements to be  deployed to the TUS-1 and AJO-1 locations has decreased by about 32  percent since October 2008 (see fig. 1).", "In addition, the number of sectors that the system is to be deployed to was  reduced from three border sectors spanning about 655 miles to two  sectors spanning about 387 miles. Further, the stringency of the  performance measures was relaxed, to the point that system performance  is now deemed acceptable if it identifies less than 50 percent of items of  interest that cross the border. According to program officials, the  decreases are due to poorly defined requirements and limitations in the  capabilities of commercially available system components. The result will  be a deployed and operational system that does not live up to user  expectations and provides less mission support than was envisioned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Reliable Schedule for Completing Block 1 Has Not Been Developed", "paragraphs": ["The success of a large-scale system acquisition program, like SBInet,  depends in part on having a reliable schedule of when the program\u2019s set of  work activities and milestone events will occur, how long they will take,  and how they are related to one another. Among other things, a reliable  schedule provides a road map for systematic execution of a program and  the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential  problems, and promote accountability. In September 2008, we reported  that the program did not have an approved master schedule that could be  used to guide the development of SBInet. Accordingly, we recommended  that the SPO finalize and approve an integrated master schedule that  reflects the timing and sequencing of SBInet tasks.", "However, DHS has yet to develop a reliable integrated master schedule for  delivering the first block of SBInet. Specifically, the August 2009 SBInet  integrated master schedule, which was the most current version available  at the time of our review, did not sufficiently comply with seven of nine  schedule estimating practices that relevant guidance states are important  to having a reliable schedule. For example, the schedule did not  adequately capture all necessary activities to be performed, including  those to be performed by the government, such as obtaining  environmental permits in order to construct towers. Further, the schedule  did not include a valid critical path, which represents the chain of  dependent activities with the longest total duration in the schedule, and it  does not reflect a schedule risk analysis, which would allow the program  to better understand the schedule\u2019s vulnerability to slippages in the  completion of tasks.", "These limitations are due, in part, to the program\u2019s use of the prime  contractor to develop and maintain the integrated master schedule, whose  processes and tools do not allow it to include in the schedule work that it  does not have under contract to perform, as well as the constantly  changing nature of the work to be performed. Without having a reliable  schedule, it is unclear when the first block will be completed, and  schedule delays are likely to continue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Block 1 Has Not Been Demonstrated", "paragraphs": ["The decision to invest in any system, or major system increment, should  be based on reliable estimates of costs and meaningful forecasts of  quantifiable and qualitative benefits over the system\u2019s useful life. However,  DHS has not demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of Block 1. In particular,  it has not reliably estimated the costs of this block over its entire life cycle.  To do so requires DHS to ensure that the estimate meets key practices that  relevant guidance states are important to having an estimate that is  comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. However, DHS\u2019s  cost estimate for Block 1, which is about $1.3 billion, does not sufficiently  possess any of these characteristics.", "Further, DHS has yet to identify expected quantifiable or qualitative  benefits from this block and analyze them relative to costs. According to  program officials, it is premature to project such benefits given the  uncertainties surrounding the role that Block 1 will ultimately play in  overall border control operations, and that operational experience with  Block 1 is first needed in order to estimate such benefits. While we  recognize the value of operationally evaluating an early, prototypical  version of a system in order to better inform investment decisions, we  question the basis for spending in excess of a billion dollars to gain this  operational experience. Without a meaningful understanding of SBInet  costs and benefits, DHS lacks an adequate basis for knowing whether the  initial system solution is cost-effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Block 1 Has Not Been Managed in Accordance with Key Life Cycle Management Processes", "paragraphs": ["Successful management of large information technology programs, like  SBInet, depends in large part on having clearly defined and consistently  applied life cycle management processes. In September 2008, we reported  that the SBInet life cycle management approach had not been clearly  defined. Accordingly, we recommended that the SPO revise, approve, and  implement its life cycle management approach, including implementing  key requirements development and management practices, to reflect  relevant federal guidance and leading practices. To the SPO\u2019s credit, it has  defined key life cycle management processes that are largely consistent  with relevant guidance and associated best practices. However, it has not  effectively implemented these processes. In particular:    The SPO revised its Systems Engineering Plan, which documents its life  cycle management approach for SBInet definition, development, testing,  deployment, and sustainment, in November 2008, and this plan is largely  consistent with DHS and other relevant guidance. For example, it defines a  number of key life cycle milestone or \u201cgate\u201d reviews that are important in  managing the program, such as initial planning reviews, requirements  reviews, system design reviews, and test reviews. The plan also requires  most key artifacts and program documents that DHS guidance identified  as important to each gate review, such as a risk management plan and  requirements documentation. However, the SPO has not consistently  implemented these life cycle management activities for Block 1. For  example, the SPO did not review or consider key artifacts, including plans  for testing and evaluating the performance of the system, as well as  assessing the robustness of the system\u2019s security capabilities, during its  Critical Design Review, which is the point when, according to the plan,  verification and testing plans are to be in place.", "The SBInet Requirements Development and Management Plan states that  (1) a baseline set of requirements should be established by the time of the  Critical Design Review; (2) requirements should be achievable, verifiable,  unambiguous, and complete; and (3) requirements should be bi- directionally traceable from high-level operational requirements through  detailed low-level requirements to test plans. Further, the plan states that  ensuring traceability of requirements from lower-level requirements to  higher-level requirements is an integral part of ensuring that testing is  properly planned and conducted. However, not all Block 1 component  requirements were sufficiently defined at the time that they were baselined  at the Critical Design Review. Further, operational requirements continue  to be unclear and unverifiable, which has contributed to testing  challenges, including the need to extemporaneously rewrite test cases  during test execution. In addition, while requirements are now largely  traceable backwards to operational requirements and forward to design  requirements and verification methods, this traceability has not been used  until recently to verify that higher-level requirements have been satisfied.", "In 2008, the SPO documented a risk management approach that largely  complies with relevant guidance. However, it has not effectively  implemented this approach for all risks. Moreover, available  documentation does not demonstrate that significant risks were disclosed  to DHS and congressional decision makers in a timely fashion as we  previously recommended, and, while risk disclosure to DHS leadership has  recently improved, not all risks have been formally captured and thus  shared. For example, some of the risks that have not been formally  captured include the lack of well-defined acquisition management  processes, staff with the appropriate acquisition expertise, and agreement  on key system performance parameters. However, the SPO recently  established a risk management process for capturing SBI enterprisewide  risks, including the lack of well-defined acquisition management processes  and staff expertise.", "Reasons cited by program officials for not implementing these processes  include their decision to rely on task order requirements that were  developed prior to the Systems Engineering Plan and competing SPO  priorities, including meeting an aggressive deployment schedule. Until the  SPO consistently implements these processes, it will remain challenged in  its ability to successfully deliver SBInet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Agreed to Implement GAO Recommendations Aimed at Addressing SBInet Longstanding Uncertainties and Risks", "paragraphs": ["To address the program\u2019s risks, uncertainties, and acquisition management  weaknesses, our report being released today provides 12  recommendations.", "In summary, we recommended that DHS limit future investment in SBInet  to work that is either already under contract and supports the completion  of Block 1 activities for deployment to TUS-1 and AJO-1 and/or provides a  basis for a departmental decision on what, if any, expanded investment in  SBInet is justifiable as a prudent use of DHS\u2019s resources for carrying out  its border security and immigration management mission. As part of this  recommendation, we reiterated prior recommendations pertaining to  program management challenges and recommended that DHS address  weaknesses identified in our report by, for example, ensuring that the  SBInet integrated master schedule, Block 1 requirements, and the Systems  Engineering Plan, among other program elements, are consistent with best  practices.", "We also recommended that the program undertake a detailed cost-benefit  analysis of any incremental block of SBInet capabilities beyond Block 1  and report the results of such analyses to CBP and DHS leadership.  Further, we recommended that DHS decide whether proceeding with  expanded investment in SBInet represents a prudent use of the  department\u2019s resources, and report the decision, and the basis for it, to the  department\u2019s authorization and appropriations committees.", "To DHS\u2019s credit, it has initiated actions to address our recommendations.  In particular, and as previously mentioned, the department froze all  funding beyond the initial TUS-1 and AJO-1 deployments until it completes  a comprehensive reassessment of the program that includes an analysis of  the cost and projected benefits of additional SBInet deployments, as well  as the cost and mission effectiveness of alternative technologies.", "Further, in written comments on a draft of our report, DHS described  steps it is taking to fully incorporate best practices into its management of  the program. For example, DHS stated that, in response to our previous  recommendations, it has instituted more rigorous oversight of SBInet,  requiring the program to report to the department\u2019s Acquisition Review  Board at specified milestones and receive approval before proceeding with  the next deployment increment. With respect to our new  recommendations, DHS stated that it is, among other things, taking steps  to bring the Block 1 schedule into alignment with best practices, verifying  requirements and validating performance parameters, updating its Systems  Engineering Plan, and improving its risk management process.", "In closing, let me emphasize our long held position that SBInet is a risky  program. To minimize the program\u2019s exposure to risk, it is imperative for  DHS to follow through on its stated commitment to ensure that SBInet, as  proposed, is the right course of action for meeting its stated border  security and immigration management goals and outcomes, and once this  is established, for it to ensure that the program is executed in accordance  with proven acquisition management best practices. To do less will  perpetuate a program that has for too long been oversold and under  delivered.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
