This report examines (1) the distributions of income and wealth among all older Americans over time; (2) the association between income, wealth, and longevity among older Americans; and (3) how the distributions of income and wealth changed over time for a cohort of individuals as they aged. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed data from two nationally representative surveys: the SCF, using data from 1989 through 2016, and the HRS. GAO used 1992 through 2014 HRS data linked to earnings records from the Social Security Administration. While preliminary 2016 HRS data are available, GAO used 2014 data, which contain more complete information for GAO's analysis. GAO also reviewed studies and interviewed researchers to further analyze the relationships between income, wealth, longevity, and retirement security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Disparities in income and wealth among older households have become greater over the past 3 decades, according to GAO's analysis of Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. GAO divided older households into five groups (quintiles) based on their income and wealth. Each year of data in the analysis, and, thus, each quintile, included different sets of households over time. Average income and wealth was generally higher over time (see fig. 1 for average income), disproportionately so for the top quintile (top 20 percent). For example, in 2016, households in the top quintile had estimated average income of $398,000, compared to about $53,000 for the middle quintile and about $14,000 for the bottom quintile. GAO also found that for quintiles with lower wealth, future income from Social Security and defined benefit pensions provide a relatively significant portion of resources in retirement for those who expect such income.", "A substantial number of older Americans born from 1931 through 1941 lived at least into their 70s or early 80s, according to GAO's analysis of data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representive survey which follows the same individuals over time. GAO divided individuals born from 1931 through 1941 into quintiles based on their mid-career household earnings using records from the Social Security Administration. GAO's analysis, as well as that of other researchers, shows that differences in income, wealth, and demographic characteristics were associated with disparities in longevity. However, even with these disparities, we found a substantial number of people in the sample were alive in 2014, including those with characteristics associated with reduced average longevity, such as low earnings (see fig. 2) and low educational attainment. Taken all together, individuals may live a long time, even individuals with factors associated with lower longevity, such as low income or education. Those with fewer resources in retirement who live a long time may have to rely primarily on Social Security or safety net programs.", "GAO's analysis of HRS data also found that disparities in household income decreased while disparities in wealth persisted as a cohort of older Americans aged from approximately their 50s into their 70s or early 80s. Income disparities decreased between higher- and lower-earning households because higher-earning households saw larger drops in income over time, indicating the possible transition from working to retirement. For example, we estimated median income for the top mid-career earnings group decreased by 53 percent while estimated median income for the bottom earnings group decreased by 36 percent over the same period. Wealth remained relatively steady for households in the bottom three earnings groups over the time period GAO examined, while households in the top two earnings groups experienced larger fluctuations in wealth. GAO estimated that median retirement account balances and median home equity increased across earnings groups for households that had these assets. However, the continued wealth disparities may be due to significant differences in the median value of retirement accounts and home equity between higher- and lower-earning households. GAO also found that white households in the bottom two earnings groups had higher estimated median incomes, and white households in all earnings groups generally had greater estimated median wealth, than racial minority households in those earnings groups. In addition, within each earnings group, households headed by someone with at least some college education generally had higher median incomes and wealth than households headed by someone who did not attend college."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Income and wealth inequality in the United States have increased over  several decades. While income inequality in the United States was  relatively stable from the 1940s to the 1970s, since then wage growth at  the top of the income distribution has outpaced the rest of the distribution,  and inequality has risen. Wealth has become increasingly concentrated  as well. By 2013, those families in the top 10 percent of the wealth  distribution held 76 percent of the wealth held by all families in the United  States.  Inequality among older Americans, specifically, is an area of  concern for some policy makers and researchers, particularly given  trends related to the U.S. retirement system over this same time period.  For example, average life expectancy has increased. This is a positive  development, but it also requires more planning and saving to support  more years in retirement. Further, income, wealth, and longevity are each  interconnected with one another. For example, life expectancy has not  increased uniformly across all income groups, and people who have  lower incomes tend to have shorter lives than those with higher incomes.  There is concern among some researchers and policy makers that  disparities in income, wealth, and life expectancy may be indicative of  potential problems for many Americans\u2019 financial security in retirement.", "You asked us to examine the distribution of income and wealth among  older Americans and identify the implication of these trends, along with  associations with longevity, on retirement security.

A different sample of households was used for each year in our  analysis. These data allow for comparison of the experiences of same- age households at different points in time. We chose to look at  household-level resources because couples may pool their economic  resources and the SCF asks some of its questions about resources for  households. For each survey year, we examined the distribution of  income and wealth for older households as a whole and by household  heads\u2019 race and ethnicity, marital status and gender, and education level.  We defined older households as those in which the household head or  any spouses or partners were aged 55 or older. We also analyzed the  percentage of households that held various sources of income and wealth  and the amounts of such sources across the income and wealth  distributions.", "Lastly, we used these data, supplemented by data from the Financial  Accounts of the United States\u2013another data source published by the  Federal Reserve\u2013to estimate the present value of future income expected  from defined benefit (DB) pension plans and Social Security. To do so,  we followed methods developed by economists at the Federal Reserve,  with some modifications to the Social Security methods, in particular, to  meet the purposes of our analysis.  Alternative methods of analyzing  distributional disparities in retirement security exist. For example, one  option would be to evaluate how future monthly income from Social  Security and DB pensions would be expected to affect retirement  security, perhaps by assessing how the standard of living for workers  would be expected to change. Additionally, disparities in health in  adulthood could contribute to subsequent disparities in income and  wealth at older ages. However, for our analysis of how income and wealth  are distributed across older Americans over time, it was useful to estimate  the present value of Social Security and DB pensions so we could  compare the value of these sources to retirement account balances. In  addition, the SCF does not include sufficient data on health to consider its  role in income and wealth disparities for this part of our analysis.", "To examine the association between income, wealth, and longevity  among a cohort of older Americans, we used 1992 through 2014 data  from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative,  longitudinal survey that follows the same set of Americans from their 50s  through the remainder of their lives. Use of a longitudinal survey allows us  to follow changes for specific individuals as they age. We analyzed data  for the cohort of individuals born from 1931 through 1941.  We identified  the distribution of income across these individuals by constructing a  measure of mid-career earnings. This measure was constructed at the  household level and was based on the household\u2019s average annual  reported earnings when the household head was aged 41 to 50.  Household earnings data came from administrative records from the  Social Security Administration linked to survey responses.", "We then analyzed how the longevity of these individuals varied across  mid-career household earnings and demographic characteristics, such as  race and education level, using a technique called survival analysis. We  were able to measure deaths over a period of 22 years (1992 through  2014). Every 2 years, the HRS attempted to measure whether the original  respondents were still alive, but these longevity data were incomplete  because some of the original respondents declined to participate in later  waves of the survey. Once these respondents left the survey, their actual  longevity could not be followed. Survival analysis accounts for survey  respondents with complete or incomplete longevity data and allowed us to  estimate the chance of death by any given time in the observation period.  Most importantly, our analysis assumed actual longevity from 1992 to  2014 of the individuals in our analysis did not have a systematic  relationship with whether the original HRS respondents continued to  participate in the study except that leaving the study implied a later death.  We believe this assumption to be reasonable for the purpose of our  analysis for two reasons. First, a small percentage (8 percent) of the  original respondents dropped out of the survey, so that the impact of any  longevity differences among the population who dropped out would likely have been small. Second, while some baseline characteristics of  respondents do appear correlated with non-response over time, the  population that dropped out of the study does not appear to vary  significantly from those completing each wave, except for race and  ethnicity. We conducted this analysis, at the individual level, for HRS  respondents in 1992, and any spouses or partners also born in 1931  through 1941.", "We also used the HRS data and the mid-career household earnings  measure to compare trends in the distributions of income and wealth, at  the household level, as the cohort aged. We restricted this analysis to  survey respondents (\u201chousehold heads\u201d), or any spouses or partners as  of 1992, who were still alive in 2014 to ensure we followed the same  group of people throughout our analysis. This analysis included an  examination of trends by demographic characteristics and by specific  sources of income and wealth.", "For the purposes of our analysis, we defined wealth to be a household\u2019s  net worth\u2014that is, total assets minus total debt. Net worth is a measure  often used by researchers studying retirement security. As mentioned  above in our summary of how we examined the distribution of income and  wealth over time, older Americans may also have other future retirement  resources, not included in net worth, such as the present value of future  income expected from defined benefit (DB) pension plans and Social  Security. For all three questions, we supplemented analyses with expert  interviews and a literature review to provide greater insight. We  specifically identified researchers\u2019 explanations and theories about the  relationships between inequality and longevity, health status, gender,  race and ethnicity, or education.", "For all of the datasets used in our study, we reviewed documentation,  interviewed or obtained information from officials responsible for the data,  and tested the data for anomalies.

In 2018, about  53 million retirees and their families received $844.9 billion in Social  Security retirement benefits, according to the Social Security  Administration.  However, Social Security is facing financial difficulties  that, if not addressed, will affect its long-term stability. If no changes are  made, current projections indicate that by 2034, the retirement program  Trust Fund will only be sufficient to pay 77 percent of scheduled benefits.", "Employer-sponsored pensions include DB plans, which generally promise  to offer a monthly payment to retirees for life. Employers also sponsor  defined contribution (DC) plans, such as 401(k)s, in which individuals  accumulate tax-advantaged retirement savings in an individual account  based on employee and/or employer contributions, and the investment  returns (gains and losses) earned on the account. Participants in both DB  and DC plans receive certain tax preferences provided the plans comply  with requirements outlined in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). For fiscal  year 2018, estimated tax expenditures related to retirement plans and  savings amounted to about $188 billion.  The Employee Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) outlines minimum standards and  requirements that must be met by most private sector employer- sponsored retirement plans; it does not, however, require any employer to  establish, or continue to maintain, a retirement plan. Assets rolled over  from employer-sponsored DC plans when individuals change jobs or  retire are the primary source of funding for individual retirement accounts  (IRAs). Over the past 40 years, private sector employers have  increasingly moved from offering DB plans to offering DC plans. While DC  plans offer more portability, some financial risks\u2014such as poor  investment returns, decreases in interest rates, and increases in  longevity\u2014have shifted from the employer to the employee, with  important implications for individuals\u2019 retirement planning and security.", "Individual savings are any other non-retirement plan savings and  investments.

While all estimates produced using survey data are subject to some uncertainty,  our present value estimates for these additional retirement resources are also  subject to additional uncertainty that arises from using another data source\u2014the  Financial Accounts of the United States\u2014to create a measure of aggregate defined  benefit entitlements; having limited information about lifetime earnings in the  Survey of Consumer Finances; and making assumptions about life expectancy,  real discount rates, and retirement ages, which are unlikely to hold for all  households.

(See text box and app. I for  more on how we analyzed Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data on  this cohort.) However, this same cohort faced disparities in longevity.   Further, our analysis, as well as that of other researchers, found income  and wealth each have strong associations with longevity, as do certain  demographic characteristics, such as gender and race.  However, even  among those with multiple factors associated with a shorter life, such as  having lower mid-career earnings and not having attended college, a  significant proportion from our cohort were alive in 2014, when they were  in their 70s or early 80s. Taken all together, individuals may live a long  time, even individuals with factors associated with lower longevity, such  as low income or education. Those who live a long time and have little or  nothing in DC account balances or pension benefits may have to rely  primarily on Social Security or safety net programs.", "Analyzing Income, Wealth and Longevity  We examined the association of income and wealth with longevity in a nationally  representative sample of Americans born from 1931 through 1941. Throughout this  analysis, our references to \u201colder Americans\u201d and \u201chouseholds\u201d apply to that specific  subset of older Americans born from 1931 through 1941 and their households. The  Health and Retirement Study (HRS) began in 1992 and first surveyed these individuals  when they were 51 to 61 years old. The same individuals have been re-interviewed  every 2 years since, provided they continued to participate in the survey, and the most  recent complete data is from 2014, when those who were still alive were 73 to 83 years  old.  We were able to measure deaths over a period of 22 years (1992 through 2014). Every  2 years, the HRS attempted to measure whether the original respondents were still  alive, but these longevity data were incomplete because some of the original  respondents declined to participate in later waves of the survey. Once these  respondents left the survey, their actual longevity could not be followed.  Therefore, we used survival analysis to estimate the proportion of individuals in the1992  sample alive in 2014. Survival analysis accounts for survey respondents with complete  or incomplete longevity data and allowed us to estimate the chance of death by any  given time in the observation period. Most importantly, our analysis assumed actual  longevity from 1992 to 2014 of the individuals in our analysis did not have a systematic  relationship with whether the original HRS respondents continued to participate in the  study except that leaving the study implied a later death. We believe this assumption to  be reasonable for the purpose of our analysis for two reasons. First, a small percentage  (8 percent) of the original respondents dropped out of the survey, so that the impact of  any longevity differences among the population who dropped out would likely have  been small. Second, while some baseline characteristics of respondents do appear  correlated with non-response over time, the population that dropped out of the study  does not appear to vary significantly from those completing each wave, except for race  and ethnicity. We conducted this analysis, at the individual level, for HRS respondents  in 1992, and any spouses or partners also born in 1931 through 1941. Additional details  and caveats to this analysis are available in appendix I.  We broke the sample into quintiles based on their income or wealth. To determine an  individual\u2019s place in the income distribution, we measured mid-career household  earnings using administrative records from the Social Security Administration that are  linked to the HRS data. Specifically, we defined mid-career household earnings based  on average annual earnings reported to the Social Security Administration for years  when the survey respondent we identified as the household head was ages 41 to 50 as  well as the earnings of their spouse or partner during those years if the respondent was  part of a couple in 1992. This measure of earnings provides a relatively stable indicator  of the household\u2019s labor market experience, compared to using a single year of  earnings, which could be unusually high or low. For wealth, we used the household\u2019s  initial net worth in 1992, including any balances in defined contribution accounts or  individual retirement accounts, but excluding second homes, which HRS did not  consistently capture in all years. In both instances, the sample was broken into  quintiles. For additional details on our methodology, see appendix I.", "Overall, an estimated 63 percent of the individuals in our sample were  alive in 2014 (ages 73 to 83), and greater levels of income and wealth  were associated with greater longevity in our analysis of HRS data.  For  income, an estimated 52 percent of individuals from households in the  bottom quintile of the mid-career earnings distribution were alive in 2014,  compared to an estimated 74 percent of individuals from households in  the top quintile. (See fig. 12.) The percentages by wealth quintile were  similar.  Other researchers have similarly found that greater levels of  income and wealth are associated with greater longevity. For example, a  researcher at the Social Security Administration has established that men  with higher earnings had seen greater gains in longevity than those with  lower earnings.", "Understanding the association among income, wealth, and longevity is  complicated because of relationships among the characteristics, as well  as their relationships with demographic characteristics (see text box).  Besides income and wealth, several demographic characteristics were  also associated with longevity in our analysis of HRS data, and these  relationships have also been noted in other researchers\u2019 studies.", "Women tended to live longer than men: Women had greater longevity  through 2014, with an estimated 69 percent living to at least ages 73  to 83 compared to an estimated 58 percent of men.", "Non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics tended to live longer than blacks:  For Hispanics, an estimated 68 percent lived to at least 2014, as did  an estimated 65 percent of non-Hispanic whites, compared to an  estimated 52 percent of non-Hispanic blacks.", "More educated individuals tended to live longer than those with less  education: An estimated 75 percent of college graduates lived to at  least 2014, compared to an estimated 65 percent of those who  graduated from high school and an estimated 50 percent of those with  less than a high school diploma or GED.", "Individuals who self-reported being in good health tended to live  longer than those who reported being less healthy: Among those who  self-reported being in excellent health in 1992, an estimated 78  percent lived to at least 2014, compared to an estimated 31 percent of  those who reported being in poor health.", "Income, Wealth, and Demographics Are Interrelated  The relationships of income, wealth, and demographics with longevity are complex  because of interactions among these characteristics themselves, which make it difficult  to determine the direction or extent of causality. For example, there are many potential  interactions among educational status, income, and wealth. Higher levels of education  could provide access to better job opportunities, increasing income. Education could  contribute to greater financial literacy and better financial decision making, increasing  wealth. Having access to wealth could make it easier to attain additional education.", "While income, wealth, and education all are associated with longevity, it is difficult to  interpret their individual associations with longevity because of their possible  interactions with each other.", "We estimated that individuals whose households were in the top two  quintiles (top 40 percent) of the mid-career earnings distribution were  more likely than their counterparts in the bottom 60 percent to be alive in  2014 (ages 73 to 83) in an analysis controlling for race and ethnicity,  gender, age, education level, and initial self-reported health status on  entry into HRS in 1992.  In a similar analysis, we found that individuals  from households in the top quintile (top 20 percent) of wealth in 1992  were more likely to be alive than their counterparts in the bottom four  quintiles. Our findings are consistent with the work of other researchers  who also controlled for such factors. However, such observational studies  are only able to demonstrate that a statistical association exists between  two characteristics. For example, one study that found a strong  association between income and life expectancy specifically notes that  unmeasured factors likely affect the association.  Similarly, we cannot  determine from our analysis the extent to which income or wealth causes  differences in longevity.", "Even among individuals with characteristics associated with decreased  longevity, a substantial proportion of older Americans lived at least into  their 70s or early 80s, according to our analysis of 1992 to 2014 HRS  data. For example, we constructed three scenarios to illustrate how  longevity varies for those with different mid-career earnings and  education.  Among those in the \u201cbottom\u201d scenario\u2013those individuals who  had no college education and were from households in the bottom 20  percent of the earnings distribution\u2013an estimated 50 percent were still  alive in 2014 (see fig. 13).  We estimated that the corresponding  percentages for our \u201cmiddle\u201d scenario and \u201ctop\u201d scenario were 65 percent and 80 percent, respectively, of individuals still alive in 2014. Thus, even  among those with education and earnings associated with lower  longevity, a significant proportion, 50 percent, were still alive in 2014, and  these individuals will need to provide for themselves through their  remaining years.  We also analyzed a subset of our bottom scenario that  included those who had no college education and were from households  in the bottom 20 percent of the earnings distribution and whose self- reported health status was fair or poor. While the percentage of the  individuals who survived was lower, an estimated 39 percent were alive in  2014, which is a substantial proportion.", "Most individuals have the potential for an unexpectedly long life, including  individuals with demographic characteristics associated with lower  longevity, income or wealth.

Taken all together, individuals may live a long time and face financial  challenges in their later years, including those with less income and  wealth.  For example, of the individuals in the bottom group of our scenarios illustrating the effects of earnings and education on longevity,  an estimated 50 percent were still alive in 2014.

We defined wealth as net worth. Data  limitations prevented us from producing estimates of the present value of future income  expected from Social Security or defined benefit pensions. The heads of households  we analyzed were from the original HRS cohort and were born in 1931 to 1941. If  neither the head of household or the spouse or partner interviewed in 1992 was still  alive in 2014, their household was not included in our sample.

By 2014,  only 25 percent of the top earnings group still had work-related earnings,  and Social Security provided the highest median value of all income  sources.  Among households in the bottom mid-career earnings group,  68 percent had work-related earnings in 1992, and 15 percent continued  to have work-related earnings in 2014. Similarly, work-related earnings  provided the greatest source of income for these households in 1992, and  Social Security provided the highest median value of all income sources  for these households in 2014. However, concerns about retirement  insecurity for those with lower earnings may remain. Social Security is  progressive, meaning it replaces a higher percentage of income for those  with lower earnings, but the formula for calculating Social Security  benefits provides a higher benefit amount to those with higher lifetime  earnings. In addition, those households with higher mid-career earnings  maintained relatively higher income in retirement, perhaps due to their  having higher levels of other types of non-wage income after retiring.

However, while wealth increased from 1992 to 2006, this was  followed by declines in wealth from 2006 to 2014.  Looking at the overall  time period of our analysis, wealth disparities persisted between  households in the top earnings groups and households in the bottom  earnings groups.

Other researchers have found that that some households may  not spend down their wealth as much during retirement due to factors  including a generally higher propensity to save, a desire to leave  bequests, and the desire to self-insure against medical costs.", "Households in the top 20 percent of mid-career earnings had greater  participation in retirement accounts (see sidebar) and increased home  equity relative to other households, which may have contributed to wealth  disparities over the time period of our analysis.", "Retirement Accounts.  Among households that had retirement  accounts, the median value of retirement accounts increased for all of  our income groups (see fig. 16); however, the continued wealth  disparities between higher- and lower-earning households may be  due to significant differences in the value of retirement accounts and  in household participation. The value of retirement accounts for  households in the top and bottom earnings groups increased  substantially between 1992 and 2014 (a 93 percent and 138 percent  increase, respectively). Some of the increase in retirement account  balances over time may be due to contributions to DC plans and IRAs  during years in which individuals worked, as well as waiting until age  70 \u00bd, when many individuals are required to take minimum  distributions from their IRAs.  Despite this potential for gains in  account balances across the distribution, disparities still exist. In 2014,  among households that had retirement accounts, we estimated that  households in the top 20 percent had about three times more in their  retirement accounts compared to households in the bottom 20 percent  (about $176,000 compared to about $54,000). Higher-earning  households may not spend down their retirement account balances as  much in retirement whereas lower-earning households may have  spent down all or part of their account balances. In addition to having  more in their retirement accounts, a greater percentage of households  in the top earnings group had retirement accounts compared to  households in the bottom earnings group. For example, in 2014, an  estimated 69 percent of households in the top 20 percent had  retirement accounts compared to an estimated 19 percent of  households in the bottom 20 percent.", "Home equity.

In  general, our analysis was done for respondents and spouses/partners  separately at the individual level, and estimates were combined to create  household totals. We generally followed methods presented in an 2016  paper entitled \u201cIs the U.S. Retirement System Contributing to Rising  Wealth Inequality?\u201d by Devlin-Foltz, Henriques, and Sabelhaus (see  bibliography for the full citation), but made some changes in the  assumptions given our specific focus on older Americans.", "In order to estimate the present value of income expected from DB plans  at the household-level, we started with the aggregate value of accrued  DB benefits by survey year from the FA. Following Devlin-Foltz et al.  (2016), we calculated aggregate DB pension entitlements as the portion  of total pension entitlements not found in DC assets and annuities held in  IRAs at life insurance companies. Then, we allocated aggregate DB  entitlements across households in a series of steps, ultimately splitting  the aggregate DB entitlements between SCF respondents who were  already receiving benefits and those who were covered by DB plans but  were not yet receiving benefits.", "In the first step of the allocation, we estimated the present value of  promised DB benefits for current DB beneficiaries. The present value of  promised DB benefits for those already receiving benefits was based on  the reported values for DB benefits in the SCF, life tables from SSA, and  an assumed 3 percent real discount rate. After solving for the present  value of promised DB benefits for those currently receiving benefits, we  subtracted the total amount of DB benefits promised to current DB  beneficiaries from the aggregate DB assets to solve for the share to be  distributed to future DB beneficiaries. By doing this, we effectively  assumed that current DB beneficiaries had first claim to DB pension  assets. We allocated the remaining DB assets to future DB recipients by  assigning each future DB beneficiary a share of the amount of the  residual of aggregate DB entitlements (left over after current beneficiaries  claimed their share) based on their earnings, the number of years they  participated in a DB plan, their expected retirement age as stated in the  SCF, and a 3 percent real discount rate.", "We also estimated the present value of expected future Social Security  benefits for current and future Social Security beneficiaries, using  information from the SCF on Social Security benefits for current Social  Security beneficiaries and earnings information for future Social Security  beneficiaries.", "With respect to current Social Security beneficiaries, we solved for the  present value of Social Security benefits using annual Social Security  benefits as reported in the SCF, life tables from SSA, and an assumed 3  percent real discount rate, consistent with our DB analysis. For future  Social Security beneficiaries, we used current earnings or earnings from  the longest job held as reported in the SCF as the basis for the Social  Security benefit. Given that our analysis focused on older Americans, we  assumed that future Social Security beneficiaries were close enough to  retirement that the earnings information in the SCF provided a reasonable  proxy for lifetime earnings. We created a monthly average of these  earnings, which we used as a simplified version of the average indexed  monthly earnings (AIME). We used these thresholds to compute  something similar to the primary insurance amount (PIA) by assigning 90  percent of earnings up to the first bend point, 32 percent of earnings  between the first and second bend points, and 15 percent of earnings  between the second bend point and the monthly taxable maximum.  We  assumed everyone who was not yet receiving benefits but would in the  future started collecting benefits at 62 or at their current age if older than  62. We applied benefit rules associated with each individual\u2019s birth year to  the PIA as set by the Social Security Administration and made  adjustments for spousal benefits. We estimated the present value of  Social Security benefits for future beneficiaries using the estimated PIA, a  retirement age of 62 or their current age if older than 62 and not yet  receiving benefits, life tables from SSA, and a 3 percent real discount  rate.", "While adding these present value estimates to wealth better captures the  totality of resources available to older Americans, our estimates of the  present value of income from future DB and Social Security benefits are  subject to uncertainty and should be interpreted with caution. For  example, our estimates of the present value of DB benefits for future  beneficiaries are not based on SCF respondent-reported expected DB  benefits. Instead, we used the aggregate DB entitlements in the FA data  and allocated that amount across households with DB plans. We followed  this method, in part, because it appears that workers do not have a good  understanding of their pension plan parameters and confuse DB benefits  with other types of payouts in the SCF data, according to Devlin-Foltz et  al. (2016).", "Moreover, our estimates of the present value of Social Security benefits  for future beneficiaries are not based on lifetime earnings since the SCF  does not collect all of the inputs needed to project Social Security benefits  for respondent-families. However, it is possible to get a sense of the  distributional impact of Social Security by focusing on those near  retirement in certain points in time.", "A general limitation of our analysis of the present value of future income  from DB pensions and Social Security is that our estimates rely on  assumptions about life expectancy, real discount rates, and retirement  ages, which are unlikely to hold for all households. As a result, we  conducted some sensitivity analyses, particularly with respect to real  discount rates and retirement ages.", "For both the DB and Social Security sensitivity analyses, we varied the  real discount rate given the uncertainty about future interest rates. In  general, higher discount rates result in lower estimated present values, so  our estimates of the present value of future DB and Social Security  benefits are sensitive to the assumptions about the discount rate. This is  especially important in the DB analysis, as changing the assumed  discount rate affects the allocation of aggregate DB assets between  current and future DB beneficiaries. For example, using a 2 percent real  discount rate, as opposed to a 3 percent real discount rate, yielded a  higher allocation of aggregate DB assets for current beneficiaries  compared to our baseline estimates. Using a 4 percent real discount rate,  as opposed to 3 percent, generated a higher allocation of aggregate DB  assets for future DB beneficiaries relative to our baseline estimates.", "For future beneficiaries, we had to make assumptions regarding the  respondent and spouse/partner\u2019s retirement age. For the DB analysis, we  used the SCF-reported expected retirement age, given that our focus is  older Americans, and older people not yet claiming benefits are relatively  close to retirement. Given these assumptions, we also did the analysis  assuming that all future DB beneficiaries retired at 62 and 65. Assuming  different retirement ages can change the amount of the share of  aggregate DB assets allocated to individual future DB beneficiaries in the  SCF. For the Social Security analysis, we generally assumed that future  Social Security beneficiaries retired at 62, in part because a sizeable  proportion of people claim Social Security at 62, despite increases in the  full retirement age. In addition, according to Devlin-Foltz et al. (2016),  assuming a low retirement age decreases the present value of benefits  directly if the reductions for early retirement are not actuarially fair, and  indirectly if the individual were to keep working at a high enough income  to increase their average indexed monthly earnings. Agency officials  raised technical concerns about choosing age 62. It is possible that  setting the retirement age at 62 may overstate the present value of future  Social Security benefits, depending on various factors including interest  rates and mortality. We considered using alternative retirement ages and  do not believe that choosing a different retirement age for those not yet  retired would substantively change our findings.", "Alternative methods to using present value estimates of future income  expected from Social Security and DB pensions for analyzing  distributional disparities in retirement security exist. For example, one  option would be to evaluate how future monthly income from Social  Security and DB pensions would be expected to affect retirement  security, perhaps by assessing how the standard of living for workers  would be expected to change. Additionally, disparities in health in  adulthood could contribute to subsequent disparities in income and  wealth at older ages. However, for our analysis, it was useful to estimate  the present value of Social Security and DB pensions so we could  compare the value of these sources to retirement account balances.

However, this report  needed adjusted household weights for all 12 waves and adjusted  respondent weights for wave 1.

First, we  had the benefit of many variables with which to model the propensity of  non-linkage. Second, weighting class adjustments, which involve creating  mutually exclusive classes based on the variables associated with non- linkage, were not feasible because of the large number of variables we  included in the adjustment. The number of respondents per cell would be  too small. Third, the propensity score adjustment allows us to consider  many variables at the same time.

HRS does not contain administrative  data on income sources besides earnings and Social Security benefits.  Moreover, for years before 1978, the administrative earnings records are  only available for earnings covered by Social Security and below the  taxable maximum. Finally, not all sources of earnings are covered by  Social Security. While around 96 percent of employment is currently  covered by Social Security, this has not always been the case.

We also estimated  survivorship across the demographic and health-related variables.", "Moreover, using the Cox proportional hazards regression models, we  analyzed the relationship between income and longevity and wealth and  longevity, controlling for related demographic and health-related  variables, as well as age at the beginning of the survey. These  regressions allow the relationships between various characteristics and death to be described as hazard ratios. For example, hazard ratios that  are statistically significant and greater than 1.00 indicate that individuals  with those characteristics are more likely to die during the survey period  compared to a reference group. Hazard ratios that are statistically  significant and less than 1.00 indicate that individuals with those  characteristics are less likely to die in the study period compared to a  reference group.", "We estimated survivorship among individuals with the following  characteristics in combination: bottom income (earnings) quintile and no  college; middle of the income (earnings) distribution (third quintile) and  high school diploma or some college (excluding GED); and top of the  income (earnings) distribution and college diploma. We then ran a subset  of these scenarios using different combinations of self-reported health  status for each of the three main scenarios. For example, we estimated  survivorship among individuals in the bottom income (earnings) quintile,  who had not attended college, and reported being in fair or poor health in  1992.", "Our results have limitations and should be interpreted with caution.  Results from the survival analysis present correlations, not causal  estimates. Moreover, while our main analysis includes self-reported  health status at the beginning of the study period, we also excluded this  variable as a sensitivity check given the interconnectedness of income,  wealth, and health and the conclusions were similar. Furthermore, due to  limitations with respect to the mortality data in later years of the HRS, we  did not have specific months and years of death for 60 respondents we  know died during the observation period due to death indicators in the  interview status variables from HRS. As a result, we imputed their death  dates based on the survey year they were indicated to have died in from  the HRS interview status questions. While death is continuous in the  sense that it can happen to any person at any time, we only observe  death within a given month for those with death dates in the data, and  only within a year for those whose death information we gathered for the  interview status variables. As a sensitivity check, we redid the analysis  using survival information at the person-year level and discrete survival  analysis techniques and found similar results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analyzing How Income and Wealth Change as Older Americans Aged", "paragraphs": ["This section describes how we used the HRS to determine how the  distributions of income and wealth change as older Americans in the  original HRS cohort aged."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Definitions and Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["We focused this analysis on the original HRS cohort (born 1931-1941).

Also,  RAND HRS variables on income and wealth are presented at the  household level. When necessary, we combined respondent and spouse  or partner level variables we used from the public-use file in order to  obtain household-level variables. We restricted this analysis to survey  respondents (\u201chousehold heads\u201d), or any spouses or partners, who were  still alive in 2014 to ensure we followed the same group of people  throughout our analysis.

Our analysis included  survey respondents (heads of households) or their spouses or partners  who responded to the survey in 1992 and were still alive and responded  in 2014, which is the most recent year for which the data are complete.  The heads of households we analyzed were from the original HRS cohort  and were born in 1931 to 1941. If neither the head of household or the  spouse or partner interviewed in 1992 was still alive in 2014, their  household was not included in our sample.", "In order to do so, we estimated median levels of household wealth and  income every 2 years for each earnings group, as well as median levels  for specific sources of income and wealth. We estimated the percentage  changes and absolute changes in median wealth and income for each  earnings group from 1992 through 2014 in order to determine whether  income or wealth levels increased or decreased over time. For specific  sources of income and wealth, we estimated medians for all households  in each earnings group as well as for only those households which  reported having the specific source of income or wealth. For example, we  determined the median home equity for all households in each earnings  group as well as the median home equity for only those households with  home equity for each earnings group. Finally, we calculated the percent  of our sample having each type of wealth and income (e.g. home equity,  Social Security benefits) for each year in the data. As a sensitivity check,  we also analyzed how total assets and income changed for the HRS\u2019s  \u201cWar Babies\u201d cohort (born 1942-1947). For this analysis, we report 99  percent confidence intervals alongside the percentage or other numerical  estimates.
