While the majority of NASA air travel is on commercial airlines, NASA employees took at least 1,188 flights using NASA passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Use of NASA passenger aircraft services can save time, provide more flexibility to meet senior executives' schedules, and provide other less tangible and quantifiable benefits. However, GAO's analysis of available reported data related to NASA passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 showed NASA reported costs were nearly $25 million compared with estimated commercial airline coach transportation costs of about $5 million. Further, this relative cost comparison, based on available NASA reported costs, did not take into account all applicable types of costs associated with its passenger aircraft services, including, for example, depreciation associated with the estimated $14 million NASA paid in 2001 to acquire several aircraft used for passenger transportation. Consequently, NASA's passenger air transportation services are much more costly than indicated by available data. Further, NASA is currently considering additional expenditures of about $77 million to upgrade and expand its existing passenger fleet. NASA's ownership of aircraft used to provide passenger transportation conflicts with federal policy allowing agencies to own aircraft only as needed to meet specified mission requirements, such as prisoner transportation and aeronautical research. GAO's analysis of NASA passenger aircraft flights for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 showed that an estimated 86 percent--about seven out of every eight flights--were taken to support routine business operations specifically prohibited by federal policy regarding aircraft ownership, including routine site visits, meetings, speeches, and conferences. Further, agencywide oversight and management of its passenger aircraft services was not effective. NASA's ability to make informed decisions on continued ownership of its passenger aircraft fleet and on flight-by-flight justifications was impaired by the lack of reliable agencywide data on aircraft costs and other weak management oversight practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since its creation in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) has owned and operated a small fleet of aircraft to  provide passenger transportation.

While NASA may continue to require access to some  mission-required passenger aircraft services for which commercial airlines  would not be a viable alternative, assuming that all prior flight hours were  mission required without first examining the purpose for these flights is not  consistent with the OMB guidance.", "In addition to NASA-owned aircraft, as discussed previously, NASA  obtained passenger aircraft services through interagency agreements with  DOD and FAA, and a fractional ownership pilot demonstration contract  with Flexjet.  These alternative approaches offer ready access to passenger  aircraft without the fixed cost investment and the need to fund aircraft  maintenance, pilot training, and other costs associated with aircraft  ownership.  For example, under NASA\u2019s contract with Flexjet, NASA had  guaranteed availability to passenger air transportation services.    Specifically, the contract with Flexjet allowed NASA to schedule flights  with a minimum of 8 hours advance notice.  According to a NASA  contractor\u2019s December 2004 study, such arrangements to obtain passenger  transportation services provide a cost-effective alternative to agency  ownership of aircraft when demand is highly variable or less than 150 to  200 hours a year.   Such flexible arrangements could provide NASA with  quick-turnaround access to air passenger transportation services, and  appear to have the ability to have met NASA\u2019s limited mission-required  needs during the period of our review.", "Further, NASA has not performed any A-76 studies for three of its aircraft  that were used as passenger aircraft.  NASA purchased two Gulfstream II  aircraft in 2001 as contingency backups to, and eventual replacements for,  its existing shuttle trainer aircraft fleet.  However, since purchasing the  aircraft, NASA has been using these aircraft as part of its passenger aircraft  services fleet.  Subsequent changes in NASA\u2019s long-term strategy for space  flight now show that shuttles will not be used after about 2010.  As a result,  the continuing mission-required need to retain these aircraft is  questionable.", "In its 1995 and 1999 reports, the NASA IG expressed concern over NASA\u2019s  exclusion of commercial airline transportation from its A-76 studies.  In  both reports, the IG reported that the A-76 studies NASA management  performed with respect to its passenger aircraft improperly excluded a cost  comparison with commercial airlines.  While the IG recommended that  NASA program offices responsible for passenger aircraft operations  perform A-76 studies to include consideration of accomplishing air travel  needs using commercial airlines, NASA management contended that  because of isolated travel destinations and extremely short advance notice,  commercial airlines could not meet its travel needs.  However, our analysis  of available documentation supporting flights taken during fiscal years  2003 and 2004 shows that most were requested more than 24 hours in  advance of flight departure and most NASA centers are located within an  hour\u2019s drive of commercial airports."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ineffective Oversight and Management of Passenger Aircraft Services", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s oversight and management controls over its passenger aircraft  operations were ineffective.

Although each center that possesses and manages  passenger aircraft is required to maintain a flight justification and manifest  for each trip, the flight usage data contained in these documents are not  compiled or analyzed on an agencywide basis to support decisions related  to mission-required needs.  Specifically, NASA data on the purposes and  costs of its passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004  were contained in paper flight justifications and manifests maintained at  six different locations.  We created a database of descriptive cost and usage  data for approximately 1,200 flights using NASA-owned or -chartered  aircraft for which sufficiently complete data were available.  Although, as  mentioned previously, we obtained evidence that NASA also utilized at  least two additional program support aircraft to meet its passenger air  transportation needs, the limited data on use and costs associated with  flights using these aircraft did not allow us to include data on these flights  in our database.  Further, data on passenger aircraft services for about 200  flights at one center was missing most of the data elements on the flight  request justification forms, including flight purpose and cost-justification  calculations.  Without agencywide data on flight purposes and costs related  to its passenger aircraft services, NASA managers and Congress lack  critical information they need to make key aircraft ownership decisions.", "In addition to the limited agencywide usage and cost data, we also found  that the data provided by NASA, although certified by NASA management  as complete and accurate, were not always complete or accurate.  Our  comparison of NASA-supplied data on flights taken in fiscal years 2003 and  2004 with FAA data showed that (1) data on 97 passenger flights were not  included in the aircraft usage data NASA certified as complete; and (2) as  discussed in a subsequent section, NASA-supplied data did not always  include all legs of trips taken using NASA passenger aircraft.  After our  identification of the flights, while not complete in all cases, NASA was able  to provide some form of supporting documentation showing these flights  occurred, including proof of authorization, approval, or a determination of  cost effectiveness.

In addition, NASA\u2019s individual flight cost justification process for  its passenger aircraft services was flawed.  Our analysis of cost-comparison  documentation supporting passenger aircraft flights taken during fiscal  years 2003 and 2004 revealed critical flaws, including variable cost data  that were 6 years out of date and unsupported cost factors.  Available  NASA documentation supporting NASA\u2019s individual flight justifications for  flights taken during 2003 and 2004 showed a total estimated savings of $6  million over the 2-year period.  However, if these justifications had included  up-to-date NASA variable costs and excluded unsupported cost factors  attributed to the additional time required to use commercial airline flights,  most flights would not have been approved because they would have been  more costly than commercial air travel.", "Policy guidance in OMB Circular A-126 provides an agency may use aircraft  on a flight-by-flight approval basis for routine business purposes to the  extent that a comparison between the agency\u2019s specified variable costs and  the costs of commercial travel shows the proposed flight is cost effective.", "Specifically, OMB Circular A-126, Attachment A, provides that costs of  commercial travel must be compared with the variable costs of operating  the agencies\u2019 passenger aircraft and that proposed flights using agencies\u2019  passenger aircraft for routine business purposes should only be approved if  they result in a cost savings to the government. Further, OMB guidance  provides that variable cost estimates used in flight-by-flight cost  justification calculations are to be updated annually.  This policy on flight- by-flight variable cost justification does not replace the agencies\u2019 need to  first establish a valid mission requirement for owning aircraft, and overall  cost effectiveness.  As discussed previously, our analysis of flight purposes  showed that about seven of every eight flights were for routine business  travel.", "Consistent with OMB policy guidance, NASA regulations provide that  individual cost justifications comparing estimated commercial airline  travel costs with estimated variable costs associated with using NASA- owned or -chartered aircraft should be prepared prior to all passenger  aircraft flights.  Figure 4 provides an overview of the methodology NASA  used to compare NASA and commercial costs for its flight-by-flight  justifications. vs.", "2.5 (multiplier)", "Several NASA centers had not updated the variable costs used in their  flight-by-flight cost-comparison calculations for over 6 years.  Such out-of- date variable costs significantly understated NASA\u2019s flight-by-flight costs.   For example, at two centers, the $964 variable cost per flight hour used for  flight-by-flight justifications during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 was over 6  years out of date.  According to NASA aircraft management officials, this  hourly rate was last adjusted in 1998.  At one center, a recent recalculation,  done in 2005 pursuant to our audit, increased the center\u2019s variable cost rate  from $964 to $1828 an hour, almost a 90 percent increase.  Further, even  this 90 percent higher rate may understate NASA\u2019s actual variable costs.   For example, the aircraft manufacturer for the aircraft in use at that center  reported a direct cost per flight hour rate of approximately $3,000 a flight  hour, including estimated fuel costs alone in excess of $1,300 an hour.", "NASA variable costs were also understated at one center because the flight- by-flight justifications included only variable cost estimates for one round  trip when the aircraft actually made two round trips to meet passengers\u2019  transportation requirements.  Our analysis of FAA flight information and  flight documentation obtained from the center showed that the flight  request data we were provided included estimates related to only two of  four flight legs flown to complete 14 flight requests over the 2-year period  of our review.  For example, on August 6, 2003, NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft  transported passengers from Houston, Texas, to Pueblo, Colorado, and  then returned without passengers to Houston the same day.  Three days  later, pilots flew an empty aircraft to Pueblo to pick up passengers and  return them to Houston.  Center officials stated that additional round trips  were necessary to return the flight crew to their home station where they  could be more productive performing other duties.  Center officials stated  that they did not include the two extra flight legs in their calculations of the  variable costs associated with NASA\u2019s passenger transportation because  they classified these legs as crew training flights.  Nonetheless, the costs  incurred by these additional flights should be considered among the costs  related to NASA\u2019s passenger air transportation services.", "In addition to understatements of NASA\u2019s variable costs, NASA\u2019s flight-by- flight cost comparisons were also flawed in that they increased the cost  associated with flying commercially by using a largely unsupported  multiplier of 2.5.  NASA could not provide any specific NASA-related  empirical evidence to validate use of the multiplier in its flight-by-flight  justification process.  NASA used this multiplier in addition to factors for  time and salary costs accounted for in its cost-justification calculation.  The  use of a multiplier to increase the value of an employee\u2019s time beyond his or  her salary and fringe benefits is not expressly provided as part of OMB\u2019s  Circular No. A-126 guidance.  Further, cognizant OMB officials told us that  it was not their intent that agencies use any such multiplier (beyond the  salary and fringe benefits associated with any time savings) in determining  whether proposed flights were cost effective.  They also stated they were  not aware of any agencies using such a multiplier in their flight justification  calculations.  While NASA officials informed us that they had been using  this multiplier for a number of years and that they believed it was a  conservative factor, they did not provide any documentation demonstrating  the appropriateness of the multiplier as it applies specifically to the  experiences of NASA personnel who used these aircraft.  Consequently,  lacking such documentation, NASA\u2019s use of a 2.5 multiplier improperly  overstates the costs of commercial alternatives.", "The overall effect of understating NASA costs and overstating commercial  costs in NASA\u2019s flight-by-flight justifications was that NASA incorrectly  approved individual flights as cost effective.  For example, NASA justified  one round trip from Kennedy Space Center, FL to Burbank, CA as cost  effective, calculating a savings of $4,800.  NASA calculated a cost savings  for the flight because it used a 1998-based variable cost factor for the NASA  plane of $964 per hour and also multiplied the travelers\u2019 salary costs  savings by the unsupported 2.5 multiplier.  If the variable cost was updated  to NASA\u2019s 2004 estimate of $2,528 per hour for that aircraft and the  unsupported multiplier was removed, the estimated variable costs  associated with the proposed NASA passenger aircraft flight would have  exceeded estimated commercial airline costs by $17,408.  Further, even  after incorporating NASA\u2019s unsupported estimate that employee fringe  benefits increase employee direct salary costs by an additional 50 percent,  the NASA aircraft variable costs for this flight would still have exceeded  commercial costs by about $16,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Procedures Not Effective in Consistently Identifying and Collecting Reimbursements from Nonofficial Travelers", "paragraphs": ["NASA lacks procedures to consistently and effectively identify and recover  the applicable costs of operating government aircraft when nonofficial  passengers fly on NASA-owned or -chartered aircraft.

We reviewed  aircraft utilization and management reports prepared by NASA and its  contractor and aircraft operations budget/cost information, including  annual Aviation Financial Reports for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, Annual  Aviation Report: Aircraft Performance for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, and  NASA\u2019s 2004 Mission Management Aircraft Fleet Plan.  At each center, we  observed and assessed the process for managing passenger aircraft  services and scheduling and justifying costs for individual flights.  We also  reviewed available documentation supporting the various cost-justification  factors and multipliers NASA used to estimate the variable costs of using  its passenger aircraft as well as the alternative costs of using commercial  airline transportation.", "As part of our effort, we collected and compiled available flight-by-flight  NASA passenger aircraft cost and usage data from NASA mission  management aircraft request forms.  These forms provided such  descriptive data as dates and purpose for travel, itinerary, passengers,  levels of approval, and cost justification for aircraft use.  We asked for all  documentation maintained at NASA centers for flights flown using NASA\u2019s  passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004.  We selected  the most recently completed 2-year period because NASA\u2019s regulations  specify retaining source documents related to passenger aircraft usage for  at least 2 years.  While incomplete, we ultimately obtained some type of  documentation indicating that NASA passenger aircraft services during this  2-year period included about 1,500 flights.  However, because of the limited  amount of supporting documentation available for several hundred flights,  we included only 1,188 flights in our analysis.  For example, we could not  use any of the approximate 200 flights from the Dryden Flight Research  Center in our analysis because few of the requested documents included all  the required usage and cost data necessary for such an analysis.  To  independently verify the reliability and completeness of individual flight  source documentation maintained at NASA centers, we compared the  NASA-provided flight information with information on NASA aircraft  flights maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA)  Enhanced Traffic Management System and reconciled differences.  Further,  while not included in our analysis, we obtained documentation showing  that 2 of NASA\u2019s aircraft classified as program support aircraft were also  used to provide passenger transportation, we did not attempt to determine  if any of NASA\u2019s other program support or research aircraft may have also  been used to provide passenger transportation as part of this audit.  Also,  we did not review the effectiveness of safety or maintenance programs  related to NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft services.", "To analyze the relative costs of NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft services  compared to commercial airline costs, we relied primarily on available  NASA cost data from NASA Aviation Financial Reports.  We validated this  data wherever feasible with comparable independent data sources  including industry data.  For example, we contacted the manufacturers of  both types of passenger aircraft used by NASA to validate that the cost  estimates used in our analysis were similar to the manufacturers\u2019 cost  metrics for operating those aircraft.  We used fiscal year 2003 and 2004 cost  data in annual Aviation Financial Reports reported by each center that  operated one or more of NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft and the costs NASA  incurred for chartering passenger aircraft from other government agencies  or contractors.  At one center where reported cost data for passenger  aircraft in the Aviation Financial Report were combined with data for other  agency aircraft, we used annual budget data that were limited to passenger  aircraft operations.  At NASA headquarters, we used annual cost data  provided by NASA because their annual Aviation Financial Reports did not  contain costs associated with NASA\u2019s use of Federal Aviation  Administration aircraft.  Finally, costs from NASA\u2019s Report on the  Fractional Aircraft Demonstration Program were used to determine the  total cost of Flexjet flights.  We used NASA Mission Management Aircraft  Request forms to determine the estimated cost for flights taken on  Department of Defense (DOD) aircraft.  We then compared reported costs  of NASA aircraft operations and aircraft charter costs with our estimates of  travel costs that NASA would have incurred had the passengers who flew  on NASA\u2019s aircraft during our 2-year test period used commercial airline  transportation instead.  To estimate the commercial transportation costs of  NASA employees who traveled using NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft, we used  the average commercial airline round-trip fare of $426 for all flights flown  by NASA employees during this same time period as reported in a database  of travel card transactions for NASA provided by NASA\u2019s contractor, Bank of America.  This average commercial round-trip air fare estimate is  intended to approximate NASA\u2019s passenger transportation costs if it had  used commercial airline services instead of its own services.  As such, it  may reflect amounts that in some cases would exceed NASA\u2019s actual  commercial costs.  For example, to the extent to which unofficial travelers  were included in estimates of passengers, commercial costs would be  overstated.  Conversely, in other cases our estimate may have  underestimated NASA\u2019s costs.  For example, costs may have been  understated to the extent that such travel involved passenger aircraft  services to remote locations or locations with limited commercial air  service.", "To determine the number of travelers who flew on NASA-owned and  -chartered aircraft during the 2-year period, we used the number of  passengers identified on individual hard-copy flight manifest  documentation NASA provided to us.  During the course of our review, we  became aware of additional flights flown at some centers for which we  were not provided flight manifest documentation.  However, we were  unable to obtain and analyze documentation for these additional flights in  time to complete our analysis.  To the extent that the number of passengers  on flights for which individual flight documentation was not provided to us,  the estimate of commercial airfare costs is understated.  At the Dryden  Flight Research Center, where individual hard-copy flight documentation  did not contain complete information, we used the number of passengers  the center reported to NASA headquarters for inclusion in annual aircraft  performance reports.", "We did not use the numbers of passengers reported for all centers because  the centers reported their passenger counts inconsistently and we were  unable to validate them.  Although the number of passengers reported on  individual flight manifests often included passengers who flew only one  way or on one or more legs of the trip, we counted these partial-trip  passengers as having flown round-trip for purposes of estimating the  commercial costs of passengers flown on NASA\u2019s aircraft.  Consequently, in  this respect, our estimated savings are likely to be understated in that  including these partial-trip passengers in the total number of passengers  overstated our estimate of airfare costs that NASA would have incurred  had the passengers traveled on commercial airlines.  Conversely, our  estimated savings may be overstated because our estimated commercial  travel costs did not include additional lodging and other incidental costs  that travelers would periodically incur and salary costs for additional lost  work time.", "To estimate the lost work time associated with commercial airline travel,  including salary and benefit costs, per diem, rental cars, commercial  tickets, and other costs, we utilized cost estimates included in NASA  individual flight request forms.  For the 1,188 flights for which we received  data, we used NASA\u2019s estimates for salary costs multiplied by lost work  hours, number of travelers, and NASA\u2019s benefit factor of .5.  Because  accounting for fringe benefit costs was recognized in OMB guidance, while  unsupported, we used NASA\u2019s estimated fringe benefits factor of .5 to  increase passengers\u2019 salary costs.  In addition to salary costs, we also  included available NASA estimates for additional per diem, commercial  tickets, rental cars, and other travel costs associated with lost work time  from using commercial airline services.  For one aircraft, we did not  receive any flight justification cost estimates.  Instead, the location  operating the aircraft had developed standard calculations for the average  commercial cost for their two common flight patterns.  We averaged the  estimated commercial cost for the two flight patterns to determine the  average cost savings per traveler for the aircraft.  We then multiplied the  commercial cost by the number of travelers NASA reported for the aircraft  during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to determine the total commercial cost of  transportation for travelers on the aircraft.", "To assess whether NASA aircraft were operated and retained in accordance  with applicable governmentwide guidance, we primarily reviewed the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-126, Improving  the Management and Use of Government Aircraft; and Circular No. A-76  (Revised), Performance of Commercial Activities.  We also reviewed  applicable governmentwide guidance in OMB Circular No. A-11,  Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget Part 7: Planning,  Budgeting, Acquisition and Management of Capital Assets (Revised June  2005); General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Property  Management Regulations, 41 C.F.R. Subtitle C; and Federal Travel  Regulations, 41 C.F.R. Subtitle F.  We also reviewed NASA\u2019s implementing  publications, NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 7900.4B, NASA Aircraft  Operations Management (April 2004); NASA Policy Regulation (NPR)  7900.3A, Aircraft Operations Management (April 1999); and center- specific implementing instructions.  We held discussions regarding these  policies and procedures with officials of OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Procurement Policy, Transportation/GSA Branch, and Science and Space  Branch; GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy; and NASA\u2019s Office of  General Counsel and NASA Center and program managers.", "At each center, while we observed the process for managing aircraft  operations and scheduling and justifying individual flights, we interviewed  managers and program officials to discuss the importance to which they  assessed the need and justification for owning/leasing passenger aircraft.   We analyzed the purpose cited by NASA for individual flights flown during  our 2-year test period to determine whether NASA\u2019s stated purpose  complied with criteria established in OMB and GSA guidance.  We  interviewed agency personnel who requested, approved, and/or were  passengers on approximately 80 flights during our 2-year test period to  ensure that we understood the purpose for the flights and the basis for  utilizing NASA\u2019s aircraft.  We did not assess the adequacy of safety or  maintenance programs related to NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft.  Further, we  did not attempt to determine the validity or appropriateness of travel using  NASA\u2019s passenger aircraft, nor did we assess if the type and number of  personnel on the NASA passenger aircraft were appropriate given the  stated flight purposes.", "To assess the effectiveness of NASA\u2019s oversight and management of its  passenger aircraft operations, we held discussions with appropriate  aircraft management officials at NASA headquarters and centers operating  passenger aircraft.  We also identified and assessed (1) NASA\u2019s  implementing policies and procedures with respect to OMB and GSA policy  guidance, (2) the process used to approve and document passenger aircraft  utilization, (3) associated aircraft management reports, (4) other recent  assessments and studies done with respect to NASA passenger aircraft  services, and (5) the extent to which accurate, current agencywide data  were available to agency managers for day-to-day decision making on  passenger aircraft usage and costs.", "We briefed NASA officials on the details of our audit, including findings and  their implications.  On June 28, 2005, we requested comments on a draft on  this report.  We received comments on July 28, 2005, and have summarized  those comments in the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section of  this report.  NASA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II.  We conducted  our work from November 2004 through June 2005 in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted government auditing standards and quality standards  for investigations as set forth by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and  Efficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Mario L.
