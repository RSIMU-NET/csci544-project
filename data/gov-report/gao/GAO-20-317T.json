For this 2019 update, GAO assessed the federal government\u2019s progress since 2017 related to climate change strategic planning against five criteria and found that the federal government had not met any of the criteria for removal from the high-risk list. Further, as of August 2019, no action had been taken to implement 14 of GAO\u2019s 17 recommendations to improve federal climate change strategic planning. Additionally, no federal agency, interagency collaborative effort, or other organizational arrangement has been established to implement a strategic approach to climate resilience investment that includes periodically identifying and prioritizing projects. Such an approach could supplement individual agency climate resilience efforts and help target federal resources toward high-priority projects.", "Based on its review of prior GAO work, relevant reports, and stakeholder interviews, GAO found six key steps that provide an opportunity for the federal government to strategically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for investment. These are (1) defining the strategic goals of the climate resilience investment effort and how the effort will be carried out, (2) identifying and assessing high-risk areas for targeted resilience investment, (3) identifying potential project ideas, (4) prioritizing projects, (5) implementing high-priority projects, and (6) monitoring projects and climate risks.", "GAO also identified two options\u2014each with strengths and limitations\u2014for focusing federal funding on high-priority climate resilience projects.

Enhancing climate resilience means taking actions to  reduce potential future losses by planning and preparing for potential  climate hazards such as extreme rainfall, sea level rise, and drought.  Investing in climate resilience can reduce the need for far more costly  steps in the decades to come; therefore, we and others have  recommended enhancing climate resilience to help limit the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure to climate change.", "Planning for federal investments in climate resilience projects to limit  fiscal exposure is no longer a hypothetical issue. The Disaster Recovery  Reform Act of 2018 provides one potential source of funding for climate  resilience projects. In particular, it allows the President to set aside up to  6 percent of the estimated aggregate amount of grants from certain  emergency programs under a major disaster declaration to implement  pre-disaster hazard mitigation activities. The Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) will administer the associated program\u2014 the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. As of the  date of this testimony, FEMA had not yet developed program guidance,  although the agency has sought input from the public on program  design.

Some federal agencies have made individual efforts to manage climate  change risk within existing programs and operations, and these efforts  may convey climate resilience benefits. For example, the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers\u2019 civil works program constructs flood control projects,  such as sea walls, that could convey climate resilience benefits by  protecting communities from storms that may be exacerbated by climate  change.", "However, even with individual agency efforts, federal investment in  projects specifically designed to enhance climate resilience to date has  been limited. As we stated in our Disaster Resilience Framework, most of  the federal government\u2019s efforts to reduce disaster risk are reactive, and  many revolve around disaster recovery. As a result, we reported in  October 2019 that additional strategic federal investments may be  needed to manage some of the nation\u2019s most significant climate risks  because climate change cuts across agency missions and presents fiscal  exposures larger than any one agency can manage. Our analysis shows  the federal government does not strategically identify and prioritize  projects to ensure they address the nation\u2019s most significant climate risks.", "In addition, our October 2019 report discusses our past work that shows  an absence of government-wide strategic planning for climate change.  For example, in our March 2019 update to our high-risk list, we reported  that one area of government-wide action needed to reduce federal fiscal  exposure is in the federal government\u2019s role as the leader of a strategic  plan that coordinates federal efforts and informs state, local, and private- sector action.

The six key steps are (1) defining the strategic goals  of the climate resilience investment effort and how the effort will be  carried out, (2) identifying and assessing high-risk areas for targeted  resilience investment, (3) identifying potential project ideas, (4) prioritizing  projects, (5) implementing high-priority projects, and (6) monitoring  projects and climate risks.

CPRA periodically identifies high-priority coastal resilience  projects designed to address two primary risks: flooding and coastal land  loss. To identify potential projects, CPRA sought project proposals from  citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and others. To prioritize  projects, CPRA used quantitative modeling to estimate project outcomes  under multiple future scenarios of varied climate and other conditions and  coordinated with stakeholders to understand potential project impacts.  CPRA has published three coastal master plans in which it identified and  evaluated potential projects. For example, in its 2017 Comprehensive  Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast, CPRA identified $50 billion in high- priority projects to be implemented as funding becomes available.", "In the international example, in 2018 the Canadian government launched  the DMAF, a financial assistance program, to provide $1.5 billion (in U.S.  dollars) over 10 years for large-scale, nationally significant projects to  manage natural hazard risks, including those triggered by climate change.  Infrastructure Canada, the entity responsible for administering the DMAF,  seeks project ideas from provinces and territories, municipal and regional  governments, indigenous groups, and others. These entities apply directly  to Infrastructure Canada for funding. According to Canadian officials, two  committees of experts\u2014one composed of experts from other federal  departments and the other composed of nonfederal experts (e.g., urban  planners and individuals with regional expertise)\u2014provide feedback on  potential projects. These projects are prioritized based on multiple criteria  such as the extent to which they reduce the impacts of natural disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options for Focusing Federal Funding on High-Priority Climate Resilience Projects Have Strengths and Limitations, and Opportunities Exist to Increase Funding Impact", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in October 2019, on the basis of our review of relevant  reports and our past work, interviews with stakeholders, and illustrative  examples, we identified two options\u2014each with strengths and  limitations\u2014for focusing federal funding on high-priority climate resilience  projects. The options are (1) coordinating funding provided through  multiple existing programs with varied purposes and (2) creating a new  federal funding source specifically for investment in climate resilience. In  addition, our analysis of these sources identified opportunities to increase  the climate resilience impact of these two funding options.", "A strength of coordinating funding from existing sources is access to  multiple funding sources for a project. For example, one stakeholder we  interviewed whose community used federal funding to implement large- scale resilience projects said that having multiple programs is  advantageous because when funding from one program is not available\u2014 such as when the project does not match that program\u2019s purpose or when  there are insufficient funds\u2014funds could be sought from another  program. The state of Louisiana\u2019s coastal master planning effort also  uses multi-program coordination to fund projects. Specifically, funding for  high-priority resilience projects identified in the master plan is provided via  several federal and nonfederal programs designed for wetlands  restoration, hurricane risk reduction, oil spill recovery, and community  development, among other purposes. A limitation of that option, according  to CPRA officials, is that coordinating funding from multiple sources could  be administratively challenging and could require dedicated staff to  identify programs, assess whether projects meet program funding criteria,  apply for funds, and ensure program requirements are met.", "Alternatively, one strength of creating a new federal funding source, such  as a federal financial assistance program that could provide loans or  grants or a climate infrastructure bank, is that it could encourage cross- sector projects designed to achieve benefits in multiple sectors. For  example, according to one stakeholder, such a funding source could  allow experts from multiple sectors\u2014such as infrastructure, housing,  transportation, and health\u2014to collaborate on projects, leading to more  creative, comprehensive approaches to enhance community resilience.  However, such a new funding source would have to be created, which  would require congressional authorization.", "In addition, we identified opportunities to increase the climate resilience  impact of federal funding options based on our review of our past work,  related reports, an international standard, and the Louisiana and  Canadian examples, as well as interviews with stakeholders:", "Using both existing and new funding options. Several  stakeholders told us that using both funding options\u2014multiple,  existing federal programs with varied purposes and a new funding  source for high-priority climate resilience projects\u2014in a strategic,  coordinated way could help increase the impact of federal investment.  Two stakeholders told us that in practice, multiple, existing federal  funding sources that are not specific to climate resilience could be  coordinated to fund projects when their purposes and rules align and  adequate funding is available. A funding source specifically for climate  resilience could be used to fund proposed projects when no related  program exists or when existing programs do not have sufficient  funding available, according to these and other stakeholders.", "Helping ensure adequate and consistent funding. Several  stakeholders we interviewed identified the need for adequate and  consistent funding to implement high-priority climate resilience  projects. For example, according to one stakeholder we interviewed,  inconsistent, inadequate funding makes it difficult to complete large- scale projects and can lead to additional costs if significant delays  occur during which existing work deteriorates. In addition to adequate  and consistent funding, funding options should be designed to  accommodate long-term projects since high-priority climate resilience  projects can take multiple years to design and implement, according  to two stakeholders we interviewed.", "Encouraging nonfederal investment. Several stakeholders we  interviewed told us that the federal government could use a federal  climate resilience investment effort to encourage nonfederal  investment in high-priority climate resilience projects, thereby  increasing the impact of federal investment. For example, several  stakeholders identified the importance of a cost-share component so  that funding recipients are invested in a project\u2019s success. Canada\u2019s  DMAF encourages nonfederal investment by partially funding projects  of national significance and requiring different levels of cost-share  from funding recipients, ranging from 25 percent for indigenous  recipients to 75 percent for private-sector and other for-profit  recipients. Several stakeholders also identified potential funding  mechanisms\u2014for example, public-private partnerships and loan  guarantees\u2014that could leverage federal dollars to encourage  additional investment in climate resilience projects by nonfederal  entities, including the private sector.", "Encouraging complementary resilience activities. To increase the  impact of federal investment in climate resilience, a federal investment  effort presents an opportunity to encourage complementary resilience  activities by nonfederal actors such as states, localities, and private- sector partners, based on interviews with several stakeholders, the  Canadian example, and reports we reviewed. For example, this could  include establishing conditions that funding recipients must meet in  exchange for receiving federal funding. Alternatively, the federal  government could use incentives (e.g., providing greater federal cost- share or giving additional preference in the project prioritization  process) to encourage complementary resilience activities by  nonfederal actors. Our Disaster Resilience Framework states that  incentives can make long-term, forward-looking risk reduction  investments more viable and attractive among competing priorities.  The federal government could use these conditions and incentives to  encourage several types of complementary resilience activities by  nonfederal actors. For example, the federal government could  encourage the use and enforcement of building codes that require  stronger risk-reduction measures. In addition, a federal investment  effort could provide an opportunity to encourage communities to limit  or prohibit development in high-risk areas to minimize risks to people  and assets exposed to future climate hazards. One example of this  would be through zoning regulations. Another stakeholder suggested  that communities receiving federal funding for resilience projects  should be adequately insured against future climate risks so they  have a potential source of funding for rebuilding in the event of a  disaster.", "Allowing funds to be used at various stages of project  development. Several stakeholders suggested that federal funds be  used for multiple stages of project development\u2014such as project  design, implementation, or monitoring\u2014to increase the impact of  federal funds. For example, two stakeholders we interviewed told us  that resilience projects can require significant amounts of design work  to develop an implementable and effective project concept and that  making funds available for project design could improve the quality of  project proposals, thereby maximizing the impact of federal funds. In  addition to providing federal funds for project design, one stakeholder  suggested making federal funding available to measure project  outcomes (e.g., how effectively projects increased resilience) to  improve future decisions by both the federal government and others  making resilience investments.", "Based on the findings of our October 2019 report, we recommended that  Congress consider establishing a federal organizational arrangement to  periodically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for federal  investment. Such an arrangement could be designed using the six key  steps for prioritizing climate resilience investments and the opportunities  to increase the climate resilience impact of federal funding options that  we identified in our report.", "Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the  Select Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
