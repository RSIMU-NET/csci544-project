As of June 17, 2020, the United States had over 2 million reported cases of COVID-19, and over 100,000 reported deaths, according to federal agencies. Parts of the nation have seen severely strained health care systems. The country has also experienced a significant and rapid downturn in the economy. Four relief laws, including the CARES Act, were enacted as of June 2020 to provide appropriations to address the public health and economic threats posed by COVID-19. In addition, the administration created the White House Coronavirus Task Force.", "The CARES Act includes a provision for GAO to report regularly on its ongoing monitoring and oversight efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yesterday, GAO issued its first report ( GAO-20-625 ).", "Like the report, this testimony focuses on key actions the federal government has taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic, GAO recommendations for improvement, and evolving lessons learned relevant to the nation\u2019s response to pandemics, among other things. GAO reviewed data and documents from federal agencies about their activities and interviewed federal and state officials as well as industry representatives. GAO also reviewed available economic, health, and budgetary data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In response to the national public health and economic threats caused by COVID-19, four relief laws were enacted as of June 2020 that appropriated $2.6 trillion. This funding provided support to individuals, health care providers, businesses, and state and local government.", "While complete government-wide data will not be available until July, GAO determined that as of May 31, 2020, a total of about $1.2 trillion of assistance has been provided\u2014close to $700 billion in expenditures and over $500 billion in loan guarantees. Consistent with the urgency of responding to widespread health issues and economic disruptions, agencies have worked hard to give priority to moving swiftly. In moving quickly, however, agencies made trade-offs; thus, only limited progress has been made so far in achieving transparency and accountability goals.", "GAO also identified challenges with the federal response to the crisis, including:", "Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The Small Business Administration (SBA) moved quickly to establish a new nationwide program, but the pace contributed to confusion and questions and raised program integrity concerns. GAO recommends that SBA develop and implement plans to identify and respond to risks in PPP to better ensure program integrity. SBA neither agreed nor disagreed. Implementing GAO\u2019s recommendation is essential.", "Economic impact payments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) faced difficulties delivering payments to some individuals, and made some payments to ineligible individuals, such as decedents. GAO recommends that IRS should consider cost-effective options for notifying ineligible recipients how to return payments. IRS agreed.", "Unemployment Insurance (UI). The program could have an unintentional overlap with benefits provided under PPP. GAO recommends that the Department of Labor (DOL) immediately provide help to state unemployment agencies that specifically addresses PPP loans, and the risk of improper payments associated with these loans. DOL is planning additional guidance.", "Aviation-preparedness plan. In 2015, GAO recommended that the Department of Transportation (DOT) work with federal partners to develop a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks. Thus far, no plan exists. GAO recommends Congress require DOT to produce a plan.", "Full access to death data. It is important to consistently use safeguards when providing assistance to individuals. The Treasury and Bureau of Fiscal Service do not have access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s full set of death records. GAO recommends that the Congress give Treasury that access and require that Treasury consistently use it.", "Medicaid. GAO previously found that during economic downturns, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) formula does not reflect current state economic conditions. GAO recommends that, during an economic downturn, Congress use a formula to provide timely and targeted assistance during economic downturns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the report, GAO makes three new recommendations for agencies and three matters for consideration for Congress that address these issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the federal government\u2019s  response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the virus has  spread around the globe and within the United States, it has left a  devastating wake of human and economic loss. On behalf of my  colleagues, I want to express my condolences for those who have lost  loved ones to COVID-19. Additionally, I want to commend the heroic  efforts of health care workers across the country who have cared for  those individuals infected with the virus. I also want to recognize the  dedication and agility of the federal, state and local workforces and others  throughout our society.", "In response to this unprecedented global crisis, Congress and the  administration have taken a series of actions to protect the health and  well-being of Americans. Notably, in March 2020, Congress passed, and  the President signed into law, the CARES Act. It provides over $2 trillion  in emergency assistance and health care response for individuals, health  care providers, businesses, and state and local governments affected by  COVID-19. Agencies across the federal government have acted quickly to  execute the law, including standing up new programs, while also  responding to the pandemic.", "The CARES Act includes a provision for us to conduct monitoring and  oversight of the use of funds made available to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. GAO is to report on, among  other things, the pandemic\u2019s effects on the public health, economy, and  public and private institutions of the United States, including the federal  government\u2019s public health and homeland security efforts. The act  requires us to submit a report within 90 days of enactment on our ongoing  monitoring and oversight efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with  subsequent bimonthly reports.", "Yesterday we issued the first of these reports, which will continue on a  bimonthly basis through March 2021. My comments today will  summarize the key findings from this report. Specifically, I will discuss  1.  the key actions the federal government has taken, to date, to respond  to and recover from COVID-19, recommendations for executive  action, and matters for legislative action by the Congress; and   2.  evolving lessons learned relevant to the nation\u2019s response to the  COVID-19 pandemic.", "To conduct the work for our initial report, we examined federal laws and  agency documents, guidance, processes, and procedures, and available  agency budgetary data. In addition, we interviewed federal and state  officials and industry representatives. We also reviewed Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation data through May 31, 2020.  We identified obligations related to COVID-19 using the National Interest  Action code, as well as the contract description. We also reviewed prior  GAO work, information from relevant federal agencies responsible for the  pandemic response and oversight of the health care system, selected  studies produced by experts in public health and epidemiology, data  collected by state health departments, and examples of federal  government response to past national emergencies. To monitor areas of  the economy supported by federal response to the pandemic, we also  reviewed prior GAO reports, releases from federal statistical agencies,  and input from internal GAO experts. More detailed information on our  objectives, scope, and methodology for that work can be found in the  issued report.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

These laws have appropriated $2.6 trillion  across the government. Six areas\u2014the Paycheck Protection Program  (PPP), Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Distressed Sectors,  unemployment insurance, economic impact payments, the Public Health  and Social Services Emergency Fund, and the Coronavirus Relief Fund\u2014 account for 86 percent of the appropriations (see fig. 1).", "Total federal spending data are not planned to be readily available until  July 2020. It is unfortunate that the public will have waited more than 4  months since the enactment of the CARES Act for access to  comprehensive obligation and expenditure information published by  federal agencies about the programs funded through these relief laws.", "In the absence of comprehensive data, we collected obligation  (government financial commitments) and expenditure data from agencies,  to the extent practicable, as of May 31, 2020. For the six largest spending  areas, we found that obligations totaled $1.3 trillion and expenditures  totaled $643 billion. The majority of the difference was due to PPP, for  which the Small Business Administration (SBA) obligated $521 billion.  The amounts for loan guarantees will not be considered expenditures  until the loans are forgiven, and, for those that are not forgiven, whether  they are timely repaid.", "We also collected spending data on other programs affected by the  federal response. For example, we found that the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) has provided $7 billion in COVID-19  Medicaid funding related to a temporary increase in the Federal Medical  Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the statutory formula the federal  government uses to match states\u2019 Medicaid spending. Based on the  information we collected, government-wide spending totaled at least $677  billion, as of May 31, 2020.", "Given the sweeping and evolving public health and economic crisis,  agencies from across the federal government were called on for  immediate assistance, requiring an unprecedented level of dedication and  agility among the federal workforce, including those serving on the front  lines, to quickly establish services for those infected with the virus.  Consistent with the urgency of responding to serious and widespread  health issues and economic disruptions, agencies have given priority to  moving swiftly where possible to distribute funds and implement new  programs. In moving quickly, however, agencies made trade-offs, and  they have made only limited progress so far in achieving transparency  and accountability goals.", "In particular, we identified several challenges related to the federal  response to the crisis, as well as recommendations to help address these  challenges, including the following:  Viral testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  reported incomplete and inconsistent data from state and jurisdictional  health departments on the amount of viral testing occurring nationwide,  making it more difficult to track and know the number of infections,  mitigate their effects, and inform decisions on reopening communities.  However, HHS issued guidance on June 4, 2020, to laboratories that  identifies required data elements to collect and how to report them to  CDC.", "Distribution of supplies. The nationwide need for critical supplies to  respond to COVID-19 quickly exceeded the quantity of supplies contained  in the Strategic National Stockpile, which is designed to supplement state  and local supplies during public health emergencies. HHS has worked  with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of  Defense to increase the availability of supplies. However, concerns  remain about the distribution, acquisition, and adequacy of supplies.", "Paycheck Protection Program. As of June 12, 2020, the Small  Business Administration (SBA) had rapidly processed over $512 billion in  4.6 million guaranteed loans through private lenders to small businesses  and other organizations adversely affected by COVID-19. As of May 31,  2020, SBA had expended about $2 billion in lender fees. SBA moved  quickly to establish a new nationwide program, but the pace contributed  to confusion and questions about the program and raised program  integrity concerns.", "First, borrowers and lenders raised a number of questions about the  program and eligibility criteria. To address these concerns, SBA and  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) issued a number of interim  final rules and several versions of responses to frequently asked  questions. However, questions and confusion remained. In June  2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the  Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020, which modified  key program components.", "Second, to help quickly disburse funds, SBA allowed lenders to rely  on borrower certifications to determine borrowers\u2019 eligibility, raising  the potential for fraud.", "We recommend that SBA develop and implement plans to identify and  respond to risks in PPP to ensure program integrity, achieve program  effectiveness, and address potential fraud. SBA neither agreed nor  disagreed, but we believe implementing this recommendation is essential.", "Economic impact payments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and  Treasury moved quickly to disburse 160.4 million payments worth $269  billion. The agencies faced difficulties delivering payments to some  individuals, and they face additional risks related to making improper  payments to ineligible individuals, such as decedents, and fraud. For  example, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration, as of April 30, almost 1.1 million payments totaling nearly  $1.4 billion had gone to decedents. We recommend that IRS consider  cost-effective options for notifying ineligible recipients how to return  payments. IRS agreed.", "Unemployment insurance (UI). States are implementing three new,  federally funded UI programs created by the CARES Act and, as of May  2020, states had received 42 million UI claims. The Department of Labor  (DOL) has taken steps to help states manage demand, but DOL is  developing its approach to overseeing the new UI programs. We will be  evaluating DOL\u2019s monitoring efforts in future reports. Further, the UI  program is generally intended to provide benefits to individuals who have  lost their jobs; under PPP, employers are generally required to retain or  rehire employees. According to DOL, no mechanism currently exists that  could capture information in real time about UI claimants who may  receive wages paid from PPP loan proceeds. We recommend that DOL,  in consultation with SBA and Treasury, immediately provide help to state  unemployment agencies that specifically addresses PPP loans and the  risk of improper payments associated with these loans. DOL neither  agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation, but noted it was planning  forthcoming guidance.", "Contract obligations. Government-wide contract obligations in response  to the COVID-19 pandemic totaled about $17 billion as of May 31, 2020.  Goods procured include ventilators, and services contracted for include  vaccine development. In addition, the CARES Act provided $1 billion for  Defense Production Act purchases\u2014$76 million of which was awarded to  increase production of N95 respirators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolving Lessons Learned from Initial COVID-19 Response and Past Emergencies Highlight Areas for Continued Attention", "paragraphs": ["The nation has made some progress in fighting COVID-19. However, the  virus continues to pose risks to all Americans, and there is a concern of  another wave of infection this fall. This could coincide with the seasonal  influenza and hurricane season\u2014further straining federal agencies  responsible for responding to these events, as well as the health care  system. Additionally, the nation\u2019s initial response to COVID-19 highlights  the challenges presented by an inherent fragmentation across  responsibilities and capabilities in the federal biodefense response and  health care system, which includes private, public (local, state, and  federal governments), and nonprofit entities.", "Lessons from the initial response, as well as experience from past  economic crises, disasters, and emergencies, highlight areas where  continued attention and oversight are needed\u2014with the focus on  improving ongoing response efforts and preparing for potential additional  waves of infection. These lessons include the following:", "Establishing clear goals and defining roles and responsibilities for the  wide range of federal departments and other key players are critically  important actions when preparing for pandemics and addressing an  unforeseen emergency with a whole-of-government response.", "Providing clear, consistent communication in the midst of a national  emergency\u2014among all levels of government, with health care  providers, and to the public\u2014is key.", "Collecting and analyzing adequate and reliable data can inform  decision-making and future preparedness\u2014and allow for midcourse  changes in response to early findings.", "Establishing transparency and accountability mechanisms early on  provides greater safeguards and reasonable assurance that federal  funds reach the intended people and are used for the intended  purposes. Such mechanisms also help ensure program integrity and  address fraud risks.", "While Congress has taken a number of actions to help address the  pandemic, it continues to consider additional actions\u2014both to improve  ongoing efforts and implement new ones\u2014and develop plans for  congressional oversight of the nation\u2019s response to and recovery from  COVID-19. Congressional oversight plays a vital role in spurring agency  progress on matters of national importance. On the basis of our work on  past large-scale government responses to economic downturns and other  crises, we recommend Congress consider taking legislative action in the  following areas:  Aviation-preparedness plan. In 2015, we recommended that the  Department of Transportation (DOT) work with federal partners to  develop a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease  outbreaks. DOT agreed, but as of May 2020, maintained that HHS and  DHS should lead the effort. Thus far, no plan exists. We recommend that  Congress take legislative action to require DOT to work with relevant  agencies and stakeholders to develop a national aviation-preparedness  plan to ensure safeguards are in place to limit the spread of  communicable disease threats from abroad while at the same time  minimizing any unnecessary interference with travel and trade.", "Full access to death data. The number of economic impact payments  made to decedents highlights the importance of consistently using key  safeguards in providing government assistance to individuals. IRS has  access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s full set of death records,  but Treasury and its Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which distribute  payments, do not. We recommend that Congress provide Treasury with  access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s full set of death records  and require that Treasury consistently use it to help reduce similar types  of improper payments.", "Medicaid. We previously found that during economic downturns\u2014when  Medicaid enrollment can rise and state economies weaken\u2014the FMAP  formula does not reflect current state economic conditions. We previously  developed a formula that offers an option for providing temporary  automatic, timely, and targeted assistance. We recommend that  Congress use this formula for any future changes to the FMAP during the  current or any future economic downturn to help ensure that the federal  funding is targeted and timely.", "In the report we issued yesterday, we also describe potential indicators  that could be used to monitor public health and economic recovery. The  report also contains 41 enclosures that contain information about a wide  range of federal programs or initiatives that were created, expanded, or  funded in the COVID-19 relief laws.", "In conclusion, both Congress and the administration have acted to  respond to public health and economic threats posed by COVID-19.  Federal agencies and personnel acted quickly to stand up new programs  or expand existing programs to, among other things, aid individuals,  states, and businesses. But much work remains in protecting the health  and well-being of Americans, both today and in the coming months, as  the nation may be forced to simultaneously confront new waves of  COVID-19 infections and seasonal influenza.", "In our initial report we make recommendations to help improve the  effectiveness of the federal government\u2019s ongoing response. Our ongoing  oversight will continue to focus on improving the government\u2019s response  and recovery efforts as well as the nation\u2019s preparedness for future  outbreaks.
