Before the Federal Transit  Administration (FTA) may make grants to transit applicants, Section 13(c)  requires that the Department of Labor (DOL) certify that fair and equitable  arrangements are in place to protect mass transit employees affected by  federal assistance. Section 13(c) requires that the arrangements contain  provisions for, among other things, the continuation of collective  bargaining rights and the protection of employees against a worsening of  their positions. Once certified, the arrangements are incorporated into the  grant agreement between FTA and the grantee.  Critics of Section 13(c)  have claimed that it greatly increases the cost of transit operations, hinders  transit agencies\u2019 efforts to adopt new technology, and creates constraints  on the efficient operation of transit systems.

We agreed with  your office to assess the impact of Section 13(c) on labor costs and the  technological and operational management of transit agencies\u2014aspects of  transit operations industry officials identified as most likely to be affected  by Section 13(c).  We also agreed to assess the impact of Section 13(c) on  the timely receipt of federal transit grants, as well as the burden of  complying with Section 13(c) relative to other federal grant requirements.   To address this request, we reviewed relevant studies and the legislative  history of Section 13(c), interviewed federal agency and union officials, and  conducted a nationwide mail survey of the 105 largest transit agencies in  April 2001.  We received responses to our survey from 92 transit agencies  for a response rate of 88 percent.  Our survey instrument and overall results  are included in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1964, Congress passed the Urban Mass Transportation Act to provide  financial assistance to states and local governments to extend and improve  urban mass transportation systems beleaguered by rising costs and  declining ridership.  The provisions commonly called Section 13(c) were  included to protect employees who might be adversely affected by industry  changes resulting from financial assistance under the act.   One specific  concern was that if municipalities and other public entities used federal  assistance to purchase failing private transportation providers, the  employees could lose their jobs, collective bargaining rights, or other rights  they had gained through collective bargaining.  For example, prior to the  passage of the act, transit employees in Dade County, Florida lost their  collective bargaining rights; and subsequent decisions regarding wages,  hours, and working conditions were made unilaterally after their employer  was acquired by a public transit authority.  Another concern leading to  Section 13(c) was that technological advances made with federal  assistance would reduce the need for transit labor.", "Section 13(c) is unusual in that two federal agencies administer it: DOT and  DOL.  Section 13(c) requires that DOL certify that fair and equitable labor  protection arrangements are in place before DOT makes grants to transit  applicants.   Such labor protection arrangements are to provide for (1) the  preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits under existing collective  bargaining agreements; (2) continuation of collective bargaining rights; (3)  protection of employees against a worsening of their positions with respect  to their employment; (4) assurances of employment to employees of  acquired mass transportation systems and priority of reemployment for  employees terminated or laid off; and (5) paid training or retraining  programs.", "In carrying out its responsibilities, DOL ensures that the protective terms  are in place through Section 13(c) arrangements, which are incorporated  within a transit agency\u2019s grant agreement with DOT.  The DOL certification  process begins when FTA forwards a grant application to DOL.  DOL refers  the grant application and recommended terms and conditions to the unions  representing transit employees in the service area of the project and the  transit agency applying for the grant.  No referral is made when (1)  employees in the service area are not represented by a union or (2) the  grant is for routine replacement items.  After DOL referral, the parties  review the proposed terms and conditions and submit objections, if any.  If  no objection is submitted, DOL issues a final certification based on the  terms and conditions recommended to the parties.  If an objection is  submitted, DOL considers its validity.  If DOL determines that the objection  is not valid, it issues a certification that is based on the recommended  terms and conditions.  If it determines that the objection is valid, and it  cannot be resolved through a technical correction, the parties are provided  an opportunity to resolve disputed matters through negotiations.  If they  are unable to do so, DOL makes a determination after considering the  objections of the parties.  If the terms and conditions applied by DOL are  not acceptable to the grant applicant, it may choose not to accept federal  transit assistance.", "After the certification process, employees who believe they have been  adversely affected as a result of federal transit assistance may file claims  under the procedures set forth in the Section 13(c) arrangements certified  by DOL.  The procedures for filing and resolving Section 13(c) claims vary  according to each agreement, but they typically set forth (1) a time period  for filing claims; (2) an informal process under which the parties can  resolve disputes over claims; and (3) a formal dispute resolution process,  such as binding arbitration, in the event that an informal settlement is not  reached."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 13(c) Has Had Minimal Impact on Labor Costs at Most Transit Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The agencies we surveyed generally reported Section 13(c) had a minimal  impact on their labor costs.  Critics have expressed concern that Section  13(c) hinders transit agencies\u2019 ability to lower labor costs, which,  according to the American Public Transportation Association, account for  over 80 percent of the operating expenses in the public transportation  industry.  In addition, some critics have stated that Section 13(c) has  caused inflated wages and benefits in the transit industry.  However, 68  percent of the transit agencies that responded to our survey reported that,  in general, Section 13(c) had no effect on their labor costs.  Twenty-seven  percent reported that Section 13(c) had somewhat increased their labor  costs, and 4 percent reported that Section 13(c) had greatly increased labor  costs.", "Moreover, a study by Rutgers University found that hourly transit wages for  operators and mechanics rose very little in real terms and substantially less  than average earnings per employee in other sectors of the economy from  1982 to 1997.  When compared within metropolitan areas, transit wages (1)  rose less than average earnings per employee in the manufacturing and  government sectors, (2) were about the same as average earnings per  employee in the transportation and public utilities sectors, (3) and rose  much less than average earnings per employee in all other sectors of the  economy.  In addition, using data from 130 transit agencies, the Rutgers  study found that mean top-wages for transit bus operators hovered at  roughly the same level over the 1982 to 1997 period.  (See table 1.)", "Section 13(c) could also affect a transit agency\u2019s costs through Section  13(c) claims.  Section 13(c) arrangements typically establish a process  whereby employees adversely affected by federal assistance can file claims  against transit agencies, for example, for a dismissal allowance when  employees lose their jobs.  Claims may be filed for an individual or for a  group of employees and claims filed in the last 5 years covered an average  of 37 employees per claim. Eighty-seven percent of the transit agencies we  surveyed reported that they have not had any Section 13(c) claims in the  last 5 years.  The remaining 12 agencies had an average of 3 claims filed  during this period.  Only eight of these agencies had Section 13(c) claims  reach settlement, arbitration, or DOL decision.  For those agencies, the  average total amount paid per agency was $188,067."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 13(c) Has Had No Influence on Most Transit Agencies\u2019 Decisions Whether to Adopt New Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Critics of Section 13(c) have asserted that it creates disincentives for  transit agencies to examine and adopt innovative technologies.  However,  85 percent of the transit agencies surveyed reported that, in general,  Section 13(c) did not affect their decisions on whether to adopt new  technologies.  In addition, we asked the transit agencies whether Section  13(c) had influenced their decisions whether to adopt specific  technologies, including automatic passenger counters and electronic fare  payment systems.  For each technology we identified, few or none of the  transit agencies surveyed indicated that Section 13(c) had influenced their  decisions on whether to adopt the technology.  For example, of the 65  agencies that had considered adopting onboard electronic security  monitors, 4 indicated that Section 13(c) influenced their decisions whether  to adopt that technology.  Only 1 of the 30 agencies that had considered  using articulated buses indicated that Section 13(c) influenced their  decisions whether to adopt that technology.  Of the 71 agencies that  considered using a global positioning system, 2 indicated that Section 13(c)  influenced their decision whether to adopt that technology; however,  officials who identified Section 13(c) as influencing their decisions did not  offer any explanation for why Section 13(c) proved problematic in these  cases.  (See fig. 1.)", "In addition, some officials suggested that the impact of Section 13(c) on  transit agencies\u2019 decisions concerning technology may be limited because  many transit systems are experiencing growth. According to the American  Public Transportation Association (APTA), over the past 5 years, transit  ridership has grown 21 percent.  Consequently, transit agencies may be able  to adopt labor-saving technologies without dismissing or displacing  employees.  Of the transit agencies we surveyed, 10 percent reported that  they have fewer employees now than 5 years ago; and 84 percent reported  that they have more employees now than 5 years ago.   The remaining  transit agencies reported no change in the number of employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 13(c) Minimally Influenced Transit Agencies\u2019 Operations, Except for Contracting", "paragraphs": ["The transit agencies we surveyed generally reported that Section 13(c) had  a minimal impact in some selected areas of their operations, including their  decisions to modify transit operations and their relations with their unions.   However, the agencies reported a greater impact due to Section 13(c) on  their ability to contract for transit services.", "Critics of Section 13(c) have stated that it creates disincentives for transit  agencies to modify their operations.  However, transit agencies generally  reported that Section 13(c) did not influence their decisions in this area.   We asked transit agencies to identify which of nine operational areas they  had considered modifying, and whether Section 13(c) had influenced their  decisions on whether to implement changes.  When agencies indicated that  they had considered changes in their transit operations, on average 81  percent of those decisions were not influenced by Section 13(c). (See fig.  2.)", "The majority of transit agencies we surveyed also reported that Section  13(c) generally did not affect their relations with the unions that  represented their employees.  For example, when asked whether Section  13(c) had caused their relations with the unions to become more amicable  or more contentious, 63 percent of the agencies reported that Section 13(c)  had not had any effect.  Thirty-four percent of the agencies reported that  Section 13(c) had made relations with the unions more contentious, and  the remaining 3 percent reported that Section 13(c) had made their labor  relations more amicable.

For example, 46 percent indicated that Section 13(c) made it somewhat or  much more difficult to contract out for fixed-route services. In contrast, 17  percent of the transit agencies indicated that Section 13(c) made it  somewhat or much more difficult to contract out for paratransit services.  A transit official we interviewed explained this difference by noting that  employees represented by labor unions have historically operated fixed- route service, but paratransit services have historically been contracted  out; thus, the continuation of contracting out paratransit services does not  pose a problem.", "In addition, some transit industry officials reported that although  provisions of Section 13(c) arrangements may directly limit contracting out  for services, more often agencies are discouraged from contracting out  because of their perception that such action will cause problems, such as  Section 13(c) claims or delays in the receipt of grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 13(c) Can Delay Grant Awards, But Transit Agencies Were Generally Satisfied With the Timeliness of Grant Application Processing", "paragraphs": ["Transit agencies have argued that Section 13(c) causes delays in  application processing and the award of federal grants.

These officials shared their views on the  costs and benefits of Section 13(c) as well as key information on the  Section 13(c) certification process, the characteristics of transit agencies  most likely to be affected by Section 13(c), and the history of Section 13(c).", "To obtain the list of transit agencies to survey, we analyzed data from FTA\u2019s  National Transit Database (NTD).  From our interviews, we determined  that larger transit authorities were more likely to have had relevant and  reportable experiences with Section 13(c).  First, larger transit agencies  generally receive more federal financial assistance than smaller agencies.   Second, the officials we interviewed reported that larger agencies were  more likely to have employees represented by unions.  Finally, DOL has  simplified certification requirements for transit authorities not located in  urbanized areas.  Consequently, we requested that FTA officials provide us  with a list of all transit providers that serve populations greater than  200,000 and that annually operate 100 or more revenue vehicles in  maximum service.

The pretest participants were selected from transit  agencies of different sizes operating in a variety of geographic areas.   During the pretesting, we simulated the actual survey experience by asking  the transit agency officials to complete the survey.
