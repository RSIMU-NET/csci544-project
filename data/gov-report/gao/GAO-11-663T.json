For its outpatient appointment scheduling project, VA spent an estimated $127 million over 9 years and was unable to implement any of the planned capabilities. The application software project was hindered by weaknesses in several key management disciplines, including acquisition planning, requirements analysis, testing, progress reporting, risk management, and oversight. For its Post 9/11 GI Bill educational benefits system, VA used a new incremental software development approach and deployed the first two of four releases of its long-term system solution by its planned dates, thereby providing regional processing offices with key automated capabilities to prepare original and amended benefits claims. However, VA had areas for improvement, including establishing business priorities, testing the new systems, and providing oversight. Effective information security controls are essential to securing the information systems and information on which VA depends to carry out its mission. For over a decade, VA has faced long-standing information security weaknesses as identified by GAO, VA's Office of the Inspector General, VA's independent auditor, and the department itself. The department continues to face challenges in maintaining its information security controls over its systems and in fully implementing the information security program required under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. These weaknesses have left VA vulnerable to disruptions in critical operations, theft, fraud, and inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information. VA and DOD operate two of the nation's largest health care systems, providing health care to 6 million veterans and 9.6 million active duty service members at estimated annual costs of about $48 billion and $49 billion, respectively. To provide this care, both departments rely on electronic health record systems to create, maintain, and manage patient health information. GAO reported earlier this year that VA faced barriers in establishing shared electronic health record capabilities with DOD in three key IT management areas--strategic planning, enterprise architecture (i.e., a description of business processes and supporting technologies), and IT investment management. Specifically, the departments were unable to articulate explicit plans, goals, and time frames for jointly addressing the health IT requirements common to both departments' electronic health record systems. Additionally, although VA and DOD took steps toward developing and maintaining artifacts related to a joint health architecture, the architecture was not sufficiently mature to guide the departments' joint health IT modernization efforts. Lastly, VA and DOD did not have a joint process for selecting IT investments based on criteria that consider cost, benefit, schedule, and risk elements, which would help to ensure that the chosen solution both meets the departments' common health IT needs and provides better value and benefits to the government as a whole. Subsequent to our report, the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense agreed to pursue integrated electronic health record capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In previous reports in recent years, GAO has made numerous recommendations to VA aimed at improving the department's IT management capabilities.

Over time, the use of IT has become  increasingly important to the department\u2019s efforts to provide these  benefits and services to veterans; VA relies on its IT systems for  medical information and records and for processing benefits claims,  including compensation and pension and education benefits.  Further, VA is increasingly expected to improve its service to  veterans by sharing information with other departments, especially  DOD.", "VA\u2019s fiscal year 2012 request for almost $3.2 billion in IT budget  authority indicates the range of the department\u2019s IT activities.

VA has begun implementing capabilities from the  second project, although we identified opportunities for  improvement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA\u2019s Scheduling Replacement Project Was Hindered by Systems Development and Acquisition Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["To carry out VA\u2019s daily operations in providing care to veterans and  their families, the department relies on an outpatient appointment  scheduling system. However, according to the department, this  current scheduling system has had long-standing limitations that  have impeded its effectiveness. Consequently, VA began work on a  replacement system in 2000. However, after spending an estimated  $127 million over 9 years, VA had not implemented any of the  planned capabilities.", "VA\u2019s efforts to successfully complete the Scheduling Replacement  Project were hindered by weaknesses in several key project  management disciplines and a lack of effective oversight.  Specifically,  \u25cf  VA did not adequately plan its acquisition of the scheduling  application and did not obtain the benefits of competition.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) required preparation of  acquisition plans that must address how competition will be sought,  promoted, and sustained. VA did not develop an acquisition plan  until May 2005, about 4 years after the department first contracted  for a new scheduling system. Further, VA did not promote  competition in contracting for its scheduling system. Instead, VA  issued task orders against an existing contract that the department  had in place for acquiring services such as printing, computer  maintenance, and data entry. These weaknesses in VA\u2019s acquisition  management reflected the inexperience of the department\u2019s  personnel in administering major IT contracts. To address identified  shortcomings, we recommended that VA ensure that future  acquisition plans document how competition will be sought,  promoted, and sustained.   \u25cf  VA did not ensure that requirements were complete and  sufficiently detailed. Effective, disciplined practices for defining  requirements include analyzing requirements to ensure that they are  complete, verifiable, and sufficiently detailed. For example,  maintaining bidirectional traceability from high-level operational  requirements through detailed low-level requirements to test cases  is a disciplined requirements management practice. However, VA  did not adequately define requirements. For example, in November  2007, VA determined that performance requirements were missing  and that some requirements were not testable. Further, according to  project officials, some requirements were vague and open to  interpretation. Also, requirements for processing information from  other systems were missing. The incomplete and insufficiently  detailed requirements resulted in a system that did not function as  intended. In addition, VA did not ensure that requirements were  fully traceable. As early as October 2006, an internal review noted  that the requirements did not trace to business rules or to test cases.  By not ensuring requirements traceability, the department increased  the risk that the system could not be adequately tested and would  not function as intended. We therefore recommended that VA  ensure implementation of a requirements management plan that  reflected leading practices.  \u25cf  VA\u2019s concurrent approach to performing system tests  increased risk. Best practices in system testing indicate that  testing activities should be performed incrementally, so that  problems and defects with software versions can be discovered and  corrected early. VA\u2019s guidance on conducting tests is consistent  with these practices and specifies four test stages and associated  criteria for progressing through the stages. For example, defects  categorized as critical, major, and average severity identified in  testing stage one are to be resolved before testing in stage two is  begun. Nonetheless, VA took a high-risk approach to testing by  performing tests concurrently rather than incrementally. Scheduling  project officials told us that they ignored their own testing guidance  and performed concurrent testing at the direction of Office of  Enterprise Development senior management in an effort to prevent  project timelines from slipping. The first version to undergo stage  two testing had 370 defects that should have been resolved before  stage two testing was begun. Almost 2 years after beginning stage  two testing, 87 defects that should have been resolved before stage  two testing began had not been fixed. As a result of a large number  of defects that VA and the contractor could not resolve, the contract  was terminated. To prevent these types of problems with future  system development efforts, we recommended that VA adhere to its  own guidance for system testing.  \u25cf  VA\u2019s reporting based on earned value management data was  unreliable. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and VA  policies require major projects to use earned value management to  measure and report progress. Earned value management is a tool for  measuring a project\u2019s progress by comparing the value of work  accomplished with the amount of work expected to be  accomplished. Such a comparison permits actual performance to be  evaluated and is based on variances from the cost and schedule  baselines. In January 2006, the scheduling project began providing  monthly reports to the department\u2019s Chief Information Officer based  on earned value management data. However, the progress reports  included contradictory information about project performance.  Specifically, the reports featured stoplight indicators (green, yellow,  or red) that frequently were inconsistent with the reports\u2019 narrative.  For example, the June 2007 report identified project cost and  schedule performance as green, despite the report noting that the  project budget was being increased by $3 million to accommodate  schedule delays. This inconsistent reporting continued until October  2008, when the report began to show cost and schedule  performance as red, the actual state of the project. Further, the  former program manager noted that the department performed  earned value management for the scheduling project only to fulfill  the OMB requirement, and that the data were not used as the basis  for decision making because doing so was not a part of the  department\u2019s culture. To address these weaknesses, we  recommended that VA ensure effective implementation of earned  value management.   \u25cf  VA did not effectively identify, mitigate, and communicate  project risks. Federal guidance and best practices advocate risk  management. To be effective, risk management activities should  include identifying and prioritizing risks as to their probability of  occurrence and impact, documenting them in an inventory, and  developing and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies.  VA established a process for managing the scheduling system  project\u2019s risks that was consistent with relevant best practices.", "Specifically, project officials developed a risk management plan that  defined five phases\u2014risk identification, risk analysis, risk response  planning, risk monitoring and control, and risk review. However, the  department did not take key project risks into account. Senior  project officials indicated that staff members were often reluctant to  raise risks or issues to leadership due to the emphasis on keeping  the project on schedule. Accordingly, VA did not identify as risks (1)  using a noncompetitive acquisition approach, (2) conducting  concurrent testing and initiation of stage two testing with significant  defects, and (3) reporting unreliable project cost and schedule  performance information. Any one of these risks alone had the  potential to adversely impact the outcome of the project. The three  of them together dramatically increased the likelihood that the  project would not succeed. To improve management of the project  moving forward, we recommended that VA identify risks related to  the scheduling project and prepare plans and strategies to mitigate  them.   \u25cf  VA\u2019s oversight boards did not take corrective actions despite  the department becoming aware of significant issues. GAO and  OMB guidance call for the use of institutional management  processes to control and oversee IT investments. Critical to these  processes are milestone reviews that include mechanisms to  identify underperforming projects, so that timely steps can be taken  to address deficiencies. These reviews should be conducted by a  department-level investment review board composed of senior  executives. In this regard, VA\u2019s Enterprise Information Board was  established to provide oversight of IT projects through in-process  reviews when projects experience problems. Similarly, the  Programming and Long-Term Issues Board is responsible for  performing milestone reviews and program management reviews of  projects. However, between June 2006 and May 2008, the  department did not provide oversight of the Scheduling  Replacement Project, even though the department had become  aware that the project was having difficulty meeting its schedule  and performance goals. According to the chairman of the  Programming and Long-Term Issues Board, it did not conduct  reviews of the scheduling project prior to June 2008 because it was  focused on developing the department\u2019s IT budget strategy. To  address these deficiencies, in June 2009, VA began establishing the  Program Management Accountability System to promote visibility  into troubled programs and allow the department to take corrective  actions. We recommended that VA ensure the policies and  procedures it was establishing were executed effectively.", "In response to our report, VA concurred with our recommendations  and described its actions to address them. For example, the  department stated that it would work closely with contracting  officers to ensure future acquisition plans clearly identify an  acquisition strategy that promotes full and open competition. In  addition, the department stated that the Program Management  Accountability System will provide near-term visibility into troubled  programs, allowing the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Information and Technology to provide help earlier and avoid long- term project failures.", "In May 2011, VA\u2019s program manager stated that the department\u2019s  effort to develop a new outpatient scheduling system\u2014now referred  to as 21st Century Medical Scheduling\u2014consists largely of planning  activities, including the identification of requirements. However,  according to the manager, the project is not included in the  department\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget request. As a result, the  department\u2019s plans for addressing the limitations that it had  identified in its current scheduling system are uncertain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Partially Delivered New Education Benefits System Capabilities, but Can Improve Its Development Process", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the scheduling system project failure, VA has begun  implementing a new system for processing a recently established  education benefit for veterans. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides  educational assistance for veterans and members of the armed  forces who served on or after September 11, 2001. VA concluded  that its existing system and manual processes were insufficient to  support the new benefits. For instance, the system was not fully  integrated with other information systems such as VA\u2019s payments  system, requiring claims examiners to access as many as six  different systems and manually input claims data. Consequently,  claims examiners reportedly took up to six times longer to pay Post- 9/11 GI Bill program claims than other VA education benefit claims.  The challenges associated with its processing system contributed to  a backlog of 51,000 claims in December 2009. In response to this  situation, the department began an initiative to modernize its  benefits processing capabilities. VA chose an incremental  development approach, referred to as Agile software development,  which is intended to deliver functionality in short increments before  the system is fully deployed.", "In December 2010, we reported that VA had delivered key  automated capabilities used to process the new education benefits.  Specifically, it deployed the first two of four releases of its long-term  system solution by its planned dates, thereby providing regional  processing offices with key automated capabilities to prepare  original and amended benefits claims. Further, VA established Agile  practices including a cross-functional team that involves senior  management, governance boards, key stakeholders, and distinct  Agile roles and began using three other Agile practices\u2014focusing on  business priorities, delivering functionality in short increments, and  inspecting and adapting the project.", "However, to help guide the full development and implementation of  the new system, we reported that VA could make further  improvements to these practices in five areas.   1.  Business priorities. To ensure business priorities are a focus, a  project starts with a vision that contains, among other things, a  purpose, goals, metrics, and constraints. In addition, it should be  traceable to requirements. VA established a vision that captured  the project purpose and goals; however, it had not established  metrics for the project\u2019s goals or prioritized project constraints.  Department officials stated that project documentation was  evolving and they intended to improve their processes based on  lessons learned; however, until it identified metrics and  constraints, the department did not have the means to compare  the projected performance with the actual results. We  recommended that VA establish performance measures for goals  and identify constraints to provide better clarity in the vision and  expectations of the project.  2.  Traceability. VA had also established a plan that identified how  to maintain requirements traceability within an Agile  environment; however, the traceability was not always  maintained between legislation, policy, business rules, and test  cases. We recommended that VA establish bidirectional  traceability between requirements and legislation, policies, and  business rules.  3.  Definition of \u201cdone.\u201d To aid in delivering functionality in short  increments, defining what constitutes completed work and  testing functionality is critical. However, VA had not  established criteria for work that was considered \u201cdone\u201d at all  levels of the project. Program officials stated that each  development team had its own definition of \u201cdone\u201d and agreed  that they needed to provide a standard definition across all  teams. Without a mutual agreement for what constitutes \u201cdone\u201d  at each level, the resulting confusion can lead to inconsistent  quality. We therefore recommended that VA define the  conditions that must be present to consider work \u201cdone\u201d in  adherence with agency policy and guidance.  4.  Testing. While the department had established an incremental  testing approach, the quality of unit and functional testing  performed during Release 2 was inadequate in 10 of the 20  segments of system functionality we reviewed. Program officials  stated that they placed higher priority on user acceptance testing  at the end of a release and relied on users to identify defects that  were not detected during unit and functional testing. Without  improved testing quality, the department risks deploying future  releases that contain defects that may require rework. To reduce  defects and rework to fix them, we recommended that VA  improve the adequacy of the unit and functional testing  processes.  5.  Oversight. In order for projects to be effectively inspected and  adapted, management must have tools to provide effective  oversight. For Agile development, progress and the amount of  work remaining can be reflected in a burn-down chart, which  depicts how factors such as the rate at which work is completed  (velocity) and changes in overall product scope affect the project  over time. While VA had an oversight tool that showed the  percentage of work completed to reflect project status at the end  of each iteration, it did not depict the velocity of the work  completed and the changes to scope over time. We therefore  recommended that VA implement an oversight tool to clearly  communicate velocity and the changes to project scope over  time.", "VA concurred with three of our five recommendations. It did not  concur with our recommendation that it implement an oversight  tool to clearly communicate velocity. However, without this level of  visibility in its reporting, management and the development teams  may not have all the information they need to fully understand  project status. VA also did not concur with our recommendation to  improve the adequacy of the unit and functional testing processes to  reduce the amount of system rework. However, without increased  focus on the quality of testing early in the development process, VA  risks delaying functionality and/or deploying functionality with  unknown defects that could require future rework that may be  costly and ultimately impede the claims examiners\u2019 ability to  process claims efficiently.", "In early May 2011, we reported that the implementation of remaining  capabilities is behind schedule and additional modifications are  needed. According to VA officials, system enhancements such as  automatic verification of the length of service were delayed because  of complexities with systems integration and converting data from  the interim system. Additionally, recent legislative changes to the  program required VA to modify the system and its deployment  schedule. For instance, VA will need to modify its system to reflect  changes to the way tuition and fees are calculated\u2014an enhancement  that officials described as difficult to implement. Because of these  delays, final deployment of the system is now scheduled for the end  of 2011\u2014a year later than planned."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Continues to Face Information Security Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Effective information security controls are essential to securing the  information systems and information on which VA depends to carry  out its mission.

The consequence of  weak information security controls was illustrated by VA\u2019s May 2006  announcement that computer equipment containing personal  information on veterans and active duty military personnel had been  stolen. Further, over the last few years, VA has reported an  increasing number of security incidents and events.

In April 2008, VA estimated an $11 billion total cost  to complete the modernization by 2018. For its part, DOD has  obligated approximately $2 billion over the 13-year life of its Armed  Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and  requested $302 million in fiscal year 2011 funds for a new system.", "Additionally, VA and DOD are working to establish the Virtual  Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER), which is intended to facilitate  the sharing of electronic medical, benefits, and administrative  information between the departments. VLER is further intended to  expand the departments\u2019 health information sharing capabilities by  enabling access to private sector health data. The departments are  also developing joint IT capabilities for the James A. Lovell Federal  Health Care Center (FHCC) in North Chicago, Illinois. The FHCC is  to be the first VA/DOD medical facility operated under a single line  of authority to manage and deliver medical and dental care for  veterans, new Naval recruits, active duty military personnel,  retirees, and dependents.", "In February 2011, we reported that VA and DOD lacked mechanisms  for identifying and implementing efficient and effective IT solutions  to jointly address their common health care system needs as a result  of barriers in three key IT management areas\u2014strategic planning,  enterprise architecture, and investment management.", "Strategic planning: The departments were unable to articulate  explicit plans, goals, and time frames for jointly addressing the  health IT requirements common to both departments\u2019 electronic  health record systems. For example, VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s joint strategic  plan did not discuss how or when the departments propose to  identify and develop joint health IT solutions, and department  officials did not determine whether the IT capabilities developed for  the FHCC could or would be implemented at other VA and DOD  medical facilities.", "Enterprise architecture: Although VA and DOD had taken steps  toward developing and maintaining artifacts related to a joint health  architecture (i.e., a description of business processes and  supporting technologies), the architecture was not sufficiently  mature to guide the departments\u2019 joint health IT modernization  efforts. For example, the departments did not define how they  intended to transition from their current architecture to a planned  future state.", "Investment management: VA and DOD did not establish a joint  process for selecting IT investments based on criteria that consider  cost, benefit, schedule, and risk elements, which would help to  ensure that a chosen solution both meets the departments\u2019 common  health IT needs and provides better value and benefits to the  government as a whole.", "These barriers resulted in part from VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s decision to  focus on developing VLER, modernizing their separate electronic  health record systems, and developing IT capabilities for FHCC,  rather than determining the most efficient and effective approach to  jointly addressing their common requirements. Because VA and  DOD continued to pursue their existing health information sharing  efforts without fully establishing the key IT management capabilities  described, they may have missed opportunities to successfully  deploy joint solutions to address their common health care business  needs.", "VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s experiences in developing VLER and IT capabilities  for FHCC offered important lessons to improve the departments\u2019  management of these ongoing efforts. Specifically, the departments  can improve the likelihood of successfully meeting their goal to  implement VLER nationwide by the end of 2012 by developing an  approved plan that is consistent with effective IT project  management principles. Also, VA and DOD can improve their  continuing effort to develop and implement new IT system  capabilities for FHCC by developing a plan that defines the project\u2019s  scope, estimated cost, and schedule in accordance with established  best practices. Unless VA and DOD address these lessons, the  departments will jeopardize their ability to deliver expected  capabilities to support their joint health IT needs.", "We recommended several actions that the Secretaries of Veterans  Affairs and Defense could take to overcome barriers that the  departments face in modernizing their electronic health record  systems to jointly address their common health care business needs,  including the following:    Revise the departments\u2019 joint strategic plan to include information  discussing their electronic health record system modernization  efforts and how those efforts will address the departments\u2019 common  health care business needs.", "Further develop the departments\u2019 joint health architecture to  include their planned future state and transition plan from their  current state to the next generation of electronic health record  capabilities.", "Define and implement a process, including criteria that considers  costs, benefits, schedule, and risks, for identifying and selecting  joint IT investments to meet the departments\u2019 common health care  business needs.", "We also recommended that the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and  Defense strengthen their ongoing efforts to establish VLER and the  joint IT system capabilities for FHCC by developing plans that  include scope definition, cost and schedule estimation, and project  plan documentation and approval.", "Both departments concurred with our recommendations and on  March 17, 2011, the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense  committed their respective departments to pursue joint  development and acquisition of integrated electronic health record  capabilities.", "In summary, effective IT management is critical to the performance  of VA\u2019s mission. However, the department faces challenges in key  areas, including systems development, information security, and  collaboration with DOD. Until VA fully addresses these and  implements key recommendations, the department will likely  continue to (1) deliver system capabilities later than expected; (2)  expose its computer systems and sensitive information (including  personal information of veterans and their beneficiaries) to an  unnecessary and increased risk of unauthorized use, disclosure,  tampering, theft, and destruction; and (3) not provide efficient and  effective joint DOD/VA solutions to meet the needs of our nation\u2019s  veterans.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement today.
