Over the past several years, the U.S. work environment has changed in such a way that achieving this mission is more difficult. For example, the strength of international competition has made us increasingly aware of the need for a skilled labor force. At the same time, large numbers of individuals in this country remain unprepared for such employment. Also, changes in employer/employee relations, such as increased use of part-time and contract employees, pose new challenges for worker protection. In addition, the public is demanding more accountability from government agencies such as Labor\u2014more assurance that their tax dollars are not being wasted and that government is operated according to sound business practices.", "Today, I would like to discuss two major challenges Labor faces in achieving its mission: first, providing effective employment training programs that meet the diverse needs of its target populations in a cost-efficient manner and, second, ensuring worker protection within a flexible regulatory structure. In addition, I want to discuss how Labor\u2019s ability to meet these challenges would be enhanced by the improved management envisioned by recent legislation. continue to have a patchwork of federal programs with similar goals, conflicting requirements, overlapping target populations, and questionable outcomes. As you know, comprehensive legislation that would have addressed this fragmentation was considered but not passed by the 104th Congress. In the absence of consolidation legislation, Labor has gone ahead with some reforms, such as planning grants for one-stop career centers, but the actions it has taken have not been enough to fix the problems. Now, passage of the recent welfare reform legislation puts even greater demands on an employment training system that appears unprepared to respond.", "A second major challenge for Labor is to develop regulatory strategies that ensure the well-being of the nations\u2019 workers in a less burdensome, more effective manner. Labor has made some changes since we last testified, which are perhaps best illustrated by actions at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), such as its partnership initiatives with companies. But OSHA\u2019s actions have not been without controversy, and substantial challenges remain there and at other Labor components with worker protection responsibilities. Congressional action poses new challenges in the worker protection area as well. Labor has committed to redesigning its Davis-Bacon wage determination process with additional funds appropriated by the Congress. Labor also must issue and enforce regulations to implement the new health insurance portability law.", "In meeting these mission challenges, Labor will need to become more effective at managing its organization. The Department of Labor, like other federal agencies, is confronted by management problems that impede its ability to carry out its mission efficiently and effectively. Major pieces of legislation that provide a statutory framework for improving agency operations and accountability include (1) the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), which requires agencies to focus on results as they define their missions and desired outcomes, measure performance, and use that performance information; (2) the expanded Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, which requires agencies to prepare financial statements that can pass the test of an independent audit and provide decisionmakers reliable financial information; and (3) the 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act and the 1996 Clinger-Cohen Act, which are intended to help agencies better manage their information resources and make wiser investments in information technology.

Labor also protects workers\u2019 pension rights; provides for job training programs; helps workers find jobs; works to strengthen free collective bargaining; and keeps track of changes in employment, prices, and other national economic measures.

Labor\u2019s employment training programs include multiple programs authorized by the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), such as those for economically disadvantaged adults and youth and workers who lose their jobs because of plant closings or downsizing and Job Corps, an intensive residential program for severely disadvantaged youth.

Alternatively, the Congress could spend the same amount of money and serve more people.", "Further, consolidating similar employment training programs could result in improved opportunities to increase effectiveness in service delivery. For example, consolidating programs could improve the assistance provided to the target populations because individuals would be more likely to receive the mix of services needed to achieve training or placement goals. And, getting needed services might be less confusing and frustrating to clients, employers, and administrators.", "In anticipation of federal consolidation legislation, and to improve their local service delivery, many states are moving ahead with their own consolidation plans. Labor has engaged in several efforts to assist states in these consolidation efforts. For example, Labor has promoted the development of \u201cone-stop career centers.\u201d These centers are designed to transform an array of employment training programs into an integrated service delivery system for job-seekers and employers. Labor expects them to identify the jobs that are available, the skills they require, and the institutions that have proven track records of preparing people for new work. This information will probably be available largely through computer links. As of February 1996, 54 states and jurisdictions had received planning or implementation grants to establish one-stop centers.", "In addition, Labor and the Department of Education jointly administer the school-to-work program\u2014a program designed to build integrated learning and employment opportunities for youth.

It has also conducted some evaluations to assess the impact of its programs. However, our reviews have shown that existing performance measures and studies still do not provide the kind of information that would provide confidence that funds are being spent to the greatest advantage of participants. Our reviews of the Job Corps program illustrate some of the weaknesses in current data collection and evaluation efforts.", "Job Corps is a national employment training program that provides severely disadvantaged youth with comprehensive services, generally in a residential setting, at a cost of about $1 billion a year to serve about 66,000 participants. Job Corps has a list of performance measures on which the over 100 individual centers are ranked each year. Moreover, to demonstrate the effectiveness of Job Corps, Labor cites the positive results of a national impact study. We have raised questions, however, about how valuable the information from these sources is in determining whether the high costs are justified by program outcomes.", "Jobs Corps reported that, nationally, 59 percent of its students obtained jobs in fiscal year 1993. However, when we surveyed a sample of employers identified in Job Corps records, we were left with serious concerns about the validity of reported job placement information. Despite Job Corps placement verification procedures, we found that about 15 percent of the reported placements in our sample were potentially invalid. In addition, we found that about half of the jobs obtained by students from the sites we visited were low-skill jobs\u2014such as fast food worker\u2014unrelated to the training provided by Job Corps.", "Labor initiated a major impact evaluation of the Jobs Corps program.

The responsibility for service delivery lies with state and local offices, yet Labor has an important role because of its expertise and experience. Labor can encourage and facilitate, as appropriate, the integration of employment training services that may be required to meet the needs of the welfare population.", "How to serve those individuals transitioning from welfare to work, while at the same time meeting the service needs of dislocated workers and other client populations, is a challenge for Labor. Concerns have been raised about the availability of appropriate jobs, the level of training and skills required for jobs, the impact of competition for low-skilled jobs on the wages of low-skilled workers, and the extent to which the current employment training system can absorb and provide needed services to the expanded welfare population.", "In addition, it is critical that Labor and other agencies providing services consider the employment training needs of welfare clients in the process of providing job placement assistance. Our work on promising employment training practices shows that providing occupational skills alone is not the answer. Equally, or perhaps even more, important are employability skills\u2014the ability not only to get a job but to keep a job.Concerns have been raised that in the rush to place welfare clients in jobs, if the appropriate mix of skills is not provided, many clients potentially will lose their jobs and go back on welfare. to monitor the situation and be responsive to the needs of states and localities as they transition individuals from welfare to work.

In May 1995, the administration announced three regulatory reform initiatives to \u201cenhance safety, trim paperwork, and transform OSHA.\u201d This action was considered necessary because, despite OSHA\u2019s efforts, the number of workplace injuries and illnesses was still too high, with over 6,000 workers dying each year from workplace injuries and 6 million suffering nonfatal workplace injuries. In addition, the administration acknowledged that the public saw OSHA as driven too often by numbers and rules, not by smart enforcement and results. The first initiative, the \u201cNew OSHA,\u201d called for OSHA to change its fundamental operating paradigm from one of command and control to one that provides employers a real choice between partnership and a traditional enforcement relationship. The second initiative, \u201cCommon Sense Regulation,\u201d called for a change in approach by identifying clear and sensible priorities, focusing on key building block rules, eliminating or updating and clarifying out-of-date and confusing standards, and emphasizing interaction with business and labor in the development of rules.

We pointed out that agencies could use awarding federal contracts as a vehicle to encourage companies to improve workplace safety and health or\u2014if companies refuse to improve working conditions\u2014debar or suspend federal contractors for violation of safety and health regulations. One of our recommendations was that OSHA work with the General Services Administration and the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension on policies and procedures regarding how safety and health records of federal contractors could be shared to help agency awarding and debarring officials in their decisionmaking.

According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), developing an overall mission and goals is a formidable challenge for Labor because of the diversity of the functions performed by its different offices. OMB officials have told us that the different offices in Labor have developed draft strategic plans that describe their respective goals and performance indicators. For example, ETA\u2019s plan describes its mission, its strategies for achieving its employment training objectives, and the measures it will use to assess program outcomes. These plans were submitted to OMB with the Department\u2019s most recent budget submission.

We found a lack of both computer software and hardware that could assist wage analysts in their reviews. For example, Labor offices did not have computer software that could detect grossly inaccurate data reported in Labor\u2019s surveys to obtain wage data. And the hardware was so outdated that the computers had too little memory to store historical data on prior wage determinations, which would have allowed wage analysts to compare current data with prior recommendations for wage determinations in a given locality. not reconcilable to Job Corps contractor reports.
