The Future Combat Systems (FCS)--which the Army calls the \"greatest technology and integration challenge ever undertaken\"--is expected to meet the Army's transformational objectives. Forming FCS' backbone is an information network that links 18 systems. Not only is FCS to play a pivotal role in the Army's military operations, FCS and its future iterations are expected to eventually replace all Army forces. For FCS' first developmental increment, the Army has set aside a 5 1/2-year timetable from program start (May 2003) until the initial production decision (November 2008). GAO was asked to testify about FCS' key features, whether the program carries any risks, and, if so, whether there are alternatives for developing FCS capabilities with fewer risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The FCS concept is a new generation of manned and unmanned ground vehicles, air vehicles, and munitions, each of which taps into a secure network of superior combat information. These weapon systems are to be a fraction of the weight of current weapons yet as lethal and survivable. FCS' lightweight and small size are critical to meeting the Army's goals of deploying faster and being more transportable for big or small military operations. Rather than rely on heavy armor to withstand an enemy attack, FCS' systems will depend on superior communications to kill the enemy before being detected. One of FCS' key advantages is that it provides an architecture within which individual systems will be designed--an improvement over designing systems independently and making them interoperable after the fact. Another merit is that FCS is being acquired and developed with the full cooperation of the Army's program managers, contractors, and the warfighter community. FCS is at significant risk for not delivering required capability within budgeted resources. Three-fourths of FCS' needed technologies were still immature when the program started. The first prototypes of FCS will not be delivered until just before the production decision. Full demonstration of FCS' ability to work as an overarching system will not occur until after production has begun. This demonstration assumes complete success-- including delivery and integration of numerous complementary systems that are not inherently a part of FCS but are essential for FCS to work as a whole. When taking into account the lessons learned from commercial best practices and the experiences of past programs, the FCS strategy is likely to result in cost and schedule consequences if problems are discovered late in development. Because it is promising to deliver unprecedented performance capabilities to the warfighter community, the Army has little choice but to meet a very high standard and has limited flexibility in cutting FCS requirements. Because the cost already dominates its investment budget, the Army may find it difficult to find other programs to cut in order to further fund FCS. To avoid unanticipated cost and schedule problems late in development, several alternatives can be considered: (1) add time to FCS' acquisition schedule to reduce concurrent development; (2) take the time to develop and demonstrate the most critical capabilities first, such as the FCS network, then proceed with an acquisition program; and (3) focus on maturing the most critical technologies first, then bundle them in demonstrations of capabilities, and ensure that decision makers have attained the knowledge they need at critical junctures before moving forward."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of the Army\u2019s  Future Combat Systems (FCS), a networked suite of weapons and other  systems.

The manned ground vehicles are to be a fraction  of the weight of current weapons such as the Abrams tank and Bradley  Fighting Vehicle, yet are to be as lethal and survivable. At a fundamental  level, the FCS concept is replacing mass with superior information; that is,  to see and hit the enemy first, rather than to rely on heavy armor to  withstand attack. The ability to make this leap depends on (1) the ability  of the network to collect, process, and deliver vast amounts of information  such as imagery and communications and (2) the performance of the  individual systems themselves.

The Future Force will be offensively oriented and  will employ revolutionary operational concepts, enabled by new  technology. This force will fight very differently than the Army has in the  past, using easily transportable lightweight vehicles, rather than traditional  heavily armored vehicles. A key characteristic of this force is agility. Agile  forces would possess the ability to seamlessly and quickly transition  among various types of operations from support operations to warfighting  and back again. They would adapt faster than the enemy, thereby denying  it the initiative. In an agile force, commanders of small units may not have  the time to wait on higher command levels; they must have the authority  and high quality information at their level to act quickly to respond to  dynamic situations.", "Thus, to be successful, the transformation must include more than new  weapons.

As such, their development is  crucial to the FCS network. The communications backbone of the Unit of  Action will be a multi-layered mobile network centered on the Joint  Tactical Radio System. According to program officials, all soldiers and  FCS vehicles, including the unmanned vehicles, will employ these radios.  Beyond being the primary communications component within the unit, the  Joint Tactical Radio System also will assist with communications beyond  the unit, to assets at higher echelons. Communications with those  echelons will be enabled through the Warfighter Information  Network-Tactical, which provides the overarching network background  for the FCS network and is expected to conform to DOD\u2019s interoperability  and network architecture directives.", "Increment 1 began system development and demonstration in May 2003.

These can be described in four characteristics: lethality,  survivability, responsiveness, and sustainability. The Unit of Action is to  be as lethal as the current heavy force. It must have the capability to  address the combat situation, set conditions, maneuver to positions of  advantage, and close with and destroy enemy formations at longer ranges  and greater precision than the current force. To provide this level of  lethality and reduce the risk of detection, FCS must provide high  single-shot effectiveness. To be as survivable as the current heavy force,  the Unit of Action is primarily dependent upon the ability to kill the enemy  before being detected. This depends on unit\u2019s ability to see first,  understand first, act first, and finish decisively. The individual FCS  systems will also rely on a layered system of protection involving several  technologies that lowers the chances of a vehicle or other system being  seen by the enemy; if seen, lowers the chances of being acquired; if  acquired, lowers the chances of being hit; if hit, lowers the chances of  being penetrated; and finally, if penetrated, increases the chances of  surviving. To be responsive, Units of Action must be able to rapidly deploy  anywhere in the world, be rapidly transportable via various transport  modes, and be ready to fight upon arrival. To facilitate rapid  transportability, FCS vehicles are being designed to match the weight and  size constraints of the C-130 aircraft. The Unit of Action is to be capable  of sustaining itself for periods of 3 to 7 days depending on the level of  conflict. This sustainability requires subsystems with high reliability and  low maintenance, reduced demand for fuel and water, highly effective  offensive weapons, and a fuel-efficient engine.", "Meeting all these requirements will be a difficult challenge because the  solution to meet one requirement may work against another requirement.  For example, the FCS vehicles\u2019 small size and lighter weight are factors  that improve agility, responsiveness, and deployability. However, their  lighter weight precludes the use of the traditional means to achieve  survivability\u2014heavy armor. Instead, the FCS program must use  cutting-edge technology to develop systems, such as an active protection  system, to achieve survivability. Yet such technology cannot be adopted if  it impairs the new systems\u2019 reliability and maintainability. Weight,  survivability, and reliability will have to be kept in balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Merits of the Concept", "paragraphs": ["The essence of the FCS concept itself\u2014to provide the lethality and  survivability of the current heavy force with the sustainability and  deployability of a force that weighs a fraction as much\u2014has the intrinsic  attraction of doing more with less.

This architecture is a significant  improvement over the traditional approach of building superior individual  weapons that must be netted together after the fact. Also, the system of  systems network and weapons could give acquisition managers the  flexibility to make best value trade-offs across traditional program lines.", "This transformation of the Army, both in terms of operations and in  equipment, is underway with the full cooperation of the Army warfighter  community. In fact, the development and acquisition of FCS are being  done using a collaborative relationship between the developer (program  manager), the contractor, and the warfighter community. For example, the  developer and the warfighter are using a disciplined approach to  decompose the Unit of Action Organizational and Operational Plan and the  FCS Operational Requirements Document into detailed specifications.  This work is defining in detail the requirements for a Unit of Action to  operate in a network-centric environment. This approach is in line with  best practices to ensure that specific technical issues are understood  before significant design work is done.", "The Army has established sustainability as a design characteristic equal to  lethality and survivability. This is an improvement over past programs,  such as the Apache helicopter and the Abrams tank. These programs did  not emphasize sustainability, to less than desirable results, including  costly maintenance problems and low readiness rates, which persisted  even after the systems were fielded. FCS\u2019 approach of emphasizing  sustainability from the outset should allow operating and support costs  and readiness to be evaluated early in development, when there is a  greater chance to affect those costs positively.

However, the radio frequency spectrum is a  finite resource, and there is a great deal of competition and demand for it.

Testing and demonstration will continue until the full rate production  decision in mid-2013.", "The initial operational capability is planned for December 2010.", "With the FCS concurrent strategy, much demonstration of knowledge will  occur late in development and early in production, as technologies mature,  prototypes are delivered, and the network and systems are brought  together as a system of systems. This makes the program susceptible to  \u201clate cycle churn,\u201d a condition that we reported on in 2000. Late cycle  churn is a phrase private industry has used to describe the efforts to fix a  significant problem that is discovered late in a product\u2019s development.  Often, it is a test that reveals the problem. The churn refers to the  additional\u2014and unanticipated\u2014time, money, and effort that must be  invested to overcome the problem. Problems are most devastating when  they delay product delivery, increase product cost, or \u201cescape\u201d to  the customer.", "The discovery of problems in testing conducted late in development is a  fairly common occurrence on DOD programs, as is the attendant late cycle  churn. Often, tests of a full system, such as launching a missile or flying an  aircraft, become the vehicles for discovering problems that could have  been found earlier and corrected less expensively. When significant  problems are revealed late in a weapon system\u2019s development, the  reaction\u2014or churn\u2014can take several forms: extending schedules to  increase the investment in more prototypes and testing, terminating the  program, or redesigning and modifying weapons that have already made it  to the field. Over the years, we have reported numerous instances in which  weapon system problems were discovered late in the development cycle.", "The Army has embarked on an impressive plan to mitigate risk using  modeling, simulation, emulation, hardware in the loop, and system  integration laboratories throughout FCS development. This is a laudable  approach designed to reduce the dependence on late testing to gain  valuable information about design progress. However, on a first-of-a-kind  system like FCS that represents a radical departure from current systems,  actual testing of all the components integrated together is the final proof  that the system works both as predicted and as needed.", "If the FCS strategy does not deliver the system of systems as planned, the  Army is still prepared to go forward with production and fielding. The  Army\u2019s Acquisition Strategy Report states that at the Initial Production  Decision, all elements of the FCS may not be ready for initial production  and will require a continuation of system development and demonstration  efforts to complete integration and testing in accordance with the  program\u2013tailoring plan. For those that need more time, FCS program  manager will present to the Milestone Decision Authority a path forward,  with supporting analysis. In addition, the Army will accept existing  systems in lieu of actual FCS systems to reach initial operational  capability."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to FCS Strategy Merit Consideration", "paragraphs": ["We have reported on options that warrant consideration as alternatives for  developing FCS capabilities with less risk. Alternatives are still viable and  worth considering, particularly before major funding and programmatic  commitments are made. If the FCS program proceeds as planned and does  experience problems later in development, it may pose a real dilemma for  decision makers. Typically, performance, schedule, and cost problems on  weapon system programs are accommodated by lowering requirements  and increasing funding. If the FCS program proceeds on its current path  until problems occur in demonstration, traditional solutions may not be  available because of the significant role it must fulfill and its financial  magnitude."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alternatives Featuring Lowering FCS Performance or Increasing Funds May Be Difficult", "paragraphs": ["While there is a significant amount of potential flexibility among the  various FCS systems and technologies, collectively the system of systems  has to meet a very high standard. It has to be as lethal and survivable as  the current force and its combat vehicles have to be a fraction of the  weight of current vehicles to be air transportable on the C-130 aircraft.  These \u201cmust haves\u201d constrain the flexibility in relaxing requirements for  the FCS system of systems.", "The opportunity for increasing funds to cover cost increases poses a  challenge because FCS already dominates the Army\u2019s investment budget.  It might be difficult to find enough other programs to cut or defer to offset  FCS increases. Assuming the Army\u2019s acquisition cost estimates are  accurate and the program will succeed according to plan, the FCS  investment for even the first increment is huge\u2014$92 billion (in then-year  dollars). These assumptions are optimistic as risks make problems likely,  the cost estimate was based on an immature program, and budget  forecasts have already forced deferral of four FCS systems. As estimated,  FCS will command a significant share of the Army\u2019s acquisition budget,  particularly that of ground combat vehicles, for the foreseeable future.  In fiscal year 2005, the FCS budget request of $3.2 billion accounts for  52 percent of the Army\u2019s proposed research, development, test and  evaluation spending on programs in system development and  demonstration and 31 percent of that expected for all Army research,  development, test, and evaluation activities. See figure 4 for FCS costs  through 2016.", "The ramp up in FCS research and development funding is very steep, going  from $157 million in fiscal 2003 to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2004 to a projected  $3.2 billion in fiscal years 2005 and topping out at about $4.3 billion in  fiscal 2006. FCS procurement funding is projected to start in fiscal 2007 at  $750 million and ramp up to an average of about $3.2 billion in fiscal years  2008 and 2009. In late development (2008-2009) the total FCS costs will run  about $5 billion per year. After 2008, FCS will command nearly 100 percent  of the funding for procurement of Army ground combat vehicles. After  2011, FCS costs will run nearly $9 billion annually to procure enough FCS  equipment for two Units of Action per year. According to Army officials, it  is not yet clear that the Army can afford this level of annual procurement  funding for FCS. The consequences of even modest cost increases and  schedule delays for FCS would be dramatic. For example, we believe that  a 1-year delay late in FCS development, not an uncommon occurrence for  other DOD programs, could cost $4 billion to $5 billion. A modest  10 percent increase in production cost would amount to over $7 billion.", "In a broader context, any discussion of DOD\u2019s sizeable investment that  remains in the FCS program must also be viewed within the context of the  fiscal imbalance facing the nation within the next 10 years. There are  important competing priorities, both within and external to DOD\u2019s budget,  that require a sound and sustainable business case for DOD\u2019s acquisition  programs based on clear priorities, comprehensive needs assessments,  and a thorough analysis of available resources. Funding specific program  or activities will undoubtedly create shortfalls in others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives for Proceeding", "paragraphs": ["Alternatives to developing FCS capabilities that do not follow a concurrent  strategy are feasible, if acted upon early enough. Alternatives should have  the common elements of building more knowledge before making program  commitments; preserving the advantages of the FCS concept, such as  defining an architecture before individual systems are developed; and  spinning off mature technologies to systems already fielded. Alternatives  that would allow for building such knowledge include:    Adding more time to the FCS program with its scope intact to reduce  concurrency would lower risk. However, until technologies are mature  and more is known about whether the FCS concept will work, there still  would not be a sound basis for estimating how much time will be needed  to build the knowledge needed to complete system development and  demonstration.", "Focus on the development and demonstration of its most critical  capabilities first, such as the network. This could be done by conducting  one or more advanced technology demonstrations to reduce technical  and integration risks in critical areas, then proceed with an acquisition  program. This would take more time than if the current FCS schedule  were successfully carried out.", "Focus on maturing the most critical technologies first, then bundle them in  demonstrations of capabilities, such as Advanced Concept Technology  Demonstrations, then proceed with an acquisition program that would  attain sufficient knowledge at the right acquisition junctures.
