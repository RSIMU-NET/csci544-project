To improve oversight of its acquisition function, NOAA reorganized in 2005 by having all acquisition divisions report to the NOAA Director of Acquisition and Grants. However, NOAA's acquisition director still lacks direct line authority to oversee a National Weather Service field office that is responsible for one of the agency's contracts worth up to half a billion dollars. Also, without appropriate oversight from the acquisition organization, collateral duty field staff who are not career contracting officers have bought millions of dollars in goods and services. Our work has shown that a well-functioning acquisition organization has direct lines of oversight between the head of acquisition and various components to help enforce policies that enable efficient and effective contract spending. Although NOAA has established clear and consistent policies for some key areas, such as advance acquisition planning, the agency lacks a knowledge-based process for developing and producing complex systems--a situation that can increase the risk of cost increases and schedule delays. NOAA is missing key elements that promote successful outcomes for complex developmental systems because it must adhere to Commerce's acquisition policies that do not support a knowledge-based approach. Without such an approach, the multibillion-dollar satellite investment that NOAA is in the early stages of acquiring is at a higher risk of not meeting program requirements. NOAA has yet to focus on succession planning and management for its contracting workforce, although the agency is pursuing hiring flexibilities to recruit new contracting employees in anticipation of an impending wave of retirements. NOAA is facing a human capital challenge because of its aging contracting workforce and has reported that about 43 percent of contracting employees are now eligible to retire or will be eligible to retire by 2009. While senior acquisition managers are concerned with the loss of a high percentage of their contracting staff to retirement and other attrition, NOAA has not specifically addressed such contracting workforce challenges in its strategic human capital plan. Also, it is unclear whether human capital planning under way by Commerce will determine the gaps in numbers and skills in the contracting workforce.

To ensure that contracting employees are adhering to proper  procedures, NOAA instituted periodic acquisition management reviews.  Under these reviews NOAA\u2019s acquisition director (or a senior contracting  officer appointed by the director) personally inspects a sample of  completed contract files from an acquisition division in order to identify  and remedy any systemic problem areas and identify best practices to  share with other divisions.

For example, all staff offices and programs must  develop annual acquisition plans that include acquisitions that are over  $100,000 or expected to result in new contracts. To support these new  planning requirements and provide real-time data, the acquisition office  deployed an online strategic acquisition management tool in fall 2005, in  which NOAA staff offices and programs enter their annual acquisition  plans for the upcoming fiscal year.

Commerce officials  acknowledged that their acquisition policy for developing major systems is  outdated and said they are revising it. While the current policy identifies  key decision points that a program must complete while acquiring a  complex developmental system, it still lacks key features of a knowledge- based acquisition framework\u2014specific criteria and metrics\u2014that can be  used to measure whether a program is ready to move through each key  decision point.", "Our work has shown that leading developers in industry and government  organizations use a knowledge-based approach to deliver high-quality  products on time and within budget.

The Secretary of  Commerce\u2019s Office of Acquisition Management and Financial Assistance  hired a contractor to develop a human capital plan for the department\u2019s  contracting workforce. However, it is too early to determine if this  Commerce-wide plan will determine the gaps in numbers and skills in the  contracting workforce to achieve mission-critical work and develop  strategies to address these gaps. Until this assessment of the contracting  workforce is completed at the departmental level, NOAA will be hard  pressed to make its own assessment. Also recognizing a critical staffing  shortage, in January 2006, Commerce approved NOAA\u2019s use of flexible  direct hire authority to recruit qualified individuals. Civilian agency heads  are authorized to determine if a shortage exists in certain federal  acquisition positions so that persons with high qualifications can be  recruited and directly hired. Direct hire authority allows an agency the  flexibility to appoint individuals to positions without adherence to certain  competitive examination requirements.

Our  work has shown that to recruit, develop, and retain the right number of  people with the right skills to support mission needs, leading organizations  go beyond a succession planning approach that focuses on simply  replacing individuals and engage in broad, integrated succession planning  and management efforts that focus on strengthening both current and  future organizational capacity. A key part of succession planning and  management is to identify the talent required to achieve organizational  goals. To that end, effective human capital planning involves   (1) identifying the gaps in skills and competencies that need to be filled to  achieve current and future mission-critical work, (2) developing strategies  that are tailored to address these gaps, and (3) monitoring and evaluating  the progress toward closing the gaps, and adjusting strategies accordingly.

Achieving a high level of technology maturity at the start of system  development acquisition is an important indicator of whether this  match has been made such that the technologies needed to meet  essential product requirements have been demonstrated to work in  their intended environment.", "Knowledge point 2: Product design is stable. This point occurs when  a program determines that a product\u2019s design will meet customer  requirements and cost, schedule, and reliability targets. A best practice  is to achieve design stability at the system-level critical design review  usually held midway through development. Completion of at least   90 percent of engineering drawings at the system design review  provides tangible evidence that the design is stable.", "Knowledge point 3: Production processes are mature and the design  is reliable. This is demonstrated when a product can be manufactured  within cost, schedule, and quality targets. A best practice is to ensure  that all key manufacturing processes are in statistical control\u2014they are  repeatable, sustainable, and capable of consistently producing parts  within the product\u2019s quality tolerances and standards\u2014at the start of  production.", "The attainment of each successive knowledge point builds on the  preceding one. While the knowledge itself builds continuously without  clear lines of demarcation, the attainment of knowledge points is  sequential. In other words, production maturity cannot be attained if the  critical technologies are not mature.", "This knowledge-based approach is not just applicable to improving how  the Department of Defense manages the acquisition of weapon systems.  As we have recently reported, utilizing a knowledge-based approach to  manage complex developmental system acquisitions can likewise help  civilian agencies reduce risk by ensuring high levels of knowledge are  attained on individual acquisitions at key decision points, thereby enabling  senior leaders to make informed investment decisions. A knowledge- based approach can also provide inexperienced program managers the  necessary guidance to implement good management practices and ensure  that the correct data are on hand for decision makers. Further, the  methodology used by successful program managers to acquire complex  developmental systems does not differ based upon each individual system  being acquired. Notwithstanding the type of system being acquired, these  managers follow a regimented process that uses common and consistent  criteria for decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Lisa Shames, (202) 512-4841 or shamesl@gao.gov."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Carolyn Kirby, Assistant  Director; Ian Jefferies; Jose Ramos; Sylvia Schatz; Bob Swierczek; and  Greg Wilmoth made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
