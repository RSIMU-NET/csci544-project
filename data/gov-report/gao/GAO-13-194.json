Section 2464 directs DOD to provide a Biennial Core Report to Congress and include three elements: (1) core capability requirements, (2) planned workloads, and (3) explanations and mitigation plans for any shortfalls between core capability requirements and planned workloads. In response to a requirement in Section 2464, GAO assessed the extent to which the report complied with the statute and included supporting information from the services as required by DOD.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) reported core capability requirements totaling about 70 million direct labor hours for the military services. Also, OSD reported a total of about 92 million direct labor hours for planned workloads with an estimated cost of about $12 billion. OSD reported complete information on core requirements and planned workload at the top-level categories, such as Sea Ships, of the work breakdown structure. The statute directs that this information be organized by work breakdown structure, which is a group of categories of equipment and technologies. The top-level category--an entire type of system or equipment--can be broken down into lower levels of detail or subcategories, such as Aircraft Carriers or Submarines, that make up the system or equipment. DOD's overall planned workloads exceed its core capability requirements, but the report shows shortfalls in certain categories for the Army and the Air Force.", "The report partially complies with the third biennial reporting element. DOD's report includes information on shortfalls at the top-level categories and plans to mitigate all shortfalls--where requirements exceed planned workload--identified in the report. However, the report does not include required information on the rationale for some of these shortfalls--reasons why the services do not have the workload to meet core requirements. The Navy and Marine Corps did not identify any shortfalls and were not required to provide explanations or mitigation plans. The report includes mitigation plans for shortfalls identified by the Army and the Air Force but does not always provide detailed explanations for why the Army and Air Force do not have sufficient planned workload to meet core requirements. The report does not always include detailed explanations for identified workload shortfalls, because the Army and Air Force did not always provide explanations for them.

To  sustain these systems and equipment, at the depot level, the department  uses a combination of military depots\u2014public-sector facilities that are  government-owned and government-operated\u2014and private-sector  contractors.

We found, among other things,  that DOD\u2019s method of compiling and internally reporting core capability  requirements and planned workloads did not reveal shortfalls between the  requirements and the planned workloads for specific categories of  weapon systems or equipment that we had identified. Further, we found  that Congress lacked visibility into DOD\u2019s process, because there was no  requirement for DOD to provide its Biennial Core Report to Congress.

The instruction describes a series of  mathematical computations and adjustments, which the military services  use to compute their core capability requirements and to identify planned  workloads needed to support these requirements. First, the services  identify the weapon systems required to execute the Joint Chiefs of Staff  contingency scenarios, which represent plans for responding to conflicts  that may occur in the future. After the systems are identified, the services  compute annual depot maintenance capability requirements for  peacetime in direct labor hours to represent the amount of time they  regularly take to perform required maintenance. Then contingency  requirements and resource adjustments are made to account for  applicable surge factors during the different phases of a contingency,  such as preparation/readiness and sustainment. Further adjustments are  made to account for redundancy in depot capability. For example, a  service may determine that repair capabilities for specific systems  maintained in military depots are so similar that the capabilities for one  system can effectively satisfy the requirements of another. Core capability  requirements are also adjusted when one service\u2019s maintenance  requirements will be supported by the maintenance capabilities of other  services.", "During this process of identifying the systems for which they will be  required to maintain repair capabilities, the services organize and  aggregate their capability data by categories of equipment and  technologies known as work breakdown structure categories. The work  breakdown structure provides a way for DOD to break down a category of  weapon system or equipment into subcategories of its parts at  increasingly lower levels of detail. The work breakdown structure can be  expressed at any level of detail down to the lowest-level part, such as a  bolt. These categories, the programs or systems they include, and the  lower-level elements or subcategories of defense materiel or equipment  into which they are broken down are referred to by DOD as \u201clevels of  indenture.\u201d There are eleven categories at the top level\u2014\u201cfirst\u201d level\u2014of  the work breakdown structure. A first-level category summarizes  information for an entire type of system or equipment, such as aircraft or  ground vehicles.

For example, the first-level category  for Aircraft can be broken down into the second-level subcategories for  Airframes, Aircraft Components, and Aircraft Engines, which are major  elements that make up an aircraft. The second-level subcategories can  be further broken down into third-level subcategories, which are  subordinate elements that make up the major elements in the second- level categories. For example, the second-level subcategory for Airframes  is further divided into the third-level subcategories\u2014different types of  airframes, such as Rotary, Fighter/Attack, or Bomber.
