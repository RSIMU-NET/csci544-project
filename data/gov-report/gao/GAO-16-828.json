For example, USCIS is leveraging overseas staff to investigate potential fraud associated with unlawful sources of immigrant investor funds and is conducting a site visit pilot to help assess the potential risks of fraud among EB-5 program investments. USCIS is also taking steps to collect more information about EB-5 program investments and immigrant investors through new, revised forms and expanding its use of background checks, among other things, to help improve its ability to identify specific incidence of fraud. However, fraud mitigation in the EB-5 Program is hindered by a reliance on voluminous paper files, which limit the agency's ability to collect and analyze program information. In its review of a nongeneralizable selection of files associated with EB-5 program regional centers and immigrant investors, GAO found that identifying fraud indicators is extremely challenging. For example, many of these files were several thousand pages long and would take significant time to review. According to USCIS documentation, the program anticipates receiving approximately 14 million pages of supporting documentation from its regional-center applicants and immigrant investor petitioners annually. Recognizing these limitations, USCIS has taken preliminary steps to study digitizing and analyzing the paper files submitted by petitioners and applicants to the program, which could help USCIS better identify fraud indicators in the program; however, these efforts are in the early stages.", "USCIS has incorporated selected leading fraud risk management practices into its efforts but could take additional actions to help guide and document its efforts. GAO's Fraud Risk Framework is a set of leading practices that can serve as a guide for program managers to use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based manner. USCIS's actions align with two key components of the Fraud Risk Framework: (1) commit to combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk management such as by providing specialized fraud awareness training; and (2) assess risks by planning and completing regular fraud risk assessments. However, USCIS has not developed a fraud risk profile, an overarching document that guides its fraud management efforts, as called for in the Fraud Risk Framework. Instead, USCIS's risk assessments, spanning multiple years, were developed as separate documents and reports, and there is not a unifying document that consolidates and systematically prioritizes these findings. Without a fraud risk profile, USCIS may not be well positioned to identify and prioritize fraud risks in the EB-5 Program, ensure the appropriate controls are in place to mitigate fraud risks, and implement other Fraud Risk Framework components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USCIS develop a fraud risk profile that aligns with leading practices identified in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework.

USCIS also has a  Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) unit charged with  preventing, detecting, and responding to allegations of fraud in the  program.", "In August 2015, we issued a report on fraud risks and the measurement  of economic benefits for the EB-5 program. With respect to fraud risks,  we found that USCIS had identified some unique fraud risks including  uncertainties in verifying that the funds invested were obtained lawfully  and various investment-related schemes to defraud investors, which are  generally not present in other types of immigration programs. We also  found that USCIS had taken steps to improve fraud prevention and  detection such as creating an organizational structure conducive to fraud  risk management and establishing a dedicated entity to design and  oversee its fraud risk management activities. However, we found that  limitations in USCIS\u2019s information collection and use hampered its ability  to detect and mitigate fraud risks. We therefore recommended, among  other things, that USCIS plan and conduct regular future fraud risk  assessments of the EB-5 Program, and develop a strategy to expand  information collection, including considering the increased use of  interviews as well as requiring the additional reporting of information by  those seeking to participate or actively participating in the program. DHS  concurred with both of these recommendations and, as will be discussed  later in this report, has taken steps to conduct additional risk assessments  and to collect additional information such as through revised petition and  application forms.", "Following the issuance of our August 2015 report, you asked us to  conduct additional work evaluating fraud-detection efforts in the program  and steps taken by USCIS to manage these risks.

We reviewed actions taken  by USCIS to improve fraud-detection efforts since our August 2015  report, including those steps taken to respond to our recommendations.  To gather additional information and context, and to understand how  immigrant investor petitions and regional-center applications can be used  for identifying indications of fraud, we conducted a targeted file review of  immigrant investor petitions and regional-center applications adjudicated  by USCIS. Specifically for the immigrant investors, we identified and  reviewed a random, nongeneralizable sample of 10 petitions based on a  universe of those that had been denied removal of the conditional basis of  their lawful permanent resident status from fiscal years 2010 through  2014. For the regional centers, we identified and reviewed a random,  nongeneralizable sample of 10 applications based on a universe of  regional centers that were currently identified as having some  adjudication issues, including some with known incidences of fraud. For  each file review, we reviewed the completed forms and supporting  evidence provided by the applicants or petitioners, as well as associated  records of USCIS\u2019s adjudication.", "To determine the extent to which USCIS has incorporated selected  leading fraud risk management practices into its efforts, we compared  USCIS\u2019s practices to those identified in GAO\u2019s A Framework for  Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework).  Issued in July 2015, GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework is a comprehensive  set of leading practices that serves as a guide for program managers to  use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based  manner. The framework describes leading practices for (1) establishing  an organizational structure and culture that are conducive to fraud risk  management; (2) assessing the likelihood and effect of fraud risks; (3)  developing, documenting, and communicating an antifraud strategy,  focusing on preventive control activities; and (4) collecting and analyzing  data from reporting mechanisms and instances of detected fraud for real- time monitoring of fraud trends, and use the results of monitoring,  evaluations, and investigations to improve fraud prevention, detection,  and response. On June 30, 2016, the Fraud Reduction and Data  Analytics Act of 2015 was enacted. Among other things, the act requires  that the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the  Comptroller General of the United States, establish guidelines for  agencies to establish financial and administrative controls to identify and  assess fraud risks and design and implement control activities in order to  prevent, detect, and respond to fraud. The act also requires that these  guidelines be established within 90 days of enactment and that they  incorporate leading practices identified in the Fraud Risk Framework. We  met with agency officials from FDNS and IPO and reviewed documents  including policies and procedures, and assessed how USCIS was  following selected components we outline for managing fraud risks. We  compared activities at USCIS to two of the four components of the Fraud  Risk Framework, specifically whether the organization was committing to  combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure  conducive to fraud risk management, and whether the organization was  planning regular fraud risk assessments and assessing risks to determine  a fraud risk profile (components 1 and 2 of the Fraud Risk Framework).  We limited our review to these two components, because the Fraud Risk  Framework was recently issued by GAO and because USCIS would need  to address these first two components before it would be able to address  the remaining two components.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2015 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Most recently, the EB-5  Program Regional Center model was extended until September 30,  2016. Immigrant investors can choose to invest on their own or with  others directly in a business, or they may use a regional center to pool  their investment with those of other immigrant investors and other foreign  and U.S. investors to develop larger projects owned and managed by  others. Immigrant investors must demonstrate that their investment in a  new commercial enterprise will result in the creation or, in the case of a  troubled business, preservation or creation (or some combination of the  two), of at least 10 full-time positions for qualifying employees.

Applicants must also include a detailed statement regarding the  amount and source of capital committed to the regional center, as well as  a description of the promotional efforts they have taken and planned.  Once a regional center has been approved to participate in the program,  a designated representative of the regional center must file a Form  I-924A, Supplement to Form I-924, for each fiscal year, to provide USCIS  with updated information demonstrating that the regional center continues  to promote economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation,  or increased domestic capital investment within its approved geographic  area.

These actions were taken in part as a response to our August 2015  recommendation for USCIS to develop a strategy to expand information  collection to strengthen fraud prevention, detection, and mitigation  capabilities. According to USCIS officials, the EB-5 program has issued  updated petition and application forms for public comment and anticipates  publishing the revised forms in final in fiscal year 2017. These updated  forms would help capture additional information about petitioners and  applicants that could be used to potentially identify fraud. Along with  capturing additional self-reported information from petitioners and  applicants, USCIS officials stated that they are exploring increased use of  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) checks to identify  potential fraudulent actors in the program, especially for regional-center  applicants. Moreover, USCIS is exploring the potential use of a new  process to allow interviews of immigrant investor petitioners seeking the  removal of their conditional status at the I-829 stage, according to agency  officials and documentation. According to agency documentation, this  effort is in part a response to our August 2015 report, which  recommended that USCIS develop a strategy to expand information  collection such as considering the increased use of interviews at the I-829  phase. If implemented, the interviews will be conducted by  knowledgeable USCIS officials based in Washington, D.C.

In August 2016,  USCIS officials reported that a preliminary scoping meeting had been  held and that project completion was tentatively planned for some time in  fiscal year 2017.", "USCIS is also taking steps to obtain additional resources for program  oversight. For example, FDNS has increased its number of authorized  positions from 21 to 25 full-time equivalent staff and has added student  intern positions and administrative support. According to agency officials  and documentation, USCIS\u2019s IPO has also created a specialized group  focused primarily on regulatory compliance of existing regional centers to  help ensure that the centers continue to serve their purpose of promoting  economic growth. Among other things, the compliance unit is expected to  help coordinate referrals, such as potential fraud referrals, to FDNS and  house an audit function, which anticipates conducting its first audit  activities later in 2016. Officials expect that the audits will be conducted  on-site at regional centers and that they will include a review of the  centers\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Most recently,  USCIS has also issued proposed changes for public comment to increase  the filing fees for immigrant investors and regional-center applicants  either seeking to participate or currently participating in the program.  Specifically, USCIS has proposed more than doubling the initial Form  I-526 filing fee from $1,500 to $3,675, nearly tripling the I-924 regional- center designation or amendment fee from $6,230 to $17,795, and adding  a new I-924A annual filing fee of $3,035. These new fees are designed to  allow USCIS to fully recover the costs of the services it provides and also  aid its efforts in administering the program including fraud-identification  efforts. For example, the proposed rule requests increased fees to  conduct additional oversight work such as through site visits. Moreover,  USCIS officials stated that they are also developing standard operating  procedures for adjudication staff for each immigrant investor form, which  the agency plans to finalize by the end of calendar year 2016 or the first  quarter of fiscal year 2017.

In February 2016,  USCIS completed a draft of this study, which evaluated both hardware  and software options to support fraud detection in both the EB-5 and  asylum programs. The study evaluated several document-conversion  alternatives including hardware and software tools to scan paper files and  convert them to digital text, as well as text analytic alternatives such as  software that allows for the detailed analysis of text similar to that used for  computer-aided plagiarism detection. For example, this software could be  used to identify duplicate passages in different petitions and applications,  which could indicate potential fraud. The study reported a number of  challenges associated with digitizing and analyzing petitioner and  applicant information for the EB-5 program. For example, the study noted  that implementing text analytic techniques for computer-aided plagiarism  detection will likely be costly since many software packages do not offer  this capability without substantial modification. Based on the results of  this study, USCIS officials told us that they were developing a set of  proposals for management review and potential approval; however, these  efforts remained in their development stages and were being reviewed by  USCIS stakeholders for feedback, recommendation, and acceptance prior  to procurement activities.

It includes control activities that help agencies prevent,  detect, and respond to fraud risks as well as structures and environmental  factors that influence or help managers achieve their objectives to  mitigate fraud risks. The framework consists of four components for  effectively managing fraud risks: commit, assess, design and implement,  and evaluate and adapt. Leading practices for each of these components  include the following:  (1)  commit: create an organizational culture to combat fraud at all  levels of the agency, and designate an entity within the program  office to lead fraud risk management activities;  (2)  assess: assess the likelihood and impact of fraud risks, and  determine risk tolerance, examine the suitability of existing  controls, and prioritize residual risks;  (3)  design and implement: develop, document, and communicate an  antifraud strategy, focusing on preventive control activities; and  (4)  evaluate and adapt: collect and analyze data from reporting  mechanisms and instances of detected fraud for real-time  monitoring of fraud trends, and use the results of monitoring,  evaluations, and investigations to improve fraud prevention,  detection, and response.", "The fraud risk profile is an essential piece of the antifraud strategy, as  described in the \u201cDesign and Implement\u201d section of the Fraud Risk  Framework, and informs the specific control activities managers design  and implement. The elements in table 1 reflect key elements of fraud risk  assessments and the fraud risk profile. The table is meant solely for  illustrative purposes to show one possible format for agencies to  document their fraud risk profile. The table shows information related to  one fraud risk; however, a robust fraud risk profile would include  information about all fraud risks that may affect a program. Documenting  fraud risks together can aid managers in understanding links between  specific risks. In addition, other tools a program uses to assess risks,  such as the risk matrix discussed in the \u201cAssess\u201d section of the Fraud  Risk Framework, can supplement the documentation for the fraud risk  profile. We adapted the table and additional information below it from  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, as well as a  publication by the Australian National Audit Office and one cosponsored  by the Institute of Internal Auditors, the American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants, and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.", "The following is additional information about the elements in table 1.", "Identified Fraud Risks. What fraud risks does the program face? Include  a brief description of the fraud risk or scheme. This list will vary by  program, and may be informed by activities to gather information during  the fraud risk assessment, such as interviews with staff, brainstorming  sessions, and information from hotline referrals.", "Fraud Risk Factors. What conditions or actions are most likely to cause  or increase the chances of a fraud risk occurring? This may reflect fraud  risk factors highlighted in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, as well as other factors that provide additional details about  specific fraud risks.", "Fraud Risk Owner. Which group or individual within the program is  responsible for addressing the risk? The owner of the fraud risk will vary  by program, but generally the owner this is the entity with accountability  for addressing the fraud risk.", "Inherent Risk Likelihood and Impact. In the absence of controls, how  likely is the fraud risk and what would the impact be if it were to occur? As  noted in the \u201cAssess\u201d section of the Fraud Risk Framework, the specific  methodology for assessing the likelihood and impact of risks will vary by  agency. One option for assessing likelihood is to use a five-point scale, as  noted in table 1. When considering impact, participants of the fraud risk  assessment may consider the impact of fraud on the program\u2019s  compliance with laws and regulations, operations, and reputation.", "Inherent Risk Significance. In the absence of controls, how significant is  the fraud risk based on an analysis of the likelihood and impact of the  risk? While the specific methodology for assessing risks may vary by  agency, including qualitative and quantitative methodologies, managers  may multiply the likelihood and impact scores, or apply a five-point scale.", "Existing Antifraud Controls. What controls does the program already  have in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of the inherent fraud  risk? This is intended to assist with mapping the existing controls to the  fraud risks or schemes, which would reduce the likelihood and impact of a  fraud risk occurring.", "Residual Risk Likelihood and Impact. Taking into account the  effectiveness of existing controls, how likely is the fraud risk and what  would the impact be if it were to occur? Managers may consider  assessing both the residual likelihood and impact of fraud risks using the  five-point scale described in table 1. Controls that are not properly  designed or operating effectively may contribute to high residual risk.", "Residual Risk Significance. How significant is the fraud risk based on  an analysis of the likelihood and impact, as well as the effectiveness of  existing controls?
