We are also including a profile of each of the 37 installations in appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Among the federal statutes that affect the reuse process, four are of particular importance: (1) the base realignment and closure acts of 1988 and 1990, (2) the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, and (3) the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney Act). Amendments to these acts enacted within the past year are leading to ongoing changes in reuse planning and implementation at closing bases.", "The Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990\u2014collectively referred to as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) acts\u2014are the two statutes that authorize the Secretary of Defense to close military bases and dispose of property. Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 amended the BRAC Acts to enable local redevelopment authorities to receive government property at no initial cost if the property is used for economic development.", "The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 requires disposal agencies to provide DOD and other federal agencies an opportunity to request property to satisfy a programmed requirement. Property may be conveyed at no cost under various public benefit discount programs, sold for not less than the appraised fair market value through negotiated sale to state governments or their instrumentalities, or sold at a competitive public sale.", "Surplus property can be made available to providers of services to the homeless as provided for by the McKinney Act. At the time of our 1994 report, the McKinney Act assigned such providers higher priority than local communities when conflicts over reuse planning for surplus property at military bases occurred. However, the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 amended the BRAC acts and the McKinney Act to incorporate homeless assistance requests into the community reuse planning process and to eliminate the higher priority given to requests for property at bases undergoing realignment and closure.", "The information contained in this report reflects the June 1995 status of property disposal plans at 37 of the 120 installations closed by the 1988 and 1991 closure commissions (see fig. 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Base Disposal", "paragraphs": ["About three fifths of the property at the 37 closing military bases will be retained by the federal government because it is contaminated with unexploded ordnance, has been retained by decisions made by the BRAC commissions or by legislation, or is needed by federal agencies. The remaining two fifths of the property is available for conversion to community reuse. Communities\u2019 plans for this property involve a variety of public benefit and economic development uses. Little property is planned for negotiated sale to state and local jurisdictions or for public sale, as shown in figure 2. (See app. I for a summary of property disposal plans.)", "Public benefit conveyances (37,268 acres)", "Economic development conveyances (23,633 acres) 6% Undetermined (12,110 acres) 4% Public sale (6,849 acres)", "Mandatory retention by federal agencies (22,154 acres)", "While the federal government plans to retain about 58 percent of the property at closing bases, only 17 percent has been requested to satisfy federal agency needs. About 29 percent is contaminated with unexploded ordnance and will be retained by the federal government because the cost of cleanup and environmental damage that would be caused by cleanup are excessive. Another 12 percent of the property has been either retained per either BRAC decisions or legislation. An example of property retained per a BRAC decision would be the 100-acre parcel at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service facility. An example of property retained by legislation would be the 1,480-acre Presidio of San Francisco, California, which was transferred to the National Park Service.", "Of the 58 percent, the Department of Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management are to receive about 42 percent of the property. Much of the property is contaminated with unexploded ordnance. DOD will retain about 13 percent to support Reserve, National Guard, Defense Finance and Accounting Service facilities, and other active duty missions. Other federal agencies will receive about 3 percent of the property for such uses as federal prisons and national parks. (See app. II for a summary of federal uses.)", "Communities also are planning to use about 20 percent of the base property for various public benefits. The largest public benefit use is for commercial airport conversions, which will total about 14 percent under current plans. About 4 percent is to go to park and recreation use, the second largest public benefit use. Plans call for transferring another 2 percent of the property to such public benefit uses as education, homeless assistance, and state prisons.", "Communities are planning to acquire about 12 percent of the property under economic development conveyances, and DOD plans to sell about 4 percent of the property either through negotiated sales to state and local jurisdictions or through direct sales to the public. Communities have not determined how the remaining 6 percent of the property should be incorporated into their reuse plans.", "Land sales for all BRAC closures totaled $138.8 million as of June 1995. The sale of 641 acres of developed land at Norton Air Force Base, California, to the local redevelopment authority for $52 million under an economic development conveyance is the largest sale to date. The 1989 sale of the Kapalama Military Reservation, Hawaii, to the state of Hawaii for $38.5 million is the next largest sale. When we last reported, land sales totaled $69.4 million. The largest increase in sales has been to local reuse authorities under the new economic development conveyance authority, which allows for no-cash downpayment terms and up to 15 years to pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful Conversions", "paragraphs": ["Overall, progress is being made in converting properties at the closing bases we reviewed to civilian use. Communities are creating new airport facilities, jobs, education and job training centers, and wildlife habitats. (See app. III for a more detailed discussion of each installation\u2019s conversion progress.)", "Converting military airfields to civilian airports is a goal at most communities that have bases with closing airfields. For example, the city of Austin, Texas, is converting Bergstrom Air Force Base\u2019s airfield and facilities into a new municipal airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has provided over $110 million toward the conversion. Buildings are being demolished to build an additional runway, while design work is underway on the conversion, which is scheduled for completion in 1998.", "DOD officials believe that one meaningful measure of base conversion success is in the number of jobs created. The 37 bases will have lost  54,217 civilian jobs when they are all closed. To date, 25 of the bases have closed. At these 25 bases, 29,229 jobs were lost. So far, 8,340 jobs have been created. (See app. IV for a summary of each community\u2019s success at creating jobs.)", "Community efforts to create jobs have been a key component of economic recovery strategies in a number of locations. Successful efforts in a few communities have led to the creation of more jobs than were lost due to closures.", "At England Air Force Base, Louisiana, the community has attracted  16 tenants that have created over 700 jobs replacing the nearly 700 civilian jobs lost as a result of the base\u2019s closure. The largest tenant has hired  65 employees to refurbish jet aircraft. Another large tenant has hired  58 people to operate a truck driving school. (See p.44.)", "At Chase Naval Air Station, Texas, newly constructed state prison facilities and several small manufacturers have created over 1,500 jobs, a net increase of 600 jobs over the level of civilian employment by the Navy. (See p. 38.)", "At Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, a commercial airport, an aircraft maintenance complex, a government agency, and a biotechnology firm are among the 41 tenants that have created over 1,000 jobs at the base, over twice the 400 civilian jobs lost. (See p. 86.)", "Several communities have begun developing or planning centers for higher education and job training. In some instances, these efforts have involved pooled efforts by local schools and state institutions and agencies.", "At Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, a consortium of Colorado colleges and the Denver public school system are providing educational and job training opportunities. Currently, 80 classes with a total of 800 students are in session at the former base. (See p. 73.)", "At Fort Ord, California, classes at the new California State University, Monterey Bay, are scheduled to begin in the fall of 1995. About  700 graduate and undergraduate students are expected to enroll in the university\u2019s fall class. (See p. 51.)", "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to set aside land at several bases for preservation as natural wildlife habitats. In some locations, the preservation of wildlife habitats reduces the level of environmental cleanup, particularly where unexploded ordnance is involved.", "At Jefferson Proving Ground, Indiana, the Army plans to transfer about 47,500 acres to the Fish and Wildlife Service for a wildlife refuge, which could potentially save the Army billions of dollars in costs otherwise needed to remove unexploded ordnance. (See p. 63.)", "At Woodbridge Army Research Facility, Virginia, all 580 acres are to be transferred to the Service for inclusion in the Mason Neck Wildlife Refuge. Service plans for the property envision showcasing habitat and wildlife not routinely seen so close to a metropolitan area and providing environmental education opportunities. (See p. 109.)", "Early experiences indicate that a new form of conveyance authority called an economic development conveyance can be mutually beneficial to both the federal government and local communities. This new authority calls for (1) DOD to convey property to a local redevelopment authority for the purpose of creating jobs when it is not practicable to obtain fair market value at the time of the transfer and (2) DOD and the local authorities to negotiate the terms and conditions of the conveyances. In qualifying rural areas, conveyances are at no cost to the communities. This new authority benefits local redevelopment authorities by allowing them to take possession of properties with no initial payment so that they can implement their job creation and economic development plans. The federal government benefits by eliminating the costs of maintaining and protecting idle properties and by generating revenues to help pay for base realignment and closure costs.", "Several communities are planning to use this new conveyance mechanism to obtain property for economic development. Two economic development conveyance agreements\u2014one at Norton Air Force Base, California, and another at Sacramento Army Depot, California\u2014have been successfully negotiated.", "The local redevelopment authority and the Air Force have agreed that for a 641-acre parcel at the Norton Air Force Base, the local reuse authority will pay the government 40 percent of gross lease revenues and  100 percent of gross land sales revenues up to a total of $52 million, the estimated fair market value of the property. If the $52 million has not been paid in full at the end of 15 years, the local redevelopment authority is obligated to pay the Air Force the balance. The local redevelopment authority is negotiating or has entered into 7 leases that it projects will result in about 2,250 new jobs by next year. (See p. 83.)", "At the Sacramento Army Depot, the city of Sacramento has acquired  371 acres of the 487-acre depot from the Army. Under the terms of the economic development conveyance agreement, the Army will be paid $7.2 million either at the end of 10 years or when the property is sold by the city, whichever is sooner. The city has negotiated a lease with Packard Bell that creates a projected 2,500 to 3,000 jobs that nearly offset the  3,200 lost from the depot\u2019s closure.

But, before the plans can be implemented, necessary environmental cleanup actions must have been taken by DOD.", "In numerous communities, the failure to reach a consensus on reuse issues has caused delays in the development of acceptable reuse plans.", "At George Air Force Base, California, reuse was delayed about 2 years while lawsuits were settled between the city of Adelanto and the Victor Valley Economic Development Authority over which jurisdiction should have the reuse authority. (See p. 58.)", "At Tustin Marine Corps Air Station, California, homeless assistance groups are requesting about 400 family housing units and other buildings. The local reuse authority believes that 100 family housing units and some single-residence, multiple-unit buildings would provide a balanced living environment and that the request for additional facilities conflicts with other aspects of its reuse plan. At its request, the local reuse authority was granted a delay in DOD\u2019s disposal process to give it more time to negotiate with the homeless assistance groups. Negotiations continue between the two groups to reach a consensus. (See p. 102.)", "At Puget Sound Naval Station (Sand Point), Washington, the city of Seattle and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe are promoting competing reuse plans. The city plans to use the property for housing, parks and recreation, and educational activities. The tribe plans to use the property for economic development and educational activities. As long as 2 years ago, the Navy asked both parties to work on a joint reuse plan. However, no consensus on reuse has been reached by the two parties. DOD\u2019s disposal decisions on the property are pending. (See p. 93.)", "Early efforts likewise indicate that even after a consensus is achieved, conversions are unlikely to prove successful if the resulting plans incorporate unrealistic reuse expectations. Some base conversions involve reuse expectations that may be unrealistic given their rural or relatively unpopulated geographic locations. Early experiences suggest that bases with airfields in remote locations pursuing reuse plans involving expanded airport operations are most prone to these types of expectations. Reuse plans for the airfields at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan, Eaker Air Force Base, Arkansas, and Loring Air Force Base, Maine, have been largely unsuccessful because the new tenants attracted are not capable of generating enough revenue to support the costs of airport operations.", "Environmental cleanup requirements delay the implementation of reuse plans. In February 1995, we reported that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 prohibits transferring property to nonfederal ownership until all necessary environmental cleanup actions are taken. However, much of the property is in the early stages of cleanup. Cleanup progress has been limited because the study and evaluation process is lengthy and complex and, with existing technology, take time.
