Taxpayers claimed deductions for donated vehicles on about 733,000 of the 4.4 million tax year 2000 returns filed with noncash deductions over $500, lowering taxpayer liability by an estimated $654 million. For the charities surveyed, proceeds from vehicle donations ranged from $1,000 for one charity, to $8.8 million for another. However, proceeds generally constituted a small share of total charity revenue for the majority of charities GAO reviewed. In addition, for two-thirds of the 54 specific vehicle donations GAO examined, charities received 5 percent or less of the value donors claimed as deductions on their tax return. Differences in proceeds received by the charity and value claimed by a taxpayer were due in part, to vehicles being sold at auctions at wholesale prices, and proceeds being reduced by vehicle processing and fundraising costs. Due to a lack of available data on the condition of donated vehicles, GAO could not determine whether taxpayers appropriately valued their vehicles when claiming associated tax deductions. The IRS has some activities designed to detect noncompliant claims for noncash deductions, including vehicle donations. However, the IRS has not pursued potential leads from these activities because tax revenue yields are less than other potential noncompliance cases, such as abusive tax shelters. IRS's ongoing National Research Program study may provide information on how to deal with donated vehicle compliance issues. Also, an IRS task force drafted recommendations for improving IRS's oversight of charities' donated property programs. State officials have filed legal actions in a number of cases involving problems with vehicle donation programs, such as an individual soliciting vehicle donations for fictitious charities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Some charities are turning to vehicle donation programs as a means for  raising funds. While these donations create an important source of  revenue for a number of charities, questions have arisen regarding the role  third-party agents play in the vehicle donation process, as well as the  amount of proceeds that are actually received by charities from vehicle  donations. Others have asked whether taxpayers know enough about  vehicle donation programs to make informed decisions about donating  their vehicles, and are claiming appropriate tax deductions.", "Given these questions, this report expands on our preliminary  observations on vehicle donation programs in our April 1, 2003, testimony  before the Senate Finance Committee and discusses (1) the number of  charities with vehicle donation programs and the number of taxpayers  claiming deductions for vehicle donations; (2) the vehicle donation  process; (3) proceeds received by charities from vehicle donations  compared to what donors claim for vehicle donation deductions;   (4) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state compliance activities directed  at vehicle donations, and the results of these activities; and (5) guidance  available to taxpayers and charities to help them make informed decisions  regarding vehicle donations.", "To satisfy these objectives, we relied on two sources of nationally  representative information and several anecdotal sources of information.  To determine the number of charities that have vehicle donation  programs, we conducted a national telephone survey of a statistically  representative sample of charities. Second, to determine how many  taxpayers claimed vehicle donation deductions, we analyzed a statistically  representative sample of tax year 2000 tax returns (the latest data then  available). We also obtained anecdotal information on compliance  activities from officials at the IRS and 11 state attorneys general and  secretary of state offices, and information on vehicle donation operations  from a pool of 65 charities, six third-party agents, and related interest  groups. Finally, we tracked a judgmental sample of 54 donated vehicles to  compare the amount of proceeds charities received from vehicle sales and  the amount claimed as deductions on donors\u2019 tax returns.

Our work was conducted between October 2002 and October 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The tax code allows individuals and businesses to make noncash  contributions (e.g., vehicles, paintings, used clothing, and household  goods) to qualifying charities by allowing taxpayers to claim deductions  for their donations on their tax returns. However, not all organizations are  granted nonprofit or tax-exempt status by the IRS that qualifies taxpayers  for tax deductions for items donated to them. Table 1 provides examples  of organizations that do and do not qualify donors for noncash deductions,  including vehicle donations.", "IRS guidance instructs donors to establish the value for their donation  based on its \u201cfair market value\u201d for donated vehicles, that is, what the item  would sell for on the market, taking into account its condition, including  mileage in the case of vehicle donations. As is the case for all noncash  contributions, the IRS does not require donors to obtain an independent  appraisal for a vehicle\u2019s value unless they claim over $5,000 for the  donated property. IRS guidance suggests that donors use used car guides,  comparable sales, and other sources to assist in establishing the fair  market value for their donated vehicles.", "Regulatory oversight over charities and their vehicle donation programs is  diffused, shared between the IRS and state agencies. The IRS decides  which charities are granted nonprofit status and whether the charity meets  tax-exempt requirements and complies with federal laws. Many states  require charities soliciting within the states to register with the state  attorney general\u2019s office or the secretary of state\u2019s office. Figure 1 shows  the 39 states and the District of Columbia that require charitable  organizations to register with state charity offices. In general, states  prohibit unregistered organizations from soliciting for donations in their  state. Some state agencies also review vehicle donation advertisements in  response to consumer complaints, or when they discover a charity is  soliciting for donations in their state without being registered.", "In addition to oversight by the IRS and state agencies, some private sector  organizations develop standards to promote ethical charitable practices  and collect information on charitable organizations. Charity \u201cwatchdog\u201d  organizations, such as the Better Business Bureau\u2019s Wise Giving Alliance,  Council of Better Business Bureaus, American Institute of Philanthropy,  Association of Fund-Raising Professionals, and the Independent Sector,  provide insight to the public on various fund-raising activities. These  organizations collect information on charitable organizations and develop  standards to promote ethical practices. They disseminate these standards  in an effort to \u201cinspire public confidence.\u201d These standards include the  voluntary disclosure of an organization\u2019s activities, finances, fundraising  practices, and governance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Charities Reported Having Vehicle Donation Programs, and Small Percentage of Taxpayers Claim Deductions for Donated Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["Based on our national survey of charities, few charities reported having a  vehicle donation program.

We found that of the  129 million returns filed that year, an estimated 0.6 percent, or   733,000 returns, contained tax deductions for vehicle donations. The  733,000 returns represented about 17 percent of the 4.4 million returns  filed with noncash contribution deductions over $500. We estimate that  vehicle donation deductions lowered taxpayers\u2019 income tax liability by an  estimated $654 million. The dollar amount of vehicle donation deductions  totaled about 6 percent of the noncash contributions claimed, while  stocks and thrift store donations accounted for most of the deductions for  noncash charitable contributions over $500, as shown in figure 3.", "While few taxpayers claim tax deductions for donated vehicles, 2 charities  we contacted conducted surveys of their donors and found that the  ability to claim a tax deduction was one of the important reasons  individuals donated their vehicles to charity. Other important reasons  cited in the surveys for donating vehicles were to help a charitable cause  and to easily dispose of an unwanted vehicle."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Vehicle Donation Programs Varied for the Charities We Reviewed, but Most Used Third-Party Agents", "paragraphs": ["The vehicle donation process, for the charities we reviewed generally  consisted of four steps: (1) solicitation/donor contact, (2) vehicle pick-up,  (3) vehicle sale, and (4) distribution of proceeds. Forty-five of the   65 charities we interviewed reported using third-party agents for some or  all of these steps rather than relying on in-house resources, and some had  arrangements with more than one agent. About half of the 45 charities  used third-party agents to run the entire program, while other charities  used a third-party agent for only certain functions. The vehicle donation  process is depicted in figure 4.", "Step 1 \u2013 Solicitation/donor contact. The vehicle donation process  generally begins with solicitations for donated vehicles through  advertisements. Vehicle donations may be solicited directly by charities,  third-party agents, or both, depending on the agreement between the  charities and third-party agents. Of the 45 charities we interviewed that  discussed their advertising practices, 26 reported that advertising was  handled solely by the charity. Some third-party agents solicited donated  vehicles for several charities using a common advertisement. Some of the  most common mediums for vehicle donation advertisements include the  radio, newspapers, and the Internet. (For Web version of this report, click  here (www.gao.gov/media/audio/donatecar.mp3) to hear a radio vehicle  donation advertisement, or see app. II for the transcript.) Vehicle  donations are also solicited through advertisements on billboards, truck  banners (see fig. 5), and television, as well as in newsletters and even on  small paper bags.", "Also during this step, donors initiate contact with the charity and or third- party agent to donate their vehicle. Either charities or third-party agents  may take the initial call from a potential donor, asking the donor questions  that may be used to screen vehicles, such as the vehicle\u2019s make, year, and  condition, and if the donor has the title to the vehicle. Twenty-four of the  65 charities we interviewed reported that they accepted donor calls in- house, while 23 said that they used third-party agents to accept calls or  shared this responsibility. Some charities or their agents limited the  vehicles they accepted to those they anticipated would produce a profit  after towing and other expenses. However, some charities reported  accepting vehicles regardless of condition, as suggested in figure 6. One  charity official stated that accepting vehicles with little value was a way of  generating goodwill for future donations.", "Step 2 \u2013 Vehicle pickup. After the donor makes the initial call to donate a  vehicle, arrangements are made to pick up the vehicle and deliver it to  wherever it will be stored until it is sold. Vehicles are generally towed,  according to a third-party agent, due to safety and liability concerns. A  majority of charities we contacted used third-party agents to pick up  vehicles. Once vehicles are picked up, donors are generally provided with  a receipt to document the donation for tax purposes. At this time, the  charity or third-party agent also obtains the title of the vehicle from the  donor. Some charities may provide the donor with state-required forms  (e.g., release of liability), or references for establishing the tax deductible  value of their donated vehicle (e.g., car guides or IRS guidance).", "Step 3 \u2013 Vehicle sale. Once collected, donated vehicles are most often  sold. Charities or third-party agents typically sell donated vehicles through  auctions to auto dealers, to the public, or to vehicle salvagers. The  majority of charities we contacted said that charities do not handle the  selling of vehicles themselves, but instead rely on a third-party agent.  Charities and third-party agents said that they generally sold donated  vehicles at auto auctions because (1) auctions allow high volume of auto  sales and (2) charities do not have the resources, such as staff, storage  space, or licenses required to sell vehicles themselves. Of the 65 charities  we interviewed, 43 charity officials said they sold all of their donated  vehicles, while officials at 16 charities said they used some donated  vehicles for clients, charity staff, or other purposes. For example,   1 charity official said that the charity used donated vehicles for student  training for a community college auto course.", "Step 4 \u2013 Distribution of proceeds. After vehicles have been liquidated,   the proceeds are distributed. Charities with in-house vehicle donation  programs keep proceeds that remain after deducting costs associated   with processing the vehicles. When charities use third-party agents, the  financial agreement between the charity and the third-party agents  dictates the proceeds that the charity and fund-raiser will receive from   the sale.", "In addition to the in-house and third-party arrangements, we identified  some variations in how vehicle donation programs operate. In one case,   a consortium of 14 charities jointly runs a vehicle donation program in  conjunction with a wrecking yard. The charities share in oversight of the  operations, such as inspecting donated vehicles and monitoring vehicle  donation reports. Donors can select 1 charity to receive the proceeds, or if  no charity is designated, proceeds are split among members of the  consortium equally. In another case, 1 large charity runs a national vehicle  donation program and serves regional offices as a third-party agent would,  charging its regions vehicle processing costs. However, some of the  charity\u2019s affiliates choose other third-party agents that are not part of the  national program to run their program. Finally, in still another case, a large  charity runs a national program and serves charity affiliates, but also has a  nonprofit vehicle donation program for other smaller charities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charities Receive Less than Donors Claimed as the Value of the Vehicle for the 54 Donations We Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["Although proceeds from vehicle donations are a welcomed source of  revenue, it was not a crucial source of income for the majority of the  charities we reviewed. The proceeds charities received from vehicle  donations varied in the 54 cases we tracked, but were generally  considerably less than the amount donors claimed on their tax returns for  the donated vehicles. Based on information from charities we spoke with,  this difference is due in part to donated vehicles being often sold at auto  auctions at wholesale prices, and processing expenses and third-party fees  reducing the amount of proceeds charities receive.

The charities considered the proceeds  received as a welcomed, but rarely crucial source of income to sustain  their operations. Although the dollar amount received from vehicle  donations was over $1 million for several charities we spoke with, for  many, the revenue was a small share of total charity revenue. Charity  proceeds constituted less than 2 percent of the total annual budget for   15 of the 30 charities providing budget information; however, 2 of the  charities stated that vehicle donation proceeds provided 90 percent or  more of their annual revenue. Many of the charities we interviewed stated  that their vehicle donation program provided benefits beyond revenue by  providing an expanded donor base and name recognition for the charity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charity Proceeds Much Less than Values Claimed by Donors in Cases We Tracked", "paragraphs": ["In the 54 specific vehicle donations we tracked, charity proceeds from  vehicle donations were much less than the value deducted by donors on  their tax returns. Based on charity and the third-party agent we contacted,  two factors contributed to this difference: (1) vehicles are often sold at  auto auctions for salvage or at wholesale prices, which are typically lower  than prices that would be received if the donor sold the vehicle themselves  and (2) processing costs and fees are deducted from gross sales revenue,  further reducing charity proceeds.", "Figure 7 illustrates the amount a charity received from 1 of the 54 vehicle  donations we tracked. In this case, a 1983 GMC Jimmy truck was donated  in 2001 to a charity whose vehicle donation program is operated by a third- party agent. The gross sale price for the truck, which sold at an auction,  was $375. After deducting third-party and advertising expenses, net  proceeds from the vehicle sale totaled $62.00. This amount was split   50/50 between the third-party agent and charity, leaving the charity with  $31 from the vehicle donation. The taxpayer claimed a $2,400 tax  deduction for the donated vehicle on his/her tax return, based on the fair  market value of the vehicle listed in a used car guidebook. Appendix III  details the vehicle donation transactions for all 54 tracked cases.", "Donated vehicles are often sold at auto auctions for lower prices than  what a seller might receive if the vehicle were sold to a private party. For  the 54 donated vehicles we tracked, sale prices for donated vehicles  ranged from 1 percent to 70 percent of donor tax deduction claims, and  over half of the cases were 10 percent or less of what donors\u2019 claimed.  (See app. III) As one third-party agent stated, it is unfair to compare  auction sale prices for donated vehicles to deduction claims because most  donated vehicles are sold at auctions that cater predominantly to  wholesalers who then resell the vehicle at higher prices. Of the 59 charities  we contacted during our review that said they sell some or all donated  vehicles, 42 used auctions to dispose of the vehicles.", "Another reason for the difference between the amounts deducted by  donors for donated vehicles and the proceeds charities receive from  vehicle sales is that sales proceeds are reduced by vehicle processing  costs, such as towing, advertising, program administration, and third-party  agent fees. California is the only state that collects data on the proceeds  received by charities from vehicle donation programs. According to the  California Attorney General\u2019s records, 145 charities using third-party  agents who had filed the required financial reports received approximately  $16 million, or 35 percent of the $45.8 million raised from reported  donated vehicle sales, during 2001. The amount of proceeds these charities  received in California ranged from 2 percent to 80 percent of proceeds  after third-party costs were deducted.", "Taking both the lower sales price and deductions for processing costs into  account, the proceeds received by charities from donated vehicles were  much lower than the donor-claimed value for the vehicles in the   54 donated vehicle cases we tracked. Charities received between 0 and   54 percent of the value claimed by donors, with most receiving 5 percent  or less, as shown in figure 8. For some vehicle donation sales, charities  receive no proceeds after the costs of vehicle donations are deducted. For  6 of the 54 donated vehicles we tracked, the processing costs exceeded the  sales price for the vehicle (see app. III). For charities using third-party  agents, whether the loss is absorbed by the third-party agent or deducted  from charity proceeds from another higher value donated vehicle depends  on the agreement between the parties.", "Because third-party agents and other donated vehicle processing costs  vary among charities, comparing net vehicle donation proceeds between  charities can be misleading. One third-party agent said that programs  claiming a high percent of proceeds as profit are not including their full  costs, that is, they are only counting towing costs and may not include  space, advertising, or staff costs. Similarly, 1 charity managing its own  vehicle donation program stated that its proceeds may be lower than some  other charities, but they are accurately capturing the true program costs  while others may not be. Proceeds also differ based on different  agreements between charities and third-party agents for paying for the  third-party\u2019s services. Of the 45 charities we contacted during our review  that reported using third-party agents, 20 said third parties were paid a  percentage of net proceeds for their vehicle donation services, many  splitting the net proceeds 50/50. Other charities reported paying third- party agents a flat fee per vehicle or had some other arrangement, such as  paying for towing expenses incurred by third-party agents.", "A number of charities interviewed had little insight into vehicle donation  processing costs incurred by third-party agents because they received  limited, or in a few cases, no information on charges for vehicle donations.  Although most charities reported receiving an itemized list of revenue and  costs of donated vehicles from their third-party agents, the detail was not  always provided. For example, 1 charity received an itemized list of each  vehicle sold that listed all costs under \u201ccost of sales\u201d except for the third-  party fee. Another received an itemized list of sold vehicles with all costs  under \u201ctow fees\u201d and \u201cexpenses.\u201d Thirteen of the charities we contacted  reported that they received a check from a third-party agent accepting  vehicles for the charity without their knowledge, and only 4 of the 13 said  that information on processing costs was provided. One well-known  charity with its own vehicle donation program stated that they repeatedly  contacted two third-party agents to stop them from accepting vehicles on  their behalf. The charity estimated that in 1 year one of the third parties  had deducted approximately $25,000 from proceeds to the charity over  what it would have cost the charity itself to process the donated vehicles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Data to Assess Taxpayer Accuracy in Estimating Donated Vehicle\u2019s Fair Market Value", "paragraphs": ["An additional factor that may explain the difference between the proceeds  charities receive from vehicle donation sales and what donors claim as the  value of the donated vehicle may be an inaccurate assessment by donors  of the vehicle\u2019s value. Although many charities we spoke with said they try  to limit vehicle acceptance to those in running condition, some charities  accept vehicles in poor condition. Charities stated that a number of the  vehicles donated are sold for scrap, and some said donor claims about  vehicle value might be inflated.", "We could not determine in the 54 cases we tracked whether donors  appropriately claimed deductions for donated vehicles. IRS guidance  suggests that taxpayers consider using used car guides when estimating  the fair market value for donated vehicles, while also considering the  vehicle\u2019s condition and mileage. Of the 54 cases, 25 assessments were  based on nationally recognized used car guides. However, since we did  not have additional information, such as the vehicle\u2019s condition and  mileage, we could not determine whether the reported valuations claimed  by donors accurately reflected fair market value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS and States Compliance Activities Directed at Donated Vehicle Issues Have Identified Cases of Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["The IRS has one compliance program that produces audit leads on  potentially overstated noncash contributions, but it does not follow up on  these leads.

As  part of its National Research Program, IRS plans to gather information on  noncash contribution compliance issues, which could provide it with data  to determine how best to address noncash contribution compliance issues.  An IRS donated property task force has drafted several recommendations  that could lead to more emphasis being directed to vehicle donation  programs and deductions.", "Data from the 11 states we contacted were limited regarding  noncompliance by charities and third-party agents involved with vehicle  donation programs.

However, due to higher priority demands for  determining compliance with tax laws, IRS has not been following up on  leads of potential noncompliance that are generated from this program.  Under this program, about two full-time equivalent employees at IRS\u2019s  Ogden Submission Processing Center are used to compare the proceeds  charities received from donated property shown on property disposal  forms (Form 8282 Donee Information Return) with the amounts claimed  by taxpayers on their tax returns. If there is a wide discrepancy between  the charity\u2019s revenues for the property and the amount claimed by the  taxpayer on their tax return, the case is referred to field offices for  possible audit.", "An Ogden Campus official estimated that on average about 20,000 Form  8282s are received annually, and that 4,000 to 5,000 individual tax returns  are reviewed to determine whether they should be audited. An Ogden  official estimated that the cost to retrieve a tax return from IRS files is  between $100 and $150. Ogden officials stated that they do not track the  number of cases that are referred for possible audit or the types of  donated property involved in the cases, but estimated that 30 percent to   40 percent of the returns reviewed are referred. An IRS official estimated  that most referred cases related to donated land or boats, which generally  have higher potential tax assessments than do vehicles. According to our  analysis of the IRS audit data, none of the returns that were referred  during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 were audited. IRS officials stated that the  returns were not audited because the potential tax assessment yield from  these cases was substantially smaller than from other types of compliance  issues handled in the field.", "IRS also established processing procedures for returns to identify and  disallow deductions for noncash contributions either when taxpayers  claim noncash contributions over a certain amount or when they do not  attach required Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions  to their  returns. These processing procedures cover relatively few noncash  contribution deductions. For example, we estimate that for tax year   2000 returns, IRS\u2019s returns processing threshold for these deductions  would account for about 1 percent of the returns where noncash  contributions of over $500 were claimed. According to IRS, returns that  meet the threshold are given a special code and are reviewed by the  examination staff to determine whether they have audit potential. Returns  with audit potential are put in the audit inventory for possible audit  selection by field agents. IRS found that these returns were not being  selected for audit because field agents had other higher priority work. IRS  expects this higher priority work to continue into the foreseeable future,  and as a result, beginning in January 2004, returns processing staff will  discontinue coding these returns for review by examination staff. IRS does  not have data on the number of noncash contribution deductions that have  been disallowed because of missing Form 8283s, but IRS officials estimate  that few were disallowed. IRS also has returns processing procedures to  identify and disallow noncash donations to individuals or nonqualifying  organizations, such as political organizations. According to IRS, in   2002 it disallowed noncash contributions of about $21.8 million on 154 tax  returns for donations made to individuals and nonqualifying  organizations.", "In addition to the above compliance activities that focus on taxpayers\u2019  deductions for donated vehicles and other types of noncash contributions,  IRS\u2019s Exempt Organization Division has an examination program that  focuses on whether charities meet tax-exempt requirements and complies  with federal law, such as those governing the use of funds for a charitable  purpose rather than private gain. IRS had little information on whether its  examinations identified compliance problems with charities operating  vehicle donation programs. At the time of our review, IRS officials  informed us that IRS had seven vehicle donation program examinations in  progress and had completed two cases. According to an IRS official, in one  recent case, IRS revoked the exemption status for one Florida  organization whose charitable purpose was to provide research,  education, and technical training on the marine environment.

The recommendations included revising Form  8283 to add a separate category for donations of motor vehicles on the  portion of the form that identifies the type of property donated. Another  recommendation made was to establish procedures to ensure that IRS  records and maintains copies of Form 8282s that are filed with the Ogden  Submission Processing Center. The task force noted that without such  procedures, IRS could not verify the accuracy of the forms or determine  whether charities filed them.
