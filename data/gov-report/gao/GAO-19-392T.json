Where there has been improvement in high-risk areas, congressional actions have been critical in spurring progress in addition to actions by executive agencies.", "GAO is removing two of the seven areas with improved ratings from the High-Risk List because they met all of GAO's five criteria for removal. The first area, Department of Defense (DOD) Supply Chain Management, made progress on seven actions and outcomes related to monitoring and demonstrated progress that GAO recommended for improving supply chain management. For example, DOD improved the visibility of physical inventories, receipt processing, cargo tracking, and unit moves. Improvements in asset visibility have saved millions of dollars and allow DOD to better meet mission needs by providing assets where and when needed.", "The second area, Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data, made significant progress in establishing and implementing plans to mitigate potential gaps. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration successfully launched a satellite, now called NOAA-20, in November 2017. NOAA-20 is operational and provides advanced weather data and forecasts. DOD developed plans and has taken actions to address gaps in weather data through its plans to launch the Weather System Follow-on\u2013Microwave satellite in 2022.", "There are two new areas on the High-Risk List since 2017. Added in 2018 outside of GAO's biennial high-risk update cycle, the Government-Wide Personnel Security Clearance Process faces significant challenges related to processing clearances in a timely fashion, measuring investigation quality, and ensuring information technology security. The second area, added in 2019, is Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Acquisition Management. VA has one of the most significant acquisition functions in the federal government, both in obligations and number of contract actions. GAO identified seven contracting challenges for VA, such as outdated acquisition regulations and policies, lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy, and inadequate acquisition training.", "Overall, 24 high-risk areas have either met or partially met all five criteria for removal from the list; 20 of these areas fully met at least one criterion. Ten high-risk areas have neither met nor partially met one or more criteria.", "While progress is needed across all high-risk areas, GAO has identified nine that need especially focused executive and congressional attention, including Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation, Resolving the Federal Role in Housing Finance, addressing Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Insurance Programs, Managing Risks and Improving VA Health Care, and ensuring an effective 2020 Decennial Census. Beyond these specific areas, focused attention is needed to address mission-critical skills gaps in 16 high-risk areas, confront three high-risk areas concerning health care and tax law enforcement that include billions of dollars in improper payments each year, and focus on a yawning tax gap."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["This statement describes GAO's views on progress made and what remains to be done to bring about lasting solutions for each high-risk area.

DOD has monitored materiel distribution by making  progress in developing its suite of distribution performance metrics,  improving the quality of their underlying data, and sharing metrics  information with stakeholders. For example, in January 2017, DOD  developed a suite of performance metrics that provides a comprehensive  picture of the distribution process, including whether supplies are  delivered on time and at sufficient quantity and quality. Also, DOD  implemented checklists to assess the quality of data underlying each  performance metric based on relevance, accuracy, comparability, and  interpretability.", "The checklists and their standards assist in identifying root causes and  addressing areas where performance data quality may be lacking. DOD  has also incorporated internal control requirements in its supply chain  management guidance to increase confidence in the performance data.  Additionally, DOD has revised its policy documents to require  stakeholders to routinely capture and share distribution performance  metrics, including cost data, and the department maintains websites to  provide current performance information to distribution stakeholders.", "DOD has also incorporated distribution metrics, as appropriate, on the  performance of all legs of the distribution system, including the tactical leg  (i.e., the last segment of the distribution system). We previously reported  on DOD\u2019s deficiencies to accurately assess its distribution performance at  the tactical leg, such as missing delivery dates for shipments in  Afghanistan. Since that time, the geographic combatant commands have  been tracking metrics at the tactical leg, including required delivery dates,  to determine the movement and causes of delays for shipments, and  have been sharing distribution performance information with the U.S.  Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) through their deployment and  distribution operations centers. DOD is implementing a cost framework to  incorporate transportation costs for all legs of the distribution system,  which will provide an additional metric for distribution stakeholders to  assess the efficiency of the system. The first phase of the cost framework  began operating in August 2018 and is expected to be fully implemented  in 2019.", "DOD is making progress in refining its Improvement Plan and is  incorporating additional actions based on interim progress and results.  Since DOD issued the Improvement Plan in September 2016, the agency  has (1) documented the results and monitored the status of each  corrective action, (2) revised completion dates as needed, and (3)  periodically provided decision makers with summary action charts, plans,  and milestones. DOD is also updating its instruction on management and  oversight of the distribution enterprise to clarify the roles and  responsibilities of all distribution stakeholders. DOD officials have not  determined a date for when this instruction will be issued.", "Demonstrated progress: met. DOD has demonstrated sustained  progress in improving its capability to comprehensively measure  distribution performance, identify distribution problems and root causes,  and implement solutions. DOD has implemented 10 of 18 corrective  actions in its Improvement Plan and is on track to implement the  remaining 8 by September 2019. Because of this progress, DOD\u2019s  monthly shipment reports have assessed performance against enhanced  metrics across the distribution system. For example, in December 2017,  TRANSCOM investigated performance standards for truck deliveries from  its Defense Logistics Agency warehouses in Bahrain to customers in  Kuwait due to frequent delays in shipments. TRANSCOM determined that  inadequate time for clearing customs in Kuwait resulted in an unrealistic  delivery standard.", "TRANSCOM, in coordination with distribution stakeholders, adjusted the  delivery standard to adequately account for the in-theater customs  process. In addition, TRANSCOM, in partnership with the Defense  Logistics Agency and the General Services Administration, developed  and implemented initiatives focused on distribution process and  operational improvements to reduce costs and improve distribution  services to the warfighter.
