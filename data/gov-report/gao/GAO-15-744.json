ACS also reviews cases to determine what action to take based on whether a levy source or contact information is known for taxpayers. ACS will then contact taxpayers according to its assigned priority and may issue a levy or lien against the taxpayer.", "ACS managers balance cases worked to ensure ACS achieves its case closure and taxpayer service measures. These decisions include how many notification and enforcement actions to take and how many cases to assign to IRS staff so that cases are worked in a timely manner. About half of the cases closed in ACS in fiscal year 2014 were high priority, including such issues as employers not paying federal employment taxes. Of the 3.5 million cases closed or transferred out of ACS in fiscal year 2014, IRS collected almost $6.2 billion. IRS generally had more success in collecting from individual taxpayers than from business taxpayers. However, because IRS has not identified objectives for the collection program and ACS, it is difficult to assess the program's overall effectiveness.", "ACS has processes for managing risk and reviewing performance, but has not implemented other key internal controls.

Over the same period, the number of  unresolved collection cases at the end of each year increased by 21  percent (from 4.2 million to 5.1 million).

These documents include the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM),  program documents, IRS reports, and presentations prepared by IRS  staff. We visited an ACS call site in Philadelphia twice to review the ACS  process, including how ACS collection cases are managed, and to  observe taxpayer calls with IRS collection representatives. In addition, we  analyzed IRS collection reports on the scope and scale of ACS  operations and performance measures for fiscal years 2012 through  2014. We interviewed IRS officials responsible for overseeing the ACS  case prioritization and selection process, as well as IRS officials  responsible for the overall IRS collection program.

To determine IRS\u2019s definition of fairness as it applies to  collection activities, we reviewed the ACS procedures and process for  case prioritization and selection. We also interviewed relevant IRS  officials concerning their understanding of the mission, objectives, and  internal controls of the collection program and ACS, and about the extent  to which procedures exist to monitor ACS case prioritization and  selection.

If a case is not resolved during the notice phase, it is  sent to the automated Inventory Delivery System (IDS), where the next  step is determined. IDS will (1) identify and filter out uncollectible cases  (i.e., removed from active collection status through a process known as  shelving), (2) categorize some cases as high risk, and (3) determine  whether cases should be routed to either ACS or Field collection to  potentially be worked.

For example, cases where a taxpayer  owes a large amount of money would be considered high risk and  would be a priority for selection.", "The outputs from the modeling and risking activities are used in  conjunction with hundreds of business rules to determine where to route  cases for further collection actions.

IRS pursues ACS  collection cases by taking one or more actions, including reminding  taxpayers of their tax delinquency through automated outgoing calls and  letters, as well as placing liens on property or levying wages or assets.  These actions may prompt taxpayers to call ACS to attempt to resolve  their cases. If collection cases in ACS do not contain up-to-date contact  information for the taxpayer, or information about sources that IRS could  levy, IRS collection representatives will search for such information. If  they find it, the case enters the pool of cases on which a potential action  could be taken.", "ACS attempts to resolve two types of collection delinquencies: (1)  balance due cases, in which a taxpayer has a tax liability to IRS, and (2)  nonfiler cases, in which a taxpayer has an unfiled return.

However, these cases could also be closed as currently not collectible if  ACS collection representatives are unable to locate or contact the  taxpayer, or if the taxpayer is facing economic hardship or unable to pay,  among other reasons. Some cases closed as currently not collectible  may reenter the collection inventory if IRS determines that in the future,  the taxpayer will be able to pay some of the tax debt.", "Unfiled return cases may be resolved if the taxpayer files the delinquent  return, or if the taxpayer is no longer liable for the unpaid taxes during the  period in question, among other reasons.

Previously, ACS operations  were split with W&I handling collections against individual taxpayers, and  SB/SE handling individuals with business income and losses as well as  all business entity taxpayers. As part of the realignment, IRS is  consolidating all ACS call and support sites within SB/SE. At least  through fiscal year 2015, ACS will operate separate phone numbers for  W&I and SB/SE, and all sites will continue to handle the same type of  taxpayers as they did prior to the realignment.

IRS  managers responsible for ACS case prioritization and selection cannot  change these steps without guidance from IRS collection program  executives and input from IRS\u2019s information technology staff. Overall, the  ACS prioritization and selection process is set up so that high-priority  cases are worked first. These include IRS program collection priorities  and cases that have a greater potential to result in full payment or an  installment agreement based on IRS\u2019s predictive models discussed  above. Documentation of the process is limited (an issue we discuss later  in this report); therefore we based our description below largely on our  reviews of the documentation that does exist, on multiple interviews with  IRS officials, and on our observations during two visits to the ACS call site  in Philadelphia.", "The first step in the ACS prioritization and selection process is to assign a  case to one of three inventory groups: (1) special inventories, (2) model  priority inventories, and (3) the general population inventory.", "During this step, ACS first assesses cases to determine whether they fall  within one of ACS\u2019s five special inventories, four of which align with IRS\u2019s  collection program priorities. ACS will look at the case characteristics,  such as from which IRS division the case originated, to assign it to a  special inventory. ACS works all but one of the special inventories at  specific call sites where staff possess the expertise to work the cases.  See table 1.", "Next, ACS assesses the remaining cases to determine whether they  qualify for assignment to one of the business model priority inventories.  These inventories contain cases that IRS predicts as having a probability  of resulting in full payment or installment agreements, among other  outcomes. To make this determination, ACS uses the predictive model  scores generated by IDS. If the model score on the case is above a  specified threshold, ACS will assign the case to the corresponding model  priority inventory. ACS assigns any remaining cases not placed into one  of the special inventories or model priority inventories to the general  population inventory.", "Simultaneously with these actions, ACS assigns each case a risk  category of high, medium, or low. ACS bases this assignment on the  case\u2019s characteristics, such as its age, the dollar value of the outstanding  balance, and the type of return the taxpayer filed or failed to file, among  others. According to IRS officials, the risk categories have remained  largely unchanged since their inception in 2000. Many of the risk  categories contain dollar thresholds, which have also remained  unchanged; for example, if a taxpayer has a delinquent balance due that  is within or above a specified amount, ACS will assign it to the  corresponding risk category. In addition, ACS uses risk categories to  determine how long to retain cases in ACS before sending them to the  queue or shelving them. ACS sends high- and medium-risk cases to the  queue after 26 weeks. Low-risk cases are not sent to the queue but are  shelved after 104 weeks. IRS officials said that ACS retains low-risk  cases for longer because ACS staff have to work through high- and  medium-risk cases before they can get to low-risk cases. These officials  added that if low-risk cases are not resolved in ACS and subsequently  sent to the queue, it is unlikely that they would get worked by revenue  officers in Field collection.", "After ACS assigns a case to an inventory and a risk category, the case  receives a priority level, which determines the order in which ACS works  the case within each inventory. ACS uses the assigned inventory, risk  category, and the predictive model scores unique to each case to assign  it a priority level. Figure 3 illustrates how ACS sets the priority level for  business taxpayers. The ACS process for setting the priority level for  individual taxpayers is similar except that it prioritizes high-income  nonfiler and FERDI cases, among others, first. Following the IRS  realignment, which is consolidating all ACS call sites within SB/SE, IRS  officials said that their goal is to integrate the case prioritization and  selection processes used for SB/SE and W&I into one approach during  fiscal year 2016.", "IRS collection program officials said that they would like to continue to  expand IRS\u2019s use of the IDS model scores to prioritize cases within ACS.  For example, ACS prioritizes cases into priority levels of 0 to 5, but does  not prioritize the cases within each level. According to IRS collection  program officials, using the model scores more robustly would allow IRS  to better select among cases that have the same priority level or follow-up  date. However, collection program officials have no plans to use the  predictive model scores as the sole factor to prioritize cases as this would  ignore the collection program priorities discussed above.", "In the third step, ACS assigns each case to a function unit. Function units  are holding bins for cases while they wait for action by either ACS  collection representatives or the system itself (which acts automatically).  Generally, these actions include contacting taxpayers, taking enforcement  actions, such as liens and levies, or investigating cases for contact  information.

Without clearly documented program objectives, IRS cannot ensure that  its risk assessment processes effectively identify and analyze relevant  risks associated with achieving objectives. ERM\u2019s training for managers  reinforces the importance of understanding objectives at various levels  across IRS and establishing a risk management process to minimize the  effects of risk to the accomplishment of those objectives.

The information we used to outline the  ACS case prioritization and selection process discussed above was  mostly told to us by IRS officials over a series of discussions, rather than  by clear and comprehensive documentation. IRS was able to provide  documentation on the case characteristics that apply to each risk  category and the IRM section that explains ACS operations, including  information about how cases are assigned to function units.

For example,  key IRS staff have been employed in ACS since at least 2000, when ACS  began using the risk categories. The officials also acknowledged that the  process needs to be written out to affect a smooth transition to future staff  and management. Indeed, IRS officials told us that some ACS staff will  soon be eligible for retirement, which highlights the importance for IRS to  document the multistep ACS process.", "Without adequate documentation, it is also difficult to determine whether  the ACS case prioritization and selection process effectively supports  collection program and ACS missions and objectives. Furthermore, as  IRS realigns ACS collection operations within SB/SE, having baseline  documentation of the process as structured would assist IRS in  communicating the process to staff and in making decisions about how  best to consolidate ACS.

ACS has no procedures or structure for  regularly completing periodic evaluations of the ACS case prioritization  and selection process, including its use of the special inventories, risk  categories, predictive models, and priority levels. For example, according  to IRS officials, the ACS risk categories have been relatively static since  their creation in 2000, and dollar values within those risk categories have  not been adjusted for inflation. While some changes have been made to  the ACS case prioritization and selection process, these changes were  based on ad hoc studies or recommended by management based on  changes in priorities, rather than the result of regular and periodic  evaluations of the ACS case prioritization process. For example, as a  result of the IRS Collection Process Study completed in 2010, IRS  decided to retain high-risk cases longer in ACS to ensure those cases get  worked. IRS officials said that while they have no procedures to  regularly or periodically evaluate ACS case prioritization, such  evaluations could provide useful information for consolidating ACS  operations in SB/SE, in light of the IRS realignment.

For example, CWOP recommended  that ACS stop prioritizing cases by follow-up date because selecting  cases by the oldest follow-up date may result in ACS selecting cases with  less collection potential. In our discussions about the status of the CWOP  recommendations, IRS officials said that while CWOP remains an  ongoing effort, they do not have a plan or time frame in place for next  steps and corrective actions in response to the report. IRS officials stated  that they have been unable to take action with regard to certain CWOP  recommendations due to scarce resources and competing priorities for  IRS\u2019s information technology services.", "Internal control standards note that managers are to (1) promptly evaluate  findings from audits and other reviews, including those showing  deficiencies and recommendations reported by auditors and others who  evaluate agencies\u2019 operations, (2) determine proper actions in response  to findings and recommendations from audits and reviews, and (3)  complete, within established time frames, all actions that correct or  otherwise resolve the matters brought to management\u2019s attention.", "Without periodically reviewing and evaluating the ACS case prioritization  and selection process and ensuring that findings from evaluations, such  as CWOP, are addressed and corrective action is taken where  necessary, ACS may be missing opportunities to better prioritize its  workload and improve collection results. For example, CWOP  recommends that ACS prioritize collection cases in each of its inventories  by the model scores rather than by the priority level codes. According to  IRS, this would help ACS select the cases with the greatest collection  potential. Without such evaluations, IRS may also not be able to ensure  that ACS case prioritization is working as intended and may be missing  opportunities to more effectively align the ACS case prioritization process  with IRS\u2019s strategic objectives and with collection program and ACS  objectives, once developed. In addition, if the prioritization and selection  process is not periodically evaluated over time, it could lose its value and  usefulness. For example, IRS does not know how the static dollar  thresholds for the ACS risk categories affect the composition of cases  assigned certain priorities and risks over time.

ACS\u2019s process for prioritizing and selecting cases helps to  ensure that high-priority taxpayers, including federal employees and  retirees, high-income nonfilers, and large corporations, as well as  taxpayers who have a higher probability of paying their taxes in full,  comply with the tax laws. But the absence of key management controls\u2014 objectives, documentation, and procedures to complete periodic  evaluations\u2014creates multiple challenges for IRS.

The documents reviewed include sections of the Internal Revenue  Manual (IRM), program documents, IRS reports, and presentations  prepared by IRS staff. To better understand background and context for  ACS, we reviewed information on the Inventory Delivery System process,  which routes cases to ACS, and interviewed IRS officials responsible for  the IRS collection program. We also twice visited an ACS call site in  Philadelphia. We interviewed IRS managers in the offices of  Headquarters Collection and Campus Collection, including IRS managers  responsible for managing case inventory in ACS, on how collection cases  are received in and flow through the ACS process. We also interviewed  IRS officials regarding the various factors that the officials take into  consideration in deciding how to work certain cases to meet ACS  performance measures and how IRS\u2019s recent realignment will affect  ACS\u2019s process. In addition, we observed ACS staff working cases and  taking telephone calls from taxpayers. To better understand the scale of  operations for ACS and performance measures, we reviewed data from a  number of prepared reports and other data provided by IRS covering  fiscal years 2012 through 2014. The data we received included the  number of notification and enforcement actions taken in ACS. We derived  most of the data from IRS Collection Activity Reports (CAR).

We  analyzed and reported closed ACS collection cases by the type of  taxpayer (individual or business), case priority, type of delinquency, type  of closure, and the average and median number of days cases were open  in ACS. For purposes of our analysis of taxpayer type, individual  taxpayers reflect cases handled by ACS call sites in the Wage &  Investment division. We defined business taxpayers as those cases that  were prioritized and worked within the Small Business and Self Employed  division. These include the following types of taxpayers:  Individual taxpayers who report business income, such as (1) nonfarm  sole proprietorships that file Form 1040, Schedule C, are  unincorporated and owned by a single individual in which net  business income or loss is included in the owner\u2019s individual adjusted  gross income; (2) landlords, who file a Form 1040 and Schedule E- Part I and are individuals who report rental real estate activity on Part  I of Schedule E; or (3) farmers, who file a Form 1040 and Schedule F  or Form 4835 and are individuals who report farm income or  landowners who report farm rental income;", "Businesses which failed to file or remit fully their employment taxes; or", "Business entity taxpayers, such as corporations.", "For the purposes of our analysis, we treated taxpayers who had both a  balance due and nonfiler account on their case, known as a combination  case, as a balance due case, consistent with how IRS reports ACS data.

We then focused our assessment of ACS internal controls around our  selected standards by interviewing IRS officials and reviewing available  documentation. To determine IRS\u2019s definition of fairness as it applies to  collection activities, we reviewed the ACS procedures and process for  case prioritization and selection. Furthermore, we surveyed relevant  industry and institutional sources, and determined that there is no  standard definition of fairness in the context of tax collection specifically\u2014 or even tax administration more generally\u2014to which IRS could appeal in  lieu of having its own internally-generated definition of fairness within the  collection program. To determine whether there are procedures in place  to monitor, evaluate, and review the ACS prioritization process  periodically, we reviewed similar documentation mentioned above.
