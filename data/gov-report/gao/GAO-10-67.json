C-5s and C-17s move troops and cargo internationally (strategic airlift) and C-130s are the primary aircraft that moves them within a theater of operation (tactical airlift). Over the next 4 years, DOD plans to spend about $12 billion to modernize and procure airlifters and is currently studying how many it needs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to (1) identify the status of DOD's modernization and acquisition efforts and (2) determine how well DOD is addressing any capability gaps and redundancies. In conducting this work, GAO identified the cost, schedule, and performance of airlift programs, as well as DOD's plan for addressing gaps and redundancies. GAO also discussed mobility study efforts with DOD, Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA), and RAND Coporation officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has recently revamped airlift investments due to modernization cost increases and requirement changes. For strategic airlift, the number of C-5s that will be fully modernized were cut in half because of substantial reengining cost increases and C-17 quantities were increased from 180 to 213 aircraft. These twin changes resulted in a net cost increase of about$3 billion. Additional costs and force structure changes are possible pending decisions on C-5 retirements, other modifications, the potential need for more C-17s to meet tactical airlift needs, and the planned shutdown of C-17 production. For tactical airlift, substantial cost increases for modernizing C-130 avionics tripled unit costs, delayed its schedule, and resulted in almost 60 percent fewer aircraft being modernized. There have been large increases in the C-130J quantity to replace older C-130s, but modest increases in unit costs. The joint Army-Air Force C-27J program was recently transferred to the Air Force and quantities were cut from 78 to 38 aircraft, with an uncertain effect on the Army's airlift missions. The Army and Air Force must also resolve fundamental differences in operating requirements and employment strategy for the Joint Future Theater Lift (JFTL). DOD appears to have addressed its strategic airlift gap, but there is a potential future tactical airlift gap for moving medium weight equipment. Also, questions regarding how the Air Force will meet the Army's direct support mission have not been resolved. DOD is using $5.5 billion appropriated by Congress to procure 23 additional C-17s, which DOD officials believe more than offsets the strategic airlift gap associated with the restructured C-5 modernization program. However, there is a potential gap in the tactical airlift of medium weight loads beyond the capability of the C-130s. The C-17 is the only aircraft capable of moving this type of Army equipment within a theater of operation, although not to austere, short, or unimproved landing areas. The JFTL is envisioned to provide this capability, but will not be available for 15 years or more under the current acquisition strategy. While the various mobility studies acknowledge the C-17's significant dual role, they did not comprehensively evaluate the expanded use of the C-17 to transport medium weight equipment in theater and how this could impact the force structure, the C-17's service life, and decisions related to when to shut down the production line. In addition, questions remain about the number of C-130s and C-27Js needed to fulfill Army direct support missions. Two studies reached somewhat different conclusions about the cost effectiveness of using C-130Js and C-27Js for this mission. The Air Force and Army have not completed a plan for meeting Army direct support requirements, which could affect future decisions on both the C-27J and the C-130J. DOD's recently established portfolio management structure is supposed to provide a useful forum to address the broad range of airlift investment decisions. However, efforts so far have primarily focused on new programs rather than addressing gaps and making other airlift decisions such as when and how many C-5s to retire or the appropriate mix of C-130s and C-27Js needed to perform Army missions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) employs over 700 aircraft to move  troops and cargo in support of wartime operations, peacetime missions,  and humanitarian aid efforts.

The family of C-130 aircraft, which includes the       C-130E, C-130H, and C-130J aircraft, is then the primary asset used to  move weapons, equipment, and troops within a theater of operation. The  C-17 is dually capable of performing both strategic and tactical airlift  missions and supplements the C-130 for tactical airlift. All of these aircraft  are owned and operated by the Air Force and are considered part of the  common user pool of aircraft that can be used to support any of the  services\u2019 missions. DOD also relies on the Air Force\u2019s aerial refueling  tankers (KC-10 and KC-135), commercial aircraft, and leased aircraft to  supplement airlift capabilities. Officials at the U.S. Transportation  Command and its Air Force component, the Air Mobility Command,  decide on how best to use the assets on a daily basis. Often, these aircraft  are scheduled for departure when they have a full load, to ensure assets  are used cost-effectively. The services may also use their own airplanes  and helicopters that are not in the common user pool to move people and  cargo within a theater of operation. For example, these assets include the  Army\u2019s C-23 Sherpas and the Marine Corps\u2019 V-22 Osprey aircraft. These  aircraft are used to perform time-sensitive, mission-critical requirements  and may take off without full loads since urgency is the primary driver for  the mission, not efficiency or cost-effectiveness.", "The Air Force is in the process of modernizing its C-5 and C-130H aircraft  and acquiring C-17s, C-130Js, and C-27Js to meet its future strategic and  tactical airlift requirements and improve aircraft availability. It plans to  retire C-130Es from the tactical airlift fleet by 2014. C-5s are being  modernized in two phases. During the first phase, known as the Avionics  Modernization Program (AMP), aircraft receive upgraded avionics  capabilities and an all-weather flight control system. During the second  phase, known as the Reliability Enhancement and Reengining Program  (RERP), aircraft engines are replaced and electrical, fuel, and other  subsystems are modified. Together, the two modifications will help  improve the C-5s wartime mission capable rate. C-130H aircraft are also  receiving an AMP modification and will undergo a center wing box  replacement because of severe cracking discovered in that area.", "DOD periodically assesses global threats, the national military strategy,  and its force structure to determine future airlift requirements and to  judge the sufficiency of its acquisition and modernization plans. The  analytical basis for DOD\u2019s current airlift requirements is the Mobility  Capabilities Study completed in December 2005. Officials used the study  results to report in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review that 180 C-17s  and 112 fully modernized C-5s (those that received the AMP and RERP  modifications) would be sufficient to meet the national military strategy  for strategic airlift with acceptable risk.  This could change pending the  completion of the ongoing DOD Mobility Capabilities and Requirements  Study 2016, two other DOD-sponsored airlift studies conducted by IDA  and RAND, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, and potential changes  in threat assumptions and the national security strategy.

The C-5 RERP modernization program is just beginning  the low rate initial production phase. Only 3 of 52 C-5s have received the  RERP modification as part of the development program. DOD has already  spent about $69.2 billion on research, development, test and evaluation  (RDT&E) and procurement funds on these programs and program officials  project they will need to invest about $7.7 billion to complete the  programs as currently planned (see table 2).", "The department planned to spend about $12 billion to make AMP and  RERP modifications to the fleet of C-5 aircraft by 2020. However, the Air  Force declared a Nunn-McCurdy cost breach in the RERP program in  September 2007, due to increased labor and parts costs. The AMP effort  required additional software development to address deficiencies found  during developmental testing. Development costs would have been higher  except that the Air Force decided not to address 250 deficiencies and 14  operational requirements in this program. These events resulted in revised  plans to provide the AMP upgrade to all C-5 aircraft and the RERP  modification to 52 aircraft. The combined cost for both modifications was  reduced to $9.1 billion, but now less than one-half of the fleet will be fully  modernized and at a much higher unit cost than originally estimated\u2014 $160.5 million for both modifications versus $96.1 million.

The C-17 is also addressing modernization through a series of aircraft  upgrades designed to address emerging issues such as international  airspace access requirements and critical operational/safety issues.", "Significant C-5 cost growth and further delays are possible if the RERP  program is not adequately funded. We previously reported that, according  to the department\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group, the RERP program  was underfunded by about $294 million, with additional funding needed in  fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Replacement engines are the costliest portion  of the RERP upgrade, and DOD officials said if funding is insufficient to  meet yearly production quantities in existing purchase agreements,  anticipated price breaks will not occur and could likely result in another  Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach and program restructure. Department  officials said the Air Force is committed to fully funding the RERP  modification of 52 aircraft, but did not provide us with new budget data  for fiscal years 2011 and beyond.", "Planned quantities of C-17s have fluctuated over the years. C-17  procurement began in 1988 and the Air Force initially planned to acquire  210 aircraft. Following a major acquisition review in 1990, the program  was reduced to 120 aircraft because of technical problems and funding  shortfalls during the full-scale development program, which resulted in  higher than expected cost increases and schedule delays. In subsequent  years, DOD expanded the program from 120 aircraft to 180 aircraft and, in  the past 3 fiscal years, Congress has provided funding that would allow  DOD to procure 33 additional aircraft: 10 in fiscal year 2007, 15 in fiscal   year 2008, and 8 in fiscal year 2009.

A DOD official stated that preliminary results of the  Mobility Capabilities and Requirements Study 2016 show that in the worst  case planning scenario there would be enough C-17s to perform its  primary role as a strategic airlifter, as well as some tactical missions  through 2016.  This is because the study analysis shows the peak demand  for the C-17 and the C-130 occurs at different times and the C-17 is aging as  planned.  However, officials indicated that none of the current mobility  studies analyzed the need for the C-17 to perform additional tactical heavy  lift missions for the 8-year period between 2016 and 2024, when the JFTL  is expected to be fielded. Furthermore, because we were not granted  access to the preliminary study information, we could not ascertain the  extent to which the C-17\u2019s heavy lift mission had been considered in DOD\u2019s  analysis through 2016.  C-17 production is scheduled to end in March 2011.  As we previously reported a well-reasoned, near-term decision on the final  C-17 fleet size could help DOD avoid substantial future costs from ending  production prematurely and later restarting production. For example, the  Air Force has estimated that restoring the production line could cost $2  billion. Costs and challenges associated with such a course include hiring  and training a workforce of nearly 3,100 people, reinstalling and restoring  production tooling, and identifying suppliers and qualifying their parts and  processes.", "Although it is too early to comment on JFTL program outcomes, we  believe DOD officials will need to exercise caution to avoid pitfalls we  have previously identified in connection with developing new weapon  systems so the new system will be delivered on time and within cost  estimates. These pitfalls include taking a revolutionary versus an  evolutionary approach for weapon system development, over promising  performance capabilities; increasing requirements; and understating  expected costs, schedules, and risks associated with developing and  producing the weapon. DOD understands many of the problems that affect  acquisition programs and has revised its acquisition policy as a foundation  for establishing sound, knowledge-based business cases for individual  acquisition programs.  For example, the policy recommends the  completion of key systems engineering activities before the start of  development, including a requirement for early prototyping, and  establishes review boards to evaluate the effect of potential requirements  changes on ongoing programs.  The policy also supports evolutionary  acquisitions and states that increments should be fully funded, include  mature technologies, and normally be developed in less than 5 years.   However, to improve outcomes, DOD must ensure that its policy changes  are consistently implemented and reflected in decisions on individual  programs.", "Both Air Force and Army science and technology officials indicated that  no new technology invention is needed for either of their concepts.  However, tiltrotor technology has never been applied to a system of the  size needed to carry all the Army\u2019s ground vehicles (excluding the M-1  tank). In fact, the Army envisions the JFTL\u2019s payload capacity will be  nearly 5 times that of the V-22, the world\u2019s first production tiltrotor aircraft  and nearly 3 times that of the CH-47 Chinook, a heavy lift helicopter used  to transport ground forces, supplies, and other critical cargo. In addition,  the Senate Armed Services Committee recently noted that to support the  JFTL initial operational capability, a prototype would need to be flying by  2015. Yet, the committee could not identify any DOD funds budgeted for  accomplishing this objective, and further observed that waiting to conduct  a competitive prototyping effort as part of an acquisition program would  take years to begin. As such, the committee requested the Under Secretary  for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to, among other things, assess  the merits of initiating a low-cost, highly streamlined competitive  prototyping effort immediately, determine whether cost and performance  goals can be met, help define requirements, and sustain the industrial base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mix of C-130s and C-27Js Needed to Support Army Missions Has Not Been Determined", "paragraphs": ["Questions remain about the number of C-130s and C-27Js needed to  support Army direct support missions.  As stated earlier, as part of its  fiscal year 2010 budget request, the department transferred the C-27J  program, along with the resupply mission it supports, exclusively to the  Air Force and reduced the program from 78 to 38 aircraft. In a recent  hearing, congressional leaders questioned the Secretary of Defense about  how the Air Force will fulfill this mission with fewer aircraft than initially  anticipated.  In response, the Secretary of Defense stated that the  reduced number of C-27Js was based on the number needed to recapitalize  the Army\u2019s fleet of C-23 Sherpas and that uncommitted C-130 aircraft can  be used to complement the C-27Js to fulfill the Army\u2019s mission. In addition,  he said there needs to be a change in the Air Force\u2019s culture with respect  to how the direct support mission is accomplished.", "The Air Force and Army are in the process of developing plans on how the  Air Force intends to fulfill the direct support mission, which would include  important decisions on employment concepts, basing, and life-cycle  support. The plans are in various stages of development and are expected  to be completed by October 2012.  However, congressional concerns  remain regarding the service\u2019s commitment to that mission. This concern  is based on historical instances in which the Air Force assigned lesser  priority to direct delivery missions compared with traditional airlift  operations, most notably during the Vietnam War when the Air Force  assumed ownership of the Army\u2019s C-7 Caribou aircraft and subsequently  dropped some missions. It is also unclear what effect this program change  will have on the Air Force\u2019s C-130 fleet operations.", "In recent studies, IDA and RAND assessed the use and roles of the C-130s  and C-27Js in performing tactical missions.  Although the study parameters  were different, they both looked at the tactical movement of cargo. IDA\u2019s  analysis focused on the use of these aircraft within the context of major  combat operations as well as persistent global involvement in numerous  smaller operations.  IDA found that the tactical fleets they examined were  equally cost-effective at transporting cargo in major combat operations.  Whereas C-130s are more cost effective than the C-27Js in specific  missions that demand full loads, the opposite is true when missions  require small loads.  Further, in non-major combat operations, IDA found  that the global demand for small loads on numbers of aircraft in different  locations made additional C-27Js more cost-effective than additional C- 130s.", "According to RAND officials, RAND work on this topic has been underway  for several years.  The first RAND study focused on determining the most  cost-effective way to recapitalize the C-130 fleet in order to meet the  official wartime requirement.  This study concluded that acquisition of the  extended version of the C-130J was the most cost effective option to  perform tactical missions defined in the officially approved wartime  requirement.  The C-27J provides about 40 percent of the cargo capacity  (in terms of pallets) as the extended C-130J at about two-thirds the cost,  based on net present value total life cycle costs.  In addition, the study also  concluded that the extended C-130J and the C-27J were equally cost- effective at conducting the ongoing resupply missions in Iraq and  Afghanistan.  RAND was then asked to consider the cost-effectiveness of  the C-27J in eight additional missions that were not part of the official  requirement.  The study concluded that the C-27J was not cost-effective or  appropriate for five of those missions and was comparable to the C-130J in  three of the missions.  RAND also found that the C-130J and the C-27J have  comparable performance under operationally consistent circumstances of  delivering the same amount of cargo at the same distances.", "It should be noted that neither of these studies addressed recent C-27J  program decisions that resulted in the transfer of the program to the Air  Force and a reduction in aircraft quantities. Likewise, neither of the  studies considered the number of C-130s that may be necessary to  supplement these missions or the impact the missions may have on the     C-130 fleet. Furthermore, because the C-27J was not initially considered  part of the common user pool, the ongoing DOD Mobility Capabilities and  Requirements Study 2016 did not include the C-27J in the common user  pool in its analysis.  Following the restructuring, an Air Force official told  us that, while the C-27J\u2019s primary use is expected to be for direct support  of the Army, it would also be available for movement of cargo in the  common user pool."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Portfolio Management Initiative Offers Opportunities to Better Manage Airlift Investments", "paragraphs": ["In September 2008, the department instituted a new process for helping  senior leaders make investment decisions, including those for airlift.

Namely,  the studies do not quantitatively account for the increasing tactical role of  the C-17, especially in light of the fact that C-130s are not capable of  delivering heavier equipment demanded by our warfighters and that the  JFTL, which is envisioned to perform this mission, will not be available for  15 years. Further, the studies do not explore the possible use of C-27Js in a  common user role or the impact on the fleet and number of C-130s needed  to support Army time-sensitive, mission-critical requirements.", "While Congress and DOD appear to have addressed the strategic airlift  capability gap, some fundamental questions remain: Can the Air Force  adequately fund the C-5 RERP modification program over the next              5 years? When should C-5s be retired and how many? And how many C-5s  would need the AMP modification if some of the aircraft are retired? Even  larger questions exist for tactical airlift:  Are 213 C-17s enough to perform  both strategic and tactical missions? What are the potential impacts on C- 17 service life, maintenance, and availability from its expected increased  use in the future for the tactical airlift of heavier and bulkier Army  equipment? How will the Air Force meet the Army\u2019s time-sensitive  mission-critical requirements with 40 fewer C-27J aircraft? Will there be a  fundamental shift in the Air Force\u2019s roles and mission that would require  the Air Force to assume more Army-specific missions? Can the department  set technically realistic requirements for the JFTL and follow an  evolutionary acquisition strategy that includes selecting mature  technologies, normally developing increments in less than 5 years and fully  funding each increment?", "More information is needed to help the department address these  questions and avoid the unnecessary expenditure of billions of dollars on  redundant capabilities or a potentially premature C-17 production line  shutdown. The airlift portfolio management team has the requisite  authority to address these questions and influence budget decisions, but  greater attention must be paid to all facets of the airlift life cycle\u2014from  cradle to grave. Making sound modernization and retirement decisions is  just as important as deciding when and what type of new programs to  start.

This would also include  identifying alternatives for using existing common user aircraft to meet  service-specific missions and considering new roles and missions for the  Air Force;  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation) and Commander, U.S. Transportation Command to develop a  specific airlift plan that would identify when C-5s will be retired and  identify the total number of additional C-17s, if any, that would be needed  to replace C-5s or perform tactical heavy lift missions until the time the  JFTL is fielded;  the Commander, Air Mobility Command, to determine the appropriate mix  of C-27Js and C-130s that are needed to meet Army time-sensitive, mission- critical requirements and common user pool requirements; the Air Force and Army to reach agreement on plans detailing how Army  time-sensitive, mission-critical requirements will be addressed and  prioritized against other Air Force priorities; and the joint Air Force and Army program office to develop a plan to follow an  evolutionary approach for developing the JFTL based on DOD acquisition  policy that includes selecting mature technologies, normally developing  increments in less than 5 years, and fully funding each increment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report; these  are included in appendix II.  DOD partially concurred with all five  recommendations, stating that it either has plans and processes in place or  ongoing efforts to address our concerns.  During the course of our review,  DOD officials explained the steps they were taking to make strategic and  tactical airlift decisions, but in some cases did not provide us with  supporting documentation and, in other cases, the plans were in the initial  stages of development and there was not yet sufficient detail for us to  determine the extent to which they addressed our concerns. Despite the  positive actions DOD described, we believe that the department\u2019s efforts  in some cases still fall short and that our recommendations are warranted  to help guide subsequent actions and transition plans to effective  implementation. DOD officials also provided technical comments on our  draft and we revised our report where appropriate.", "In response to our first recommendation about the portfolio management  team providing more comprehensive advice to senior leaders on the full  range of investment decisions, DOD says it has a structured process in  place for assessing its mobility capabilities and requirements that includes  strategic and tactical airlift decisions.  We understand that DOD has a  process in place to make airlift decisions, but they are not being made  from a comprehensive portfolio management perspective, per DOD  regulation. DOD officials could not provide us with any evidence that the  portfolio management team had even discussed airlift issues from a  portfolio perspective, even though the logistics portfolio began as a pilot  program for portfolio management 2 years ago. We believe DOD portfolio  managers need to take a broader perspective on airlift issues to ensure  that the appropriate amount of attention and resources are available to  address the most pressing issues for new and legacy programs and to  avoid unnecessary expenditure of funds for modernizations or  acquisitions. Therefore, we do not believe that DOD\u2019s response adequately  addresses our recommendation.", "The department agreed with our second recommendation on the need to  develop a plan for strategic airlift that identifies the number of C-5s that  will be retired and the number of additional C-17s, if any that might be  needed.  In its comments, DOD stated that the Secretary of the Air Force,  in coordination with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation) and U.S. Transportation Command  has already developed this plan based on the current level of  congressional funding for the C-17 and preliminary results of the Mobility  Capabilities Requirements Study 2016 and the Quadrennial Defense  Review.  Specifically, DOD officials believe an adequate number of C-17s  have been procured to cover all necessary missions to satisfy the National  Defense Strategy and will retire some C-5s.  We were not provided any  details about this plan for strategic airlift, the ongoing mobility study or  the Quadrennial Defense Review to comment on the adequacy of the  analysis, but believe that a thorough analysis is needed for senior leaders  to make sound investment decisions. We are concerned about the  adequacy of the plan because during the course of our review, DOD  officials told us that the Mobility Capabilities Requirements Study 2016  does not specifically quantify the use of the C-17 in a tactical role or  evaluate the impact on its service life resulting from the increased use in  that regard.  In 2007, over 20 percent of the C-17 missions were for tactical  missions and this could grow given that it is the only aircraft that is  capable of moving certain types of equipment within a theater of  operations that are too large or bulky for the C-130.  Further, it is unclear  whether DOD has identified how many C-5s need the AMP modification  since additional C-17s are being procured or when and how many C-5s will  be retired. In addition, we previously reported on deficiencies in how DOD  conducted its previous mobility capabilities study and we do not know if  DOD has addressed these flaws in the current study. As a result, we do  not know the extent to which the new study will provide clear answers for  senior leaders regarding strategic and tactical airlift or engender more  questions.", "DOD commented that it believes it has fulfilled the requirements for our  third and fourth recommendations by recently tasking the Air Force and  Army to determine the appropriate mix of C-27Js and C-130s to perform  Army time-sensitive, mission-critical requirements and common user pool  requirements, as well as develop plans detailing how Army requirements  will be prioritized against Air Force priorities.  These are good first steps.   However, the plans are still in development and, according to an Air Force  briefing to the Deputy\u2019s Advisory Working Group, more work needs to be  done. Critical details, including a concept for employment, a final basing  plan, and a decision on the maintenance concept will have to be worked  out over the next several years. These issues have also generated much  debate within the department and in Congress concerning aircraft  quantities and employment strategies. As we stated earlier, the Air Force  has historically had trouble balancing Army priorities with its own and,  according to the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force will need to change  its culture to successfully meet both requirements.  In addition to  completing the plans, we believe DOD may need to exert sustained  oversight by senior leaders, including the portfolio management team, to  ensure the Air Force is able to perform these missions over the long-term.", "Finally, DOD believes that it has fulfilled the requirement for our fifth  recommendation related to using an evolutionary approach for developing  the JFTL that includes selecting mature technologies, developing  increments in less than 5 years, and fully funding each increment.  DOD  stated that the Air Force and Army are currently engaged in approving a  JFTL initial capabilities document and commencing with a formal analysis  of alternatives to consider all viable options for addressing capability gaps.   We believe these start-up actions are appropriate and, if accomplished  according to policy, should provide a solid foundation to inform  subsequent decisions for a new weapon system acquisition program.  Our  recommendation, however, is geared not only to these initial planning  steps but also looking forward to the smooth transition to system  development and effective acquisition program management.  This  recommendation will take several steps and years to complete, and we  believe senior leaders, including the portfolio management team, need to  ensure that the JFTL program has a solid business case at the start of  development with mature technologies, adequate funding, and an  incremental plan for development. Our previous work on many other  weapon systems programs has shown that without these, programs are  likely to encounter significant cost and schedule growth that will, if  realized on the JFTL program, impact the department\u2019s ability to move  medium weight equipment within a theater of operations directly to the  warfighter.  It may also have an impact on the C-17 program as these  aircraft may be used more frequently than planned for tactical missions.
