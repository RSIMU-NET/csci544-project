Such opportunities exist throughout the government. GAO reports annually to Congress on federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives (both within departments and government-wide) that are fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative as well as opportunities for cost savings or enhanced revenues. One area that GAO has highlighted as offering the potential for significant cost savings is improper payments, which are payments that should not have been made or were made in the incorrect amount.", "This statement discusses the status of (1) actions taken and remaining opportunities to address fragmentation, overlap, and duplication issues, and achieve other financial benefits as identified in GAO's 2011-2014 annual reports; and (2) efforts to address government-wide improper payment issues. GAO reviewed and updated prior work and recommendations on issues of fragmentation, overlap, duplication, cost savings, and improper payments. GAO also reviewed reports of inspectors general and agency financial reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The executive branch and Congress have made progress in addressing the approximately 440 actions across 180 areas that GAO identified in its past annual reports. These issues span the range of government services and programs, from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to transportation programs to weapon systems acquisitions. As of November 19, 2014, 29 percent of these actions were addressed, 44 percent were partially addressed, and 22 percent were not addressed. Executive branch and congressional efforts to address these actions over the past 4 years resulted in over $20 billion in financial benefits, with about $80 billion more in financial benefits anticipated in future years. Although progress has been made, fully addressing all the remaining actions identified in GAO's annual reports could lead to tens of billions of dollars of additional savings, with significant opportunities for improved efficiencies, cost savings, or revenue enhancements in the areas of defense, information technology, education and training, health care, energy, and tax enforcement. Sustained leadership by Congress and the executive branch is necessary to achieve this goal.", "Efforts to reduce improper payments could result in significant cost savings. For the first time in recent years, the government-wide improper payment estimate significantly increased\u2014to $124.7 billion in fiscal year 2014, up from $105.8 billion in fiscal year 2013. This increase of almost $19 billion was primarily due to estimates for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, which account for over 76 percent of the government-wide estimate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made numerous recommendations that, if effectively implemented, could improve program management and help reduce improper payments in these programs. Examples include improving the use of prepayment edits in Medicare and requiring states to audit Medicaid payments to and by managed care organizations. Recent laws and guidance have focused attention on the issue of improper payments. For example, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 enacted into law elements of the Do Not Pay initiative, which is a web-based, centralized data matching service that could help prevent improper payments. However, agencies continue to face challenges, such as statutory limitations and compliance issues, in reducing improper payments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces an unsustainable long-term fiscal path.  Changing this path will require difficult fiscal policy decisions to alter both  long-term federal spending and revenue. However, in the near-term,  executive branch agencies and Congress can act to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of government programs and activities.  Opportunities to take action exist in areas where federal programs or  activities are fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative. We annually identify  and report on these opportunities as well as those to achieve other cost  savings or enhanced revenues. One area that we have highlighted as  offering the potential for significant cost savings is improper payments.  The federal government is accountable for how its agencies and grantees  spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars annually, including  safeguarding against improper payments and establishing mechanisms to  recover those funds when overpayments occur.", "My testimony today describes (1) the status of actions taken by the  administration and Congress to address the more than 400  recommendations we identified in our annual reports from 2011 through  2014 on fragmentation, overlap, duplication, cost savings, and revenue  enhancement, and (2) actions needed to address government-wide  improper payments, most recently estimated to be over $124 billion. My  comments are primarily based on our four annual reports and related  testimonies, as well as our high-risk update and recent work on improper  payments and analysis of agency financial reports and reports of  inspectors general (IG). These products include detailed explanations of the methods used to conduct our work. In February 2015, we also  updated our work on programs noncompliant with reporting requirements  for improper payments. We conducted the work that informs this  testimony in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sustained Attention Is Critical for Addressing Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication and Achieving Other Financial Benefits", "paragraphs": ["In our four annual reports issued from 2011 through 2014, we identified  over 180 areas with approximately 440 actions that the executive branch  and Congress could take to address fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication; achieve other cost savings; or enhance revenue. Figure 1  outlines the definitions we use for fragmentation, overlap, and duplication.  Although it may be appropriate for multiple agencies or entities to be  involved in the same programmatic or policy area due to the nature or  magnitude of the federal effort, the instances of fragmentation, overlap, or  duplication that we include in our annual reports are in areas where  multiple programs and activities may be creating inefficiencies.", "We consider programs or activities to be fragmented when more than one  federal agency (or more than one organization within an agency) is  involved in the same broad area of national need, which may result in  inefficiencies in how the government delivers services. We have identified  fragmentation in multiple programs we reviewed. For example, in our  2014 annual report, we reported that the Department of Defense (DOD)  does not have a consolidated agency-wide strategy to contract for health  care professionals, resulting in a contracting approach that is largely  fragmented. Although some of the military departments attempted to  consolidate their health care staffing requirements through joint-use  contracts, such contracts only accounted for approximately 8 percent of  the $1.14 billion in obligations for health care professionals in fiscal year  2011. Moreover, in May 2013 we identified several instances in which a  single military department awarded numerous task orders for the same  type of health care professional in the same area or facility. For example,  we identified 24 separate task orders for contracted medical assistants at  the same military treatment facility. By not consolidating its requirements,  this facility missed the opportunity to achieve potential cost savings and  other efficiencies.", "Fragmentation also can be a harbinger of overlap or duplication. Overlap  occurs when multiple agencies or programs have similar goals, engage in  similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar  beneficiaries. We found overlap among federal programs or initiatives in a  variety of areas, including housing assistance. In particular, in our 2012  annual report, we reported that 20 different entities administered 160  programs, tax expenditures, and other tools that supported  homeownership and rental housing in fiscal year 2010. In addition, we  identified 39 programs, tax expenditures, and other tools that provided  assistance for buying, selling, or financing a home and 8 programs and  tax expenditures that provide assistance to rental property owners. We  found overlap in products offered and markets served by the Department  of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Rural Housing Service and the Department of  Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Federal Housing Administration,  among others. In August 2012, we questioned the need for maintaining  separate programs for rural areas.", "In other areas, we found evidence of duplication, which occurs when two  or more agencies or programs engage in the same activities or provide  the same services to the same beneficiaries. For example, we reported in  2013 that a total of 31 federal departments and agencies invested billions  of dollars to collect, maintain, and use geospatial information\u2014 information linked to specific geographic locations that supports many  government functions, such as maintaining roads and responding to  natural disasters. We found that federal agencies had not effectively  implemented policies and procedures that would help them identify and  coordinate geospatial data acquisitions across the government. As a  result, we found that agencies made duplicative investments and risk  missing opportunities to jointly acquire data and save millions of dollars.", "In addition, opportunities exist to reduce the cost of government  operations or enhance revenue collections. For example, our body of  work has raised questions about whether DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce  headquarters overhead will result in meaningful savings. In 2013, the  Secretary of Defense directed a 20 percent cut in management  headquarters spending throughout DOD, to include the combatant  commands and service component commands. However, our work found  that mission and headquarters-support costs for the five geographic  combatant commands and their service component commands we  reviewed more than doubled from fiscal years 2007 through 2012, to  about $1.7 billion. We recommended that DOD more systematically  evaluate the sizing and resourcing of its combatant commands. If the  department applied the 20 percent reduction in management  headquarters spending to the $1.7 billion DOD used to operate and  support the five geographic combatant commands in fiscal year 2012, we  reported that DOD could achieve up to an estimated $340 million in  annual savings.", "In our 2013 report, we reported that refining return-on-investment  measures could improve how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  allocates enforcement resources (subject to other considerations, such as  minimizing compliance costs and ensuring equitable treatment of  taxpayers). Our work illustrated that a small shift in existing resources\u2014 from examinations of less productive groups of tax returns to more  productive groups\u2014could potentially increase enforcement revenue by  more than $1 billion. In addition, in our 2011 annual report, we identified  opportunities for improving the Department of the Interior\u2019s management  of federal oil and gas resources. In particular, increasing the diligent  development of federal lands and waters leased for oil and gas  exploration and production and considering adjustments to Interior\u2019s  royalty rates to a level that would ensure the government a fair return,  among other actions, could result in approximately $2 billion in revenues  over 10 years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Executive Branch and Congress Continued to Make Progress in Addressing Previously Identified Issues", "paragraphs": ["We found that the executive branch agencies and Congress have made  progress in addressing the actions identified in our 2011\u20132014 annual  reports. As shown in table 1, of the approximately 440 actions needed in  these areas, 135 (29 percent) were addressed, 202 (44 percent) were  partially addressed, and 103 (22 percent) were not addressed as of  November 2014.", "Examples of progress made include DOD and Congressional actions to  reduce DOD\u2019s fragmented approach for acquiring combat uniforms. In  2013, we found that DOD\u2019s fragmented approach could lead to increased  risk on the battlefield for military personnel and increased development  and acquisition costs. In response, DOD developed and issued guidance  on joint criteria that will help to ensure that future service-specific  uniforms will provide equivalent levels of performance and protection. In  addition, a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2014 established as policy that the Secretary of Defense shall  eliminate the development and fielding of service-specific combat and  camouflage utility uniforms in order to adopt and field common uniforms  for specific environments to be used by all members of the armed forces.Subsequently, the Army chose not to introduce a new family of  camouflage uniforms into its inventory, in part, because of this legislation,  resulting in a cost avoidance of about $4.2 billion over 5 years.", "In addition, progress has been made in addressing the proliferation of  certain programs. For example, the National Science and Technology  Council\u2019s (NSTC) implemented our suggested actions to better manage  overlap across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics  (STEM) education programs. Specifically, NSTC released guidance to  agencies on how to align their programs and budget submissions with the  goals of NSTC\u2019s 5-Year strategic plan for STEM education and on  developing evaluations for the programs. In addition, several programs  were eliminated or consolidated into new programs, with the total number  of STEM education programs dropping from 209 funded in fiscal year  2010 to 158 funded in 2012. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget  proposes to further consolidate and eliminate 20 STEM programs across  eight agencies. These efforts help agencies better target resources  toward programs with positive outcomes and achieve the greatest impact  in developing a pipeline of future workers in STEM fields. As another  example, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, enacted in July  2014, includes provisions to strengthen the workforce development  system under which a variety of employment and training services are  provided to program participants. In particular, the law requires that states  develop a unified state plan that covers all designated core programs to  receive certain funding. States\u2019 implementation of the requirement may  enable them to increase administrative efficiencies in employment and  training programs\u2014a key objective of our prior recommendations on  employment and training programs.", "We estimated that executive branch and congressional efforts to address  suggested actions resulted in roughly $20 billion in financial benefits from  fiscal years 2011 through 2014, with another approximately $80 billion in  additional benefits projected to be accrued through 2023. For example,  in our 2011 annual report, we stated that the ethanol tax credit would cost  about $5 billion in forgone revenues in 2011 and that Congress could  reduce annual revenue losses by addressing duplicative federal efforts  directed at increasing domestic ethanol production. To reduce these  revenue losses, we suggested that Congress consider whether revisions  to the ethanol tax credit were needed and suggested options to consider,  including allowing the credit for the volumetric ethanol excise tax (for fuel  blenders that purchase and blend ethanol with gasoline) to expire at the  end of 2011. Congress allowed the tax credit to expire at the end of 2011.", "In our 2012 annual report, we presented options for adjusting the  Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) passenger security fee\u2014a  uniform fee on passengers of U.S. and foreign air carriers originating at  airports in the United States\u2014to offset billions of dollars in civil aviation  security costs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 modifies the passenger  security fee from its current per enplanement structure ($2.50 per  enplanement with a maximum one-way-trip fee of $5.00) to a structure  that increases the passenger security fee to a flat $5.60 per one-way-trip,  effective July 1, 2014. Specifically, this legislation identifies $12.6 billion  in fee collections that, over a 10-year period beginning in fiscal year 2014  and continuing through fiscal year 2023, will contribute to deficit  reduction. Fees collected beyond those identified for deficit reduction  are available, consistent with existing law, to offset TSA\u2019s aviation  security costs. This fee is expected to cover 43 percent of aviation  security costs beginning in fiscal year 2014, compared with the  approximately 30 percent offset under the previous fee structure.", "Table 2 outlines a number of addressed actions that resulted in or are  expected to result in cost savings or enhanced revenue.

For example, at one Air Force base in 2013,  eight separate control centers operated satellites for 10 satellite  programs. Furthermore, the Air Force alone funded about $2.1 billion in   While dedicated networks can  fiscal year 2011 on satellite operations.offer some benefits to programs, they also can be more costly to maintain  and have led to fragmented and potentially duplicative networks that  require more infrastructure and personnel to manage as compared with  shared networks. We suggested that DOD take actions to improve its  ability to identify and then assess the appropriateness of a shared versus  dedicated satellite control system, which DOD has begun to address.", "Electronic Warfare: We reported in 2011 that all four military services  in DOD had been separately developing and acquiring new airborne  electronic attack systems and that spending on new and updated  systems was projected to total more than $17.6 billion during fiscal  years 2007\u20132016. While the department has taken steps to better  inform its investments in airborne electronic attack capabilities, it has  yet to assess its plans for developing and acquiring two new  expendable jamming decoys to determine if these initiatives should be  merged. For example, in fiscal year 2015 one DOD decoy system is already in production, while DOD defines performance requirements  for another decoy system. Without an assessment for potential  duplication, DOD may preclude the timely identification and  prevention of unnecessary overlap between its systems.", "Unmanned Aircraft Systems: We reported in 2012 that DOD\u2019s cost  estimates for acquisition programs for unmanned aircraft systems  (UAS) and related systems exceeded $37.5 billion for fiscal years  2012\u20132016. We found that military service-driven requirements,  rather than an effective department-wide strategy, led to overlap in  DOD\u2019s UAS capabilities, resulting in programs and systems being  pursued that have similar flight characteristics and mission  requirements. To reduce the likelihood of overlap and potential  duplication in DOD\u2019s UAS portfolio, we suggested several actions to  DOD that have not been fully implemented. The overlap in current  UAS programs, as well as continued potential for overlap in future  programs, shows that DOD must do more to implement these actions.  Our analysis suggests that the potential for savings would be  significant, and with DOD\u2019s continued commitment to UAS for meeting  strategic requirements, action is all the more imperative.", "More broadly, we identified multiple weaknesses in the way DOD  acquires weapon systems and the actions that are needed to address  these issues, which we recently highlighted in our high-risk series  update. For example, further progress must be made in tackling the  incentives that drive the acquisition process and its behaviors, applying  best practices, attracting and empowering acquisition personnel,  reinforcing desirable principles at the beginning of programs, and  improving the budget process to allow better alignment of programs and  their risks and needs. Addressing these issues could help DOD improve  the returns on its $1.5 trillion investment in major weapon systems and  find ways to deliver capabilities for less than it has in the past.", "The federal government plans to spend $79 billion on information  technology (IT) in fiscal year 2015. The magnitude of these expenditures  highlights the importance of avoiding duplicative investments to better  ensure the most efficient use of resources. Opportunities remain to  reduce duplication and the cost of government operations in critical IT  areas, many of which require agencies to work together to improve  systems, including the following examples:  Information Technology Investment Portfolio Management: To  better manage existing IT systems, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) launched the PortfolioStat initiative. PortfolioStat  requires agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide review of their  IT portfolios to reduce commodity IT spending and demonstrate how  their IT investments align with their missions and business functions,  among other things. In 2014, we reported that while the 26 federal  agencies required to participate in PortfolioStat had made progress in  implementing OMB\u2019s initiative, weaknesses existed in agencies\u2019  implementation of the initiative, such as limitations in the Chief  Information Officers\u2019 authority. As noted in our recent high-risk update,  we made more than 60 recommendations to improve OMB and  agencies\u2019 implementation of PortfolioStat and provide greater  assurance that agencies will realize the nearly $6 billion in savings  they estimated they would achieve through fiscal year 2015.", "Federal Data Centers: In 2014, we found that consolidating federal  data centers would provide an opportunity to improve government  efficiency and achieve cost savings and avoidances of about $5.3  billion by fiscal year 2017. Although OMB has taken steps to identify  data center consolidation opportunities across agencies, weaknesses  exist in the execution and oversight of the consolidation efforts. For  example, we previously reported that all 24 departments and agencies  in the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative had not yet  completed a data center inventory or the consolidation plans to  implement their consolidation initiative. It will continue to be important  for agencies to complete their inventories and implement their plans  for consolidation to better ensure continued progress toward OMB\u2019s  planned consolidation, optimization, and cost-savings goals.", "DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Electronic Health  Records System: DOD and VA abandoned their plans to develop a  single electronic system for health records that both departments  would share. Although the departments\u2019 2008 study showed that over  97 percent of inpatient functional requirements were common to both  DOD and VA, they decided to pursue separate electronic health  record system modernization efforts. In February 2014, we reported  that the departments had based this decision on the assertion that  pursuing separate systems would be less expensive and faster than  the single, shared-system approach. However, they had not  supported this assertion with cost and schedule estimates that  compared the separate efforts with estimates for the single-system  approach. Through continued duplication of these efforts, the  departments may be incurring unnecessary system development and  operation costs and missing opportunities to support higher-quality  health care for servicemembers and veterans. The departments plan  to make the separate systems interoperable as required by law.", "Given the federal government\u2019s continued experience with failed and  troubled IT projects, coupled with the fact that OMB initiatives to help  address such problems have not been fully implemented, we added  improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to our 2015  high-risk list. The federal information technology acquisition reforms  enacted in December 2014 reinforce a number of the actions that we  have recommended to address IT management issues. For example, the  law containing these reforms codifies federal data center consolidation,  emphasizing annual reporting on cost savings and detailed metric  reporting, and OMB\u2019s PortfolioStat process, focusing on reducing  duplication, consolidation, and cost savings. If effectively implemented,  this legislation should improve the transparency and management of IT  acquisitions and operations across the government. Twenty-seven federal  agencies plan to spend about $58 billion\u2014almost three-quarters of the  overall $79 billion budgeted for federal IT in fiscal year 2015\u2014on the  operations and maintenance of legacy (i.e., steady-state) investments.  The significance of these numbers highlights the importance of ensuring  that OMB\u2019s PortfolioStat and Data Center Consolidation initiatives meet  their cost-savings goals.", "We identified several opportunities to help address the proliferation of  certain education and training programs and improve the delivery of  benefits, which the executive branch agencies and Congress have been  working to address. However, additional opportunities remain to more  effectively invest in education and training programs, including the  following examples:", "Teacher Quality: Federal efforts to improve teacher quality led to the  creation and expansion of a variety of programs across the federal  government; however, there is no government-wide strategy to  minimize fragmentation, overlap, or duplication among these  programs. Specifically, in our 2011 annual report we identified 82  distinct programs designed to help improve teacher quality, either as a  primary purpose or as an allowable activity. Many of these programs  (administered across 10 federal agencies) shared similar goals. We  suggested that Congress could enact legislation to eliminate teacher  quality programs that are too small to evaluate cost-effectively or to  combine programs serving smaller target groups into a larger  program. In February 2015, the House Committee on Education and  Workforce reported the Student Success Act, H.R. 5. According to  House Report 114-24, H.R. 5 would consolidate most teacher quality  programs into a new flexible grant program. In addition, we suggested  that Congress could include legislative provisions to help the  Department of Education reduce fragmentation, such as by giving  broader discretion to the agency to move resources from certain  programs. In February 2015, the Senate Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions reported the Strengthening Education  through Research Act, S. 227, which would authorize the Department  of Education to reserve and consolidate funds from Elementary and  Secondary Education Act programs to carry out high-quality  evaluations and increase the usefulness of those evaluations. These  bills, if enacted, could help eliminate some of the barriers to  educational program alignment and help invest scarce resources  more effectively.", "Employment for Persons with Disabilities: In June 2012, we  reported on 45 programs administered by nine federal agencies that  supported employment for people with disabilities and found these  programs were fragmented and often provided similar services to  similar populations. OMB has worked with executive agencies to  propose consolidating or eliminating some of these programs. In  particular, three programs were eliminated in the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act: the Veterans\u2019 Workforce Investment  Program, administered by the Department of Labor, and the Migrant  and Seasonal Farmworker Program and Projects with Industry,  administered by the Department of Education. However, OMB has not  yet systematically looked across all agencies and programs\u2014beyond  those already identified in the Departments of Education and Labor\u2014 for opportunities to streamline and improve service delivery, which  could help achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness.", "Table 3 outlines these and other examples of opportunities for  consolidating or streamlining programs to better provide services.", "Opportunities also exist to achieve cost savings or enhance revenue  collection. As with the opportunities to address fragmentation, overlap  and duplication, fully achieving these opportunities will require sustained  leadership by executive branch agencies and Congress. Examples of  these actions include rescinding unobligated funds, improving fiscal  oversight over Medicare and Medicaid, reducing contract spending  through strategic sourcing, and increasing tax revenue collections.", "We reported in March 2013 that the Department of Energy (DOE) was not  actively considering any applications under the Advanced Technology  Vehicle Manufacturing loan program that was established to provide  loans for projects to produce more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles and   In our 2014 annual report, we suggested that unless  their components.DOE could demonstrate a demand for new loans and viable applications,  Congress might wish to consider rescinding all or part of the remaining  $4.2 billion in credit subsidy appropriations made available under this  program. Since our April 2014 annual report, DOE has not yet  demonstrated a demand for these loans that would substantially use the  remaining credit subsidy appropriations. The department received four  complete applications seeking a total of $945 million in loans, which  represents 5.7 percent of the program\u2019s remaining $16.6 billion in loan  authority. DOE officials stated that the program anticipated issuing  conditional commitments for loans in fiscal year 2015. In January 2015,  the Savings, Accountability, Value, and Efficiency Act of 2015 was  introduced in the House of Representatives, and includes a provision to  rescind unobligated balances of funding for the program, including the  remaining credit subsidy appropriations.", "Improving Fiscal Oversight of Medicare and Medicaid  Over the years, we identified a number of actions that have the potential  for sizable cost savings through improved fiscal oversight in the Medicare  and Medicaid programs. For example, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) that is responsible for overseeing both programs,  could save billions of dollars by improving the accuracy of its payments to  Medicare Advantage programs, such as through methodology  adjustments to account for diagnostic coding differences between  Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare. In addition, we found that  federal spending on Medicaid demonstrations could be reduced by  billions of dollars if HHS were required to improve the process for  reviewing, approving, and making transparent the basis for spending  limits approved for Medicaid demonstrations.between 2002 and 2013 has shown that HHS approved several  demonstrations without ensuring that they would be budget neutral to the  federal government.", "In particular, our work  To address this issue, we suggested that Congress could require the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to improve the Medicaid  demonstration review process, through steps such as improving the  review criteria, better ensuring that valid methods are used to  demonstrate budget neutrality, and documenting and making clear the  basis for the approved limits. In September 2014, the Chairman, House  Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Ranking Member, Senate  Committee on Finance, sent a letter to CMS asking for additional  information on steps the agency was taking to improve the budget  neutrality of demonstrations. Enhancing the process HHS uses to  demonstrate budget neutrality of its demonstrations could save billions in  federal expenditures.", "Reducing Contract Spending through Strategic Sourcing  In 2013, we reported that federal agencies could achieve significant cost  savings annually by expanding and improving their use of strategic  sourcing\u2014a contracting process that moves away from numerous  individual procurement actions to a broader aggregated approach. In  particular, we reported that a reduction of 1 percent in spending from  large procurement agencies, such as DOD, would equate to over $4  billion in savings. However, a lack of clear guidance on metrics for  measuring success has hindered the management of ongoing strategic  sourcing efforts across the federal government. Since our 2013 report,  OMB has made progress by issuing guidance on calculating savings for  government-wide strategic sourcing contracts and in December 2014  issued a memorandum on category management, which in part identifies  federal spending categories suitable for strategic sourcing. These  categories cover some of the government\u2019s largest spending categories,  including IT and professional services. As part of this effort, OMB directed  the General Services Administration to develop additional guidance and  performance metrics. However, until OMB sets government-wide goals  and establishes metrics, the government may miss opportunities for cost  savings though strategic sourcing.", "In addition, strategic sourcing could play a role in helping DOD acquire  services more efficiently. In our recent high-risk work, we noted that DOD  made some progress in acquiring services through strategic sourcing, but  had more to do. For example, as of March 2014, DOD had identified  some of high-spend categories as candidates for strategic sourcing, such  as IT. Further, DOD appointed individuals within specified portfolios of  major areas of DOD services spending to help coordinate strategic  sourcing efforts. But according to DOD officials, DOD still is developing  the roles, responsibilities and authorities for some of these offices.  Additionally, the department has not yet issued guidance establishing  goals and metrics to track progress.", "IRS estimated that the gross tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed  and taxes paid on time\u2014was $450 billion for tax year 2006 (the most  recent year for which data were available). IRS estimated that it  eventually would recover about $65 billion of this amount through late  payments and enforcement actions, leaving a net tax gap of $385 billion.  Because of its magnitude, even a 1 percent improvement in net tax gap  would generate almost $4 billion in revenue collections annually.", "Over the last 4 years, our work identified multiple opportunities for the  government to increase revenue collections. For example, in 2014, we  identified three actions that Congress could authorize and that could  increase tax revenue collections from delinquent taxpayers by hundreds  of millions of dollars over a 5-year period: limiting issuance of passports  to applicants, levying payments to Medicaid providers, and identifying  security clearance applicants.
