These differences are based on relative resources used in  the delivery of medical services. Physicians conducting procedures in their  offices are responsible for providing clinical staff, supplies, and  equipment. However, physicians who conduct procedures in hospitals or  ASCs have fewer expenses, since these facilities provide many of the  necessary services. As a result, Medicare payments for procedures in  physicians\u2019 offices are higher to account for the increased practice  expenses. These differences in Medicare reimbursements based on the  setting are known as \u201csite-of-service payment differentials.\u201d The payment  differentials have been phased in since 1999, and were fully implemented  in 2002. During this time, the site-of-service payment differentials have  increased for most endoscopic procedures.", "Section 411 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement  and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) directed us to examine the practice of  providing physician services that are ordinarily performed in health care  facilities\u2014such as gastroenterological and urological endoscopic  procedures\u2014in physicians\u2019 offices. We were directed to (1) review safety  evidence regarding medical settings, (2) assess whether the practice  expense site-of-service payment differential has served as an incentive for  physicians to perform such procedures in their offices rather than in other  medical settings, and (3) assess whether access to care by Medicare  beneficiaries would be affected if these procedures were no longer  reimbursed by Medicare when conducted in physicians\u2019 offices.", "For our study, we selected 12 gastroenterological and 8 urological  procedures that are ordinarily performed in health care facilities for  Medicare beneficiaries. In 2001, there were about 4.8 million of these  gastroenterological procedures performed, of which about 156,000   (3.3 percent) were conducted in physicians\u2019 offices. During this same year,  there were about 306,000 of these urological procedures performed, of  which about 12,000 (3.8 percent) were conducted in physicians\u2019 offices. To  determine the relative safety of these procedures conducted in different  medical settings in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, we reviewed  the scientific literature maintained by the National Library of Medicine and  interviewed physicians; medical directors at Medicare carriers, which are  the CMS contractors that process and review Medicare claims; and a  representative of a trade association that represents the medical  malpractice insurance industry. We also attempted to obtain Medicare  claims data to determine whether patients who had endoscopic  procedures later encountered medical complications. However, such data  are not readily available. To assess whether the practice expense site-of- service differential has served as an incentive for physicians to conduct  office-based procedures, we analyzed CMS data on the percentage of  endoscopic procedures performed in physicians\u2019 offices, hospitals, and  ASCs from 1996 through 2001. To determine whether access to care by  Medicare beneficiaries would be affected if these procedures were no  longer reimbursed by Medicare when conducted in physicians\u2019 offices, we  analyzed CMS data on a geographic basis, leading to a focus on the New  York City area, which has a high utilization rate of physician office-based  endoscopic procedures. For this metropolitan area, we analyzed CMS  medical setting data and interviewed Medicare carrier directors and New  York state officials. We conducted our work from February 2001 through  October 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In Connecticut, state regulations require any office or facility operated by  a licensed health care practitioner or practitioner group to be accredited  by a nationally recognized body if sedation or anesthesia is used.  In Florida, the state is required to inspect a physician\u2019s office where  certain levels of surgery (including endoscopy) are performed, unless a  nationally recognized accrediting agency or another accrediting  organization approved by the Board of Medicine accredits the office.  In Illinois, state regulations allow the delivery of anesthesia services by a  certified registered nurse anesthetist in the office only if the physician has  training and experience in these services.  In Mississippi, physicians conducting office procedures must register with  the state, maintain logs of surgical procedures conducted, follow federal  standards for sterilization of surgical instruments, and report any surgical  complications to a state board.  In New Jersey, state regulations have been developed to establish training  programs for physicians who utilize anesthesia in their office practices.  In Rhode Island, state regulations require licensure for offices in which  surgery, other than minor procedures, is performed. Accreditation by a  nationally recognized agency or organization is also required.", "In South Carolina, guidelines address the safe delivery of anesthesia, the  presence of emergency equipment, procedures to transfer emergency  cases to hospitals, and physician training.  In Texas, regulations govern physicians in outpatient settings providing  general or regional anesthesia.", "In addition, organizations such as the American Society for  Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal  Endoscopic Surgeons publish safety guidelines that are similar to the  Medicare guidelines for ASCs. These guidelines are designed to ensure  that endoscopies are conducted safely regardless of whether they are  conducted in health care facilities or physicians\u2019 offices.

The physician fee schedule is applicable to procedures  conducted in a variety of health care settings, including hospitals, ASCs,  and physicians\u2019 offices. Under this fee schedule, physician payments are  based on relative amounts of resources needed to provide procedures  regardless of the health care setting. The physician fee schedule includes  three components. The physician work component (implemented in 1992)  provides payment for the physician\u2019s time, effort, skill, and judgment  necessary to provide a service. The malpractice insurance component  reimburses physicians for the expense of their professional liability  insurance. The practice expense component compensates physicians for  direct expenses, such as clinical staff salaries, medical supplies, and  medical equipment and indirect expenses, such as administrative staff  salaries and other office expenses incurred in providing services.", "Unlike the other two components, physician practice expenses can differ  depending on where the procedure is performed. In the office setting, the  physician is responsible for providing clinical staff, supplies, and  equipment needed to perform a service. In the facility setting, such as a  hospital or ASC, these are the responsibility of the facility. Medicare\u2019s  practice expense payments to physicians can differ depending upon the  medical setting to reflect these differences. For medical facilities, practice  expense payments to physicians are generally lower, because Medicare  pays for nursing support, equipment, and supplies needed with a separate  facility fee. However, when these procedures are performed in an office,  Medicare pays physicians for these expenses in the practice expense  portion of the physician fee schedule. The differences in practice expense  payments for the same procedure are referred to as the site-of-service  differential. In 1999, HCFA began a now completed 3-year phase-in of the  site-of-service payment differential, as a part of the resource-based  practice expense system. In previous work, we found that HCFA used  acceptable methodology and relied on the best data available to develop  the practice expense component of its Medicare payment system of which  this payment differential is a result. Medicare\u2019s higher payment for office- based procedures reflects the higher expenses to the physicians of  providing those procedures, but this payment may not cover all of their  expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Level of Safety of Endoscopy Does Not Appear to Differ by Medical Setting", "paragraphs": ["We found no evidence to suggest that the level of safety of  gastroenterological or urological endoscopy conducted on Medicare  beneficiaries differs by medical setting.

The average  Medicare practice expense payments for the 12 gastroenterological  endoscopic procedures are presented in figure 1. The figure shows that  the payment differential has increased both because the average practice  expense payments for procedures performed in health care facilities have  decreased substantially (from $133 in 1998 to $59 in 2002) and because the  payment for office-based procedures has nearly doubled (from $143 in  1998 to $277 in 2002).

New York requires an  approved certificate of need (CON) in order to approve a new ASC. To  obtain a CON, the need for the services of a proposed ASC must be  demonstrated for specific geographic areas. According to a New York  State Department of Health official, the rules for CON approval were  relaxed significantly in March 1998, and nearly all applications are  currently being approved. Since March 1998, there has been an increase of  almost 200 percent in the number of ASCs in New York, including major  increases in the New York City area. CON approvals can be obtained in the  New York City area because most area hospitals are operating at capacity.  In the future, if ASCs are equipped to offer the gastroenterological  procedures included in our study, it is possible that they could  accommodate displaced patients, if they are located in areas accessible to  these patients.
