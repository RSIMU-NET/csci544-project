GAO examined the extent to which programs that support employment for people with disabilities (1) provide similar services to similar populations and (2) measure effectiveness. GAO identified programs by searching the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance and consulting agency officials. GAO surveyed and interviewed agency officials to determine program objectives and activities. Nine agencies reviewed the draft report and five provided comments. Labor was concerned that GAO characterized its programs as fragmented and potentially duplicative. While multiple programs may be appropriate, GAO maintains that additional review and coordination may reduce inefficiencies and improve effectiveness among overlapping programs.", "GAO is not recommending executive action at this time. In a recent report, GAO suggested the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) consider establishing governmentwide goals for employment of people with disabilities, and working with agencies that administer overlapping programs to determine whether consolidation might result in more effective and efficient delivery of services. GAO continues to believe these actions are needed and will follow up with OMB to determine their status."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 45 programs that supported employment for people with disabilities in fiscal year 2010, reflecting a fragmented system of services. The programs were administered by nine federal agencies and overseen by even more congressional committees. All programs overlapped with at least one other program in that they provided one or more similar employment service to a similar population\u0097people with disabilities. The greatest overlap occurred in programs serving veterans and servicemembers (19 programs) and youth and young adults (5 programs). In addition, GAO identified seven programs that did not limit eligibility to any particular population and were potentially available to veterans and servicemembers or youth. Some overlapping programs, such as those with specific eligibility requirements, have less potential for duplication\u0097providing the same services to the same beneficiaries\u0097than others. However, even when the potential for duplication of services is low, there may be inefficiencies associated with operating multiple programs that provide similar services to similar populations. Coordination across programs may help address fragmentation and potential duplication, but officials that GAO surveyed reported only limited coordination. However, among six selected programs that only serve people with disabilities\u0097including the Department of Education\u0092s Vocational Rehabilitation program and the Social Security Administration\u0092s Ticket to Work program\u0097officials cited more consistent coordination.", "Most (32) of the 45 programs surveyed tracked at least one employment-related outcome measure for people with disabilities, but overall little is known about the effectiveness of these programs. The most commonly tracked outcomes for people with disabilities were \u0093entered employment\u0094 (28 programs) and \u0093employment retention\u0094 (18 programs). However, it may be difficult to compare outcomes across programs, in part, because of variation in the type and severity of participants\u0092 disabilities. In addition, only 10 of the 45 programs reported that an evaluation had been conducted in the last 5 years. Just one of the 45 programs (Job Corps) reported conducting an impact study\u0097a study that would most clearly show whether the program (and not other factors) was responsible for improved employment outcomes for people with disabilities. However, additional studies are underway for at least two other programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly one in five people in the United States are reported to have a  disability. Although some people are born with disabilities, everyone is at  risk of experiencing a short-term or long-term disability, whether through  accidents, employment-related injuries and illnesses, disease, or aging. In  addition, individuals may have mental disorders or developmental  disabilities, which are severe chronic conditions resulting from mental  and/or physical impairments that can begin at any time during  development and last throughout a person\u2019s lifetime. A body of evidence  indicates that many people with disabilities can and want to work.  However, research has shown that people with disabilities may face  multiple barriers to employment, including poor health or functioning;  inadequate education, skills, or training; lack of transportation; lack of  accessible workplaces or accommodations; and discrimination. Federal  programs reported obligating more than $4 billion in fiscal year 2010 on  employment-related supports for people with disabilities, compared to a  significantly higher amount on income and medical supports for people  with disabilities. Even with these expenditures, historically, people with  disabilities have experienced higher unemployment and poverty rates  than those without disabilities.", "GAO, 2012 Annual Report: Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap, and  Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue, GAO-12-342SP (Washington,  D.C.: Feb. 28, 2012).

Consistent with our prior work on  duplication, we considered \u201cprograms\u201d to include a variety of types of  assistance\u2014such as grants, initiatives, and tax expenditures\u2014and will  use that term throughout the report for simplicity. We included programs  that served only people with disabilities, as well as programs that served  a broader population but provided special consideration to people with  disabilities or their employers. We also included programs for wounded,  ill, and injured servicemembers within our scope. After validating the list  of programs with agency officials, we fielded a web-based survey to each  program. The survey collected information on each program\u2019s objectives,  eligibility requirements, services provided, outcome measures, and  obligations, among other data. We incorporated data reliability checks  into the survey instrument, reviewed documentation, and conducted  follow-up interviews as necessary. We determined that the data used in  this report were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We did  not conduct an independent legal analysis to identify relevant programs or  verify the program information provided by survey respondents. To further  explore coordination efforts among overlapping programs, we selected six  programs\u2014administered by three different agencies\u2014that serve only  people with disabilities. We conducted interviews with officials  representing these six programs regarding their coordination efforts,  challenges to coordination, and factors that facilitate or create barriers to  coordination. To address our second objective, we collected data through  our survey on program outcome measures and any studies or evaluations  of program performance conducted since 2006. We reviewed the studies\u2019  methodologies to determine whether they met our definition of an impact  study.2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Both Congress and the Executive Branch have  recognized this, and in January 2011, the GPRA Modernization Act of  2010 (GPRAMA) was enacted, updating the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993. GPRAMA establishes a new framework aimed  at taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach for focusing on  results and improving government performance. Effective implementation  of the law could play an important role in clarifying desired outcomes,  addressing program performance spanning multiple organizations, and  facilitating future actions to reduce unnecessary duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation.", "GPRAMA requires OMB to coordinate with agencies to establish  outcome-oriented goals covering a limited number of crosscutting policy  areas as well as goals to improve management across the federal  government, and to develop a governmentwide performance plan for  making progress toward achieving those goals. The performance plan is  required to, among other things, identify the agencies and federal  activities\u2014including spending programs, tax expenditures, and  regulations\u2014that contribute to each goal, and establish performance  indicators to measure overall progress toward these goals as well as the  individual contribution of the underlying agencies and federal activities.  GPRAMA also requires similar information at the agency level. Each  agency is required to identify the various federal organizations and  activities\u2014both within and external to the agency\u2014that contribute to its  goals, and describe how the agency is working with other agencies to  achieve its goals as well as any relevant crosscutting goals. OMB officials  stated that their approach to responding to this requirement will address  fragmentation among federal programs. OMB and the agencies within our  scope identified several employment-related goals for fiscal year 2013,  including a goal to increase the percentage of eligible servicemembers  served by career readiness and preparedness programs, and a goal to  provide 2 million workers with skills training by 2015 and improve the  coordination and delivery of job training services. However, none of the  governmentwide goals established for fiscal year 2013 relate specifically  to employment for people with disabilities.", "Members of Congress have expressed concern that there is no  consolidated list of all federal government programs, and that individual  federal agencies are not able to provide a list of all of their programs and  initiatives. GPRAMA requires OMB to create a single website, no later  than October 1, 2012, that lists each federal agency\u2019s programs.  Agencies are required to identify how they define the term \u201cprogram,\u201d  consistent with guidance from OMB; a description of the purpose of each  program and how it contributes to the mission and goals of the agency;  and information on funding for the current fiscal year and two previous  fiscal years. In addition, in January 2012, OMB announced that it will work  with agencies to identify a comprehensive list of programs, pursuant to  the law. As a first step, OMB stated it will conduct a pilot for a selected  group of agencies and bureaus with programs related to trade, exports,  and competitiveness.

Agency officials reported that 27 of the 45 programs were created by  statute, rather than at the agencies\u2019 initiative. At least 13 congressional  committees are responsible for oversight of the 45 programs, which are  administered by nine federal agencies. In some cases, a range of  departments or offices within an agency are responsible for the programs.  For example, several offices in the Department of Labor (Labor)  administer 14 programs that provide employment-related services to  people with disabilities. Further, the Department of Defense has 10  programs within its purview in part because each service branch  administers its own program or programs to assist wounded, ill, and  injured servicemembers with employment. Adding to the fragmented  landscape, some of these federal programs are administered by  governmental and nongovernmental state or local entities, either in  collaboration or independently. In addition, agency officials noted that  states have various governmental structures to administer the programs.  For example, the Department of Education (Education) allocates formula  funds to states to carry out the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services  (VR) program. The state may create one vocational rehabilitation agency  (VR agency) or designate a separate VR agency to serve individuals who  are blind and a \u201cgeneral\u201d agency for all other disability categories. In  addition, each state may organize its VR agency or agencies within  different government departments relative to other states, such as state  departments of labor or education, or they may be free-standing agencies  or commissions.", "The specific definitions of disability and eligibility requirements that  programs use\u2014often established by law\u2014vary, which may contribute to  fragmentation. For example, officials from 34 programs collectively  reported using at least 10 different definitions of disability, and 10  programs reported having no specific definition for disability. In addition,  the 45 programs reported at least 26 specific limitations to eligibility, such  as limiting services to Native Americans or people who are blind. The  variation across programs allows policy makers and program officials to  target certain populations and, as discussed later, may reduce the  potential for duplicative services. However, variation in definitions of  disability and eligibility requirements may lead to confusion among people  with disabilities about their eligibility for a specific program, and may  create additional administrative burdens for state and local agencies and  private partners that deliver services.", "To address fragmentation among programs that support employment for  people with disabilities, at least two programs have been created to assist  clients in determining what services and benefits they are eligible for, and  which would best meet their needs. Specifically, according to agency  officials, the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Work Incentives  Planning and Assistance program helps Social Security Disability  Insurance beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income disability  recipients (for the purposes of this report, we will refer to these  populations collectively as \u201cSSA disability beneficiaries\u201d) understand  SSA\u2019s complex work incentives and how working would affect their  disability benefits or payments. In addition, agency officials noted that  Labor\u2019s Disability Program Navigators, jointly funded with SSA, provided  staff members in one-stop career centers to help people with disabilities  navigate multiple employment programs and services to meet their  employment needs.", "The number and range of programs makes it difficult to estimate the total  federal funding dedicated to providing people with disabilities with  employment supports or the number of individuals served. Programs we  surveyed reported obligating about $4.1 billion to provide employment  support to at least 1.5 million individuals with disabilities in fiscal year  2010, but these numbers may be largely underestimated for several  reasons. (See table 1 for summary information on reported numbers of  people served and obligations in fiscal year 2010; see app. III for detailed  fiscal year 2010 participant and obligation data reported by each  program.) Of the 23 programs serving only people with disabilities, 18  reported on the number of people with disabilities receiving employment  supports and 18 reported data on obligations in fiscal year 2010. One  program\u2014Education\u2019s VR program\u2014accounted for most of these funds  and participants (the program obligated $3 billion to serve more than 1  million people with disabilities). Even less is known about expenditures on  and the number of people receiving employment supports from the 22  programs serving people with and without disabilities. Specifically, only 13  of these programs reported how many people with disabilities received  employment supports and 10 reported obligations spent on people with  disabilities. Agency officials from some of these programs reported that  they do not systematically collect information on whether participants  have disabilities, while others indicated that program participants may not  always disclose that they have a disability. SSA officials noted that  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended\u2014which  prohibits federal agencies and programs that receive federal funding from  discriminating against individuals with disabilities\u2014limits programs\u2019 ability  to require individuals to disclose that they have a disability. Other  programs, such as Labor\u2019s Employer Assistance and Resource Network,  serve employers of people with disabilities and do not track the number of  people with disabilities who indirectly benefit from program services.", "All 45 programs overlapped with at least one other program in that they  provided one or more similar employment service to people with  disabilities. To identify services provided, we asked survey respondents  to indicate from a list of employment-related services and supports which  ones their programs provide. Respondents indicated a range of services  provided, with some services being provided more than others. For  example, survey responses revealed that 36 of the 45 programs provided  employment counseling, assessment, and case management, with 23  providing these services to more than half of their participants. On the  other hand, agency officials reported that 17 programs provided remedial  academic English language skills and adult literacy assistance, with 4 of  those providing it to more than half of their participants. Two programs  reported providing tax expenditures related to workers with disabilities.  For example, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit provides a tax credit to  employers who hire individuals from target groups, including disabled  veterans. In addition, two programs\u2014Education\u2019s Randolph-Sheppard  program and the U.S. AbilityOne Commission\u2019s AbilityOne Program\u2014 help create jobs for individuals with disabilities through the federal  property management and procurement systems. Randolph-Sheppard  licenses people who are blind to operate vending facilities on federal or  other designated state properties. Under the AbilityOne program, federal  government agencies are generally required to purchase certain goods  and services from nonprofit agencies that employ people who are blind or  have some other severe disability. Several programs also noted that they  provided additional services not included on our list, such as financial  supports, resume preparation, job coaching, transportation, and medical  and psychiatric services.", "Overlap was greatest in programs serving two distinct groups;  specifically, we identified 19 programs that provided employment services  to veterans and servicemembers (see fig. 3) and 5 programs that  provided employment services to students and young adults (see fig. 4).  In addition, 7 programs did not limit eligibility to any particular group and  therefore potentially overlapped with these and other programs in our  scope (see fig. 5). For example, 17 of the 19 programs that limit eligibility  to veterans and servicemembers reported providing job-readiness skills.  At the same time, any veteran or servicemember could receive these  services from 5 of the 7 programs that did not limit eligibility to any  particular population. The remaining 14 programs limited eligibility to  other specific groups or types of disabilities, such as SSA disability  beneficiaries, or people who are blind or visually impaired. For a complete  list of programs, their objectives, and eligibility requirements, see  appendix IV. For a list of programs, populations they serve, and the  services they reported providing, see appendix V.", "While many programs reported providing similar services to similar  populations, some programs have less potential for duplication\u2014 providing the same services to the same beneficiaries\u2014than others.  Some overlapping programs have specific eligibility requirements that  make duplication less likely. For example, the Department of Veterans  Affairs\u2019 (VA) Compensated Work Therapy and Vocational Rehabilitation  and Employment (VR&E) programs both reported providing vocational  rehabilitation and a number of other similar employment services to  veterans with disabilities. However, the work therapy program targets  veterans with mental illness or other severe disabilities who are patients  in VA medical centers, whereas the VR&E program serves veterans with  all types of disabilities. In addition, unlike the work therapy program, the  VR&E program requires that a veteran\u2019s disability be connected to his or  her military service. In another example, the Workforce Recruitment  Program, jointly administered by Labor and the Department of Defense, is  the only one of the five youth programs that reported limiting eligibility to  college students or recent graduates with disabilities.", "As shown in table 2, the programs have different age ranges for eligibility, but all allow  eligible youth between the ages of 16 and 21 to participate. program in two states administered in partnership with state-organized  apprenticeship agencies to place young adults with disabilities in  registered apprenticeships in the construction and health care fields.  Labor officials said that case managers may refer a participant from the  WIA Youth program to the YouthBuild program, for example, if they are  interested in learning construction skills. However, it is difficult to  determine the extent to which these different strategies reduce or prevent  potential duplication in services among these programs.", "Another factor affecting the potential for duplication is resource levels, in  that some overlapping programs lack the capacity to serve all who apply,  thereby reducing the potential for duplication in services. Six of the 45  programs reported having a waiting list for services (see table 3). Three of  these programs reported serving only people with disabilities. Individuals  who are on a waiting list for one program may be eligible to receive  services from another program. For example, Labor officials told us that  individuals waiting for VR services could be referred to one-stop career  centers for services.", "Even when the potential for duplication of services is low, there may be  inefficiencies associated with operating two or more separate programs  that provide similar services to similar populations. For example, in its  budget requests for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, Education proposed  consolidating two smaller programs in our scope\u2014the Migrant and  Seasonal Farmworker and Supported Employment State Grants  programs\u2014into its larger VR program. Education proposed this  consolidation in order to reduce duplication of effort and administrative  costs, streamline program administration at the federal and local levels,  and improve accountability.", "Among the 19 programs that serve servicemembers and veterans, we  identified two programs\u2014Labor\u2019s Disabled Veterans\u2019 Outreach and Local  Veterans\u2019 Employment Representatives programs\u2014that provide similar  services at similar locations, potentially by the same staff members. Both  programs reported that they provided job search and placement services  to veterans with disabilities, among other similar services. Labor officials  said that the veterans\u2019 employment representatives were intended to  reach out to employers and the disabled veterans\u2019 outreach specialists  were intended to work with job seekers. However, as we reported in May  2007, staff often performed the same roles in one-stop career centers  and, in some cases, the roles were carried out by the same staff  member. A recent law gave states the flexibility\u2014subject to the approval  of the Secretary of Labor\u2014to consolidate these two programs in order to  promote more efficient provision of services. Labor officials noted that the  agency is in the process of developing criteria and procedures for making  determinations on consolidations. The law also requires the Secretary of  Labor to conduct audits to ensure that the veterans\u2019 employment  representatives and the outreach specialists are performing their required  duties, and officials told us that they are in the process of defining the  requirements and protocols for these audits.", "42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 422(d) and 1382d(d); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.2101 and 416.2201. Under  thresholds set annually by SSA, individuals are considered engaged in substantial gainful  activity if they had earnings in 2012 above $1,010 per month for nonblind beneficiaries  and $1,690 per month for blind beneficiaries. the two programs provide a continuum of services\u2014VR agencies provide  more intensive, up-front services to help beneficiaries enter or return to  work, while employment networks under the Ticket to Work program can  provide longer-term supports to help beneficiaries stay at work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Surveyed Reported Limited Coordination across All Programs", "paragraphs": ["Coordination could help mitigate the potential for duplication among  fragmented programs, but officials we surveyed reported limited  coordination among the 45 programs in our scope. In our survey, we  asked respondents to indicate whether their program coordinated with  any of the other programs receiving our survey. In 13 percent of cases,  two programs mutually reported coordinating with each other. However, in  most cases, respondents either reported not coordinating or  inconsistently reported coordinating with other programs (see table 4).  For example, although VA\u2019s VR&E program reported coordinating with  Labor\u2019s Veterans Workforce Investment Program and Disabled Veterans  Outreach Program, only one of the two Labor programs\u2014the Disabled  Veterans Outreach Program\u2014reported coordinating with the VA program.  Officials explained that, in some cases, federal-level program staff  responding to our survey may not be aware of coordination taking place  at the state and local levels. Further, although the rate of mutual  coordination reported is low among all the programs in our scope,  programs that have different missions or serve different populations may  not be expected to coordinate with one another. For instance, Labor\u2019s  Senior Community Service Employment Program supports part-time work  opportunities for low-income senior citizens, and therefore may not need  to coordinate with Department of Defense transition programs\u2014such as  Operation Warfighter\u2014that help servicemembers returning to civilian life  gain employment experience.", "In order to better understand our survey results, we held more detailed  discussions about coordination efforts with six selected programs that  serve only people with disabilities:", "Assistive Technology State Grant program (Education)", "Disability Employment Initiative (Labor)", "State Vocational Rehabilitation Cost Reimbursement Program  (SSA)", "Ticket to Work program (SSA)", "VR program (Education)", "Work Incentives Planning and Assistance program (SSA)", "Officials cited more consistent coordination among these programs. In  response to our survey, all six programs had mutually reported  coordinating with the Ticket to Work and the VR programs. This is  perhaps not surprising, given that the VR program reported serving the  largest number of people with disabilities and the Ticket to Work program  is closely related to the VR program.", "Although not all of the six programs mutually reported coordination,  federal program officials noted that a significant amount of coordination  occurs at the state and local levels where services are delivered. Labor  officials reported that its Disability Employment Initiative grantees at the  state and local level have established Integrated Resource Teams, which  include representatives from a number of programs\u2014including the VR  program, the Assistive Technology State Grant program, and other state  and local programs\u2014to leverage all available resources for individual  clients. To further encourage local coordination, Labor recently issued  guidance to state and local workforce agencies outlining ways in which  programs housed in one-stop career centers can coordinate with  providers under SSA\u2019s Ticket to Work program. Labor issued similar  guidance listing available resources to help beneficiaries obtain assistive  technology, including Education\u2019s Assistive Technology State Grant  program and SSA\u2019s Ticket to Work program.", "Agency officials also described efforts to increase coordination more  broadly among programs that support employment for people with  disabilities. For example, in 2008, Education and SSA established the  Partnership Plus initiative, which is intended to provide a seamless  approach to vocational services for people with disabilities. Individuals  who need intensive employment services, such as education or training,  can receive them first through the VR program, and then transition to an  employment network under Ticket to Work for job retention services, or  other ongoing services and supports to maintain employment and  increase earnings. In addition, officials described a new initiative that  coordinates programs and leverages resources from Education, the  Department of Health and Human Services, Labor, and SSA, and aims to  help youth receiving Supplemental Security Income to transition  successfully to higher education or employment by working with the entire  family to provide supports necessary to reduce barriers and improve  outcomes.", "Officials from selected programs reported facing a number of challenges  in coordinating with each other. First, officials noted that coordination can  be challenging because programs are governed by separate statutes and  regulations containing different definitions and program requirements.  One official noted that aligning definitions of disability in statute would be  helpful to ensure programs established by WIA and the Rehabilitation Act  are complementary. In interviews with our six selected programs, officials  from each reported that individual programs lack the resources, both in  terms of funding and staff time, to pursue coordination with one another.  Finally, one official indicated that interagency working groups may have  limited effectiveness. He said that, in general, coordination could be more  effective if programs had a set of outcomes they were expected to  collectively achieve and were given the authority to work together to do  so\u2014including the authority to waive requirements that present barriers\u2014 and given funding to support such collaboration. This is consistent with  concerns raised in our 2010 forum on employment for people with  disabilities, where participants noted that past interagency coordination  efforts have not been very successful at achieving significant change  because they have lacked sufficient authority, accountability, or  resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Programs Tracked Varying Outcome Measures, and Little Is Known About Program Effectiveness", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Programs Reported Tracking Varying Employment Outcomes for People with Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["Coordination efforts can be enhanced when agencies work toward a  common goal, yet outcome measures varied across programs and not all  programs reported outcomes specifically for people with disabilities.

For instance, both VA\u2019s VR&E program and Education\u2019s  Helen Keller National Center track the number of participants who are  able to live independently or in less-restrictive residential programs. The  remaining 13 programs did not report tracking any employment-related  outcomes for people with disabilities, in part because they have a broader  mission.

Many researchers consider impact  studies to be the best method for determining the extent to which a  program is responsible for participant outcomes, but these studies can be  challenging to conduct. However, there are sometimes opportunities for  agencies to assess impacts without conducting full-scale impact studies.  As an example, Education officials noted that it may be more feasible to  conduct a rigorous study to evaluate the impact of providing enhanced  services over regular services, rather than the impact of providing  services over providing no services at all. The Job Corps impact study  compared the outcomes of participants in the program to outcomes of a  comparable group of individuals who did not participate in the program.  The study concluded that, although there were no long-term program  impacts on earnings for many Job Corps participants, the program  generated earnings gains for participants between the ages of 20 and 24,  who may be more highly motivated and disciplined.", "Reports for two additional programs that were excluded from our scope\u2014 SSA\u2019s Youth Transition Demonstration and the Mental Health Treatment  Study programs\u2014met the criteria for impact studies.

Efforts such as Education\u2019s proposed consolidation of several smaller  programs into its VR program also indicate an awareness of the need to  simplify the system and increase effectiveness and ease of use. In our  February 2012 report on duplication and overlap in government  programs, we suggested that OMB continue to work with executive  agencies that administer overlapping programs to identify any  opportunities for cost savings or streamlining, such as program  consolidation. We continue to believe that such a review could result in  more effective and efficient delivery of services to help people with  disabilities obtain and retain employment.", "We identified limited coordination among programs that provide  employment support for people with disabilities, which may exacerbate  the potential for duplication among fragmented programs. In addition,  many programs have not evaluated their programs for effectiveness, and  little is known about effectiveness overall, such that policymakers have  limited information to help them make informed decisions on allocating  scarce resources. In our February 2012 report, we noted that OMB  should consider establishing governmentwide goals related to  employment of people with disabilities, with agencies establishing related  outcome measures. We continue to believe that setting common goals  across programs that support employment for people with disabilities  could help spur greater coordination and more efficient and economical  service delivery in overlapping program areas, and plan to follow up with  OMB on its progress with respect to both of the actions we suggested in  our February 2012 report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of our draft report to the nine federal agencies that  administer programs within the scope of this report for comment.

Education also stated  that the capacity of the VR program to provide and coordinate a wide  range of individualized services to achieve employment outcomes for  individuals with disabilities\u2014particularly individuals with significant  disabilities\u2014is not duplicated by any other program.", "Labor generally expressed concern that we found fragmentation among  the programs we examined, noting that our definition of fragmentation is  broad.
