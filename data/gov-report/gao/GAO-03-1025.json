Specifically, BLM has established most of the key practices associated with building an investment foundation. For example, the bureau has established a board for managing IT investments, implemented processes to ensure that IT projects support business needs and meet users' requirements, and established a process for selecting IT proposals. In addition, the bureau has efforts under way to address the key practices it has not yet established. BLM has also initiated efforts to manage its investments as a portfolio. For example, it has established a council to support portfolio management activities and begun defining portfolio selection criteria. BLM has also begun performing postimplementation reviews to learn lessons that will help define and implement an IT investment evaluation process. However BLM's progress to date in defining practices for managing its investments as a portfolio has been limited because, according to its officials, its investment board first focused its resources on establishing the processes associated with building the IT investment management foundation. Although BLM has made progress in developing its IT investment process, it has not yet developed a plan to guide its efforts in this area and, as a result, may not be able to successfully establish more mature ITIM processes. According to the chief information officer, this is because BLM wanted to develop an ITIM plan that is integrated with improvement plans for other IT management areas, and the results of the comprehensive assessment that were to be used as the basis for such a plan were obtained only in June 2003. BLM officials agree that this plan is necessary for guiding improvement efforts and stated their intention to develop one.

For  example, in 1998, the bureau established an IT Investment Board (the ITIB)  to manage national investments. With the development of the IT  Investment Management Process guide in 2001, BLM provided the board  and all involved parties (i.e., project managers and sponsors, portfolio  managers, investment management group) with specifics concerning  responsibilities and procedures.

This inventory (which can take many  forms) should, at a minimum, identify the organization\u2019s IT projects  (including new and existing systems) and a defined set of relevant  investment management information about them (e.g., purpose, owner, life- cycle stage, budget cost, physical location, and interfaces with other  systems). Information from the IT project and system inventory can, for  example, help identify systems across the organization that provide similar  functions and help avoid the commitment of additional funds for redundant  systems and processes. It can also help determine more precise  development and enhancement costs by informing decision makers and  other managers of interdependencies among systems and how potential  changes in one system can affect the performance of other systems.  According to ITIM, effectively managing an IT project and system inventory  requires, among other things, (1) identifying projects and systems,  collecting relevant information about them, and capturing this information  in a repository; (2) assigning responsibility for managing the inventory  process and ensuring that the inventory meets the needs of the investment  management process; (3) developing written policies and procedures for  maintaining the project and system inventory; (4) making information from  the inventory available to staff and managers throughout the organization  so they can use it, for example, to build business cases and support  activities to select and control projects; and (5) maintaining the inventory  and its information records to contribute to future investment selections  and assessments. (The full list of key practices is provided in table 4.)", "BLM has executed three out of seven of the key practices for IT project and  system identification. For example, the bureau is using its target  application architecture and Budget Planning System to collect  information on its IT projects and systems to make informed IT investment  management decisions; according to CIO officials, the architecture is used  for the information it contains on BLM\u2019s business processes and supporting  data, applications, and technology, while the Budget Planning System is  used for the financial information on the investments. Resources have been  assigned to support activities related to identifying IT projects and systems,  including the Bureau Enterprise Architecture Team and the Budget  Planning System system owners. According to BLM, all national projects  and systems are in both the target application architecture and Budget  Planning System (although BLM officials told us that they have planned a  meeting to determine whether additional requirements are needed for the  Budget Planning System to effectively serve as an inventory for investment  management purposes).", "Despite these strengths, policies and procedures for collecting project and  system information in the Budget Planning System for investment  management purposes have not yet been defined.

At the stage 2 level of maturity, investment  boards should review each project\u2019s progress toward predefined cost and  schedule expectations, using established criteria and performance  measures, and take corrective actions to address cost and milestone  variances. According to ITIM, effective project oversight requires, among  other things, (1) having written policies and procedures for project  management; (2) developing and maintaining an approved management  plan for each IT project; (3) making up-to-date cost and schedule data for  each project available to the oversight boards; (4) reviewing each project\u2019s  performance by regularly comparing actual cost and schedule data with  expectations; (5) ensuring that corrective actions for each under- performing project are documented, agreed to, implemented, and tracked  until the desired outcome is achieved; and (6) having written policies and  procedures for oversight of IT projects.

Project management policies and high-level procedures  are defined in the IT Investment Management Process guide, associated  memoranda, and in best practices guidance. In addition, project oversight  policies and procedures are defined in the guide and associated  memoranda, which, among other things, require the involvement and  approval of the board at key stages in a project\u2019s life cycle. For example,  according to the guide, the ITIB must review and approve investment  proposals before they can be developed into business cases. Further, once  a project has been approved, the ITIB reviews up-to-date cost, schedule,  and scope information quarterly and analyzes this information against  predetermined performance expectations. The board also determines  corrective actions for projects that have not met performance  expectations.", "We verified that cost, schedule, and scope information was submitted to  the ITIB quarterly and analyzed against expectations and, when significant  variances occurred, corrective actions were determined for the three  projects we reviewed.

In addition,  individuals responsible for managing projects at BLM can adequately  identify business needs; according to BLM, the bureau\u2019s practice is to select  staff from business units as project managers (instead of staff from the IT  unit). Finally, according to BLM officials, all national applications are in the  Budget Planning System and target enterprise architecture, which are  repositories of investment information that BLM is planning on using to  make informed investment management decisions. For the three projects  we reviewed, business needs and associated users were identified in  business case or project planning documents, and users were involved in  project management throughout the life cycle of the project through, for  example, chartered user-group meetings, structured walk-throughs,  prerelease workshops, and conference calls.

Portfolio categories have been defined that correspond to BLM\u2019s  organizational units (e.g., Minerals, Realty, and Resource Protection;  Information Resource Management). Moreover, the board revised its  charter in April 2003 to include portfolio management responsibilities (i.e.,  stage 3) and established an IT Portfolio Management Council to support it  in carrying out these responsibilities. At a higher level stage, BLM has  begun to address postimplementation reviews, a critical process associated  with the most capable organizations.

According to  the CIO, this is because BLM intends to develop a plan integrating  improvements for IT investment management and other IT management  areas, and the results of the comprehensive assessment to be used as a  basis for this integrated plan were not received until June 2003. BLM  officials recognize the importance of having a plan to guide their  improvement efforts, however, and stated their commitment to developing  one, although they do not have a specific time frame for doing so.

We  applied the framework as it is described in the exposure draft, except that  we used a revised version of the IT Asset Inventory critical process, called  IT Project and System Identification, after discussions with departmental  officials at the beginning of this engagement. This revised critical process  has been used in our evaluations since June 2001. We did not formally  assess BLM\u2019s progress in establishing capabilities found in stages 3, 4, and 5  because BLM acknowledged that it had so far primarily focused on stage 2  and had not executed many key practices in higher maturity stages. In  addition, we limited our review to BLM\u2019s management of its national  investments because they represent the investments of greater cost and  impact to the organization.", "To determine whether BLM had implemented the critical processes  associated with stage 2, we reviewed the results of a self-assessment of  stage 2 practices using GAO\u2019s ITIM framework and validated and updated  the results of the self-assessment through document reviews and  interviews with officials. We reviewed written policies, procedures, and  guidance and other documentation providing evidence of executed  practices, including BLM\u2019s IT Investment Management Process guide,  various board/council charters, and instruction memorandums. We also  reviewed national Information Technology Investment Board (ITIB)  meeting materials, including quarterly status reports, meeting minutes,  records of decision, and matrices tracking action items through  completion. We interviewed several BLM officials, including system  coordination office officials, portfolio managers, and ITIB members. We  also attended a 2-day national ITIB meeting in March 2003.", "As part of our analysis, we selected three IT projects as case studies to  verify application of the critical processes and practices. We selected  projects that (1) supported different BLM functional areas (directorates),  (2) were in different life-cycle phases, and (3) required various levels of  funding. The three projects are the following:  PayCheck\u2014The objective of PayCheck, currently in the evaluate phase,  is to allow employees to input their time and attendance data using an  automated system. Previously, the employee developed a hard-copy  time sheet, and then a timekeeper keyed the same information into the  payroll system. By allowing the employees to enter their own data,  PayCheck changed the business process and eliminated the duplication  of manual effort. This project, with an estimated life-cycle cost of  $1,681,000, is the responsibility of the National Human Resources  Management Center, which supports BLM\u2019s human resources function.", "National Integrated Land System\u2014The objective of this system, which is  currently in a mixed life cycle, is to provide a process to collect,  maintain, and store survey- and parcel-based land information that  meets the common, shared business needs of land title and land  resource management. This system will provide agencies, BLM\u2019s  partners, and the public with business solutions for the management of  cadastral records and land parcel information in a Geographic  Information System environment, accessible via the Internet. This  project, which has an estimated life-cycle cost of $31.3 million, is under  the Minerals, Realty, and Resource Protection directorate. This  directorate is responsible for managing commercial energy and mineral  production from the public lands.", "Antivirus\u2014The objective of Antivirus, currently in the control phase, is  to renew or replace BLM\u2019s existing antivirus contract that is expiring to  provide antivirus coverage to all simple mail transfer protocol gateways,  mail servers, other servers, desktops, and laptops. In addition, BLM is  seeking to provide improved enterprise management and reporting  capabilities, as well as a more automated methodology for deploying  virus update files across the bureau. This project is being carried out by  the Information Resources Management directorate, which provides IT  services to BLM states, centers, and partners in support of the bureau\u2019s  mission. The estimated life cycle cost for Antivirus is $800,600.", "For these projects, we reviewed project management documentation, such  as business cases, project plans, and quarterly reports.
