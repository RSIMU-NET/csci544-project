VA projects demand for long-term care will continue to increase, driven in part by growing numbers of aging veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities. Expenditures for long-term care are projected to double by 2037, as shown below. According to VA officials, VA plans to expand veterans' access to noninstitutional programs, when appropriate, to prevent or delay nursing home care and to reduce costs.", "VA currently faces three key challenges meeting the growing demand for long-term care: workforce shortages, geographic alignment of care (particularly for veterans in rural areas), and difficulty meeting veterans' needs for specialty care. VA's Geriatrics and Extended Care office (GEC) recognizes these challenges and has developed some plans to address them. However, GEC has not established measurable goals for these efforts, such as specific staffing targets for programs with waitlists or specific targets for providing telehealth to veterans in rural areas.

However, while VA\u2019s  GEC\u2014the office that manages VA long-term care programs\u2014is aware of  these challenges, as of November 2019 GEC\u2019s strategic planning has not  identified measurable goals for addressing them.", "Addressing workforce shortages. According to VA, the agency  faces challenges hiring the staff needed to meet veterans\u2019 demand for  long-term care, a challenge that is likely to grow as demand for care is  projected to increase in coming years. We have previously reported  on workforce shortages in key positions\u2014such as nursing assistants  and home health aides\u2014that are critical for supporting long-term care  programs and affect health care systems beyond VA. Within VA, the  Healthcare Analysis and Information Group (HAIG) report found that  80 percent of VA community living centers had, at the time of the  report, current vacancies for nursing assistant or health technician  positions. These workforce challenges have led to waitlists for some  long-term care programs. For example, VA officials told us staffing  challenges were the key factor creating a waitlist of 1,780 veterans for  the Home-Based Primary Care program. (The HAIG report found 65  percent of VA facilities cited staffing as a barrier to expanding Home- Based Primary Care.) GEC officials recognize these workforce  challenges and told us they have developed some workforce  strategies such as offering geriatrics training to rural primary care  providers through GEC\u2019s Geriatric Scholars Program.", "Aligning care geographically. According to VA, the agency faces  challenges aligning its provided or purchased long-term care with  where veterans live. VA data show that 2.8 million VA-enrolled  veterans lived in rural areas as of 2018, and that veteran populations  have shifted to different geographic regions. Providing long-term care  in rural areas is a challenge experienced by other health care  systems; for example, a report from the Rural Policy Research  Institute identified challenges with providing long-term care in rural  areas, including \u201cmore limited access to services and support\u201d and the  \u201cabsence of an adequate workforce and infrastructure.\u201d VA officials  also told us that veterans moving from one region to another presents  demand and capacity challenges. For example, officials told us that  veterans have moved away from the Northeast and to the South, and  that VA now has too many long-term care beds in the Northeast and  too few in the South. VA officials acknowledged the challenge of  aligning care with where veterans live and pointed to telehealth,  where veterans can receive care remotely, and to Veteran Directed  Care program, which provides veterans with a budget to manage their  own care, as approaches that could provide care to veterans in rural  areas with limited access to VA provided or purchased care. GEC  officials have also identified potential strategies to address the issue;  for example, GEC\u2019s strategic planning includes a proposal to expand  telehealth geriatrics services to reach more veterans, although  officials told us this effort is currently unfunded. Further, VA officials  from the Office of Policy and Planning said an ongoing market  assessment project will provide information that will help VA align its  provided and purchased care with where veterans live to better meet  veteran needs.", "Meeting needs for specialty care. According to VA, the agency  faces challenges meeting some specialty care needs for veterans in  long-term care. Specifically, it can be difficult to find appropriate long- term care settings for veterans with dementia, behavioral issues, and  for veterans requiring a ventilator. Meeting specialty care needs is  also a challenge for other health care systems; for example, a 2017  study from the RAND Corporation found that the U.S. health system  does not have sufficient capacity to care for a growing number of  people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Challenges in providing this type of  care are not new for VA. For example, in 2013 we reported that VA  officials told us that while \u201cin certain geographic areas [community  living centers] provide certain services that are not available in the  community, such as dementia care, behavioral health services, and  care for ventilator-dependent residents,\u201d in other areas \u201cthese  specialized services might not be available in a [community living  center] and instead might be available at a community nursing  home.\u201d As previously mentioned, VA has developed some programs  to provide specialty care (e.g. VA\u2019s Spinal Cord Injury and Disability  Care program and the agency\u2019s efforts to educate home caregivers on  how to better serve veterans with dementia).", "While GEC recognizes and has taken some steps to address the  challenges it faces in meeting the demand for long-term care, our review  of GEC\u2019s most recently approved strategic planning document from  March 2019 shows that GEC has not established measurable goals for its  efforts to address these three key challenges.", "GEC has not established measurable goals for its efforts to address  workforce shortages, such as specific staffing targets necessary to  address the waitlist for the Home-Based Primary Care program, or  defining the number of rural providers it expects to train through the  Geriatrics Scholar program.", "GEC has not established measurable goals for its efforts to address  the geographic alignment of care, such as specific targets for  providing long-term care within the Home Telehealth and Veteran  Directed Care programs.", "GEC has not established measurable goals for its efforts to address  difficulties meeting veterans\u2019 needs for specialty care, such as specific  targets for the number of available ventilators or the number of  caregivers educated to help veterans with dementia.", "According to GAO\u2019s body of work on effectively managing performance  under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as  enhanced by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, federal agencies  should clarify and clearly define measurable outcomes for each strategic  objective and assess progress towards those goals. VA officials told us  that competing priorities, including implementation of the VA MISSION  Act of 2018, have affected GEC\u2019s ability to effectively address challenges  to meeting veterans\u2019 long-term care needs. Without measurable goals,  however, VA is limited in its ability to better plan for and understand  progress towards addressing the challenges it faces meeting veterans\u2019  long-term care needs. As VA works to address these challenges, it does  so along with other health care systems, and VA has opportunities for  leveraging outside experience through VA\u2019s Geriatrics and Gerontology  Advisory Group. For example, the Advisory Group recently acknowledged  workforce challenges and recommended that VA \u201cdevise strategies to  create incentives and identify and remove barriers\u201d for the recruiting and  retaining the health care workforce needed to care for VA\u2019s growing  geriatric veteran population.", "In addition to the key challenges that VA and many other health care  systems face, VA has identified, but has not planned to take steps to fully  address, challenges at the VAMC level that affect its ability to meet  veterans\u2019 long-term care needs. Specifically, VA has identified issues with  inconsistency in the management of the 14 long-term care programs at  the VAMC level that could lead to inefficient and inequitable decisions  about long-term care across VA. While VA has identified the steps it can  take to address these issues, it has not implemented these steps.", "First, VA identified that VAMCs do not have a consistent approach to  managing VA\u2019s 14 long-term care programs. GEC officials told us that  fragmentation of the long-term care programs within the VAMCs\u2014that  is, where programs could be run by one or more departments within  the VAMC, for example the Nursing department or the Social Work  department at VAMCs where there are not GEC staff\u2014hinders  standardization and the ability to get veterans the right care. Similarly,  the HAIG report found that VAMCs organize their long-term care  programs differently and recommended that to \u201cefficiently, reliably,  and equitably serve veterans\u201d VA align GEC programs \u201cat all VISNs  and eventually VAMCs nationwide.\u201d GEC strategic planning  documents outline a goal of alignment within the VISNs, and officials  said alignment has been established within the VISNs. However, VA  officials told us that, as of October 2019, they had not taken action to  pursue VAMC-level alignment with a GEC point of contact at each  VAMC that could provide consistency across long-term care programs  at the VAMC level.", "Second, GEC has developed a tool to improve the consistency with  which VAMCs determine the amount of services needed for veterans  based on their specific health issues. However, as of October 2019,  VA has not required the tool be used in all VAMCs. VA has identified  that VAMCs do not have a consistent approach to determining the  amount of noninstitutional long-term care services veterans need. VA  officials told us that, as of October 2019, VAMCs used different  methods to assess the amount of noninstitutional long-term care  services veterans need\u2014for example, how many hours of in-home  care veterans need. As a result, decisions about the amount of  services veterans receive may vary by VAMC. The HAIG report  recommended that VA use a standardized approach to ensure the  \u201cbalance of noninstitutional care programs, program reliability, and  equity of resource distribution.\u201d GEC officials said the tool they  developed is currently being used by some VAMCs, and they expect  VA will require the tool to be used by all VAMCs sometime in the next  year. However, VA has not set time frames for this requirement.", "One of VA\u2019s performance goals is to provide highly reliable and integrated  care and support and excellent customer service. Furthermore, federal  internal controls dictate that federal agencies should exercise oversight  responsibility, for example by overseeing the remediation of deficiencies  as appropriate and providing direction to management on appropriate  time frames for correcting these deficiencies. Although VA has identified  steps it can take to improve consistency in long-term care programs,  according to officials, it has not prioritized their implementation. Without a  reliably consistent approach to administering long-term care programs  across its VAMCs, VA may not consistently and equitably meet veteran  preferences and needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA currently faces difficult challenges meeting the demand for long-term  care. These challenges\u2014such as addressing workforce shortages,  aligning care geographically, and meeting specialty care needs\u2014are  likely to intensify as veterans\u2019 demand for long-term care grows.  However, a lack of measurable goals in the strategic planning efforts of  VA\u2019s GEC, which has the lead responsibility for managing VA\u2019s 14 long- term care programs, affects VA\u2019s ability to appropriately plan for and  understand its progress towards addressing long-term care challenges. In  addition to these key challenges, VA has identified, but not yet fully  addressed, inconsistencies in the management of the 14 long-term care  programs at the VAMC level.
