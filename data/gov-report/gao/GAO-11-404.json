GAO assessed (1) the extent to which parts quality problems affect those agencies' space and missile defense programs; (2) causes of any problems; and (3) initiatives to prevent, detect, and mitigate parts quality problems. To accomplish this, GAO reviewed all 21 systems with mature designs and projected high costs: 5 DOD satellite systems, 4 DOD missile defense systems, and 12 NASA systems. GAO reviewed existing and planned efforts for preventing, detecting, and mitigating parts quality problems. Further, GAO reviewed regulations, directives, instructions, policies, and several studies, and interviewed senior headquarters and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Parts quality problems affected all 21 programs GAO reviewed at the Department of Defense (DOD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In some cases they contributed to significant cost overruns and schedule delays. In most cases, problems were associated with electronic versus mechanical parts or materials. In several cases, parts problems discovered late in the development cycle had more significant cost and schedule consequences. For example, one problem cost a program at least $250 million and about a 2-year launch delay. The causes of parts quality problems GAO identified were poor workmanship, undocumented and untested manufacturing processes, poor control of those processes and materials and failure to prevent contamination, poor part design, design complexity, and an inattention to manufacturing risks. Ineffective supplier management also resulted in concerns about whether subcontractors and contractors met program requirements. Most programs GAO reviewed began before the agencies adopted new policies related to parts quality problems, and newer post-policy programs were not mature enough for parts problems to be apparent. Agencies and industry are now collecting and sharing information about potential problems, and developing guidance and criteria for testing parts, managing subcontractors, and mitigating problems, but it is too early to determine how much such collaborations have reduced parts quality problems since such data have not been historically collected. New efforts are collecting data on anomalies, but no mechanism exists to use those data to assess improvements. Significant barriers hinder efforts to address parts quality problems, such as broader acquisition management problems, workforce gaps, diffuse leadership in the national security space community, the government's decreasing influence on the electronic parts market, and an increase in counterfeiting of electronic parts. Given this, success will likely be limited without continued assessments of what works well and must be done. DOD and NASA should implement a mechanism for periodic assessment of the condition of parts quality problems in major space and missile defense programs with periodic reporting to Congress. DOD partially agreed with the recommendation and NASA agreed. DOD agreed to annually address all quality issues, to include parts quality."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) space and missile defense systems play  a vital role in protecting national and homeland security, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) space systems provide  global weather forecasting and all government space organizations  facilitate important scientific research. Because of these systems\u2019  complexity, the environments they operate in, and the high degree of  accuracy and precision needed for their operation, quality is paramount to  their success. Yet in recent years, many space and missile defense  programs, which rely on many of the same contractors, have struggled  with quality problems. For example, the Air Force\u2019s Advanced Extremely  High Frequency communications satellite was launched on August 14,  2010, but has yet to reach its intended orbit because of a blockage in a  propellant line that was most likely caused by a small piece of cloth  inadvertently left in the line during the manufacturing process. In 2009, a  major test for the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) Terminal High Altitude  Area Defense missile system was not completed because of a design and  quality problem affecting the target. While these two cases were widely  reported by the media, other space and missile defense programs have  struggled with less-visible quality problems that have resulted in  unnecessary repair, scrap, and rework, and in some cases, a complete halt  in large-scale programs, months of delay, and millions of dollars in cost  growth. Often, such problems have arisen at the tail end of problematic,  long-term development efforts, creating a great deal of frustration for  program and government officials. Moreover, while attention has  increased in recent years on problems related to counterfeit parts, we have  reported that problems affecting major missile defense and space  programs have generally been the result of other issues, such as design  instability and technology maturity.", "In view of the cost and importance of space and missile defense  acquisitions, you asked that we examine parts quality problems affecting  satellites and missile defense systems across DOD and NASA. Our review  of parts quality problems includes problems with the materials and  processes used in manufacturing. Parts are the basic elements of a system;  their manufacturing must be dependable if a system\u2019s hardware is to be  reliable. Moreover, given the span of agencies and systems we were  examining, our focus on parts enabled consistent analysis of problems,  causal factors, and improvement efforts. At the same time, however, our  scope excluded quality problems that arose during assembly and  integration of larger subsystems, assemblies, and components, unless such  problems were tied to a specific part. Figure 1 depicts the focus of our  review and figure 2 defines materials, process, and parts.", "Our specific objectives were to assess (1) the extent to which parts quality  problems are affecting DOD and NASA space and missile defense  programs; (2) the causes behind these problems; and (3) initiatives to  prevent, detect, and mitigate parts quality problems.", "To determine the extent to which parts quality problems affected a  program\u2019s cost, schedule and performance, we identified 21 DOD and  NASA major acquisitions that had completed their critical design reviews  (CDR) as of October 2009. This universe of 21 programs includes 9 DOD  systems (4 Air Force, 1 Navy, and 4 MDA) and 12 NASA systems. We  asked officials from all 21 programs to identify the most significant parts  quality problems that had affected their programs, as well as the  associated cost and schedule impacts, causes, and contributing factors. A  quality problem is the degree to which the product attributes, such as  capability, performance, or reliability, did not meet the needs of the  customer or mission, as specified through the requirements definition and  allocation process.", "From the 21 systems examined, we selected 2 from DOD (1 Air Force and  1 MDA program) and 1 from NASA with known quality problems, as  identified in previous GAO reports, for further review to gain greater  insight into the root causes of the parts quality problems. We are unable to  make generalizable or projectable statements about parts quality problems  related to space and missile programs beyond this stated scope. We  reviewed regulations, directives, instructions, and policies to determine  how DOD, the Air Force, MDA, and NASA define and address parts quality.  We interviewed senior DOD, MDA, and NASA headquarters officials, as  well as system program and contractor officials from the Air Force, MDA,  and NASA, about their knowledge of parts problems on their programs.  We also reviewed several studies on parts quality from the Aerospace  Corporation and met with officials to discuss their findings. To identify  the extent to which parts problems are common across DOD, MDA, and  NASA, we collected and reviewed failure review board reports, advisory  notices, and cost and schedule analysis reports on parts problems  affecting the 21 identified systems and interviewed program officials. To  identify initiatives planned and practices used by DOD, MDA, and NASA to  prevent and detect parts quality problems, we interviewed program  officials at DOD, the Air Force, MDA, and NASA responsible for systems  engineering and quality and obtained, reviewed, and discussed their parts  quality policies and factors contributing to parts problems. For more on  our scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to May 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD and NASA build costly, complex systems that serve a variety of  national security and science, technology, and space exploration missions.  Within DOD, the Air Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems Center is  responsible for acquiring most of DOD\u2019s space systems; however, the Navy  is also acquiring a replacement satellite communication system. MDA, also  within DOD, is responsible for developing, testing, and fielding an  integrated, layered ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend  against all ranges of enemy ballistic missiles in all phases of flight. The  major projects that NASA undertakes range from highly complex and  sophisticated space transportation vehicles, to robotic probes, to satellites  equipped with advanced sensors to study the Earth. Requirements for  government space systems can be more demanding than those of the  commercial satellite and consumer electronics industry. For instance,  DOD typically has more demanding standards for radiation-hardened  parts, such as microelectronics, which are designed and fabricated with  the specific goal of enduring the harshest space radiation environments,  including nuclear events. Companies typically need to create separate  production lines and in some cases special facilities. In the overall  electronics market, military and NASA business is considered a niche  market.", "Moreover, over time, government space and missile systems have  increased in complexity, partly as a result of advances in commercially  driven electronics technology and subsequent obsolescence of mature  high-reliability parts. Systems are using more and increasingly complex  parts, requiring more stringent design verification and qualification  practices. In addition, acquiring qualified parts from a limited supplier  base has become more difficult as suppliers focus on commercial markets  at the expense of the government space market\u2014which requires stricter  controls and proven reliability.", "Further, because DOD and NASA\u2019s space systems cannot usually be  repaired once they are deployed, an exacting attention to parts quality is  required to ensure that they can operate continuously and reliably for  years at a time through the harsh environmental conditions of space.  Similarly, ballistic missiles that travel through space after their boost  phase to reach their intended targets are important for national security  and also require reliable and dependable parts. These requirements drive  designs that depend on reliable parts, materials and processes that have  passed CDRs, been fully tested, and demonstrated long life and tolerance  to the harsh environmental conditions of space."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Shifts in Government Oversight and Management of Parts", "paragraphs": ["There have been dramatic shifts in how parts for space and missile  defense systems have been acquired and overseen. For about three  decades, until the 1990s, government space and missile development  based its quality requirements on a military standard known as MIL-Q- 9858A. This standard required contractors to establish a quality program  with documented procedures and processes that are subject to approval  by government representatives throughout all areas of contract  performance. Quality is theoretically ensured by requiring both the  contractor and the government to monitor and inspect products. MIL-Q- 9858A and other standards\u2014collectively known as military  specifications\u2014were used by DOD and NASA to specify the  manufacturing processes, materials, and testing needed to ensure that  parts would meet quality and reliability standards needed to perform in  and through space. In the 1990s, concerns about cost and the need to  introduce more innovation brought about acquisition reform efforts that  loosened a complex and often rigid acquisition process and shifted key  decision-making responsibility\u2014including management and oversight for  parts, materials, and processes\u2014to contractors. This period, however, was  marked by continued problematic acquisitions that ultimately resulted in  sharp increases in cost, schedule, and quality problems.", "For DOD, acquisition reform for space systems was referred to as Total  System Performance Responsibility (TSPR). Under TSPR, program  managers\u2019 oversight was reduced and key decision-making responsibilities  were shifted onto the contractor. In May 2003, a report of the Defense  Science Board/Air Force Scientific Advisory Board Joint Task Force stated  that the TSPR policy marginalized the government program management  role and replaced traditional government \u201coversight\u201d with \u201cinsight.\u201d In  2006, a retired senior official responsible for testing in DOD stated that  \u201cTSPR relieved development contractors of many reporting requirements,  including cost and technical progress, and built a firewall around the  contractor, preventing government sponsors from properly overseeing  expenditure of taxpayer dollars.\u201d We found that TSPR reduced  government oversight and led to major reductions in various government  capabilities, including cost-estimating and systems-engineering staff.  MDA chose to pursue the Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) approach as part  of its acquisition reform effort. The LSI approach used a single contractor  responsible for developing and integrating a system of systems within a  given budget and schedule. We found in 2007 that a proposal to use an LSI  approach on any new program should be seen as a risk at the outset, not  because it is conceptually flawed, but because it indicates that the  government may be pursuing a solution that it does not have the capacity  to manage.", "Within NASA, a similar approach called \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d was  intended to help reduce mission costs, improve efficiency, and increase  scientific results by conducting more and smaller missions in less time.  The approach was intended to stimulate innovative development and  application of technology, streamline policies and practices, and energize  and challenge a workforce to successfully undertake new missions in an  era of diminishing resources. We found that while NASA had many  successes, failures of two Mars probes revealed limits to this approach,  particularly in terms of NASA\u2019s ability to learn from past mistakes.", "As DOD and NASA moved from military specifications and standards, so  did suppliers. According to an Aerospace Corporation study, both prime  contractors and the government space market lost insight and traceability  into parts as suppliers moved from having to meet military specifications  and standards to an environment where the prime contractor would  ensure that the process used by the supplier would yield a quality part.  During this time, downsizing and tight budgets also eroded core skills,  giving the government less insight, with fewer people to track problems  and less oversight into manufacturing details.", "As DOD and NASA experienced considerable cost, schedule, and  performance problems with major systems in the late 1990s and early  2000s, independent government-sponsored reviews concluded that the  government ceded too much control to contractors during acquisition  reform. As a result, in the mid-to late 2000s, DOD and NASA reached broad  consensus that the government needed to return to a lifecycle mission  assurance approach aimed at ensuring mission success. For example,  MDA issued its Mission Assurance Provisions (MAP) for acquisition of  mission and safety critical hardware and software in October 2006. The  MAP is to assist in improving MDA\u2019s acquisition activities through the  effective application of critical best practices for quality safety and  mission assurance. In December 2008, DOD updated its acquisition  process which includes government involvement in the full range of  requirements, design, manufacture, test, operations, and readiness  reviews.", "Also in the last decade, DOD and NASA have developed policies and  procedures aimed at preventing parts quality problems. For example,  policies at each agency set standards to require the contractor to establish  control plans related to parts, materials, and processes. Policies at the Air  Force, MDA, and the NASA component we reviewed also establish  minimum quality and reliability requirements for electronic parts\u2014such as  capacitors, resistors, connectors, fuses, and filters\u2014and set standards to  require the contractor to select materials and processes to ensure that the  parts will perform as intended in the environment where they will  function, considering the effects of, for example, static electricity, extreme  temperature fluctuations, solar radiation, and corrosion. In addition, DOD  and NASA have developed plans and policies related to counterfeit parts  control that set standards to require contractors to take certain steps to  prevent and detect counterfeit parts and materials. Table 1 identifies the  major policies related to parts quality at DOD and NASA.", "Government policies generally require various activities related to the  selection and testing of parts, materials, and processes. It is the prime  contractor\u2019s responsibility to determine how the requirements will be  managed and implemented, including the selection and management of  subcontractors and suppliers. In addition, it is the government\u2019s  responsibility to provide sufficient oversight to ensure that parts quality  controls and procedures are in place and rigorously followed. Finally,  DOD and NASA have quality and mission assurance personnel staff on  their programs to conduct on-site audits at contractor facilities. Table 2  illustrates the typical roles of the government and the prime contractor in  ensuring parts quality.", "DOD and NASA also have their own oversight activities that contribute to  system quality. DOD has on-site quality specialists within the Defense  Contract Management Agency and the military services, MDA has its  Mission Assurance program, and NASA has its Quality Assurance program.  Each activity aims to identify quality problems and ensure the on-time, on- cost delivery of quality products to the government through oversight of  manufacturing and through supplier management activities, selected  manufacturing activities, and final product inspections prior to  acceptance. Likewise, prime contractors employ quality assurance  specialists and engineers to assess the quality and reliability of both the  parts they receive from suppliers and the overall weapon system. In  addition, DOD and NASA have access to one or more of the following  databases used to report deficient parts: the Product Data Reporting and  Evaluation Program (PDREP), the Joint Deficiency Reporting System  (JDRS), and the Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP).  Through these systems, the government and industry participants share  information on deficient parts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Parts Quality Problems Are Widespread and in Some Cases Have Had a Significant Effect on Cost, Schedule, and Performance", "paragraphs": ["Parts quality problems reported by each program affected all 21 programs  we reviewed at DOD and NASA and in some cases contributed to  significant cost overruns, schedule delays, and reduced system reliability  and availability.

In some cases, program  officials told us that they do not track the cost effects of parts quality  problems or that it was too early to determine the effect. The schedule  effect is the cumulative total of months it took to resolve a problem.

In many cases, programs experienced problems with the  same parts and materials. Figure 3 identifies the distribution of quality  problems across electronic parts, mechanical parts, and materials.", "In many cases, programs experienced problems with the same parts and  materials. For electronic parts, seven programs reported problems with  capacitors, a part that is widely used in electronic circuits. Multiple  programs also reported problems with printed circuit boards, which are  used to support and connect electronic components. While printed circuit  boards range in complexity and capability, they are used in virtually all but  the simplest electronic devices. As with problems with electronic parts,  multiple programs also experienced problems with the same materials.", "For example, five programs reported problems with titanium that did not  meet requirements. In addition, two programs reported problems with four  different parts manufactured with pure tin, a material that is prohibited in  space because it poses a reliability risk to electronics.

As shown in figure 5, part screening,  qualification, and testing typically occur during the final design phase of  spacecraft development. When parts problems are discovered during this  phase, they are sometimes more easily addressed without major  consequences to a development effort since fabrication of the spacecraft  has not yet begun or is just in the initial phases. In several of the cases we  reviewed, however, parts problems were discovered during instrument  and system-level testing, that is, after assembly or integration of the  instrument or spacecraft. As such, they had more significant consequences  as they required lengthy failure analysis, disassembly, rework, and  reassembly, sometimes resulting in a launch delay.", "Our work identified a number of cases in which parts problems identified  late in development caused significant cost and schedule issues.", "Parts quality problems found during system-level testing of the Air  Force\u2019s Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite program  contributed to a launch delay of almost 2 years and cost the program at  least $250 million. A power-regulating unit failed during system-level  thermal vacuum testing because of defective electronic parts that had  to be removed and replaced. This and other problems resulted in  extensive rework and required the satellite to undergo another round  of thermal vacuum testing. According to the program office, the  additional thermal vacuum testing alone cost about $250 million.", "At MDA, the Space Tracking and Surveillance System program  discovered problems with defective electronic parts in the Space- Ground Link Subsystem during system-level testing and integration of  the satellite. By the time the problem was discovered, the manufacturer  no longer produced the part and an alternate contractor had to be  found to manufacture and test replacement parts. According to  officials, the problem cost about $7 million and was one of the factors  that contributed to a 17-month launch delay of two demonstration  satellites and delayed participation in the BMDS testing we reported on  in March 2009.", "At NASA, parts quality problems found late in development resulted in  a 20-month launch delay for the Glory program and cost $71.1 million.  In August 2008, Glory\u2019s spacecraft computer failed to power up during  system-level testing. After a 6-month failure analysis, the problem was  attributed to a crack in the computer\u2019s printed circuit board, an  electronic part in the computer used to connect electronic  components. Because the printed circuit board could not be  manufactured reliably, the program had to procure and test an  alternate computer. The program minimized the long lead times  expected with the alternate computer by obtaining one that had already  been procured by NASA. However, according to contractor officials,  design changes were also required to accommodate the alternate  computer. In June 2010, after the computer problem had been resolved,  the Glory program also discovered problems with parts for the solar  array drive assembly that rendered one of the arrays unacceptable for  flight and resulted in an additional 3-month launch delay.", "Also at NASA, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental  Satellite System Preparatory Project experienced $105 million in cost  increases and 27 months of delay because of parts quality problems.  In one case, a key instrument developed by a NASA partner failed  during instrument-level testing because the instrument frame fractured  at several locations. According to the failure review board, stresses  exceeded the material capabilities of several brazed joints\u2014a method  of joining metal parts together. According to officials, the instrument\u2019s  frame had to be reinforced, which delayed instrument delivery and  ultimately delayed the satellite\u2019s launch date. In addition, officials  stated that they lack confidence in how the partner-provided satellite  instruments will function on orbit because of the systemic mission  assurance and systems engineering issues that contributed to the parts  quality problems.", "For some of the programs we reviewed, the costs associated with parts  quality problems were minimized because the problems were found early  and were resolved within the existing margins built into the program  schedule. For example, the Air Force\u2019s Global Positioning System (GPS)  program discovered problems with electronic parts during part-level  testing and inspection. An investigation into the problem cost about  $50,000, but did not result in delivery delays. An independent review team  ultimately concluded that the parts could be used without a performance  or mission impact. At NASA, the Juno program discovered during part- level qualification testing that an electronic part did not meet performance  requirements. The program obtained a suitable replacement from another  manufacturer; it cost the program $10,000 to resolve the issue with no  impact on program schedule.", "In other cases, the costs of parts quality problems were amplified because  they were a leading cause of a schedule delay to a major milestone, such  as launch readiness. For example, of the $60.9 million cost associated with  problems with the Glory spacecraft computer found during system-level  testing, $11.6 million was spent to resolve the issue, including personnel  costs for troubleshooting, testing, and oversight as well as design,  fabrication, and testing of the new computer. The majority of the cost\u2014 $49.3 million\u2014was associated with maintaining the contractor during the  15-month launch delay. Similarly, problems with parts for Glory\u2019s solar  array assembly cost about $10.1 million, $2.7 million to resolve the  problem and $7.4 million resulting from the additional 3-month schedule  delay. Similarly, program officials for NASA\u2019s National Polar-orbiting  Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project attributed the $105  million cost of its parts quality problems to the costs associated with  launch and schedule delays, an estimated $5 million a month.", "In several cases, the programs were encountering other challenges that  obscured the problems caused by poor quality parts. For example, the Air  Force\u2019s Space-Based Infrared System High program reported that a part  with pure tin in the satellite telemetry unit was discovered after the  satellite was integrated. After an 11-month failure review board, the  defective part was replaced. The program did not quantify the cost and  schedule effect of the problem because the program was encountering  software development issues that were already resulting in schedule  delays. Similarly, NASA\u2019s Mars Science Laboratory program experienced a  failure associated with joints in the rover propulsion system. According to  officials, the welding process led to joint embrittlement and the possibility  of early failure. The project had to test a new process, rebuild, and test the  system, which cost about $4 million and resulted in a 1-year delay in  completion. However, the program\u2019s launch date had already been delayed  25 months because of design issues with the rover actuator motors and  avionics package\u2014in effect, buying time to resolve the problem with the  propulsion system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Some Cases, Parts Quality Problems Affected System Reliability and Availability", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the launch delays discussed above, parts quality problems  also resulted in reduced system reliability and availability for several other  programs we reviewed. For example, the Air Force\u2019s GPS program found  that an electronic part lacked qualification data to prove the part\u2019s quality  and reliability. As a result, the overall reliability prediction for the space  vehicle was decreased. At MDA, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense  program discovered problems with an electronic part in the telemetry unit  needed to transmit flight test data. The problem was found during final  assembly and test operations of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle resulting  in the cancellation of a major flight test. This increased risk to the program  and the overall BMDS capability, since the lack of adequate intercept data  reduced confidence that the system could perform as intended in a real- world situation. Also, MDA\u2019s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program  recalled 16 missiles from the warfighter, including 7 from a foreign  partner, after the prime contractor discovered that the brackets used to  accommodate communications and power cabling were improperly  adhered to the Standard Missile 3 rocket motor.

In part, this is due to the use of cost- reimbursement contracts. Because space and missile defense acquisitions  are complex and technically challenging, DOD and NASA typically use  cost-reimbursement contracts, whereby the government pays the prime  contractor\u2019s allowable costs to the extent prescribed in the contract for  the contractor\u2019s best efforts. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the  government generally assumes the financial risks associated with  development, which may include the costs associated with parts quality  problems. Of the 21 programs we reviewed, 20 use cost-reimbursement  contracts. In addition, 17 programs use award and incentive fees to reduce  the government\u2019s risk and provide an incentive for excellence in such  areas as quality, timeliness, technical ingenuity, and cost-effective  management. Award and incentive fees enable the reduction of fee in the  event that the contractor\u2019s performance does not meet or exceed the  requirements of the contract.

Generally, prime contractor activities to  capture manufacturing knowledge should include identifying critical  characteristics of the product\u2019s design and then the critical manufacturing  processes and materials to achieve these characteristics. Manufacturing  processes and materials should be documented, tested, and controlled  prior to production. This includes establishing criteria for workmanship,  making work instructions available, and preventing and removing foreign  object debris in the production process.", "Poor workmanship was one of the causes of problems with electronic  parts. At DOD, poor workmanship during hand-soldering operations  caused a capacitor to fail during testing on the Navy\u2019s Mobile User  Objective System program. Poor soldering workmanship also caused a  power distribution unit to experience problems during vehicle-level testing  on MDA\u2019s Targets and Countermeasures program. According to MDA  officials, all units of the same design by the same manufacturer had to be  X-ray inspected and reworked, involving extensive hardware disassembly.  As a corrective action, soldering technicians were provided with training  to improve their soldering operations and ability to perform better visual  inspections after soldering. Soldering workmanship problems also  contributed to a capacitor failure on NASA\u2019s Glory program. Analysis  determined that the manufacturer\u2019s soldering guidelines were not  followed.", "Programs also reported quality problems because of the use of  undocumented and untested manufacturing processes. For example,  MDA\u2019s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program reported that the brackets  used to accommodate communications and power cabling were  improperly bonded to Standard Missile 3 rocket motors, potentially  leading to mission failure. A failure review board determined that the  subcontractor had changed the bonding process to reduce high scrap rates  and that the new process was not tested and verified before it was  implemented. Similarly, NASA\u2019s Landsat Data Continuity Mission program  experienced problems with the spacecraft solar array because of an  undocumented manufacturing process. According to program officials, the  subcontractor did not have a documented process to control the amount  of adhesive used in manufacturing, and as a result, too much adhesive was  applied. If not corrected, the problem could have resulted in solar array  failure on orbit.", "Poor control of manufacturing materials and the failure to prevent  contamination also caused quality problems. At MDA, the Ground-Based  Midcourse Defense program reported a problem with defective titanium  tubing. The defective tubing was rejected in 2004 and was to be returned  to the supplier; however, because of poor control of manufacturing  materials, a portion of the material was not returned and was inadvertently  used to fabricate manifolds for two complete Ground-Based Interceptor  Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicles. The vehicles had already been processed  and delivered to the prime contractor for integration when the problem  was discovered. Lack of adherence to manufacturing controls to prevent  contamination and foreign object debris also caused parts quality  problems. For example, at NASA, a titanium propulsion tank for the  Tracking Data and Relay Satellite program failed acceptance testing  because a steel chip was inadvertently welded onto the tank.

Officials attributed the problem to poor design, and the  attenuators were subsequently redesigned. At NASA, design problems also  affected parts for the Mars Science Laboratory program.

According to project  officials, the board design was almost impossible to manufacture with  over 100 serial steps involved in the manufacturing process. Furthermore,  failure analysis found that the 27,000 connection points in the printed  circuit board were vulnerable to thermal stresses over time leading to  intermittent failures.

Requirements  flow-down from the prime contractor to subcontractors and suppliers is  particularly important and challenging given the structure of the space and  defense industries, wherein prime contractors are subcontracting more  work to subcontractors. At MDA, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense  program experienced a failure with an electronics part purchased from an  unauthorized supplier. According to program officials, the prime  contractor flowed down the requirement that parts only be purchased  from authorized suppliers; however, the subcontractor failed to execute  the requirement and the prime contractor did not verify compliance.  Program officials for NASA\u2019s Juno program attributed problems with a  capacitor to the supplier\u2019s failure to review the specification prohibiting  the use of pure tin. DOD\u2019s Space-Based Infrared System High program  reported problems with three different parts containing pure tin and  attributed the problems to poor requirements flow-down and poor supplier  management.

For  example, MDA has developed the supplier road map database in an effort  to gain greater visibility into the supply chain in order to more effectively  manage supply chain risks. In addition, according to MDA officials, MDA  has recently been auditing parts distributors in order to rank them for risk  in terms of counterfeit parts. NASA has begun to assess industrial base  risks and challenges during acquisition strategy meetings and has  established an agency Supply Chain Management Team to focus attention  on supply chain management issues and to coordinate with other  government agencies.", "Agencies and industry also participate in a variety of collaborative  initiatives to address quality, in particular, parts quality. These range from  informal groups focused on identifying and sharing news about emerging  problems as quickly as possible, to partnerships that conduct supplier  assessments, to formal groups focused on identifying ways industry and  the government can work together to prevent and mitigate problems. As  shown in table 5, these groups have worked to establish guidance, criteria,  and standards that focus on parts quality issues, and they have enhanced  existing data collection tools and created new databases focused on  assessing anomalies.", "One example of the collaborative efforts is the Space Industrial Base  Council (SIBC)\u2014a government-led initiative\u2014which brings together  officials from agencies involved in space and missile defense to focus on a  range of issues affecting the space industrial base and has sparked  numerous working groups focused specifically on parts quality and critical  suppliers. These groups in turn have worked to develop information- sharing mechanisms, share lessons learned and conduct supplier  assessments, soliciting industry\u2019s input as appropriate. For instance, the  SIBC established a critical technology working group to explore supply  chains and examine critical technologies to put in place a process for  strategic management of critical space systems\u2019 technologies and  capabilities under the Secretary of the Air Force and the Director of the  National Reconnaissance Office. The working group has developed and  initiated a mitigation plan for batteries, solar cells and arrays, and  traveling wave tube amplifiers. In addition, the Space Supplier Council  was established under the SIBC to focus on the concerns of second-tier  and lower-tier suppliers, which typically have to go through the prime  contractors, and to promote more dialogue between DOD, MDA, NASA,  other space entities, and these suppliers. Another council initiative was  the creation of the National Security Space Advisory Forum, a Web-based  alert system developed for sharing critical space system anomaly data and  problem alerts, which became operational in 2005.", "Agency officials also cited other informal channels used to share  information regarding parts issues. For example, NASA officials stated  that after verifying a parts issue, they will share their internal advisory  notice with any other government space program that could potentially be  affected by the issue. According to several government and contractor  officials, the main reasons for delays in information sharing were either  the time it took to confirm a problem or concerns with proprietary and  liability issues. NASA officials stated that they received advisories from  MDA and had an informal network with MDA and the Army Space and  Missile Defense Command to share information about parts problems.  Officials at the Space and Missile Systems Center also mentioned that they  have informal channels for sharing part issues. For example, an official in  the systems engineering division at the Space and Missile Systems Center  stated that he has weekly meetings with a NASA official to discuss parts  issues.", "In addition to the formal and informal collaborative efforts, the Air Force\u2019s  Space and Missile Systems Center, MDA, NASA, and the National  Reconnaissance Office signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in  February 2011 to encourage additional interagency cooperation in order to  strengthen mission assurance practices. The MOU calls on the agencies to  develop and share lessons learned and best practices to ensure mission  success through a framework of collaborative mission assurance. Broad  objectives of the framework are to develop core mission assurance  practices and tools; to foster a mission assurance culture and world-class  workforce; to develop clear and executable mission assurance plans; to  manage effective program execution; and to ensure program health  through independent, objective assessments. Specific objectives include  developing a robust mission assurance infrastructure and guidelines for  tailoring specifications and standards for parts, materials, and processes  and establishing standard contractual language to ensure consistent  specification of core standards and deliverables.", "In addition, each agency is asked to consider the health of the industrial  base in space systems acquisitions and participate in mission assurance  activities, such as the Space Supplier Council and mission assurance  summits. In signing the MOU, DOD, MDA, NASA, and the National  Reconnaissance Office acknowledged the complexity of such an  undertaking as it typically takes years to deliver a capability and involves  hundreds of industry partners building, integrating, and testing hundreds  of thousands of parts, all which have to work the first time on orbit\u2014a  single mishap, undetected, can and has had catastrophic results.", "Although collaborative efforts are under way, we could not determine the  extent to which collaborative actions have resulted in reduced instances  of parts quality problems to date or ensured that they are caught earlier in  the development cycle. This is primarily because data on the condition of  parts quality in the space and missile community governmentwide  historically have not been collected. The Aerospace Corporation has  begun to collect data on on-orbit and preflight anomalies in addition to the  Web alert system established by the Space Quality Improvement Council.  In addition, there is no mechanism in place to assess the progress of  improvement actions using these data or to track the condition of parts  quality problems across the space and missile defense sector to determine  if improvements are working or what additional actions need to be taken.  Such a mechanism is needed given the varied challenges facing  improvement efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvement Efforts Face Potential Barriers to Success", "paragraphs": ["There are significant potential barriers to the success of improvement  efforts, including broader acquisition management problems, diffuse  leadership in the national security space community, workforce gaps, the  government\u2019s decreasing influence on the overall electronic parts market,  and an increase in counterfeiting of electronic parts. Actions are being  taken to address some of these barriers, such as acquisition management  and diffuse leadership, but others reflect trends affecting the aerospace  industry that are unlikely to change in the near future and may limit the  extent to which parts problems can be prevented.", "Broader acquisition management problems: Both space and  missile defense programs have experienced acquisition problems\u2014well  beyond parts quality management difficulties\u2014during the past two  decades that have driven up costs by billions of dollars, stretched  schedules by years, and increased technical risks. These problems have  resulted in potential capability gaps in areas such as missile warning,  military communications, and weather monitoring, and have required  all the agencies in our review to cancel or pare back major programs.  Our reports have generally found that these problems include starting  efforts before requirements and technologies have been fully  understood and moving them forward into more complex phases of  development without sufficient knowledge about technology, design,  and other issues. Reduced oversight resulting from earlier acquisition  reform efforts and funding instability have also contributed to cost  growth and schedule delays. Agencies are attempting to address these  broader challenges as they are concurrently addressing parts quality  problems. For space in particular, DOD is working to ensure that  critical technologies are matured before large-scale acquisition  programs begin, requirements are defined early in the process and are  stable throughout, and system designs remain stable. In response to  our designation of NASA acquisition management as a high-risk area,  NASA developed a corrective action plan to improve the effectiveness  of its program/project management, and it is in the process of  implementing earned value management within certain programs to  help projects monitor the scheduled work done by NASA contractors  and employees. These and other actions have the potential to  strengthen the foundation for program and quality management but  they are relatively new and implementation is uneven among the  agencies involved with space and missile defense. For instance, we  have found that both NASA and MDA lack adequate visibility into costs  of programs. Our reports also continue to find that cost and schedule  estimates across all three agencies tend to be optimistic.", "Diffuse leadership within the national security space  community: We have previously testified and reported that diffuse  leadership within the national security space community has a direct  impact on the space acquisition process, primarily because it makes it  difficult to hold any one person or organization accountable for  balancing needs against wants, for resolving conflicts among the many  organizations involved with space, and for ensuring that resources are  dedicated where they need to be dedicated. In 2008, a congressionally  chartered commission (known as the Allard Commission) reported that  responsibilities for military space and intelligence programs were  scattered across the staffs of DOD organizations and the intelligence  community and that it appeared that \u201cno one is in charge\u201d of national  security space. The same year, the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence reported similar concerns, focusing  specifically on difficulties in bringing together decisions that would  involve both the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of  Defense. Prior studies, including those conducted by the Defense  Science Board and the Commission to Assess United States National  Security Space Management and Organization (Space Commission),  have identified similar problems, both for space as a whole and for  specific programs. Changes have been made this past year to national  space policies as well as organizational and reporting structures within  the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Air Force to address  these concerns and clarify responsibilities, but it remains to be seen  whether these changes will resolve problems associated with diffuse  leadership.", "Workforce gaps: Another potential barrier to success is a decline in  the number of quality assurance officials, which officials we spoke with  pointed to as a significant detriment. A senior quality official at MDA  stated that the quality assurance workforce was significantly reduced  as a result of acquisition reform. A senior DOD official responsible for  space acquisition oversight agreed, adding that the government does  not have the in-house knowledge or resources to adequately conduct  many quality control and quality assurance tasks. NASA officials also  noted the loss of parts specialists who provide technical expertise to  improve specifications and review change requests. According to NASA  officials, there is now a shortage of qualified personnel with the  requisite cross-disciplinary knowledge to assess parts quality and  reliability. Our prior work has also shown that DOD\u2019s Defense Contract  Management Agency (DCMA), which provides quality assurance  oversight for many space acquisitions, was downsized considerably  during the 1990s. While capacity shortfalls still exist, DCMA has  implemented a strategic plan to address workforce issues and improve  quality assurance oversight. The shortage in the government quality  assurance workforce reflects a broader decline in the numbers of  scientists and engineers in the space sector. The 2008 House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report mentioned above  found that the space workforce is facing a significant loss of talent and  expertise because of pending retirements, which is causing problems in  smoothly transitioning to a new space workforce. Similarly, in 2010 we  reported that 30 percent of the civilian manufacturing workforce was  eligible for retirement, and approximately 26 percent will become  eligible for retirement over the next 4 years. Similar findings were  reported by the DOD Cost Analysis Improvement Group in 2009.", "Industrial base consolidation: A series of mergers and  consolidations that took place primarily in the 1990s added risks to  parts quality\u2014first, by shrinking the pool of suppliers available to  produce specialty parts; second, by reducing specialized expertise  within prime contractors; and third, by introducing cost-cutting  measures that de-emphasize quality assurance. We reported in 2007  that the GPS IIF program, the Space-Based Infrared High Satellite  System, and the Wideband Global SATCOM system all encountered  quality problems that could be partially attributed to industry  consolidations. Specialized parts for the Wideband Global SATCOM  system, for example, became difficult to obtain after smaller  contractors that made these parts started to consolidate. For GPS,  consolidations led to a series of moves in facilities that resulted in a  loss of GPS technical expertise. In addition, during this period, the  contractor took additional cost-cutting measures that reduced quality.  Senior officials responsible for DOD space acquisition oversight with  whom we spoke with for this review stated that prime space  contractors have divested their traditional lines of expertise in favor of  acting in a broader \u201csystem integrator\u201d role. Meanwhile, smaller  suppliers that attempted to fill gaps in expertise and products created  by consolidations have not had the experience and knowledge needed  to produce to the standards needed for government space systems. For  instance, officials from one program told us that their suppliers were  often unaware that their parts would be used in space applications and  did not understand or follow certain requirements. Officials also  mentioned that smaller suppliers attempting to enter the government  space market do not have access to testing and other facilities needed  to help build quality into their parts. We recently reported that small  businesses typically do not own the appropriate testing facilities, such  as thermal vacuum chambers, that are used for testing spacecraft or  parts under a simulated space environment and instead must rely on  government, university, or large contractor testing facilities, which can  be costly.", "Government\u2019s declining share of the overall electronic parts  market: DOD and NASA officials also stated that the government\u2019s  declining share of the overall electronic parts market has made it more  difficult to acquire qualified electronic parts. According to officials, the  government used to be the primary consumer of microelectronics, but  it now constitutes only a small percentage of the market. As such, the  government cannot easily demand unique exceptions to commercial  standards. An example of an exception is DOD\u2019s standards for  radiation-hardened parts, such as microelectronics, which are designed  and fabricated with the specific goal of enduring the harshest space  radiation environments, including nuclear events. We reported in 2010  that to produce such parts, companies would typically need to create  separate production lines and in some cases special facilities. Another  example is that government space programs often demand the use of a  tin alloy (tin mixed with lead) for parts rather than pure tin because of  the risk for growth of tin whiskers. According to officials, as a result of  European environmental regulations, commercial manufacturers have  largely moved away from the use of lead making it more difficult and  costly to procure tin alloy parts, and increasing the risk of parts being  made with pure tin. Similarly, officials noted concerns with the  increased use of lead-free solders used in electronic parts. Moreover,  officials told us that when programs do rely on commercial parts, there  tends to be a higher risk of lot-to-lot variation, obsolescence, and a lack  of part traceability.", "An increase in counterfeit electronic parts: Officials we spoke  with agreed that an increase in counterfeit electronics parts has made  efforts to address parts quality more difficult. \u201cCounterfeit\u201d generally  refers to instances in which the identity or pedigree of a product is  knowingly misrepresented by individuals or companies. A 2010  Department of Commerce study identified a growth in incidents of  counterfeit parts across the electronics industry from about 3,300 in  2005 to over 8,000 incidents in 2008. We reported in 2010 that DOD is  limited in its ability to determine the extent to which counterfeit parts  exist in its supply chain because it does not have a departmentwide  definition of \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and a consistent means to identify instances  of suspected counterfeit parts. Moreover, DOD relies on existing  procurement and quality control practices to ensure the quality of the  parts in its supply chain. However, these practices are not designed to  specifically address counterfeit parts. Limitations in the areas of  obtaining supplier visibility, investigating part deficiencies, and  reporting and disposal may reduce DOD\u2019s ability to mitigate risks  posed by counterfeit parts. At the time of our review, DOD was only in  the early stages of addressing counterfeiting. We recommended and  DOD concurred that DOD leverage existing initiatives to establish  anticounterfeiting guidance and disseminate this guidance to all DOD  components and defense contractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Space and missile systems must meet high standards for quality.

Options for  correction are scant.\u201d The number of parts problems identified in our  review is relatively small when compared to the overall number of parts  used. But these problems have been shown to have wide-ranging and  significant consequences. Moreover, while the government\u2019s reliance on  space and missile systems has increased dramatically, attention and  oversight of parts quality declined because of a variety of factors,  including the implementation of TSPR and similar policies, workforce  gaps, and industry consolidations. This condition has been recognized and  numerous efforts have been undertaken to strengthen the government\u2019s  ability to detect and prevent parts problems.

DOD  responded that it would work with NASA to determine the optimal  governmentwide assessment and reporting implementation to include all  quality issues, of which parts, materials, and processes would be one of  the major focus areas. In addition, DOD proposed an annual reporting  period to ensure planned, deliberate, and consistent assessments. We  support DOD\u2019s willingness to address all quality issues and to include  parts, materials, and processes as an important focus area in an annual  report. Recent cases of higher-level quality problems that did not fall  within the scope of our review include MDA\u2019s Terminal High Altitude Area  Defense missile system and the Air Force\u2019s Advanced Extremely High  Frequency communications satellite, which were mentioned earlier in our  report. It is our opinion that these cases occurred for reasons similar to  those we identified for parts, materials, and processes. We recognize that  quality issues can include a vast and complex universe of problems.  Therefore, the scope of our review and focus of our recommendation was  on parts, materials, and processes to enable consistent reporting and  analysis and to help direct corrective actions. Should a broader quality  focus be pursued, as DOD indicated, it is important that DOD identify  ways in which this consistency can be facilitated among the agencies. In  response to our second recommendation, DOD stated that it had no  objection to providing a report to Congress, if Congress desired one.

Based on additional information gathered  through documentation provided by the programs and discussions with  program officials, we reviewed each part problem reported by each  program to determine if there was a part problem, rather than a material,  process, component, or assembly level problem. In addition, when  possible we identified the impact that a part, material, or process quality  problem might have had on system cost, schedule, and performance.
