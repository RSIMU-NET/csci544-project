To help assess the extent to which FEMA is  experiencing employee morale issues, we reviewed findings of the  Partnership for Public Service, which ranked the best places to work in  the federal government for fiscal years 2010 through 2014\u2014the 5 most  recent years for which data were available. We also interviewed  OCCHCO officials to obtain information on the agency\u2019s progress and  challenges with addressing employee morale issues.", "As shown in table 1, to obtain the views of FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce on  FEMA\u2019s challenges in managing its workforce, we conducted 23 focus  group sessions with a total of 136 participants from the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), FEMA, and the AmeriCorps National Civilian  Community Corps (NCCC).", "To obtain regional perspectives on FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce on FEMA\u2019s  workforce planning and management efforts, we conducted focus groups  with Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE) and  Permanent Full-Time (PFT) employees at 3 of FEMA\u2019s 10 regions  (Regions II, IV, and VI). We selected the 3 regions based on factors  including geographic dispersion and regions that typically respond to  different types of disasters. These sessions involved small-group  discussions designed to gain more in-depth information about issues  COREs and PFTs face. Discussions were guided by a moderator who  used a list of discussion topics to encourage participants to share their  thoughts and experiences as COREs or PFTs. Specifically, discussion  topics included experiences while being deployed to Hurricane Sandy or  other disasters, job differences during deployments and steady-state  conditions, likelihood of deployments, whether every employee is an  emergency manager, FQS implementation, force structure, training,  policies and procedures, communication, perspectives of other employee  groups, employee morale, and changes at FEMA; however, not all topics  were discussed in each group. Each focus group involved four to eight  COREs or PFTs. There were two types of focus groups based on whether  employees were deployed to Hurricane Sandy response efforts. The  participants were chosen from a random sample of the entire universe of  eligible participants at each region. We excluded supervisors from  selection to allow participants to speak freely. Selected individuals who  were not available for the focus groups were replaced with randomly  selected alternates, to the extent possible. We completed written  summaries of each focus group, and used qualitative analysis software to  categorize responses and identify common themes across the focus  groups, using appropriate checks to ensure accuracy. The results of  these focus groups are not generalizable. However, the views we  obtained from them provided us with valuable examples of CORE and  PFT experiences.", "To address the second objective, we selected the FEMA Corps and  Surge Capacity Force programs for review because these new disaster  workforces were deployed for the first time during Hurricane Sandy, the  nation\u2019s most recent catastrophic disaster. We also selected these  workforces for review because they are jointly managed by agencies  outside of FEMA and they consist of non-FEMA employees who are  funded by the Disaster Relief Fund. To examine the retention and  recruitment challenges of these programs, we reviewed program  documentation, such as the Surge Capacity Force Concept of  Operations, and NCCC surveys of FEMA Corps member graduating  classes. We also interviewed officials with FEMA, NCCC, DHS  headquarters, and DHS components about program staffing challenges.  We reviewed FEMA Corps program data on the number of FEMA Corps  members who left the program because of failed background  investigations from September 2012 through March 2015, but we  determined that these data were not sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report. We compared the information we gathered against our  leading practices on collaboration and strategic workforce planning. To  examine the extent to which these programs collect complete cost  information, we reviewed program documentation, such as the FEMA  Corps Business Case, and interviewed officials with FEMA, NCCC, DHS  headquarters, and DHS components responsible for implementing and  supporting the Surge Capacity Force and FEMA Corps programs. We  compared the information we gathered against Office of Management and  Budget guidance on cost-benefit analyses and our best practices on  program cost estimating and assessment.of these workforces, we reviewed program documentation, such as the  FEMA Corps Implementation Plan, and Surge Capacity Force  postdeployment surveys. We also interviewed officials with FEMA,  NCCC, DHS headquarters, and DHS components about performance  management for both programs. We intended to review FEMA Corps  service project requests and corresponding project completion reports  from September 2014 through November 2014, but as we discuss in the  report, the records could not be reliably compared. As a result, we could  not report on the number of service projects completed by FEMA Corps  teams or the extent to which the goals of service projects have been  accomplished by FEMA Corps teams. We visited two FEMA regions and  one FEMA region via teleconference to interview FEMA officials  responsible for requesting and managing FEMA Corps teams in the field   To examine the performance  and, as discussed later, to conduct focus groups of FEMA Corps team  leaders and members. We compared the information we gathered against  standards in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  program management best practices, program guidance, and Office of  Management and Budget guidance on surveys.", "To obtain perspectives on FEMA\u2019s management of its new disaster  workforces\u2014FEMA Corps and Surge Capacity Force\u2014we conducted  focus groups with all four of FEMA\u2019s liaisons to the five NCCC regional  campuses and all eight DHS component Surge Capacity Force  coordinators. These sessions involved small-group discussions designed  to gain more in-depth information about recruitment and retention issues  in the FEMA Corps and Surge Capacity Force programs. Discussions  were guided by a moderator who used a list of discussion topics to  encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences.  Specifically, discussion topics included implementation, management,  deployment, recruitment, and retention issues; however, not all topics  were discussed in each group. We completed written summaries of each  focus group, and used qualitative analysis software to categorize  responses and identify common themes across the focus groups, using  appropriate checks to ensure accuracy. The results of these focus groups  of all four FEMA\u2019s liaisons to the five NCCC regional campuses and all  eight DHS component Surge Capacity Force coordinators represent the  entire populations.", "In addition, to obtain perspectives of participants in the FEMA Corps  program, we conducted focus groups with FEMA Corps team leaders and  members at FEMA Regions II, IV, and VI. These sessions involved small- group discussions designed to gain more in-depth information about  participant experiences in the FEMA Corps program. Discussions were  guided by a moderator who used a list of discussion topics to encourage  participants to share their thoughts and experiences. Specifically,  discussion topics included implementation, management, deployment,  recruitment, and retention issues; however, not all topics were discussed  in each group. Both focus groups with FEMA Corps team leaders  involved three team leaders each. Each focus group with FEMA Corps  members involved eight members from two or more teams in a region.  The participants were chosen from a random sample of the entire  universe of eligible participants at each region. We completed written  summaries of each focus group, and used qualitative analysis software to  categorize responses and identify common themes across the focus  groups, using appropriate checks to ensure accuracy. The results of  these focus groups are not generalizable. However, the views we  obtained from them provided us with valuable examples of experiences of  participants in the FEMA Corps program.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to June 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
