Throughout my tenure, I have stressed the need for fundamental reforms to ensure that more timely, reliable, and useful information is available for managing and assessing the government\u2019s financial condition and operating performance. Such reforms are critical if our federal government is ever to attain proper accountability over hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars and these reforms are essential prerequisites to achieving broader management reforms.", "I am pleased to say that in the last 6 years a solid framework for improving financial management finally has been established. This base has been laid by (1) the original Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and its subsequent expansion through the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, (2) the creation of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) in 1990, and (3) efforts made to improve the budget process through such actions as enactment of credit reform. During this period, many professionals involved in budgeting, accounting, and management reporting have devoted a great deal of thought and effort to developing a vision for more effective and understandable financial management reporting for the federal government.", "Today I will discuss the need to build upon this foundation as well as outline additional areas for further reforms. I will begin with some changes we have suggested to improve the budget process even within its current basic design; most of these go to the need to increase the recognition of the long-term implications of budget decisions and to strengthen accountability. Then I will turn to the important set of reforms underway, which would further enhance budget decision-making as well as broader accountability for the government\u2019s use of and care for taxpayer funds. Moreover, as the quality of financial data and of federal reports on costs and performance improves through implementation of the CFO Act and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) as well as the introduction of new accounting concepts and standards, these enhancements must be more fully integrated into the budget decision-making process to permit better-informed budget decisions.", "This is not a simple agenda. Nor will it be accomplished in a year. But we have laid a good foundation, and there is reason to expect continued progress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Budget Process: Ideas for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Today there is widespread frustration with the budget process. It is attacked as confusing, time-consuming, burdensome, and repetitive. In addition, the results are often disappointing to both participants and observers. Although frustration is nearly universal, there is less agreement on what specific changes would be appropriate. This is not surprising. It is in the budget debate that the government determines in which areas it will be involved and how it will exercise that involvement. Disagreement about the best process to reach such important decisions and how to allocate precious resources is to be expected.", "We have made several proposals based on a good deal of GAO work on the budget, including the structure of the budget and the budget process.These proposals emphasize the need to improve the recognition of the long-term impact of today\u2019s budget decisions and advance steps to strengthen or better ensure accountability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Focus on the Long Term", "paragraphs": ["In previous reports and testimonies, we have said that the nation\u2019s economic future depends in large part upon today\u2019s budget and investment decisions. Therefore, it is important for the budget to provide a long-term framework and be grounded in a linkage of fiscal policy with the long-term economic outlook. This would require a focus both on overall fiscal policy and on the composition of federal activity.", "In previous reports, we have cautioned that the objective of enhancing long-term economic growth through overall fiscal policy is not well served by a budget process which focuses on the short-term implications of various spending decisions. It is important to pay attention to the long-term overall fiscal policy path, to the longer-term implications of individual programmatic decisions, and to the composition of federal spending. very short term, planning for longer-range economic goals requires exploring the implications of budget decisions well into the future. By this, we do not mean detailed budget projections could be made over a 30-year time horizon, but it is important to recognize that for some programs a long-term perspective is critical to understanding the fiscal and spending implications of a decision. The current 5-year time horizon may work well for some programs, but for retirement programs, pension guarantees, and mortgage-related commitments\u2014for example\u2014a longer-time horizon is necessary.", "Although the surest way of increasing national savings and investment would be to reduce federal dissaving by eliminating the deficit, the composition of federal spending also matters. We have noted that federal spending can be divided into two broad categories based on the economic impact of that spending\u2014consumption spending having a short-term economic impact and investment spending intended to have a positive effect on long-term private sector economic growth. We have argued that the allocation of federal spending between investment and consumption is important and deserves explicit consideration. However, the current budget process does not prompt the executive branch or the Congress to make explicit decisions about how much spending should be for long-term investment. The budget functions along which the resolution is structured represent one categorization by \u201cmission,\u201d but they are not subdivided into consumption and investment. Appropriations subcommittees provide funding by department and agency in appropriations accounts that do not distinguish between investment and consumption spending. In short, the investment/consumption decision is not one of the organizing themes for the budget debate.", "We have suggested that an appropriate and practical approach to supplement the budget\u2019s focus on macroeconomic issues would be to incorporate an investment component within the discretionary caps set by BEA. Such an investment component would direct attention to the trade-offs between consumption and investment but within the overall fiscal discipline established by the caps. It would provide policymakers with a new tool for setting priorities between the long term and the short term. Within the declining unified budget deficit path, a target for investment spending could be established for the appropriate level of investment to ensure that it is considered formally in the budget process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement, Accountability, and Transparency", "paragraphs": ["In addition to changes aimed at improving the focus on the long term, we have continued to emphasize the importance of enforceability, accountability, and transparency. We describe these three elements together because it is difficult to have accountability without an enforcement mechanism and without transparency to make the process understandable to those outside it. Accountability in this context has several dimensions: accountability for the full costs of commitments that are to be made and accountability for actions taken\u2014which requires targeting enforcement to actions. In addition, it may encompass the broader issue of taking responsibility for responding to unexpected events. Transparency is important not only because in a democracy the budget debate should be accessible to the citizenry but also because without it, there can be little ultimate accountability to the public.", "In this area, as in others I discuss today, there has been progress. For example, enforcement provisions in BEA have worked within their scope: the discretionary caps and controls on expanding entitlements have held. The design of the law has provided accountability for the costs of actions taken and for compliance with rules. However, accountability for the worse-than-expected deficits in the past has been diffuse. For credibility and for success, we need to consider bringing more responsibility for the results of unforeseen actions into the system.", "We have previously suggested that Congress might want to consider introducing a \u201clookback\u201d into its system of budgetary controls. Under such a process, the current Congressional Budget Office (CBO) deficit projections would be compared to those projected at the time of a prior deficit reduction agreement and/or the most recent reconciliation legislation. For a difference exceeding a predetermined amount, the Congress would decide explicitly\u2014through a vote\u2014whether to accept the slippage or to act to bring the deficit path closer to the original goal by mandating actions to narrow this gap. required to recommend whether none, some, or all of the overage should be recouped. The Congress could be required to vote either on the President\u2019s proposal or an alternative one.", "Neither of these \u201clookback\u201d processes determine an outcome; both seek to increase accountability for decisions about the path of federal spending. Taken together, the changes we have suggested, which could be made within the current budget process, would move us toward increased focus on important decisions and increased accountability for those decisions.

Good information on the full costs of federal operations is frequently absent or extremely difficult to reconstruct and reliable information on federal assets and liabilities is all too often lacking. While GAO has been actively urging improvements in this area for over 20 years, complete, useful financial reporting is not yet in place.", "The good news is that tools are now being put in place that promise to get the federal government\u2019s financial house in order. First, beginning for fiscal year 1996, all major agencies, covering about 99 percent of the government\u2019s outlays, are required to prepare annually financial statements and have them audited. Second, an audited governmentwide financial statement is required to be produced every year starting with fiscal year 1997. Third, FASAB is recommending new federal accounting standards that will yield more useful and relevant financial statements and information.", "The basis for much of this progress is the CFO Act\u2019s requirements for annual financial statement audits. Audits for a select group of agencies under the Act\u2019s original pilot program highlighted problems of uncollected revenues and billions of dollars of unrecognized liabilities and potential losses from such programs as housing loans, veterans compensation and pension benefits, and hazardous waste cleanup. Such audits are bringing important discipline to agencies\u2019 financial management and control systems. Thanks to the benefits achieved from these pilot audits, the Congress extended this requirement, in the 1994 Government Management Reform Act, to the government\u2019s 24 major departments and agencies.", "That act also mandated an annual consolidated set of governmentwide financial statements\u2014to be audited by GAO\u2014starting for fiscal year 1997. These statements will provide an overview of the government\u2019s overall costs of operations, a balance sheet showing the government\u2019s assets and liabilities, and information on its contribution to long-term economic growth and the potential future costs of current policies. These reports will provide policymakers and the public valuable information to assess the sustainability of federal commitments.", "The CFO Act also went beyond these auditing and reporting requirements to spell out an agenda of other long overdue reforms. It established a CFO structure in 24 major agencies and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide the necessary leadership and focus. It also set expectations for the deployment of modern systems to replace existing antiquated, often manual, processes; the development of better performance and cost measures; and the design of results-oriented reports on the government\u2019s financial condition and operating performance by integrating budget, accounting, and program information. measures into the reports and developing reports more specifically tailored to the government\u2019s needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FASAB Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The creation of FASAB was the culmination of many years of effort to achieve a cooperative working relationship between the three principal agencies responsible for overall federal financial management\u2014OMB, Treasury, and GAO. Its establishment represents a major stride forward because financial management can only improve if these principal agencies involved in setting standards, reporting, and auditing work together. As you know, FASAB was established in October 1990 by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of OMB, and me to consider and recommend accounting principles for the federal government. The 9-member board is comprised of representatives from the three principals, CBO, the Department of Defense, one civilian agency (presently Energy), and three representatives from the private sector, including the Chairman, former Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats. FASAB recommends accounting standards after considering the financial and budgetary information needs of the Congress, executive agencies, other users of federal financial information and comments from the public. OMB, Treasury, and GAO then decide whether to adopt the recommended standards; if they do, the standards are published by GAO and OMB and become effective.", "FASAB will soon complete the federal government\u2019s first set of comprehensive accounting standards developed under this consensus approach. Key to the FASAB approach for developing these standards was extensive consultation with users of financial statements early in its deliberations to ensure that the standards will result in statements that are relevant to both the budget process as well as agencies\u2019 accountability for resources. Users were interested in getting answers to questions on such topics as:", "Budgetary integrity\u2014What legal authority was provided to finance government activities and was it used correctly?", "Operating performance\u2014How much do programs cost and how were they financed? What was achieved? What are the government\u2019s assets and are they well managed? What are its liabilities and how will they be paid for?", "Stewardship\u2014Has the government\u2019s overall financial capacity to satisfy current and future needs and costs improved or deteriorated? What are its future commitments and are they being provided for? How will the government\u2019s programs affect the future growth potential of the economy?", "Systems and control\u2014Does the government have sufficient controls over its programs so that it can detect and correct problems?", "The FASAB principals have approved eight basic standards and statements, which I will refer to as FASAB standards in my testimony today, and approval of the final one for revenue accounting is expected this spring. This will complete the body of basic accounting and cost accounting standards for all federal agencies to use in preparing financial reports and developing meaningful cost information.

Some are effective now; all that have been issued will be effective for fiscal year 1998. OMB defines the form and content of agency financial statements in periodic bulletins to agency heads. The most recent guidance incorporates FASAB standards for selected assets and liabilities, credit programs, and inventory. In the fall, OMB will be issuing new guidance reflecting the rest of the FASAB standards.", "Since the enactment of the CFO Act, OMB\u2019s form and content guidance has stressed the use of narrative \u201cOverview\u201d sections preceding the basic financial statements as the best way for agencies to relate mission goals and program performance measures to financial resources. Each financial statement includes an Overview describing the agency, its mission, activities, accomplishments, and overall financial results and condition. It also should discuss what, if anything, needs to be done to improve either program or financial performance, including an identification of programs or activities that may need significant future funding. OMB also requires that agency financial statements include a balance sheet, a statement of operations, and a statement reconciling expenses reported on the statement of operations to related amounts presented in budget execution reports.", "Based on FASAB\u2019s standards, OMB is making efforts to design new financial reports that contain performance measures and budget data to provide a much needed, additional perspective on the government\u2019s actual performance and its long-term financial prospects. Financial reports based on FASAB\u2019s standards will provide valuable information to help sort out various kinds of long-term claims. The standards envision new reports on a broad range of liabilities and liability-like commitments and assets and asset-like spending. Liabilities, such as the federal debt, would be reported on a balance sheet, along with assets owned by federal agencies, like buildings. recognition as liabilities on the balance sheet. FASAB is still considering what types of estimates would be most useful if stewardship reporting is applied to social insurance. To give a picture of the government\u2019s capacity to sustain current public services, stewardship reporting will also include 6-year projections of receipt and outlay data for all programs based on data submitted for the President\u2019s budget.", "Stewardship reports based on FASAB standards would also provide information on federal investments intended to have future benefits for the nation, thus providing actual data on the budget\u2019s investment component that GAO has recommended and which I discussed earlier. Stewardship reporting would cover federal investments and some performance information for programs intended to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure, research and development, and human capital due to their potential contribution to the long-term productive capacity of the economy. These kinds of activities would not be reflected on the balance sheet because they are not assets owned by the federal government but rather programs and subsidies provided to state and local governments and the private sector for broader public purposes. Stewardship reporting recognizes that, although these investments lack the traditional attributes of assets, such programs warrant special analysis due to their potential impact on the nation\u2019s long-term future.", "Linking costs to the reported performance levels is the next challenge. FASAB\u2019s cost accounting standards\u2014the first set of standards to account for costs of federal government programs\u2014will require agencies to develop measures of the full costs of carrying out a mission or producing products or services. Thus, when implemented, decisionmakers would have information on the costs of all resources used and the cost of support services provided by others to support activities or programs\u2014and could compare these costs to various levels of program performance.", "Perseverance will be required to sustain the current momentum in improving financial management and to successfully overcome decades of serious neglect in fundamental financial management operations and reporting methods. Implementing FASAB standards will not be easy. FASAB has allowed lead time for implementing the standards so that they can be incorporated into agencies\u2019 systems. Nevertheless, even with this lead time, agencies may have difficulty in meeting the schedule. It is critical that the Congress and the executive branch work together to make implementation successful.", "As the federal government continues to improve its accountability and reporting of costs and performance, the more useful and reliable data need to be used to influence decisions.

The changes underway to financial reporting have been undertaken with a goal of making financial data more accessible to these decisionmakers. The budget community\u2019s involvement in the FASAB standard-setting process has contributed to this. Still, the future challenge remains to further integrate financial reports with the budget to enhance the quality and richness of the data considered in budget deliberations. Improving the linkages between accounting and budgeting also calls for considering certain changes in budgeting such as realigned account structures and the selective use of accrual concepts.", "The chief benefit of improving this linkage will be the increased reliability of the data on which we base our management and budgetary decisions. The new financial reports will improve the reliability of the budget numbers undergirding decisions. Budgeting is a forward-looking enterprise, but it can clearly benefit from better information on actual expenditures and revenue collection. Under FASAB standards, numbers from the budget will be included in basic financial statements and thus will be audited for the first time. Having these numbers audited was one of the foremost desires of budget decisionmakers consulted in FASAB\u2019s user needs study and stems from their suspicion that the unaudited numbers may not always be correct.", "The new financial reports will also offer new perspectives and data on the full costs of program outputs and agency operations that are currently not reported in the cash-based budget. Information on full costs generated pursuant to the new FASAB standards would provide decisionmakers a more complete picture of actual past program costs and performance when they are considering the appropriate level of future funding.

Our work to date has revealed shortcomings with cash-based budgeting for insurance programs, but also highlighted difficulties in estimating future costs for some of them due to the lack of adequate data or to sensitivity to the assumptions used to model future costs. The potential distortions arising from the cash-based approach must be weighed against the risks and uncertainties involved in estimating longer-term accrued costs for some programs.
