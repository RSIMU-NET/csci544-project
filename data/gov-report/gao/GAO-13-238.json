The Dodd-Frank Act required that eight federal financial agencies and the Federal Reserve Banks implement provisions to support workforce and contractor diversity.

Industry representation of minorities in 2011 was higher in lower-level management positions--about 20 percent--compared to about 11 percent of senior-level manager positions. Industry representation of women at the overall management level remained at about 45 percent. Agency representation of minorities at the senior management level in 2011 ranged from 6 percent to 17 percent and from 0 percent to 44 percent at the Reserve Banks. Women's representation ranged from 31 to 47 percent at the agencies and from 15 to 58 percent at the Reserve Banks. Officials said the main challenge to improving diversity was identifying candidates, noting that minorities and women are often underrepresented in both internal and external candidate pools.", "In response to the requirements in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), in 2011 federal financial agencies and Reserve Banks began to report annually on the recruitment and retention of minorities and women and other diversity practices. They all have established Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) as required. Many agencies and Reserve Banks indicated they had recruited from minority-serving institutions and partnered with organizations focused on developing opportunities for minorities and women, and most described plans to expand these activities. Some used employee surveys or recruiting metrics to measure the progress of their initiatives, as suggested by leading diversity practices, but OMWIs are not required to include this type of information in the annual reports to Congress. Better reporting of measurement efforts will provide Congress, agency officials, and other stakeholders additional insights on the effectiveness of diversity practices and demonstrate how agencies and Reserve Banks are following a leading diversity practice. Most federal financial agencies and Reserve Banks are in the early stages of implementing the contracting requirements required under the act. For example, most now include a provision in contracts for services requiring contractors to make efforts to ensure the fair inclusion of women and minorities in their workforce and subcontracted workforce and have established ways to evaluate compliance. The proportion of an agency's dollars awarded or a Reserve Bank's dollars paid to minority- or woman-owned businesses reported in 2011 OMWI reports ranged between 3 percent and 38 percent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Each agency and Reserve Bank should include in its annual OMWI report to Congress efforts to measure the progress of its diversity practices.

During hearings on the financial services industry between 2004  and 2010, congressional members and witnesses expressed concern  about the level of inclusion of women and minorities in the industry,  particularly in key management-level positions. The 2007-2009 financial  crisis has renewed concerns about commitment within the financial  services industry to workforce diversity and the number of federal  contracting opportunities available to minority- and women-owned  businesses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) included provisions requiring selected  federal financial agencies and Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks)  each to establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI).

According to the  Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, almost half of its MWOB contract dollars  were paid for software and related technology integration services from  minority-owned firms. All other Reserve Banks paid under 13 percent of  contracting dollars to MWOBs, with the Reserve Bank of New York  awarding the smallest percentage of its contracting dollars to such  businesses (3 percent). The Reserve Bank of New York described its  commitment to increasing diversity in its pool of potential contractors  through its outreach efforts to us and in its 2011 OMWI report.

Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires  federal financial agencies and Reserve Banks to include in their annual  OMWI report a description of the challenges they may face in contracting  with qualified MWOBs. As a new agency, CFPB has not been required to  complete an annual OMWI report and did not identify any contracting  challenges to us. In interviews with us and in the 2011 OMWI reports to  Congress, the remaining agencies and all Reserve Banks discussed a  number of common challenges to increasing contracting with MWOBs,  including the following:", "Limited capacity of MWOBs: Some agencies and Reserve Banks  stated that reporting or other requirements under federal contracts  were often too great a burden for MWOBs or that MWOBs needed to  build capacity to meet federal contracting requirements. Some  agencies and Reserve Banks also stated that at times the need for  goods or services is not scaled to the capacity of MWOBs. For  example, some agencies and Reserve Banks faced challenges  identifying MWOBs that can meet procurement needs on a national  scale.", "Developing staff or procedures to meet contracting requirements of  the act: According to some agencies, new OMWIs require additional  staff or staff development, or procedures to meet the requirements of  the act, including providing technical assistance to increase  opportunities for MWOBs, identifying qualified MWOBs in the  marketplace, and incorporating the use of a fair inclusion provision in  contracts and good faith effort determination processes, which we  discussed earlier, into established procurement processes.", "MWOB classification challenges: Multiple agencies and Reserve  Banks described difficulty identifying and classifying suppliers as  diverse entities. Some Reserve Banks noted that no central agency is  responsible for certifying MWOBs. Some agencies and Reserve  Banks also discussed a need for new procedures or information  systems to identify and classify diverse ownership of businesses.", "Availability: Some agencies and Reserve Banks noted that  specialized services are often only available from a limited pool of  suppliers that may not include MWOBs.", "Centralized procurement: Reserve Banks may use the National  Procurement Office (NPO), the centralized procurement office for the  12 Reserve Banks, to contract for some goods and services. When  a Reserve Bank procures through the NPO, access to MWOBs may  be limited because the NPO procures for volume discounts with larger  contractors. However, the Reserve Bank of Richmond, in its 2011  OMWI report, described efforts to work with existing large contractors  to increase subcontracting with smaller, diverse firms.", "No MWOB bids: In some cases, agencies and Reserve Banks found  that potentially eligible MWOB applicants decided not to bid without  explanation.", "Other challenges were described on a limited basis by one agency or  Reserve Bank. For example, NCUA explained that MWOBs are not  familiar with the agency. According to NCUA, to address this issue it  increased its outreach budget and attendance to MWOB events and  published an online guide on doing business with the agency. According  to FDIC, in some cases MWOBs do not have relationships with large  federal contractors for subcontracting opportunities. To address this  problem, FDIC emphasizes to larger firms the importance of  subcontracting with MWOBs and has negotiated increases in MWOB  subcontracting participation with large contractors. FDIC participated in  procurement events where small and large contractors could meet and  match capabilities. The Reserve Bank of Chicago stated that MWOBs  have a hard time standing out in highly competitive industries, such as  staff augmentation services. Finally, according to the Reserve Bank of  Richmond, MWOBs may have incorrect perceptions that Reserve Banks  are subject to federal procurement rules that they cannot meet.", "To counter challenges MWOBs may face in accessing federal contracting  opportunities, all agencies and Reserve Banks described providing  various specific forms of technical assistance to MWOBs, which they  described in discussions with us and in 2011 OMWI reports to Congress.", "No agency or Reserve Bank stood out as coordinating technical  assistance better than others, although some agencies pointed to  longstanding efforts at FDIC to provide technical assistance to MWOBs  as model practices. Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires federal  financial agencies and Reserve Banks to develop standards for  coordinating technical assistance to MWOBs. These activities included  developing and distributing literature, such as manuals and brochures  describing contracting procedures and resources to prospective  contractors. Most agencies also established websites that function as  informational portals on doing business with agencies and act as an  agency entry point to prospective contractors. Agencies and Reserve  Banks described outreach activities to MWOBs, including conducting  expert panels, hosting meetings and workshops, and exhibiting at trade  shows and procurement events. Some of these outreach activities have  been coordinated with SBA. For example, FDIC has partnered with SBA  to develop a technical assistance program for small businesses, including  MWOBs, on money management. OCC worked with SBA to create a  technical assistance workshop that they conducted in 2012 with women- owned small businesses. Some agencies have included SBA  representatives in supplier diversity events they sponsor. Even prior to  the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board had  participated in SBA procurement fairs and used SBA information and  events to market its procurement opportunities among diverse suppliers.  Treasury has participated in SBA outreach events and created a mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program to assist small businesses with contracting  opportunities.", "Agencies and Reserve Banks also provide one-on-one technical  assistance, which is intended to meet the specific needs of a prospective  MWOB contractor. According to Treasury, they coordinate with SBA to  leverage SBA\u2019s knowledge of one-on-one technical assistance practices  with MWOBs. FHFA and SEC have created dedicated e-mail addresses  and telephone lines for MWOBs to reach their OMWIs, and SEC has  established monthly vendor outreach days when MWOBs can speak one- on-one with SEC\u2019s supplier diversity officer and small-business specialist.  Some Reserve Banks described conducting one-on-one meetings with  prospective contractors in 2011, some of which were held during  procurement events. Finally, FDIC offered its database of MWOBs to the  OMWIs and some agencies described using or planning to use it to  identify potential contractors for outreach regarding procurement  opportunities.

Since 2011, federal financial agencies and Reserve Banks  have taken initial steps to respond to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s requirements  to promote workforce diversity, and OMWIs have begun reporting on both  planned and existing diversity practices, in addition to reporting on  workforce demographic statistics according to EEOC requirements. While  many OMWIs have implemented or are planning efforts to measure and  evaluate the progress of their diversity and inclusion activities, a leading  diversity management practice, information on these efforts is not  reported consistently across the OMWI annual reports. Although the act  requires information on successes and challenges, it does not specifically  require reporting on measurement; however, the act provides that the  federal financial agencies and the Reserve Banks can include additional  information determined appropriate by the OMWI director. Measurement  of diversity practices is one of the nine leading diversity management  practices we have previously identified. Reporting on these efforts as part  of annual OMWI reporting would provide Congress, other OMWIs, and  the financial services industry with potentially useful information on the  ongoing implementation of diversity practices. Such information could be  helpful industrywide, as management-level diversity at federal financial  agencies, Reserve Banks, and the broader financial services industry  continues to be largely unchanged.
