The Navy has been developing two different LCS seaframes and plans to select one for production in 2010. Due to the small 78-person crew size--40 core crew, 23 for aviation detachment, and typically 15 for mission packages--the Navy is developing new concepts for personnel, training, and maintenance. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD) has (1) estimated LCS long-term operating and support costs and (2) developed plans to operate and support LCS. To do so, GAO compared Navy cost estimates to DOD guidance and GAO best practices; and analyzed Navy plans to implement its concepts for personnel, training, and maintenance and the extent these plans included assessments of program risk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Navy estimated operating and support costs for LCS seaframes and mission packages in 2009, but the estimates do not fully reflect DOD and GAO best practices for cost estimating and may change due to program uncertainties. GAO's analysis of the Navy's 2009 estimates showed that the operating and support costs for seaframes and mission packages could total $84 billion (in constant fiscal year 2009 dollars) through about 2050. However, the Navy did not follow some best practices for developing an estimate such as (1) analyzing the likelihood that the costs could be greater than estimated, (2) fully assessing how the estimate may change as key assumptions change, and (3) requesting an independent estimate and comparing it with the program estimate. The estimates may also be affected by program uncertainties, such as potential changes to force structure that could alter the number of ships and mission packages required. The costs to operate and support a weapon system can total 70 percent of a system's costs, and the lack of an estimate that fully reflects best practices could limit decision makers' ability to identify the resources that will be needed over the long term to support the planned investment in LCS force structure. With a decision pending in 2010 on which seaframe to buy for the remainder of the program, decision makers could lack critical information to assess the full costs of the alternatives. The Navy has made progress in developing operational concepts for LCS, but faces risks in implementing its new concepts for personnel, training, and maintenance that are necessitated by the small crew size. Specifically, the Navy faces risks in its ability to identify and assign personnel given the time needed to achieve the extensive training required. GAO's analysis of a sample of LCS positions showed an average of 484 days of training is required before reporting to a crew, significantly more than for comparable positions on other surface ships. Moreover, the Navy's maintenance concept relies heavily on distance support, with little maintenance performed on ship. The Navy acknowledges that there are risks in implementing its new concepts and has established groups to address how to implement them. However, these groups have not performed a risk assessment as described in the 2008 National Defense Strategy. The Strategy describes the need to assess and mitigate risks to executing future missions and managing personnel, training, and maintenance. If the Navy cannot implement its concepts as envisioned, it may face operational limitations, have to reengineer its operational concepts, or have to alter the ship design. Many of the concepts will remain unproven until 2013 or later, when the Navy will have committed to building almost half the class. Having a thorough risk assessment of the new operational concepts would provide decision makers with information to link the effectiveness of these new concepts with decisions on program investment, including the pace of procurement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the ability to maneuver in shallow waters inaccessible to other  surface combatants, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is a new class of  warship meant to facilitate U.S. Navy access to and operations in the  littorals, which are waters close to shore. The Navy plans a major  investment in the LCS program, which could cost $28 billion to buy 55  ships and related, interchangeable combat capability. The planned 55 ships  would comprise about 38 percent of the Navy\u2019s surface combatants  in a  313-ship Navy. The Navy is using two contractors to build differently  designed ships, called seaframes. As of October 2009, the Navy had  procured two ships (one of each design) and contracted for two more (one  of each design). The Navy plans to select one design in fiscal year 2010. To  increase flexibility, the LCS\u2019s combat capability will be contained in  removable, interchangeable mission packages to perform one of three  primary missions\u2014mine countermeasures, antisubmarine warfare, and  surface warfare concentrating on countering small surface boat attacks.  Each LCS ship will carry only one package at any given time. Further,  since the cost to operate and support a weapon system traditionally  accounts for over 70 percent of the total cost over a system\u2019s lifetime, the  resources needed to operate and support the LCS seaframes and mission  packages could be significant over time.", "In 2005, the Navy began developing an LCS concept of operations which  broadly describes these unique approaches to personnel, training, and  maintenance and outlines the responsibilities of shore organizations to  support LCS operations. LCS differs from other Navy ships in three key  areas\u2014personnel, training, and maintenance. First, a deployed LCS will  have a total of 78 personnel on board comprised of 40 core crewmembers  to operate the ship, 15 to operate the mission packages, and 23 for the  aviation detachment. A crew of this size is significantly less than on other  surface combatants\u2014about 172 for a frigate and about 254 for a destroyer.  In order to increase operational availability, the Navy intends to rotate  crews about every 4 months to enable each LCS to deploy continuously for  up to 18 months. Second, due to the decision to operate the ship with 40  sailors, training will be tailored to each position and include training in  skills outside the crewmember\u2019s specialty. For example, a fire fighter  specialist is also required to be trained in an engineering skill area. Third,  the crew will perform minimal maintenance on board the ship and will rely  extensively on support from organizations ashore to perform maintenance  and administrative functions such as maintaining supply and pay records.", "Considering the Navy\u2019s unique LCS concept of operations, you asked us to  review the Navy\u2019s efforts to estimate the program\u2019s operating and support  costs and to plan for how the ship will be operated and supported  considering the small crew size. For this review, we assessed the extent to  which the Navy has (1) estimated the long-term operating and support  costs for LCS seaframes and mission packages; and (2) developed and  implemented plans to operate and support the LCS particularly in the  areas of personnel, training, and maintenance.", "To assess the extent to which the Navy estimated the long-term operating  and support costs for LCS seaframes and mission packages, we reviewed  documentation of seaframe and mission package cost estimates prepared  by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

We also  reviewed prior GAO products and DOD guidance on risk management to  assess the extent that Navy plans included assessments of program risk.  To estimate long term LCS personnel requirements, we analyzed Navy  documentation and validated the results with appropriate Navy officials.  To compare LCS training days to training days for other surface ships, we  first identified a non-probability sample of LCS positions from both  seaframes based on criteria for which positions required a wide variety of  training or, based on Navy information, might be hard to fill. Then we  compared the required training days for these LCS positions with  comparable positions on two other surface ships. We validated the data  and results with appropriate Navy officials.

During the 2-week turnover period, the  crews and contractors will perform preventive and corrective  maintenance and resupply the ship. Navy officials stated that one benefit  to having more crews than ships is that the Navy is able to quickly replace  a deployed crew member who becomes sick or injured with a comparably  trained sailor.

However, this analysis is based, in part, on  certain assumptions that are not yet verified. For example, one assumption  is that rotational crewing plans will work as expected, allowing a greater  presence per ship than the traditional one crew per ship. However,  rotational crewing has never been routinely conducted by the Navy for an  entire class of surface combatants. If the Navy switches to a different  crewing model, a different number of ships could be required to sustain  the same presence, or alternatively, a different number of crews could be  required. The expected purchase of 55 seaframes is also based on an  assumption that some ships would be homeported overseas, according to  Navy officials. If the assumed number homeported overseas changes, then  the number of LCS needed to maintain the same presence requirements  could also change. If these assumptions change due to program decisions  or operating experience, the total number of LCS seaframes needed to  meet requirements may change. It may be important for Navy and DOD  decision makers to have updated and complete force structure analyses  for the LCS program since any changes to the planned purchase quantities  as a result of updated force structure analyses would affect the program\u2019s  total operating and support costs.

For  example, one study raised the issue that crew fatigue could affect missions  which could be mitigated by temporarily augmenting the crew or  modifying how missions are conducted. The 40-person core crew size was  based upon the results of a 2005 conference to explore options for  reducing the size of the core crew, which was not the typical workload  analysis.

Due to the limited crew size, many  administrative and maintenance duties will have to be performed ashore  rather than on board as on other surface ships and will be managed by  LCS squadrons.  Navy officials estimated that the number of people  needed in a squadron organization to manage and support 12 to 15 LCSs  might be about 170. The LCS squadrons are likely to be larger than  squadrons for other surface ships since their responsibilities for the level  of shore-based support required for the small core crew will be greater.

In addition, the shore support personnel required will be affected by  outstanding decisions, such as where to homeport the ships and the long- term maintenance strategy.

Specifically:    LCS sailors must be experienced sailors and positions must be filled by a  person of the exact pay grade required, which could limit the pool of  personnel available. Sailors must also commit to serving on an LCS crew  for 36 months after completing their LCS training.

Also, sailors will  not be considered for assignment to LCS if they are color blind or have a  pending application for the officer commissioning program.", "Due to the longer training time required to prepare LCS sailors, the Navy\u2019s  Personnel Command must identify personnel 18 to 24 months prior to  when they need them to report to the LCS crew. For other surface ships,  the Personnel Command needs to identify personnel only 5 to 9 months  ahead of time. Personnel Command officials stated that they must  manually identify the personnel for LCS since the computer system  normally used to identify personnel can only identify personnel up to12  months in advance. Due to the increased workload resulting from the  manual process, the Navy Personnel Command has set up a separate office  specifically to handle LCS personnel assignments and added eight  positions. Officials stated that they will likely need more personnel as  more ships and mission packages enter service.

According to Navy officials, it may take  about 6 months of onboard on-the-job training for a sailor on other surface  ships to reach the same level of proficiency as that described in the  concept for LCS sailors. The Navy\u2019s approach to LCS training is different  than for other surface ships since the small LCS crew size means that  there is little capacity on board for supervised training and no training  group on board the ship as is typical of other surface ships. LCS sailors  will also be required to be trained in several skill areas outside their  primary specialty. For example, an LCS Damage Control Assistant will also  have to train in an engineering skill area and an Electronics Technician  will also have to train in a Fire Controlman skill area. In addition, LCS  sailors will be expected to perform various collateral duties, such as  serving as the crew\u2019s barber and running the ship\u2019s store.", "The Navy expects to complete a study of LCS training by the end of 2009  but may not fully implement the results for several years. The Navy began  this study to fully identify LCS training requirements and to recommend  alternatives for providing training over the life of the LCS program. This is  a complex process since training requirements for the core crew are  unique for each position on the two seaframes. Although the Navy has  identified LCS-specific training requirements for both seaframes and the  three mission packages, the Navy has not yet completed plans for how to  provide this training over the long term. Further, the training plan resulting  from the Navy\u2019s LCS training study may not be fully implemented until  about 2013 or after, largely due to the need to develop and buy simulators  and virtual training facilities. Depending on homeporting decisions, the  Navy may need to build comparable simulators on the east coast as well as  the west coast. Although the Navy has built one shore-based trainer for  each seaframe, the trainers will need to be upgraded in accordance with  the training study results and to meet the train-to-qualify standard. Until  the results of the training analysis are implemented, the Navy has  developed an interim solution, called the LCS Academy, to provide LCS- specific training and fill training gaps.", "Another reason the training required prior to the sailor coming on board  the LCS is longer and more extensive than for other surface ships is that  the training requirements include courses outside of the sailor\u2019s primary  specialty. To assess the training requirements for LCS versus other surface  ships, we compared the training days required before a sailor reports to an  LCS crew to the training days required before a sailor reports to other  types of surface ships. Our analysis of a sample of LCS positions showed  that the number of training days required before an LCS sailor reports to  the crew is significantly longer than for sailors in comparable positions on  other ships\u2014an average of 484 days versus 126 days for an amphibious  transport docking ship and 103 days for a destroyer. The lowest number  of training days required for an LCS position in our sample was 264 and  the highest was 832. Figure 3 below shows the average number of training  days for the positions in our sample on a typical destroyer, amphibious  transport docking ship, and the LCS.", "As noted above, a sailor on ships other than LCS may spend an additional  6 months completing training on board via supervised, on-the-job training.  Therefore, even accounting for this time, the LCS training time required is  significantly higher. Implementing the LCS concept of train-to-qualify has  two important effects. First, the costs to train sailors before they report to  an LCS crew are likely to be significantly higher than for other surface  ships due to the longer training time required before the sailors report to a  crew and due to the costs to build and sustain the shore-based training  facilities. Second, the longer training time before reporting to a crew is the  major reason that the Personnel Command has to identify people 18 to 24  months before they report to an LCS crew, which Navy documents have  indicated may be unsustainable using the current personnel distribution  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Faces Risks in Implementing Its Maintenance Concept", "paragraphs": ["The Navy also faces risks in implementing the maintenance concept being  developed to allow for a small assigned crew. Performing preventive  maintenance is an important factor in maintaining the material condition  of the ship. According to the Navy\u2019s Board of Inspection and Survey,  deferred maintenance was a key factor in some surface ships having  significant material problems identified during recent inspections. The  risks for LCS are in preventive maintenance\u2014periodic tasks to keep  equipment in good condition\u2014and distance support\u2014moving work from  the ship to the shore. Regarding preventive maintenance, the Navy is still  assessing how much preventive maintenance the core crew can  accomplish. Due to the small core crew size, a significant amount of  maintenance has to be moved off ship. The initial analysis was that 20 to  30 man-years of preventive maintenance would have to be moved off of  the ship. According to the Navy\u2019s LCS concept, the core crew is expected  to do little or no corrective maintenance and minimal preventive and  facilities maintenance. The rest would be done during in-port periods\u2014 by the crew or contractors\u2014or by teams that fly out to the ship to perform  maintenance during crew turnover periods. As of October 2009, Navy  officials stated that well over 50 percent of the preventive maintenance  had been transferred from the ship to the shore and is being accomplished  by contractors under the interim support plan agreement. In contrast, on  other surface ships, the crew performs all preventive maintenance and  much corrective maintenance that involves diagnosing problems and  completing somewhat complex repairs. During fiscal year 2009, the Navy  spent $6.0 million on the interim support plan for seaframe preventive and  facilities maintenance. The Navy is also still working to resolve issues in  the system developed for LCS to schedule and track accomplishment of  preventive maintenance.", "The Navy also faces risks in implementing its plans for distance support.  Distance support is a key enabler for supporting LCS and requires the  capability to move information to and from the ship. Although other ships  in the Navy rely to some extent on distance support, Navy officials stated  that distance support is critical to enabling LCS to operate as envisioned in  the operational concept due to the small crew size. According to the  concept, many administrative functions are also planned to be moved  ashore such as postal, administrative records, logistic support, and  maintenance and fuel records. Commander, Naval Surface Forces  established LCS distance support requirements in April 2009, which  included developing the capability to move the workload for 120 processes  from the ship to the shore. Navy officials stated that they are still  evaluating what work to move ashore and how to do so. The processes  identified to date include identifying corrective maintenance, monitoring  crew qualifications, fuel reporting, and remote monitoring of the condition  of some ship systems. However, the Navy has not yet provided funding for  the development, implementation, and long-term sustainment of these  distance support capabilities. If these capabilities are not fully developed  and maintained, then the crew\u2019s workload could increase or the crew size  might need to be increased.", "In addition, the Navy does not yet have a long-term maintenance strategy  for the LCS seaframes and mission packages. Currently, the Navy has  interim support plans for both the seaframes and mission packages that  include contractor-provided maintenance. The Navy intends to develop  and implement a long-term maintenance strategy by about 2015 for the  mission packages and by the end of 2011 for the seaframes. The long-term  strategy may continue to employ mostly contractor-provided maintenance  or could consist of a combination of contractor- and service-provided  maintenance in a Navy shipyard. According to Navy officials, the Navy has  not yet analyzed core logistics capabilities for the LCS program but plans  to do so as part of its analysis to identify a long-term maintenance strategy.  Under section 2464 of Title 10 U.S. Code, DOD is required to maintain a  \u201ccore logistics capability\u201d that is government owned, government  operated, and that uses government personnel, equipment, and facilities.  However, we reported in May 2009 that DOD has neither identified nor  established core capabilities in a timely manner for certain new systems  that were included in the May 2009 report. Consequently, among other  things, we recommended that DOD require an initial core assessment early  in the acquisition process, preferably before Milestone B, and that  acquisition strategies for new or modified systems include either a plan for  establishing core capability within 4 years of initial operational capability,  or a statement that no core capability requirements were identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Risk Assessment Could Inform Key Procurement Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Despite risks in implementing its new LCS operational concepts, the Navy  has not specified the potential operational effects or identified alternative  approaches if its concepts cannot be implemented as envisioned.

Our prior  work also showed that a risk assessment is a best practice that informs an  organization\u2019s decision making and includes identifying potential risks and  identifying countermeasures to reduce the risks.", "The Navy acknowledges that there are risks in implementing its new LCS  operational concepts for personnel, training, and maintenance, and has  established some groups to manage the details of how to implement the  concepts, such as the cross-functional teams and the Oversight Board.  These groups identify and review issues and barriers to implementing the  LCS concepts and work together to jointly develop solutions. In addition,  the LCS program office has established a Risk Management Board, which  monitors issues primarily related to development and production of the  seaframe and mission packages and focuses on technical, schedule, and  cost risks. In general, this board does not focus on personnel, training, and  maintenance risks. Although the work these groups perform is important,  their scope does not include a thorough risk assessment as described in  DOD\u2019s Strategy and GAO best practices. These groups are focused on how  to make the operational concepts work and, as yet, have not fully  identified operational risks and assessed alternatives to mitigate the risks  if these new concepts for personnel, training, and maintenance cannot be  implemented as intended. In the case of LCS, a thorough risk assessment  could be used, for example, to: identify the operational limitations if a 40- person core crew experiences undue fatigue and assess alternatives to the  40-person core crew or to identify the operational limitations if the  distance support does not work as intended and assess alternatives for  supporting a small crew. Without such a risk assessment to inform  decision makers, the Navy faces unspecified operational and program  risks at the same time that it plans to buy a total of 23 ships by the end of  fiscal year 2015. Although the LCS operational testing is expected to  provide some insights into the effectiveness of the new operational  concepts, according to Navy officials, the tests are not scheduled to be  completed until about fiscal year 2014.

Such estimates  are needed to enable decision makers to assess the program\u2019s  affordability, including the long-term, recurring operating and support  costs, and assess the long-term operating and support costs of all the  acquisition alternatives before a decision is made. Specifically, having  complete estimates of the long-term operating and support costs that are  periodically updated and based on results of complete and current force  structure analyses could be an important factor for decision makers to  consider when weighing program investment alternatives such as which  seaframe to buy or options for what to do with the two seaframes of the  design that is not selected. Although the Navy\u2019s operating and support cost  estimates showed some qualities of a sound estimating process, the Navy  did not follow best practices, such as requesting an independent estimate  and comparing it to the program estimate, analyzing the likelihood that  costs will increase, and analyzing the effects on the estimate of key cost  drivers. Further, the Navy\u2019s force structure analyses of the quantities of  required seaframes and mission packages are incomplete and based on  assumptions, such as how many ships may be homeported overseas,  which, if changed, could change the quantities required. Changes in the  quantities of required seaframes and mission packages could affect  estimates of the program\u2019s total operating and support costs. Cost  estimates that fully reflect best practices and are based on complete and  current force structure analyses of required quantities could enhance the  ability of decision makers to identify the resources needed over the long  term to support the seaframes and mission packages and assess the  affordability of the LCS program. Further, decision makers in both DOD  and Congress lack a complete picture of the likely long-term operating and  support costs that will be incurred when buying an increasing number of  LCS ships, hampering their ability to make sound program and investment  decisions.", "At the beginning of the LCS program, the Navy stated that reducing the  number of ship personnel would be a major factor in lowering operating  and support costs. As a result, the Navy\u2019s decision to operate the LCS with  a core crew of only 40 sailors drove the need to develop new operational  concepts. Currently, these concepts are broadly stated and the Navy has  not fully developed the details to implement its vision for identifying  personnel, providing LCS-unique training over the long term, or shifting  maintenance from the ship to shore. Although the Navy acknowledges its  approach entails risk, the Navy has not specified what the potential  operational effects might be if its concept cannot be fully implemented as  envisioned. For example, the Navy has not specified potential negative  consequences to LCS missions or identified mitigating strategies if there  are not enough or insufficiently trained personnel on board or if the  distance support concepts cannot be fully implemented. The Navy\u2019s LCS  plans represent a significant investment to achieve its force structure goals  at a time when there are competing demands for limited resources.  However, without a thorough risk analysis including an assessment of  alternatives, the Navy faces undefined and, potentially significant  operational and program risks. If the operational concepts for personnel,  training, and maintenance cannot be implemented as desired, the Navy  may face operational limitations, may have to reengineer its operational  concept, or may have to make significant design changes to the ship after  committing to building almost half of the class. For example, a thorough  risk assessment could help the Navy identify the operational risks of a 40- person core crew, such as whether the crew can operate continuously for  a 30-day mission without undue fatigue. A risk assessment could assess  the alternatives such as the pros and cons of conducting shorter missions  or increasing the size of the crew. Having such a risk assessment would  enable decision makers to identify and assess: the operational effects if  these concepts cannot be implemented as envisioned; alternatives to  mitigate these risks; and information to link the effectiveness of these new  operational concepts with decisions on program investment, specifically  how many ships the Navy should buy each year.

DOD stated that the  Navy will prepare two cost estimates, one for each seaframe design, that  will include estimates of the total operating and support costs for the  entire class of LCS ships.  However, DOD stated that, since the Navy has  not released the solicitation for the fiscal year 2010-2014 buy, it is  premature to discuss the down-select criteria included in the solicitation.    While we appreciate the sensitivity of discussing criteria for the down- select prior to the release of the solicitation, we noted in the report that  operating and support costs are critical to any evaluation of acquisition  alternatives since these costs constitute over 70 percent of system life- cycle costs.  We continue to believe that decision makers should consider  long-term operating and support costs when deciding which of the two  seaframes to buy for the remainder of the program.  DOD also stated that  the LCS seaframe estimate we reviewed for the report was developed  solely to support trade study analysis and was not intended as a budget  quality estimate.  We understand this was the case, but the seaframe  estimate we analyzed was the only estimate available even though the  Navy has bought four LCS ships.

DOD\u2019s response  implies that, for the present, the department has decided to keep the two  non-selected LCS ships without considering the results of a complete  analysis of the costs and benefits of keeping the ships compared to other  alternatives.  As we point out in the report, it is important that estimates of  long-term operating and support costs are available to decision makers to  assess alternatives before a decision is made.
