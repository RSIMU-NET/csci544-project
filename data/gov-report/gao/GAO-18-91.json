In August 2017, OPM posted a web-based training course  for agency officials on special payment authorities and other flexibilities,  including examples of their use and resources for additional information.", "OPM has also pursued initiatives that focus attention on addressing  mission-critical skills gaps areas. As part of government-wide efforts to  develop and strengthen the cybersecurity workforce, in November 2016,  OPM issued a memorandum and guidance to CHCOs on strategic and  cost-effective use of the various flexibilities agencies may employ to  recruit and retain employees in cybersecurity positions. The guidance  included checklists of steps agencies need to complete to use various  special payment authorities, and described ways to combine use of  special payment authorities, when appropriate, to make federal agencies  more competitive in recruiting and retaining cybersecurity employees.", "OPM also formed Federal Agencies Skills Teams (FASTs) for  occupations as an effort to help agencies address mission-critical skills  gaps areas. As part of FASTs, OPM collected and reviewed information  from agencies on the root causes of skills gaps and found that  compensation levels play a role in skills gaps, in some cases. As of  August 2016, OPM\u2019s approach included a strategy to hold agencies  accountable for closing skills gaps in their MCOs, and to monitor metrics  and progress through fiscal year 2020. In January 2015, we reported that  the measures agencies had in place limited OPM and the CHCO  Council\u2019s ability to track progress in closing skills gaps government- wide.

Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government also state that management should obtain relevant  data from reliable sources that can be used to effectively monitor  programs. We have reported that understanding the relative  effectiveness of various flexibilities can help identify any changes needed  for agencies to more effectively use them. As we also recently reported,  collecting and using data to assess the effectiveness of authorities would  be a critical first step in making more strategic use of flexibilities to  effectively meet hiring needs.", "OPM collects agency data on the use of special payment authorities via  annual reporting on certain authorities and EHRI, but has not analyzed  whether the payment authorities help agencies to improve recruitment  and retention government-wide.

As required by statute,  OPM annually collects data from agencies to report to Congress on the  use of the student loan repayment and critical position pay authorities.", "Student loan repayment: OPM collects some information from  agencies about their use of student loan repayment authority and  invites agencies to provide details about their experiences in  administering the authority, but has not conducted an analysis of the  authority\u2019s effectiveness for addressing recruitment and retention  needs. As discussed previously, we analyzed the government-wide  use of this authority by occupation and identified those occupations  for which agencies most frequently used the authority (see figure 4).  In addition, we used OPM\u2019s 2015 report and information from its  FASTs skills gap initiative to identify the use of this authority for  MCOs. These are two examples of analyses that OPM could perform  to help understand how agencies are using this authority.", "Critical position pay: OPM collects data on agency use of critical  position pay from the agencies with existing OPM approval, but the  information does not help OPM understand how the payment authority  supports recruitment or retention. OPM collects data that it is required  by statute to report to Congress such as who received the higher rate  and the rate paid, but does not include information on the impact on  recruitment and retention.", "OPM has stopped regularly collecting and analyzing data for the 3R  incentives, except on the use of retention incentives for employees likely  to leave for other federal agencies, and does not collect and analyze data  for special rates, leaving a void for conducting government-wide analysis  that would help determine whether special payment authorities help  address agency recruitment and retention needs:", "3R incentives: In a February 2010 memorandum to agency CHCOs  on 3R incentives, OPM called for it and agencies to more actively  manage the program and track data. OPM said that validated data  would help OPM and agencies to understand the nature and trends of  use of the incentives and better track incentives on an ongoing basis.  OPM and agencies would also, if necessary, be better able to  investigate any 3R data anomalies and take corrective actions. Based  on its request to agencies in October 2011, OPM prepared a draft  report on its analysis of agency-provided data and information on use  of 3R incentives in calendar years 2010 and 2011, including what  agencies reported as barriers to using the authorities and whether 3R  improved recruitment and retention. However, OPM did not  distribute the report or take action on it. Although OPM said it  planned to conduct periodic reviews on an ongoing basis, since the  3R reporting requirement expired and OPM\u2019s October 2011 agency  data request, OPM does not regularly collect and review government- wide information on the level of use and potential barriers.", "Special rates: In conducting its annual review of special rates, each  year OPM asks that agencies review their respective applicable  special pay rate tables to determine whether the rates should be  terminated, reduced, or increased. OPM considers requests to make  changes based on the agency reviews, but according to OPM  officials, in recent years, agencies have not identified any needed  changes to special rates during that annual review process.", "Moreover, OPM has not used its EHRI data to better understand trends in  the use of these authorities government-wide and how agencies are using  them to address their recruitment and retention challenges. As an  example, we analyzed EHRI data to describe government-wide use of  selected authorities by occupational family in fiscal year 2014. From that  analysis, we identified differences in use across various occupational  families that could be helpful in understanding how agencies are using  these authorities. For example, we found that the Medical, Hospital,  Dental, and Public Health family was the top occupational family for four  of the five authorities. See appendix IV for additional information.", "OPM also has not explored trends in agency use of the critical position  pay authority. OPM has not pursued reasons why agencies have not  requested approval for over 750 available slots or why agencies have  used only 4 of the 36 authorized positions as of calendar year 2015. As  part of an initiative to close skills gaps for the STEM workforce, in October  2014, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, OPM,  and OMB identified the critical position pay authority as a potentially  underused flexibility. However, according to the 2015 OPM report, OPM  had authorized critical position pay for 36 positions in 10 agencies as of  calendar year 2015. And, only four of those agencies reported using the  critical position pay authority in 2015 for four current employees (see  table 6).", "In July 2017, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA) recommended that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pilot the  use of critical position pay authority to recruit highly-qualified experts to  lead IRS\u2019s cybersecurity and related specialized functions. According to  TIGTA, IRS would enhance its recruitment efforts by using the authority.  OPM officials attribute low use of critical position pay to: (1) agencies\u2019  views that the approval process is cumbersome; (2) management  resistance or cultural issues based on views about pay inequity between  employees, or employees receiving higher salaries than their managers;  and (3) agencies using other compensation flexibilities that do not require  prior OPM approval.", "OPM is not tracking government-wide data on the use of the range of  special payment authorities to better understand whether or how various  authorities improve recruitment and retention. OPM officials said the  information they collect on special payment authorities depends on  reporting requirements for the specific payment authority. For example,  they said they collect information on assessing the effectiveness of  student loan repayments because of the reporting requirements in the  law. However, the reporting requirement does not include assessments to  examine effectiveness or impediments to help OPM determine whether  potential changes may be needed to address recruitment and retention  challenges. Instead, OPM\u2019s annual data request memorandums invite  agencies to provide additional details on their experiences in  administering the student loan repayments.", "OPM officials said they may sometimes perform ad hoc analyses of EHRI  data on certain authorities but do not regularly analyze EHRI data on the  use of the various authorities government-wide. For example, OPM  officials said they have queried the EHRI database on the use of selected  special payment authorities for cybersecurity employees and found the  numbers of 3R incentives and agencies using them increased from fiscal  year 2015 to 2016, while use of student loan repayments decreased  during that period.

OPM stated that  tracking government-wide workforce data available to them will not  provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the special  payment authorities because agencies are in the best position to analyze  such information. We agree that agencies have first-hand information on  use of special payments. Agencies also have data that can inform  discussions between OPM and the CHCO Council on potential strategies  for a government-wide approach to enhance strategic use of these  authorities to address mission-critical skill gaps.

We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable to present agency use of special  payment authorities over this time period.", "To assess the extent to which CHCO agencies evaluate the effectiveness  of special payment authorities and to identify challenges they reported  facing in using the authorities, in our questionnaire to agencies we asked  about their views on the impacts of each authority used in fiscal years  2014-2016. We analyzed and summarized closed-ended question  response data agencies reported on authorities\u2019 impacts on agency  operations, including the extent of positive or negative effects in areas  such as employee retention, applicant quality, and ability to achieve the  agency mission. We also asked whether and how they assessed each  authority\u2019s effectiveness. We summarized closed-ended question  response data on whether agencies had done documented, informal, or  no effectiveness assessments of authorities in impact areas such as  agency mission, meeting staffing needs, or addressing mission-critical  skills gap areas. We contacted the 10 agencies that reported having  documented assessments for one or more authorities to request copies of  them. Nine agencies provided requested documents. We analyzed the  documents to determine the type of information they provided, including  whether they had information on how use of the authority had been  effective in the impacts the questionnaire asked about. To learn more  about agencies views on authorities\u2019 effectiveness, we also asked an  open-ended question for agencies to provide examples of how authorities  helped address mission-critical skills gaps. We reviewed the narratives  agencies provided to identify and report examples appropriate to illustrate  the various effects agencies reported.", "We also asked agencies about their views on any challenges they  experienced in using special payment authorities and potential changes  to operations or procedures to help improve effective use of authorities.  We analyzed and summarized the closed-ended question response data  agencies reported on how often they experienced certain challenges,  including insufficient resources, management resistance, burdensome  documentation, and complex approval process. For the two most  common challenges agencies reported other than insufficient resources\u2014 burdensome documentation and the complex approval process\u2014we  followed up with the three agencies that reported regularly or always  experiencing both challenges. Two agencies responded. We also asked  an open-ended question for agencies to provide narrative examples of  how they identified and responded to challenges in using these  authorities. We analyzed the content of the narrative responses to identify  and report examples appropriate to illustrate various challenges and  responses to challenges agencies reported.", "To learn more about agencies\u2019 experiences with OPM\u2019s approval  processes for special payment authorities, we analyzed OPM\u2019s data on  agency requests to use the special payment authorities that OPM  approves. In addition to our CHCO agency questionnaire response follow- up, we contacted selected agencies that OPM data identified as having  requested approval to use a special payment authority since 2009. We  asked seven agencies to provide narrative of their views on such topics  as what worked well, challenges experienced, and any suggestions for  improving the process. To provide an opportunity to learn how approval  processes could affect agency decisions to not seek such approvals, we  included two agencies\u2014EPA and HHS\u2014that had not made such  requests to ask for narrative explanations of why they had not sought  such approvals. All agencies provided their views. We analyzed  agencies\u2019 narrative responses to illustrate examples of the experiences  agencies reported.", "We also analyzed and summarized the closed-ended question response  data agencies reported on how likely potential changes would improve  use of special payment authorities. We followed up with five agencies that identified the three most common potential changes that would very likely  or certainly improve their ability to effectively use special pay authorities\u2014 changes to training for agency managers, training for agency human  resources employees, and OPM regulations. We asked them to provide  narrative descriptions of changes they had in mind and how changes  would improve their agency\u2019s effective use of special payment authorities.  Four agencies responded. We reviewed the narratives agencies  provided to identify examples appropriate to illustrate the various views  on potential changes agencies reported.", "To evaluate how OPM has helped agencies address federal recruitment  and retention needs, we interviewed OPM officials and reviewed OPM\u2019s  procedures to collect and analyze data on agency use of special payment  authorities, including through automated systems (EHRI) and information  requests and reporting. We reviewed the procedures to assess whether  OPM tracks data to assess the level and effective use of the payment  authorities to improve recruitment and retention. We also reviewed and  summarized the various ways OPM provides agencies information on  special payment authorities, including through OPM\u2019s memorandums,  opm.gov website tools and guidance on each special payment authority,  and guidance for using special payment authorities to address  cybersecurity skills gaps. We compared the types of information and  consistency of the various ways OPM provides information to promote the  strategic use of special payment authorities to include supporting agency  effectiveness assessments and increased awareness and strategic  decision making on the use special payment authorities. We reviewed  procedures to collect information on the use of critical position pay  authority and a July 2017 Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration report on the topic. We also interviewed OPM officials and  reviewed available documents on OPM\u2019s processes to review and  approve agencies\u2019 requests to use certain special payment authorities,  and analyzed OPM data to determine the average months it took OPM to  make approval decisions on CHCO agency requests received from  January 2009 through January 2017. We compared OPM\u2019s procedures  for collecting, analyzing, and providing information on the effective,  strategic use of special payment authorities, and its procedures for approving use of special payment authorities, to criteria identified in our  related reports on federal human capital management and in Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government, including standards that  agency management design and implement controls and document  procedures.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to December  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
