CHCOs reported using the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Executive Institute and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government most often. Agencies are required to maintain records of training plans, expenditures, activities, and (since 2006) to report training data to OPM. However, half of the CHCOs reported data to GAO that they deemed incomplete, or with limitations. For example, two agencies did not include travel related costs; one did not include costs for course materials; another did not include costs from all components. OPM officials agree that training cost data reported by agencies continues to be unreliable, and is probably lower than actual agency expenditures. OPM officials said they are meeting with agencies to address data deficiencies. However, OPM has not set interim milestones for meeting with agencies or established a timeframe to improve reporting. One leading practice is to establish such interim milestones and timeframes, in order to demonstrate progress towards achieving goals. By not establishing interim milestones and timeframes for improving the reliability of executive training cost data, OPM may be missing an opportunity to better position itself to hold agencies accountable for improving their data.", "Most CHCOs reported evaluating participant reaction and changing their training programs based on participant input, but fewer reported assessing training impact on agency mission. Agencies are required by statute and OPM implementing regulations to evaluate how well training programs contribute to mission accomplishment and performance goals. OPM is not sharing lessons learned from agencies that have experience assessing executive training impact on agency mission. However, OPM acknowledged that some agencies struggle with these evaluations; in response, OPM has issued guidance on the subject. CHCOs cited time, costs, and difficulty as reasons for not conducting the required evaluations and reported the need for additional OPM assistance. Eight agencies reported conducting these evaluations and may have lessons learned from which other agencies could benefit. For example, VA has a process for assessing the impact of executive training on its mission that it has used to make better training investment decisions.", "CHCOs identified opportunities for agencies and OPM to achieve efficiencies in executive training. CHCOs said agencies could (1) increase interagency cooperation by sharing training facilities and expanding eligibility to Senior Executive Service (SES) candidates from other agencies, and (2) implement or expand computer-based training. CHCOs also said OPM could, among other things, (1) help centralize training offerings by creating a centrally funded SES candidate development program, and (2) assist agencies in identifying programs open to other agencies and departments. By not assessing lessons learned and other efficiencies identified by agencies, OPM may be missing an opportunity to better position agencies to achieve these efficiencies in executive training.", "Career SES and SES candidates generally said external executive training is useful and valuable, but suggested that it would be more cost-effective for the government to negotiate prices as a large-scale buyer, versus individual agencies purchasing training."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OPM (1) establish interim milestones for meeting with agencies to address training data deficiencies and establish time frames for improving the reliability of agency data, (2) share information and examples of how agencies have evaluated the impact of executive training on agency mission and goals, and (3) assess potential efficiencies identified by agencies for possible government-wide implementation.

The Senior Executive Service (SES), the government\u2019s most senior-level  career leaders, is relatively small\u2014about 7,000 members in 2012\u2014and  represents less than one percent of the over two million federal civilian  employees. Underscoring the importance of high-value executive training,  the Partnership for Public Service recently reported on weaknesses in  talent development for the SES pipeline, and the need to ensure effective  leadership in these positions. The federal government annually spends  millions of dollars on executive training programs administered by training  providers external to federal agencies, in order to provide its senior  leaders with the necessary skills to fulfill their agencies\u2019 missions. These  programs can range widely in both duration and costs, from a four-hour  session at a cost of $200 per federal employee to a four-week program  costing over $20,000 or more per federal employee.

We obtained agency executive  training cost data from 26 of the 27 CHCO Council agencies and  compared these data to training cost data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human  Resources Integration (EHRI) training database. We assessed the  reliability of related cost elements in OPM\u2019s training database based on  reviews of our prior work on federal training investments, testing of  agency data collected by OPM, and interviews conducted with OPM  officials. We also assessed the reliability of executive training participant  and cost data provided by agencies by examining the data for obvious  errors and inconsistencies, and by querying 10 agencies to better  understand the data systems each agency used to collect and report such  data, as well as the quality of data entered into their system(s). We  interviewed five external providers used by CHCO Council agencies to  collect information on executive training offered by these providers. To  answer the second question, we selected three agencies\u2014Department of  Energy (Energy), Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014to obtain illustrative examples of how they  approached, implemented and evaluated the effectiveness of executive  training. We selected these agencies based on workforce size, number of  career SES, total training costs, types of evaluations conducted to  measure effectiveness of executive training, and whether agencies  identified potential opportunities for achieving efficiencies in executive  training.", "To answer the third question, we analyzed responses to our  questionnaire from agencies, analyzed OPM and agency executive  training policies, procedures, and practices, and interviewed agency  human capital officials to identify potential efficiencies. We examined  how, if at all, OPM, the CHCO Council, and the Chief Learning Officers  (CLO) Council (made up of chief learning officers from the 27 agencies)  share information on potential efficiencies by interviewing OPM officials  and members of the CHCO Council and the CLO Council.

If agencies  establish these training programs, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3396(b) states that OPM is  required to assist agencies in the establishment of such programs and  monitor their implementation. In accordance with this, OPM has issued  regulations on training and management development. For example, in  2006 OPM issued a regulation requiring agencies to report training  expenditures to OPM through the government-wide electronic reporting  system. Executive Order No. 11348 (issued in 1967 and later amended  by Executive Order No. 12107 in 1978) further requires OPM to assist  agencies in developing sound programs and financial plans for training  and to provide advice, information, and assistance to agencies on  planning, programming, budgeting, operating, and evaluating training  programs.

Since 2006, OPM has required agencies to report training data to OPM  monthly via OPM\u2019s EHRI system. OPM\u2019s Guide to Human Resources  Reporting states that these data should include training materials cost,  per diem cost, travel cost, and tuition and fees. Further, federal financial  accounting standards state that reliable information on the costs of  federal programs or activities is crucial for effective management of  government operations; federal financial accounting standards also state  that Congress needs cost information to evaluate program performance,  to make program authorization decisions, and to compare alternative  courses of action.", "External providers employed different approaches for executive training,  which had different cost implications. Based on external providers\u2019 views,  the cost of individual executive education training courses can vary  greatly among external providers due to a variety of factors, including  location of training, length of training, and whether courses are tailored to  meet the mission and goals of a particular agency. For example, VA\u2019s  Leading EDGE (Executives Driving Government Excellence) program  offers half-day executive training workshops to all agencies where  employees can participate either in person or online. The workshops can  serve from about 300 to over 700 participants. According to Leading  EDGE\u2019s executive director, the annual cost for Leading EDGE is about  $850 per participant without coaching and $2,100 per participant with  coaching.

All 26 of the agency CHCOs that  responded to our questionnaire provided data on executive training  administered by external providers; however, half of the agencies  reported that the data they provided were incomplete, and in some cases,  had limitations. In addition, during our review, agency officials from 4 of  the 26 agencies asked us to clarify the cost data we requested, noting  that training cost data are not always readily available within their  agencies. They explained that in order to respond to our data request, in  some cases they would have to manually retrieve paper documents and  tabulate the costs. Moreover, the agencies provided data that included  different cost components. For example, one agency reported that it did  not include costs for course materials. Two other agencies reported that  they did not include costs for travel, lodging, or per diem. Other CHCO  agencies cited additional problems with tracking and summarizing costs  paid to external providers of executive education. For example, one  agency reported experiencing challenges in tracking training costs  agency-wide. According to agency officials, they were unable to  completely (or 100 percent) accurately track training costs across the  department because of the multiple, incompatible learning management  systems that the department uses to track training throughout the  agency. In addition, they stated that the agency\u2019s practices for tracking  training data are inconsistent within the agency because agency  components do not always report training completed with external  providers to the agency\u2019s shared training database system. Another  agency said its agency-wide training data were incomplete and unreliable  because its internal training and financial tracking systems were  incompatible with each other. In light of all these factors, agencies are  likely underreporting the amount they spent on executive training.", "In our interviews with Energy, Treasury, and VA, the CHCOs (or their  representatives) reported that their agencies track and report training cost  data to OPM in various formats, some automated and some manual.  However, the three agencies reported facing challenges tracking cost  data. Energy reported that executive training reporting is not consistent  across the agency because many Energy components have direct  funding streams from Congress and schedule their own training  programs; thus, they do not always report training completed with  external providers to Energy\u2019s Office of Human Capital. Moreover,  because Energy\u2019s Office of Human Capital has no direct access to  component organization records, the CHCO cannot ensure that all of  Energy\u2019s funded and administered training programs are tracked and  reported to EHRI and OPM; in addition, Energy\u2019s CHCO cannot identify  whether executive training is reported to OPM by a component  organization in a separate report or with other line item reporting of  completed training. However, the cost and delivery of Energy\u2019s SES  candidate development program and its executive training provided  centrally by Energy\u2019s Office of Human Capital is normally tracked and  reported on an annual basis although Energy has not had any recent  centrally funded executive learning activities. Treasury and VA also  reported difficulties in collecting and tracking reliable executive training  data. Treasury reported that some of its individual bureaus were  challenged by our request to provide executive training cost data because  the costs had to be identified by a manual review of financial transaction  listings. They stated that part of the reason the costs were difficult to pull  together is that the training costs were not reported via OPM\u2019s Standard  Form 182\u2014which is used to collect and document training information for  inclusion in participants\u2019 employee records and the EHRI database.  Treasury officials explained that much of its reported executive training  was done by contract and was not procured by either the individual or the  individual offices that would normally complete the training form. As a  result, Treasury enlisted multiple sources to pull the data together at each  of the agency\u2019s bureaus. Treasury officials reported that the agency is  working internally to determine how to track this information at the  department level. VA reported two issues with its electronic reporting of  data to EHRI: inconsistent recording of overall training cost data in its  training management system, and incompatibility between VA\u2019s learning  management system and EHRI.", "We found discrepancies between the data for external executive training  costs that agencies submitted to us and the data from OPM\u2019s EHRI. In  most instances where we identified discrepancies, the cost information  that agencies provided to us was higher than the cost total from OPM\u2019s  EHRI. Table 3 provides illustrative examples of discrepancies in cost  information.", "OPM officials agreed that agencies have challenges collecting and  reporting costs for executive training through the EHRI database, and as  a result, executive training cost data in EHRI is probably lower than actual  agency expenditures. OPM officials explained that although agencies  have taken steps recently to improve their reporting of training data, some  agencies continue to struggle with the reporting requirements, in part  because these agencies\u2019 learning management systems are not  compatible with OPM\u2019s EHRI. For these agencies, reports on training  costs require manual uploading because some agencies cannot  sufficiently aggregate training information at the sub-agency level. In  September 2012, we reported on the weaknesses of training cost data  that agencies report to OPM and found that several agencies were unable  to collect reliable training cost data from components, due to multiple  incompatible learning management systems and to inconsistent practices  in tracking training cost data, such as the use of inconsistent coding  schemes for tracking similar training activities. We recommended, among  other things, that OPM (1) work with the CHCO Council to improve the  reliability of agency training investment information, and (2) provide  regular report summaries to agencies on EHRI training investment data  and reliability. OPM agreed to work with agency CHCOs to continue to  strengthen the use of the Standard Form 182 and to increase reliability of  their training data; further, OPM stated that it would provide regular  summaries to agencies on the training investment data submitted to OPM  in order to improve transparency. However, OPM stated that these  summaries will not directly lead to improved reliability of the data and  explained that agencies must take action to improve the data to positively  impact data reliability.", "OPM officials told us that they provide assistance and guidance for  federal training efforts but because current training data is unreliable,  OPM officials said they have not used it to inform their training guidance  and assistance to agencies. OPM officials stated that they do not believe  they have a viable way to enforce reporting requirements for training data.  However, OPM has avenues, such as interagency councils, that can help  them assist agencies with fulfilling their reporting obligations. For  example, during 2013, OPM officials reported that they, in collaboration  with the Chief Learning Officers Council, created an interagency group to  develop quality standards and desired reporting data elements to help  agencies collect the right information and to make informed training  decisions, but as of September 2012, the interagency group has not  established any timeframes for completing this effort. OPM reported that  as of October 2013, the working group is moving forward on a project to  develop guidance on prioritizing and ranking federal training investments  that will support a broader effort to develop a single standardized process  for prioritizing training investments. In addition, OPM officials told us they  have been meeting separately with CHCO Council agencies to discuss  each agency\u2019s training data reported to OPM and any deficiencies noted  by OPM. OPM believes this will help rectify situations where agencies are  unable to report training data\u2014among other types of data\u2014accurately,  completely, and in a timely fashion. OPM officials said that they also plan  to meet with smaller agencies for these same purposes.", "However, OPM has not established interim milestones for the completion  of these planned meetings with agencies to address training data  deficiencies, nor has OPM set timeframes for agencies to have a plan in  place for improving the completeness and reliability of agency data on  executive training costs. One leading transformation practice is to  establish milestones and timeframes to demonstrate progress towards  achieving goals.

Five agencies reported using post-course surveys given to supervisors or  participants to measure if what was learned affected the participants\u2019  behavior. For example, one agency requested that managers and  mentors of Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program  (SESCDP) candidates fill out a questionnaire about the impact and value  of the program for their candidate; this questionnaire included to what  degree the candidate applied lessons learned in the program toward their  developmental assignments.", "Twenty of the twenty-six agency CHCOs said they changed their  executive training program as the result of evaluations. Six agencies  reported they revised their program\u2019s content and logistics as a result of  feedback. For example, VA reported that it reorganized its training  schedule to add subjects that its senior executives wanted included.  Other agencies reported they expanded the program based on participant  feedback. For example, one agency expanded the number of leadership  development programs offered, while a second agency increased the  number and types of training opportunities available for executives in  order to increase participation in executive training.

OPM\u2019s  Training Evaluation Field Guide provides information on methodologies  for conducting training evaluations with the goal of identifying cost  effective training initiatives that maximize mission accomplishments. The  guide is based on the Kirkpatrick model of evaluation, a popular model of  evaluation that includes measuring (1) participant reaction to the training  program; (2) changes in employees\u2019 skills, knowledge, or abilities; (3)  changes in employees\u2019 behavior or performance; and (4) the impact of  the training on program or organizational results, which may be split into a  fifth level that includes a return on investment assessment that compares  training costs to derived benefits.", "Similarly, our guidance on assessing training states that to measure the  real impact of training, agencies need to move beyond data on inputs and  outputs by developing additional indicators that help to determine how  training contributes to the accomplishment of agency goals and  objectives. The traditional approach of collecting and reporting data  related to training and development often involves indicators that can be  readily quantified, such as the number of employees trained, training  hours per employee, and total training hours. While necessary, these  kinds of measures do not fully provide agencies with the kind of  information they need to determine how training efforts contributed to  improved performance, to reduced costs, or to a greater capacity to meet  new and emerging transformation challenges.", "Two of the agencies we interviewed, Treasury and VA, were among those  who reported in their questionnaires that they measured the impact of  executive training on the agency\u2019s performance goals and mission. VA  uses various assessment measures to evaluate effectiveness against  VA\u2019s overall mission and the VA Secretary\u2019s strategic objectives for  accomplishing transformation: VA reported that these measures have led  to better training investment decisions. For example, VA includes post- course requirements for its Strategic Leadership Course II \u2013 Basic, which  is focused on providing its senior executives with tools to support  strategic decision-making, critical thinking, and leading and driving  change. Approximately 30 days after the training, class participants are  asked to provide their \u201cah ha\u201d moment from the training, with regard to  their leadership style or techniques; approximately 90 days after the  training, participants are asked how they have been able to apply the  concepts from the executive training to their agency\u2019s organization or  mission. Sometimes specific questions of interest are substituted, such as  recommendations on strategic challenge questions for future classes, or  requests for programs or resources that they need to better accomplish  their mission as strategic leaders. A second requirement may be  assigned at the post 90-day training point. This requirement usually asks  the participants to explain how they have applied lessons taken from the  training to their organization or mission. Additionally, the agency provides  assessment data to a team of program analysts at the VA Learning  University who periodically provide the agency with feedback on the  effectiveness of the program. According to VA, the evaluation tends to  focus on the impact of training on agency mission and strategic goals,  and also on return on investment; the evaluation also includes specific  examples where senior executives applied what they gained at the  training and applied it to their mission in the VA. Treasury officials  explained that while it would be hard to isolate when training by itself  contributes to an individual meeting an agency\u2019s goal, by aligning all of its  programs to the department\u2019s strategic plan and to the executive core  qualifications (ECQ), they are ensuring the training support the agency\u2019s  goals.", "CHCO agencies recognized the importance of evaluating the impact of  training on their mission but emphasized the difficulty in conducting these  types of evaluations. For example, two agencies reported needing  additional assistance from OPM for these types of activities, such as  centralized evaluation information on the performance of external  providers. In addition, we previously found that some agencies found it  difficult to conduct these evaluations because their cost and time  demands can be significant. OPM acknowledged that some agencies  struggle with evaluating training programs. OPM reported that it has  developed and published regulations related to training evaluation.   According to OPM, these regulations were developed to enhance the  impact of training on agency mission accomplishment. The regulations  generally relate to training planning, execution, and demonstration of  value. However, OPM is not sharing lessons learned from agencies that  reported having assessed the impact of executive training on agency  missions. Given that less than half of the CHCO agencies reported they  are evaluating the impact of executive training on their missions, sharing  lessons learned in its oversight role could help OPM better position the  other CHCO agencies for conducting such evaluations.", "We recognize that higher levels of evaluation (such as evaluating the  impact on organization performance or the return on investment) can be  challenging to conduct because of the difficulty and costs associated with  data collection and the complexity of directly linking training and  development programs to improved individual and organizational  performance. However, eight agencies that responded to our  questionnaire (and that are also members of the CHCO Council) reported  that they have conducted these evaluations and may have lessons  learned from which other agencies could benefit. According to GAO  guidance on evaluating training, factors to consider when deciding the  appropriate level of evaluation include estimated costs of the training  effort, size of the training audience, management interest, program  visibility, and the anticipated life span of the effort. The guidance also  states that each agency consider the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of  conducting these in-depth evaluations, along with budgetary and staffing  circumstances that may limit the agency\u2019s ability to complete such  evaluations. Without conducting higher levels of evaluation, agencies  are missing information that could help them make more effective training  investment decisions; in addition, OPM is missing the opportunity to  assist agencies in fully understanding the benefits of executive training on  the continued development of senior executives and on the agency\u2019s  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CHCOs Identified Opportunities for Agencies and OPM to Achieve Efficiencies in Executive Training", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opportunities Include Using Virtual Training and Centralizing Training", "paragraphs": ["Twenty of twenty-six agency CHCOs responding to our questionnaire  said they identified opportunities for achieving efficiencies in delivering  executive training within their respective agencies.

As we  previously concluded, efforts to identify cost-effective and robust options  for designing training and development programs may include use of in- house staff, such as senior executives, based on their capability to  implement training.", "Four CHCOs said they are considering implementing or expanding  computer-based training, such as use of webinars, online books, virtual  \u201cexecutive summits\u201d with developmental sessions and strategic meetings  for executives, and other online training programs used for executive  development. One CHCO also said his agency is considering use of  blended learning activities\u2014which incorporate classroom-based and  computer-based training\u2014to maximize impact and cost-effectiveness.  This is consistent with leading practices for training investments.  Specifically, one such practice calls for comparing the merits of different  methods of delivery\u2014such as classroom or computer-based training\u2014 and determining what mix of mechanisms to use to ensure efficient and  cost-effective delivery. Another leading practice is for agencies to  consider blended learning that combines different teaching methods (e.g.,  Web-based and instructor-led) within the same training effort and  provides trainees with the flexibilities to choose among different training  delivery methods, while leveraging resources in the most efficient way  possible.", "In our interviews with selected agencies, Treasury officials reported they  are working to centralize training for all Treasury executives through the  Treasury Executive Institute (TEI) in an attempt to enhance Treasury\u2019s  return on investment for organizational performance and to provide more  consistency for mission-critical leadership training. Treasury officials said  they could use TEI to leverage training resources throughout the  department, with a goal of providing \u201cjust-in-time\u201d training to senior  executives, rather than requiring them to set aside their normal job  responsibilities for a number of months to attend training. Treasury  officials told us the agency is in the beginning stages of obtaining OPM  approval for an agency-wide SESCDP, which would allow Treasury to  train executives from all of its components and would help Treasury fill  vacant SES positions agency-wide. Treasury officials said they are likely  to operate the proposed agency-wide SESCDP alongside the Internal  Revenue Service\u2019s SESCDP\u2014the only SESCDP currently in operation  within Treasury. Treasury\u2019s efforts to centralize SES candidate training is  consistent with a leading practice related to identifying the most  appropriate mix of centralized and decentralized approaches for an  agency\u2019s training and development programs. In particular, centralizing  design can enhance consistency of training content and offer potential  cost savings through standardized record keeping and simplified and  more accurate reporting on courses, certifications, educational  attainment, costs, or standards.", "VA officials said they performed after action reviews on and made  changes to their Strategic Leadership Course II \u2013 Basic course for career  SES members within VA. Based on the reviews and subsequent changes  to its executive training program, VA officials negotiated a new price  structure from the course vendor to deliver the training at a lower cost in  2013 than if they had used the course\u2019s 2012 price structure. We  previously concluded that agencies can use evaluation feedback to  identify problems and improve training and development programs as  needed. Based on modifications to its executive training programs from  after action reviews, VA was also able to reduce program costs, thus  increasing the efficiency of training delivery.", "Further, 20 of 26 agency CHCOs said they found opportunities for  achieving efficiencies government-wide. For instance, some CHCOs said  agencies can increase interagency cooperation on executive training by  sharing space in training seminars with other agencies, and allowing  admission of SES candidates from other federal agencies into training  programs such as SESCDPs. Treasury officials we interviewed said they  actively market shared training services to the rest of the government  through TEI. Energy told us the agency produces a catalog on a semi- annual basis with real-time information on leadership development  courses and programs located throughout the country; according to  Energy officials, government officials could use the catalog to reduce  travel and per diem costs for executive seminars conducted around the  nation by identifying equivalent training that is available locally for senior  executives. Additionally, several CHCOs said their agencies used VA\u2019s  Leading EDGE program to deliver executive training. One CHCO offered  to share training facilities with other agencies. However, one CHCO noted  that courses sponsored by OPM and VA raised the possibility of  redundancy in executive training delivery provided by the two agencies.  According to our guide for assessing strategic training and development  efforts, agencies can try to achieve economies of scale and avoid  duplication of effort when assessing training delivery options by taking  advantage of existing course content or training, such as sharable online  courseware or multiagency training programs. Specifically, interagency  training can help address common developmental needs government- wide and promote cost-efficiency while taking advantage of existing  resources rather than creating similar programs in multiple agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CHCOs Reported OPM Can Help Agencies by Offering More Lower Cost or No Cost Training and by Centralizing Training Offerings", "paragraphs": ["CHCOs from agencies responding to our questionnaire reported that  OPM can take several steps to help both the federal government and  individual agencies deliver executive training more efficiently. First, some  agency CHCOs said that OPM should provide more training to senior  executives government-wide that is free or lower cost to agencies. One  CHCO noted that OPM could provide lower or no cost executive  development opportunities to agencies by more effectively using  technology to deliver virtual training. This would be consistent with  leading training practices comparing the merits of different delivery  vehicles, such as classroom or computer-based training, in order to  assess what vehicles to use for ensuring efficient and cost-effective  delivery. OPM officials said that agencies cannot avoid training costs, but  OPM is trying to reduce agency training costs by bringing courses closer  to agency offices and by using free space for training rather than renting  sites. OPM has also developed free and fee-based training solutions for  use government-wide, and hosts speaker series and meta-leadership  courses for senior executives.", "Second, agency CHCOs said that OPM could take steps to help  centralize training offerings for senior executives, such as creating a  centrally funded SESCDP, and could coordinate joint training efforts  among agencies. For example, according to one CHCO, OPM could take  steps to encourage agencies to fill paid-for, but unfilled seats for  executive training programs across agency lines. CHCOs also said that  OPM could assist agencies in locating executive training programs open  to other agencies and departments, and provide a central source for  listing executive development opportunities throughout the federal  government. An example of this type of executive training program is the  Leading EDGE program administered by VA. This program is operated by  a senior executive within VA and offers executive training to agencies  across the federal government. According to the program\u2019s deputy  director, 17 federal agencies are participating in Leading EDGE training.  Treasury\u2019s TEI is another example of a shared service model that  presents an opportunity to leverage resources across the government.  According to Treasury, TEI serves 9 other bureaus and agencies in  addition to Treasury. Our guide for assessing training practices previously  found that centralizing design of training programs can, among other  things, offer potential cost savings.", "OPM officials agree they could centralize training offerings for senior  executives. For instance, OPM hosted the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence\u2019s (ODNI) suite of 12 courses detailing the full  performance management cycle; in turn, OPM\u2019s Human Resources  University (HR University) made them available for use by other  agencies, and OPM officials said they incurred savings of about $46  million in 11/2 years. In terms of coordinating joint training efforts among  agencies, OPM officials said they collaborate with the CLO Council, the  CHCO Council, and federal agencies to provide joint training. For  example, OPM collaborates with VA to implement the Leading EDGE  program for use by many agencies. OPM officials also suggested that  federal agencies use additional FEI courses\u2014and to reimburse FEI for  implementing such courses through user fees\u2014so it could become the  federal government\u2019s primary source for executive training. As mentioned  earlier, sharing online courseware and implementing multiagency training  programs can help agencies try to achieve economies of scale while  avoiding duplication of effort in designing executive training courses that  address similar content as existing courses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Reports Taking Additional Actions to Improve Training Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["OPM officials noted they are taking additional steps to increase training  efficiencies beyond what agency CHCOs suggested. Attributes of  effective training include planning training that considers government- wide reforms and other targeted initiatives to improve management and  performance, as well as administration priorities, legislative reforms, and  major management challenges. In response to our September 2012  recommendation on federal training investment practices, OPM officials  said the agency is working with the CLO Council to draft a government- wide mandatory training curriculum and finish plans to implement a pilot  course for mandatory training. OPM officials also said the agency is  working with CLO Council representatives to standardize elements of  federal executive training programs by developing a framework for  supervisory and managerial leadership development. The supervisory  framework has been distributed to agencies. According to OPM officials,  senior executives and other managers can use the supervisory training  framework to identify learning objectives they need to achieve, and then  target the right job assignments and training courses to address the  objectives. OPM officials said agencies are not required to use the  framework to develop their executive training programs; however, some  agencies are using the framework as a \u201croadmap\u201d for aligning their  training programs.", "In November 2012, OPM also released its Executive Development Best  Practices guide, which includes key themes and recommendations OPM  identified as hallmarks of successful executive development efforts  across the public and private sectors. OPM has also developed a training  and development webpage where agency officials can find and share  products and courses for all areas of learning and development.  However, the webpage does not describe examples of agency efforts to  achieve efficiencies in delivering executive training.", "OPM\u2019s efforts so far to work with agencies to identify efficiencies for  executive training have been relatively broad-based; while OPM has  taken steps to increase efficiencies, it does not have a process for  assessing lessons learned from agencies about potential efficiencies in  executive training that other agencies could implement. Our questionnaire  results suggest that OPM can use its oversight role to take additional  steps to assess and promote ways agencies can achieve efficiencies in  executive training that have government-wide application.

The candidate said such relationships  helped training participants hold each other accountable in their  executive assignments, which can be a tremendous benefit to  organizations.", "Participants develop better responses to customer and  stakeholder needs. Multiple participants said relationships they  established in executive training helped them collaborate to resolve  customer issues. For example, two participants from different  components in one agency said they developed a relationship during  executive training that enabled them to work together to provide  financial relief to an agency customer without using additional agency  resources. Another participant noted he completed a $400 million  project with another agency before a scheduled deadline, based on  trust and relationships he previously built with fellow participants in an  SESCDP.", "Participation promotes interaction and relationship building with  senior leadership to address organizational issues.

Over 7 years  have elapsed since agencies were required to report training cost data to  OPM, and many agencies are not yet accurately and completely reporting  this information. For corrective actions OPM has already initiated,  establishing milestones could help ensure that efforts progress as  intended. Moreover, by not establishing a timeframe for improving the  reliability of executive training cost data, OPM may be missing an  opportunity to better position itself to hold agencies accountable for  improving the data. Improving the overall reliability of the data would  better position OPM and the agencies to make sound decisions on  training investments.", "Half of the CHCOs reported they do not have complete information on the  cost of executive training provided by external training providers.  Moreover, many agency CHCOs struggle to conduct evaluations that  identify the impact of training on organizational performance and agency  mission, although a few CHCO agencies reported conducting such  evaluations. OPM has not used interagency councils to share lessons  learned from agencies that have experience with assessing executive  training\u2019s impact on agency missions.

For the third agency, which did not have recent SES  candidates at the time we selected our focus group, we also conducted  two focus groups: one representing early career SES members who  completed a basic agency leadership course, and one representing mid-  to late-career SES members who completed an advanced agency  leadership course. The insights gained from the discussions were not  generalizeable to all career SES and SES candidates within participants\u2019  agencies or to the federal government as a whole.", "We also collected documentation from and interviewed OPM officials  involved in the agency\u2019s oversight function for federal training activities in  order to obtain information on their roles and responsibilities in monitoring  agency training programs, on their perspectives on executive training  government-wide, and on steps they have taken to improve training  efficiencies. We examined how, if at all, OPM, the CHCO Council, and the  Chief Learning Officers Council (made up of chief learning officers from  the 27 agencies) share information on potential efficiencies by  interviewing OPM officials and members of the CHCO Council and the  Chief Learning Officers Council. We interviewed five external training  providers who were most frequently used by CHCO Council agencies, to  collect information on executive training course offerings, costs, and  evaluation strategies; however, the collected information is not  generalizeable to all external providers. We also interviewed officials  from the Partnership for Public Service and Booz Allen Hamilton who had  relevant expertise in federal leadership training activities in order to obtain  information on prior studies of executive training, and on their  perspectives about evaluating the effectiveness of executive training.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2012 to December  2013, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Signora May (Assistant Director),  Clifton G.
