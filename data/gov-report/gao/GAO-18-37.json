Specifically, GAO estimated that the allowance rate could vary by as much as 46 percentage points if different judges heard a typical claim (one that was average in all other factors GAO analyzed). SSA officials said that this level of variation is not surprising, given the complexity of appeals and judicial discretion. Nonetheless, the variation declined by 5 percentage points between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 (see figure), a change officials attributed to enhanced quality assurance efforts and training for judges. GAO also identified various factors that were associated with a greater chance that a claimant would be allowed benefits. In addition to characteristics related to disability criteria, such as the claimant's impairment and age, GAO found that claimants who had representatives, such as an attorney or family member, were allowed benefits at a rate nearly 3 times higher than those without representatives. Other factors did not appear related to allowance rates, such as the percentage of backlogged claims in a hearing office.", "SSA has various reviews to monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions by administrative law judges, but some of these reviews may overlap and SSA has not systematically evaluated them. Specifically, SSA conducts five types of quality assurance reviews of hearings decisions, several of which have similar goals and may look at similar claims. SSA has not evaluated the efficiency or effectiveness of these reviews, despite spending at least $11 million on them in fiscal year 2016. Moreover, the agency has struggled to sustain all of its quality reviews due to competing priorities\u2014two of the five reviews were curtailed in 2016 because SSA reassigned staff to help expedite claims decisions.

First, SSA determines if a claimant is working and screens out  (denies) claimants who earn over a specified amount. Second, SSA  determines whether the claimant has an impairment severe enough to  significantly limit his or her ability to do basic work activities and expected  to last more than 12 months or result in death, and denies claimants who  do not meet these criteria. At the third step, SSA determines whether a  claimant\u2019s impairment meets or is equivalent to an impairment listed in  SSA\u2019s Listings of Impairments. If a claimant \u201cmeets\u201d or \u201cequals\u201d one of the  listed impairments, they are allowed benefits.

In 2000, 29  percent of decisions were made at steps 4 and 5, according to an SSA  report.

If the claimant is dissatisfied with the reconsideration, he or she  may request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). In one of  several initiatives to improve the disability determination process, SSA  has eliminated the reconsideration step of the process in 10 states,  allowing the claimant to appeal the initial decision directly to an ALJ. In  fiscal year 2016, claimants appealed more than 698,000 decisions to the  hearings level, and SSA issued more than 637,000 dispositions (including  allowances, denials, and dismissals).

The ALJ reviews the claimant\u2019s file, including any additional  evidence the claimant submitted after the initial determination, and  generally conducts a hearing. At the hearing, the ALJ may hear testimony  from the claimant, medical experts on the claimant\u2019s medical condition,  and vocational experts regarding the claimant\u2019s past work and jobs  currently available in significant numbers in the national economy.

We defined the \u201callowance rate\u201d for each judge as the  number of claims in which a judge granted the claimant Disability  Insurance (DI) and/or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits  divided by the total number of decisions issued by the judge (excluding  claims that were dismissed).

These factors  included characteristics of claimants, judges, and hearing offices, as well  as other factors such as the unemployment rates in a claimant\u2019s state,  that could otherwise explain differences in allowance rates. Specifically,  for the years 2007 through 2015 combined, our analysis estimated that  the allowance rate would vary by 46 percentage points for a typical  claim, depending on the judge who heard the case. For example, we  estimated that the allowance rate for a typical claim heard by a judge with  low allowance rates would be 42 percent, compared to 88 percent for a  judge with high allowance rates. This estimated range fell from 50  percentage points in 2007 to 45 percentage points in 2015 (see fig. 5).  (Appendix I describes this statistical analysis in more detail.)", "Allowance rates also varied across hearing offices during the same time  period, but this variation was considerably smaller than the variation  across judges in every year. The estimated range across the entire period  was 19 percentage points across hearing offices (see fig. 6), compared  to a 46 percentage-point estimated range across judges. Accounting for  differences in allowance rates across offices ensured that the variation  across judges did not reflect characteristics of their offices (such as the  types or severity of disability claims received by their offices).", "SSA officials noted that the variation in allowance rates we observed  across judges was not surprising, nor was the modest narrowing in this  range over time. Administrative law judges usually hear complex appeals  that may not be clear-cut allowances or denials. As a result, according to  SSA officials, given judges\u2019 decisional independence, different judges  could look at cases with similar fact patterns and circumstances and  come to different conclusions. At the same time, officials also pointed to  several factors potentially related to the modest narrowing in the range of  allowance rates. First, they noted that SSA started conducting quality  assurance reviews of a random sample of allowances in 2011\u2014 previously, such cases were not reviewed. In addition, they said that  Social Security\u2019s disability programs and administrative law judges were  under increased public and Congressional scrutiny following a high-profile  fraud case in 2011 involving a judge and an attorney representative.  Further, officials said that the expanding use of electronic case files and  data analytics within SSA made it possible for the agency to enhance  monitoring of decision-making and share this information with judges.  Finally, while SSA cannot direct judges to decide cases in a particular  way, officials suggested that some judges may have \u201cself-corrected\u201d their  approach to decision-making, given all of these factors.", "Our multivariate analyses had some limitations, but it provides more  information than simple comparisons in allowance rates across judges.  For example, the SSA data we used for this analysis do not include a  measure of the severity of a claimant\u2019s impairment or their remaining  ability to work, which could help explain why one claim with a particular  impairment was allowed while another was denied. The data also do not  include a standardized measure for the nature of claimants\u2019 prior work  (such as the skill level or extent of physical labor), which is also relevant  for the disability decision. Nevertheless, our multivariate analysis enabled  us to compare allowance rates across judges and hearing offices for  typical claims. In addition, SSA\u2019s practice of assigning cases randomly  to judges makes it more likely that the remaining variation we found  across judges reflects the unique effect of having a particular judge hear  a case, rather than other factors. As a result, even though we could not  account for all factors that could explain differences in allowance rates,  random assignment increases the chances that such factors were similar  across all of the cases heard by individual judges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Numerous Factors, Particularly Those Representing SSA\u2019s Disability Criteria, Are Associated with Variation in Allowance Rates", "paragraphs": ["Although variation in allowance rates persisted across judges, even after  controlling for certain factors, many of the factors we identified had  meaningful associations with the chance that a claimant was allowed  benefits. These factors represent criteria in SSA\u2019s disability decision- making process, such as the claimant\u2019s age, impairment, prior work, and  education. We also identified factors that did not have such  associations.", "Certain claimant characteristics\u2014such as older ages or certain  impairments\u2014were associated with higher allowance rates.", "Age: Claimants\u2019 chances of being allowed benefits increased with  age, even holding constant other factors. For example, a 55-year-old  claimant was allowed benefits at a rate 4.3 times higher than a typical  35-year-old claimant. This association is consistent with Social  Security\u2019s vocational guidelines, which are generally more lenient for  older claimants. As part of SSA\u2019s five-step process to determine  eligibility for adult disability benefits, SSA uses a set of rules to  evaluate how a claimant\u2019s age, education, and work experience affect  their remaining capacity for work. SSA\u2019s criteria vary across four  primary age groups\u201445-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60 and older. The  criteria are less stringent for claimants in older age groups than they  are for younger claimants, because the rules assume that individuals  at older ages may be less able to transition to other work.", "Impairment: Certain impairments were also strongly associated with  the chance of being allowed benefits (see fig. 7). For example,  claimants with primary impairments recorded in SSA\u2019s data of heart  failure or multiple sclerosis were allowed benefits at rates 4.2 and 5  times higher, respectively, than typical claimants with asthma. From  fiscal years 2007 through 2015, the allowance rates for claimants with  heart failure or multiple sclerosis were 78 and 80 percent,  respectively, compared to 44 percent for asthma.", "Critical or terminal case: Claimants with critical or terminal cases  were allowed benefits at a rate 1.4 times higher than a typical  claimant without a critical or terminal case. Critical and terminal cases  are cases that require special processing, such as a terminal illness or  a veteran with a 100-percent permanent and total disability  compensation rating.", "Prior work: Claimants reporting shorter work histories (4 years or  less in the last 15 years before applying for disability benefits) were  allowed at a rate 0.8 times as high as a typical claimant with 10 or  more years of work history. As expected, given the nature of the work  requirements for the DI program, the association with prior work  history was stronger for that program than for the SSI program.", "College education: Claimants who reported having a college-level  education or higher were approved at a slightly higher rate (1.1 times  higher) than a typical claimant with a high-school education. SSA  officials suggested that this association could be an indirect measure  of the severity of a claimant\u2019s impairment, a factor for which we did  not have data. They said that individuals with higher levels of  education often have higher incomes and, therefore, may be less  likely to forego their income to apply for disability benefits, were it not  for the severity of their disability.", "Claim type: DI claimants were allowed at a rate 1.7 times higher than  a typical SSI claimant. Across judges, the average allowance rate for  DI claimants (67 percent) was higher than for SSI claimants (52  percent) from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, with the allowance rate  for claimants applying concurrently for DI and SSI benefits falling in  between (58 percent).", "Other Participants in the Disability Appeals Process  Claimants who had appointed a representative to present their case, or  had a medical expert testify at their hearing, were associated with a  greater chance of being allowed benefits, but the presence of a vocational  expert had the opposite association.", "Claimant representative: Similar to findings in our prior work,  claimants who had a representative\u2014either an attorney or a  nonattorney representative\u2014were allowed at a rate 2.9 times higher  than a typical claimant with no representative. SSA officials stated  that representatives may have a screening process for potential  clients, and under SSA\u2019s fee structure, representatives are paid only if  the claimant is awarded benefits. As a result, representatives may  tend to take cases they believe will be successful. Officials also stated  that a representative can help the claimant by ensuring that the  medical evidence and other records are fully developed and help the  claimant present their case at a hearing. From fiscal years 2007  through 2015, most claimants (77 percent) had an attorney  representative, and 12 percent had a nonattorney representative.", "Expert testimony: Claimants whose hearings involved testimony  from a medical expert were allowed at a rate 1.6 times higher than a  typical claimant without a medical expert present. Medical experts  include physicians, psychologists, and other types of medical  professionals who provide impartial, expert opinion evidence for an  ALJ to consider when making a decision about disability. SSA officials  said that the association of medical experts with an increased chance  of allowance is expected, given that judges are required to seek the  testimony of a medical expert in certain cases, for example, when the  judge is considering allowing benefits because the claimant\u2019s  impairment may be medically equivalent to one in SSA\u2019s Listing of  Impairments. In other cases, involving a medical expert is generally at  the judge\u2019s discretion. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, 12  percent of decisions involved a medical expert.", "The presence of a vocational expert had the opposite effect\u2014 claimants with a vocational expert testifying were allowed at a rate 0.8  times as high as claimants without a vocational expert testifying.  Vocational experts provide objective, expert opinion evidence to the  ALJ, primarily at the last two steps of the disability decision-making  process where SSA considers whether claimants can do their prior  work or transition to other work available in the national economy.  Although involving a vocational expert is generally at a judge\u2019s  discretion, SSA officials said that they were not surprised by this  result, because vocational experts are usually called upon at the final  two steps in the disability decision-making process. At that point,  claimants had already not been allowed benefits at an earlier step  because their impairment(s) did not meet or were not equivalent to an  impairment in SSA\u2019s listings. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015,  most hearings (85 percent) involved a vocational expert.", "Judges with certain characteristics, such as those appointed in earlier  years, were associated with a greater chance of allowing benefits.", "Appointment cohort: A claimant whose claim was heard by a judge  appointed between 1995 and 1999 was allowed at a rate 1.5 times  higher than a typical claim heard by a judge appointed after 2010.  SSA officials said that, since 2010, they have changed the way they  train and mentor new judges, and introduced new tools to help  provide a standardized decision-making template. As a result, SSA  officials said, more recently hired ALJs may be more aware of agency  policies and procedures.", "Certain characteristics of hearing offices and other factors also were  associated with higher chances of allowance. For example:", "Hearing type: Claimants whose hearings were held in person were  allowed at a slightly higher rate (1.1 times higher) than a typical  claimant with a hearing conducted remotely using videoconference  technology. This is equivalent to a 2.8 percentage-point higher  probability of being allowed benefits for a claimant whose hearing was  held in person, compared to an otherwise typical claimant whose  hearing was conducted by videoconference. However, we did not  seek to estimate the causal impact of videoconferences on allowance  rates, and so did not design our analysis to account for all factors that  could affect this relationship. Rather, we accounted for the use of  videoconferences solely to further ensure that circumstances were  similar across the judges and offices we analyzed. Expanding video  service delivery is a key goal for SSA, including plans to partner with  other agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, to  increase the number of available video hearing sites beyond those  already available at hearing offices and the five National Hearing  Centers.", "Year of decision: Claimants whose appeals were decided in earlier  years were associated with a greater chance of being allowed  benefits. While this trend is similar to the raw change over time shown  in figure 4, our multivariate analysis showed that this change held  even for claimants in similar circumstances. For example, claimants  who received decisions in 2007 were allowed at a rate 2.0 times  higher than a typical claim in 2015. This is consistent with other  studies that have found trends of lower allowance rates in recent  years.", "Factors Not Associated with Differences in Allowance Rates  Some factors were not meaningfully associated with allowance rates  when holding other factors constant.", "Workload measures: Workload and productivity measures at the  hearing office and judge level were not meaningfully associated with  allowance rates. This includes the annual percentage of cases that  were backlogged (that is, awaiting a judge\u2019s decision for more than  270 days) at each hearing office, as well as the annual number of  dispositions (decisions plus dismissals) each judge issued. This may  suggest that judges\u2019 decisions to allow or deny cases are not  significantly influenced by the number of cases before them, similar to  findings in prior research.", "Hearing office type: We found no meaningful differences in  allowance rates between similar claims heard at one of SSA\u2019s  National Hearing Centers or a traditional hearing office, after holding  constant other factors (including whether the hearing was held by  videoconference). SSA has five National Hearing Centers, which hear  cases from across the country by videoconference in order to reduce  backlogs in certain hearing offices.", "Economic characteristics: The unemployment and poverty rates in  the claimant\u2019s state at the time of the ALJ decision were not  associated with allowance rates. Higher unemployment rates can  result in increased applications for Social Security disability benefits  because workers with impairments that could qualify them for the  program who experience job loss may find it more difficult to become  re-employed during periods of high unemployment and apply for  benefits. However, the impact on allowance rates in the research we  reviewed is mixed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Efforts to Monitor Accuracy and Consistency of Hearings-Level Decisions Lack Performance Measures and Have Not Been Evaluated", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Has Timeliness Measures, but Lacks Public Performance Measures for Accuracy and Consistency", "paragraphs": ["SSA has employed a range of efforts to monitor the accuracy and  consistency of hearings decisions, but it lacks performance measures to  report publicly on these efforts. SSA\u2019s current strategic plan includes an  objective to \u201cimprove the quality, consistency, and timeliness\u201d of its  disability decisions; however, all of the hearings-level measures  supporting this objective are related to timeliness. In a previous report, we  developed nine attributes of performance goals and measures based on  previously established GAO criteria, as well as relevant federal laws and  performance management literature. One key attribute states that an  agency\u2019s suite of performance measures should be balanced to cover  various priorities. In addition, each measure should cover a priority such  as quality, timeliness, and cost of service. However, because SSA\u2019s  performance measures do not fully reflect its goals, the overall success of  SSA\u2019s efforts in this area may be limited.", "SSA previously had performance measures related to hearings-level  accuracy, which used data from ALJ peer reviews. These measures were  discontinued in fiscal year 2009, when the ALJs conducting the reviews  were reassigned to hearing cases. By comparison, SSA continues to  have a measure for accuracy at the initial decision-making level (see  table 1).", "SSA officials stated that they have no plans to add new performance  measures related to the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions  to the strategic plan. They said that while they collect and monitor a wide  variety of workload and performance measures for day-to-day operations,  they have to select a few, representative measures that are meaningful to  stakeholders and represent agency-wide efforts to achieve its goals. They  stated that the current performance measures meet these requirements.", "Although SSA officials said the agency does not publicly report  performance measures related to the accuracy and consistency of  hearings decisions, they said that SSA uses internal performance  measures related to hearings decisions. However, these internal  measures to monitor quality and consistency of hearings decisions have  limitations and are not shared with the public. Regional chief judges\u2014who  oversee the hearing offices and judges within each of SSA\u2019s 10 regions\u2014 and others told us that they use a measure known as the \u201cagree rate\u201d to  help monitor the quality of a judge\u2019s decisions. This measure is based on  the number of cases that have been appealed to the Appeals Council by  the claimant or representative as a request for review. The agree rate  reflects the percentage of cases in which the Appeals Council\u2014the final  level of appeals within SSA\u2014concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decisions were  supported by substantial evidence and contained no error of law or abuse  of discretion. However, the agree rate has some limitations. For example,  as noted earlier, it does not reflect the accuracy of ALJ decisions that the  claimant did not appeal. SSA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  found that this measure provided information on less than one-quarter of  all ALJ dispositions and it is not representative of the ALJ\u2019s entire  workload because it is based only on Appeals Council reviews of  appealed cases. In addition, a March 2017 SSA OIG report found that  SSA has not maintained historical data on agree rates, limiting the  agency\u2019s ability to analyze agree rate trends.", "SSA uses other internal measures to track consistency. For example,  SSA developed an internal early monitoring system that tracks 22 metrics  of ALJ performance to identify outliers. For example, three of these  metrics (average number of dispositions a judge issues per day, agree  rate, and allowance rate) have \u201calarm thresholds\u201d to indicate when an  ALJ\u2019s metrics fall outside of a given threshold. Based on these findings,  SSA may conduct a focused quality review (a type of quality assurance  review) to ensure the judge\u2019s decisions complied with SSA policies, or  follow up with the regional chief judge to determine if additional policy  guidance or training is needed.", "Although these internal measures are helpful for management to monitor  and improve accuracy and consistency, without sharing this or similar  information publicly, SSA lacks accountability for improving the quality of  hearings-level decisions. In addition, federal internal control standards  state that management should externally communicate the necessary  quality information to achieve objectives, including to external  stakeholders such as Congress and the public. Further, given the  persistent variation in allowance rates, SSA may be missing an  opportunity to provide the public with information on the results of its  efforts to improve the accuracy and consistency of disability decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Has Efforts to Monitor and Improve Accuracy and Consistency of Hearings- Level Decisions, but Quality Reviews May Overlap and Have Not Been Systematically Evaluated", "paragraphs": ["SSA provides training and tools to all ALJs and initiates disciplinary  actions where needed, as part of its efforts to monitor and improve  accuracy and consistency. SSA also conducts multiple quality assurance  reviews, but some of these reviews may overlap and SSA has not  evaluated them.", "Training, Tools, and Policy Guidance  ALJs receive ongoing training and guidance from several sources,  including through judicial trainings, mentoring, and policy memorandums.  In 2006, SSA implemented a three-phase training program for new ALJs,  which includes training on core competencies as well as a formal  mentoring program in which new ALJs are paired with experienced ALJs  for regular sessions over a nine-month period. Regional managers,  judges, and stakeholders we spoke with had positive feedback on the  training SSA provides to judges. For example, officials from one  stakeholder group told us that they believe training had created more  consistency in allowance rates. SSA\u2019s chief judge also issues guidance  memorandums to clarify policies related to the hearings process. For  example, in July 2013, SSA issued a memorandum establishing  expectations for the instructions judges provide to decision writers, who  are SSA staff who prepare the draft decisions. SSA officials said that they  issued the memorandum in response to an ALJ who was providing low- quality instructions to decision writers and SSA realized it had not  provided formal guidance on the topic. In addition, ALJs also receive  quarterly continuing education training and have a library of reference  materials and on-demand video courses to use as needed.", "SSA also uses internal metrics and provides electronic tools to judges to  monitor and improve accuracy and consistency. Regional chief judges  regularly review management information (MI) reports and develop  strategies, such as recommending training, to address identified issues.  Beginning in 2011, SSA established an electronic tool called \u201cHow MI  Doing?\u201d, which allows ALJs to compare their productivity and timeliness  metrics to hearing office, regional, or national metrics. The tool also  provides data on the agree rate for each judge as well as the hearing  office, regional, and national agree rates. Using this tool, judges can also  learn the reasons any prior decisions have been remanded, and access  on-demand training pertaining to that reason. Regional chief judges we  spoke with generally found \u201cHow MI Doing?\u201d to be a helpful tool, although  SSA does not track judges\u2019 usage and has not formally evaluated its  effectiveness. In addition, SSA established the electronic Bench Book  (eBB), which is designed to assist users with documenting, analyzing,  and making consistent and accurate decisions on hearings-level adult  disability cases. However, the SSA OIG recently recommended that SSA  evaluate eBB and determine whether to continue it. Regional chief judges  we spoke with provided mixed feedback on the use of eBB and its  usefulness for ALJs. In fiscal year 2016, nearly 500 ALJs (about one- third) used eBB. In June 2017, SSA officials said that while no formal  evaluation of eBB was conducted, they recently received approval to  proceed with plans to replace eBB with a similar tool as part of updates to  SSA\u2019s case management system.", "SSA also addresses identified issues with the accuracy and consistency  of hearings decisions by taking disciplinary actions, as needed. SSA can  take non-disciplinary or disciplinary action to address performance  concerns. Non-disciplinary actions include training and counseling (known  as \u201ccollegial conversations\u201d). Another non-disciplinary action is a written  directive, which SSA can issue to individual judges to improve  performance on workload, scheduling or policy compliance. From 2007  through 2016, SSA issued about 1,330 such directives. Nearly all (95  percent) were issued to improve timeliness, while about 2 percent were  issued to improve policy compliance. If an ALJ\u2019s conduct or performance  does not change or becomes more egregious, SSA continues with  progressive discipline including reprimand or seeking disciplinary action  from the Merit Systems Protection Board, such as short- or long-term  suspension or removal. From 2007 through 2016, there were 98  reprimands, 34 proposed suspensions, and 16 proposed removals,  according to SSA.", "SSA conducts various quality assurance reviews to improve accuracy and  consistency. SSA officials stated that the agency has been enhancing its  quality review efforts since 2009. Since then, it has added five types of  quality assurance reviews that are conducted by three additional offices  within SSA (see fig. 8).", "SSA added quality assurance reviews for various reasons. For example,  in 2009, SSA\u2019s regional staff under the Office of the Chief Administrative  Law Judge began conducting regional inline quality reviews, which  involve assessing the extent to which hearing office staff are processing  cases and preparing them for hearings in accordance with SSA policy, as  well as the policy compliance and legal sufficiency of the draft decision.  SSA added this review to enhance its reviews of decisions before they  are issued, in an effort to reduce remands. Also in 2009, SSA\u2019s Office of  Quality Review began conducting disability case reviews to provide  feedback on decision-making accuracy to ALJs. In addition, in 2010, SSA  created the Division of Quality under the Appeals Council, a unit focused  on conducting reviews on a regular basis of decisions that claimants did  not appeal. Prior to 2010, SSA generally only reviewed decisions that  claimants appealed through the Appeals Council.", "While these quality assurance reviews have somewhat different  focuses\u2014for example, some assess aspects of how a case was  processed while others review the accuracy of the decisions\u2014they  overlap in two key ways. According to prior GAO work, overlap occurs  when multiple agencies or programs have similar goals, engage in similar  activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar beneficiaries.  Some of SSA\u2019s quality review efforts fit the description of overlap in that  they have similar goals and review similar cases. For example:", "Similar goals: Several of the reviews have similar goals (see table 2).  For example, two of the four entities conducting reviews\u2014the Appeals  Council\u2019s Division of Quality and staff in SSA\u2019s 10 regional offices\u2014 both review decisions for policy compliance before those decisions go  into effect (known as pre-effectuation reviews). While one review  looks at the judge\u2019s decision and the other looks at the draft decision  prior to the judge\u2019s review and approval, according to officials and  documents we reviewed, these reviews share similar goals: to guide  training and provide feedback to judges. In addition, all the reviews  are designed to assess compliance with SSA policy.", "Similar cases: SSA\u2019s five quality assurance reviews look at similar  cases, and could potentially include the same cases (see table 3).  SSA takes some steps to prevent assessing the same claim in  multiple quality assurance reviews. Officials told us that, in conducting  focused quality reviews (conducted after the decision is final), they  exclude cases that were reviewed in a pre-effectuation review.  However, they said that the Division of Quality does not know whether  cases it has selected were also subject to a regional inline quality  review. They said that additional efforts to prevent multiple reviews of  a case are manual in nature, and thus there is still the potential for  claims to be reviewed more than once. Further, SSA officials said they  did not see a need to prevent multiple reviews of a case, in particular,  because some reviews are conducted before the decision is final and  others are conducted after the decision is final.", "SSA officials stated that opportunities exist to improve coordination  across offices conducting quality assurance reviews. We found that  several offices coordinated their work in some cases. For example, SSA\u2019s  Division of Quality and Office of Quality Review participate in a multi- office workgroup that addresses such issues as policy compliance across  the initial and hearings levels of the disability process. In addition, they  have also worked together on several studies, including a one-time  quality review of 454 claims that were denied at the initial determination  level, but were allowed as fully favorable at the hearings level. The Office  of Quality Review also reviews the content of selected training for judges.  In addition, the Division of Quality provided some initial input when the  regional inline review effort was being designed. Prior GAO work has  found that enhanced coordination can help to reduce overlap and improve  efficiency. Effective October 1, 2017, SSA created a new deputy  commissioner-level component, the Office of Analytics, Review and  Oversight. This agency reorganization moved six oversight offices into the  new component, including the Division of Quality and Office of Quality  Review. Officials said the new component will create opportunities for  improved coordination between these six offices. While this  reorganization creates the opportunity for SSA to assess many of its  quality assurance reviews, the regional quality review staff will not be  included in the new office, and it is too early to tell how this reorganization  will help manage the overlap between SSA\u2019s various quality assurance  reviews.", "In addition, SSA has struggled to sustain all of its quality assurance  reviews due to competing demands for the staff who perform them. For  example, SSA placed regional inline quality reviews on hold in September  2016 and again in December 2016, because officials said that the agency  needed staff to complete pending decisions before a change in the  medical listings for mental impairments took effect in January 2017.  Decisions not completed before the new listings took effect would have to  be redone. Also, the Office of Quality Review curtailed its Disability Case  Reviews in fiscal year 2016 to help prepare the oldest cases for hearings.  As a result, only the Appeals Council\u2019s review of appealed ALJ decisions  (requests for review) and the Division of Quality\u2019s quality assurance  reviews were active in 2016.", "Even as SSA has added quality assurance reviews, it has not  systematically evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of all the  reviews to determine the extent to which they may be overlapping or  complementary. We found that reviews conducted by the four entities  have resulted in similar findings, raising questions about the efficiency of  these reviews. For example, during the same 3-year period (fiscal years  2013 through 2015), quality reviews conducted by all four entities found  problems with judges\u2019 assessment of a claimant\u2019s ability to perform work- related tasks, known as a residual functional capacity assessment. In  addition, all four entities found problems with the evaluation of medical  opinion evidence.", "Moreover, SSA has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the five  reviews. Officials said that there are no definite plans to do so, although  they may consider conducting such an analysis in the future. We found  that costs for the quality assurance reviews conducted in fiscal year 2015  were at least $23.7 million, and in fiscal year 2016 were at least $11.7  million (see table 4). By evaluating the quality assurance reviews to  determine the extent to which each is needed to monitor and improve  accuracy and consistency, SSA would be better positioned to meet its  goals within its resources.", "In addition, SSA continues to develop and implement initiatives aimed at  improving hearing decisions, without evaluating the potential for overlap  with existing quality assurance reviews. For example, as part of its  backlog reduction plan known as the Compassionate And Responsive  Services (CARES) plan, SSA is using computer algorithms for natural  language processing to analyze the text of disability decisions and flag  potential errors. Although the agency is piloting this effort in the Appeals  Council before expanding it to hearing offices, it did not conduct a cost- benefit analysis. SSA officials said that natural language processing could  be used to identify cases for further review, similar to its current selective  reviews, and that decision writers could use the tool to conduct their own  reviews of their draft decisions. SSA officials said that they do not  anticipate much overlap between the use of natural language processing  and OAO\u2019s pre-effectuation reviews. However, there could be potential for  overlap with regional inline reviews, which also review decisions drafted  by decision writers. Federal internal control standards state that  management should implement control activities through policies.  Periodically reviewing policies, procedures, and related control activities  for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving objectives and  addressing related risks can help agencies meet this standard."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s disability programs provide more than $200 billion in benefits for  tens of millions of Americans annually, making it one of the largest  components of the nation\u2019s social safety net. The hearings and appeals  level of the disability decision-making process is particularly important  because about one in three people receiving Social Security disability  benefits are granted benefits at this level. Given the number of people  and the dollars at stake, it is crucial that claimants are treated fairly and  their applications are evaluated accurately and consistently across the  country, at all levels of the program.", "Some of the variation in allowance rates that we found across judges may  be expected, given the complexity of the cases and judges\u2019 decisional  independence. However, the persistent variation we observed over time,  even after accounting for various factors that could otherwise explain  allowance rates, might warrant additional attention. SSA is rightly  focusing on oversight of judges, but our work suggests that the agency\u2019s  emphasis on timeliness over accuracy in its public metrics and the  potential overlap in its quality assurance efforts may offer opportunities for  improving the accuracy and consistency of hearing decisions.", "First, this amount of variation in allowance rates underscores the need for  SSA to measure and hold itself accountable for accuracy and  consistency. However, without sharing performance information on the  accuracy and consistency of its hearings-level decisions, such as the rate  at which the Appeals Council agrees with a judge\u2019s decisions, SSA may  not be providing the public with adequate information on progress toward  its objective to improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness of its  disability decisions. Developing a set of performance measures that  includes the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions will help  ensure the overall success of the program.", "Second, SSA has not systematically considered how each of its quality  assurance reviews helps the agency meet its objective to improve the  quality of hearings-level decisions. Although the planned consolidation of  multiple oversight and quality review offices is a positive step, it will be  important for SSA to consider the usefulness of the information yielded by  each quality assurance effort, as well as the costs associated with  conducting the effort. Evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of  quality assurance activities can help ensure that SSA is using its  resources for maximum benefit toward its objective to improve the quality,  consistency, and timeliness of its disability decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to SSA:  The Commissioner of SSA should develop a set of public performance  measures, to include accuracy and consistency, as well as timeliness, of  administrative law judges\u2019 (ALJ) disability decisions.

(Recommendation 1)", "The Commissioner of SSA should systematically evaluate the efficiency  and effectiveness of its quality assurance reviews and take steps to  reduce or better manage any unnecessary overlap among them to ensure  strategic use of resources. Such steps could include enhancing  collaboration where reviews overlap or only conducting the reviews that  are most efficient and effective in achieving agency goals for improving  accuracy and consistency of ALJ disability decisions.

SSA stated that it would address both recommendations as part of a  comprehensive assessment and refinement of its oversight roles and  processes. SSA made several other comments about one of our  conclusions and our analysis of variation in administrative law judge  allowance rates, which we discuss below. SSA also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "In its comments, SSA described its evolving oversight activities at the  hearings level, including providing policy guidance and training for judges,  capturing and utilizing data to gain a better understanding of trends and  challenges, and implementing additional oversight review processes, all  of which we discussed in our report. SSA\u2019s comments acknowledged that  our report describes the steps that the agency has taken to improve  oversight, but disagreed with our conclusion that SSA emphasizes  timeliness over accuracy. Our final report clarifies that we came to this  conclusion based on a review of the performance measures the agency  shares with the public in its annual strategic plan and performance  reports. As we state in the report, SSA has employed a range of efforts to  monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions, but it lacks  performance measures to report publicly on these efforts.", "Regarding our analysis of variation in ALJ allowance rates, SSA raised a  concern about our finding (on page 26 of the final report) that claimants  whose hearings were held in person were slightly more likely (by about  2.8 percentage points) to be allowed benefits than a typical claimant with  a hearing held by videoconference. SSA cited its own internal analysis,  which found a small (0.6 percentage-point) difference in allowance rates  between in-person and videoconference hearings after controlling for a  number of factors. It is not surprising, however, that our estimates are  somewhat different, since SSA\u2019s internal analysis differs from ours in  several ways. The primary purpose of our statistical analysis was to  isolate variation in allowance rates due to the unique judge or hearing  office assigned to each claim. To do this, we developed a multilevel  model using 9 years of data that controls for judge, hearing office, and  claimant-level factors associated with allowance rates. On the other hand,  SSA\u2019s analysis was specifically designed to look at the difference in  allowance rates between in-person and video hearings. SSA\u2019s analysis  also covered a shorter, more recent period of time (part of fiscal year  2015, fiscal year 2016, and part of fiscal year 2017), than our study (fiscal  years 2007 through 2015). Additionally, the version of the model SSA  cited in its comments included hearings held in person or by  videoconference only in regular hearing offices, whereas our analysis  included hearings held in National Hearing Centers as well as regular  hearing offices and controlled for the type of hearing office. These  differences notwithstanding, we agree with SSA that the estimated model- adjusted difference in allowance rates between in-person and  videoconference hearings in both GAO\u2019s and SSA\u2019s analyses could  potentially be explained by unmeasurable factors.", "In addition, SSA noted that our measure of variation in judge decisions  focused on allowance rates at the extremes of the distribution. Given that  our charge was to explore the extent of variation in allowance rates  across judges, we believe it was appropriate and important to measure  the range of allowance rates between judges with high allowance rates  (at the 95th percentile) and those with low allowance rates (at the 5th   percentile). This would be more conservative than an approach that looks  at allowance rates across all judges, including potential extreme values;  and more nuanced than an approach that looks at the number of judges  whose allowance rates are higher or lower than a given threshold.  Further, our analysis shows that unadjusted allowance rates at the 95th  percentile declined over the period of our analysis, from a high of 96  percent in fiscal year 2008 to 82 percent in fiscal year 2015. We saw a  comparable decline in allowance rates after applying our multivariate  model. To provide additional context, our report figures also show the  middle of the distribution (the 25th and 75th percentiles), as well as the  average allowance rates. We have also added information to our report  further describing this middle range.", "Finally, SSA noted that our analysis was not weighted by the number of  determinations a judge made, suggesting that judges who decided very  few claims, for example, could affect the range in allowance rates or the  trends. As we show in Appendix I, Table 7, only 2.3 percent of the judges  in our study population heard fewer than 250 claims per year. This group  of judges had an unadjusted allowance rate of 61.9 percent, very similar  to the allowance rate among judges who heard 500-699 claims per year  (61.6 percent). Furthermore, the statistical methods we used to estimate  the distributions of allowance rates (multilevel models) adjust the  estimates for judges with fewer claims by weighting them more heavily  toward the overall approval rate. This mitigates against judges with  smaller caseloads, and therefore higher sampling variation, from  contributing overestimated allowance rates that might have inflated our  estimated variation across judges.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Commissioner of Social Security, and  other interested parties.
