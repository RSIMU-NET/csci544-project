Specifically, MDA has made advances across a broad range of management activities, such as improving stakeholder outreach, reducing concurrency, (broadly defined as the overlap between product development, testing, and production), improving testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and increasing transparency of its progress. MDA has also made progress toward improving homeland and regional defense.", "However, MDA can go further to align itself with best practices as it faces ongoing challenges associated with improving transparency and reducing high risk acquisition practices. These challenges include:", "Stakeholder involvement: MDA has improved its outreach to stakeholders, including the intelligence community and other DOD stakeholders, however, opportunities remain, such as obtaining more input from the defense intelligence community. While MDA is not required to do so, the community is uniquely positioned to help keep pace with emerging threats and validate threat models.", "Concurrency: MDA has taken steps to reduce concurrency, but falls back on this practice when experiencing developmental delays or schedule pressures. The recently canceled Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) initially aligned production decisions with flight testing. However, in response to advancements from North Korea, development and production were performed concurrently and flight testing was reduced, thereby removing the safeguards that had been put into place.", "Flight test schedule changes: Despite initiating a new approach to developing its flight test schedule in 2009, MDA continues to struggle with execution. Namely, MDA is frequently revising its annual schedule by adding new tests, and deleting or delaying others\u2014sometimes multiple times.", "Transparency of test cost estimates: MDA regularly makes changes to its test schedule without reporting the impact to its costs and funding needs. We continue to believe that breaking out funding requests by test will improve transparency into planned versus actual test costs and aid departmental and congressional decision makers as they make difficult choices of where to invest limited resources.", "MDA is at a pivotal crossroads, needing to balance its ability to pursue new and advanced efforts while also maintaining its existing portfolio.

MDA\u2019s mission is to  develop an integrated and layered Ballistic Missile Defense System  (BMDS) to defend the United States, its deployed forces, allies and  friends from ballistic and hypersonic missile attacks. In order to meet this  mission, MDA is developing a highly complex system that includes land-,  sea-, and space-based systems and assets located across the globe.  MDA has received approximately $174 billion from fiscal years 2002  through 2020 and is requesting an additional $9.2 billion for fiscal year  2021 to continue its efforts.", "Since the fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act was  enacted, we have been mandated to prepare annual assessments of  MDA\u2019s progress towards its acquisition goals and objectives. Since our  first report in 2003, we have reported on MDA\u2019s progress and challenges  in acquiring and fielding BMDS capabilities. In general, we have reported  that MDA has developed, demonstrated, and fielded a limited homeland  and regional ballistic missile defense capability, but MDA has fallen short  of its goals, in part, because of high-risk acquisition practices. These  include initiating new programs without robustly assessing alternative  solutions, incorporating high levels of concurrency, and fielding  capabilities prior to completing flight testing. These practices enabled  MDA to quickly ramp up efforts in order to meet tight, presidentially  directed deadlines, but they also resulted in problems that caused some  programs to be canceled or significantly disrupted. In recent reports, we  have also identified contracting challenges; challenges in working with  warfighters and stakeholders, such as the intelligence community; and  challenges associated with testing, such as optimistic planning. We have  also reported on MDA\u2019s need for more reliable models and simulations,  which play an integral role in validating performance.", "MDA has made efforts to put newer programs on a more sound footing  and it has taken some actions to address acquisition issues, including  adopting acquisition best practices in some cases. However, MDA is not  always able to sustain its use of these best practices.", "Today, I will highlight (1) steps MDA has taken to increase transparency,  reduce acquisition risks, and deliver capability; and (2) ongoing  challenges associated with improving transparency and reducing high-risk  acquisition practices. My testimony is based on reports we issued from  April 2003 to December 2019 and on preliminary observations for our  ongoing work covering fiscal year 2019. For our previous work, we  reviewed MDA management documents including their reported  baselines and test schedules. We compared these plans against MDA\u2019s  actual delivery and testing achievements recorded in agency documents  and through interviews with agency officials and relevant officials in the  Department of Defense. More detailed information on our objectives,  scope, and methodology can be found in those reports. For our ongoing  work covering fiscal year 2019, we reviewed MDA\u2019s planned delivery and  testing goals for fiscal year 2019. We also discussed the agency\u2019s plans  and performance in interviews with agency officials and the BMDS  Operational Test Agency. In addition, we met with officials from the office  of the Undersecretaries of Defense for Research and Engineering and  Acquisitions and Sustainment.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["MDA is responsible for developing a number of systems, known as  elements, with the purpose of defending against ballistic and hypersonic  missile attacks. MDA\u2019s mission is to combine these elements into an  integrated system-of-systems known as the Ballistic Missile Defense  System (BMDS). The goal of the BMDS is to combine the abilities of two  or more elements to achieve objectives that would not have been  possible for any individual element. These emergent abilities are known  as integrated capabilities or BMDS level capabilities. Table 1 provides a  brief description of selected BMDS elements.", "MDA was established in 2002 with exceptional flexibilities to manage the  acquisition of the BMDS\u2014developed as a single program\u2014that allow  MDA to expedite the fielding of assets and integrated ballistic missile  defense capabilities. These flexibilities allow MDA to diverge from DOD\u2019s  traditional acquisition life cycle and defer the application of certain  acquisition policies and laws designed to facilitate oversight and  accountability until a mature capability is ready to be handed over to a  military service for production and operation.", "In addition, MDA has been operating in an environment of tight  timeframes for delivering capabilities\u2014beginning with a presidential  directive in 2002 to field a limited capability by 2004. This was followed by  a presidential announcement in 2009 to begin deploying U.S. missile  defense in Europe in 2011 finishing in 2020. This schedule required  concurrency among technology, testing and other development activities.  More recently, MDA has been directed to develop and deploy defenses  against hypersonic and cruise missile threats as soon as technologically  able. These schedule pressures compound challenges associated with  complex technology, design, and integration associated with the missile  defense mission that normally require careful planning, disciplined  engineering practices, extensive coordination, and effective management  and oversight to be successful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Has Taken Steps to Improve Management Practices, Reduce Acquisition Risks, and Deliver Capability", "paragraphs": ["MDA has taken important actions to increase transparency, reduce high- risk approaches in its management of BMDS elements, and test and  deliver BMDS capability. Specifically, MDA has improved reporting in its  annual progress reports to the Congress and made advances across a  broad range of management activities, including the involvement of  stakeholders, reducing concurrency, and continued efforts to improve key  aspects of testing necessary to demonstrate delivered capability.", "Increased Transparency: MDA, consistent with several of our  recommendations has increased the ability to track progress over time  in the BMDS Accountability Report (BAR). This is MDA\u2019s annual  report that presents the current estimate of the BMDS programs\u2019  baselines. To increase insight into MDA\u2019s management of the BMDS,  MDA implemented significant changes to its key acquisition processes  and for the first time developed and reported detailed baselines for  each element in the BAR in 2010. As we found in March 2011, MDA\u2019s  prior approach limited the ability for DOD and congressional decision  makers to measure MDA\u2019s progress on cost, schedule, and testing.  While MDA\u2019s changes were positive, over the years, we made  additional recommendations to further improve MDA\u2019s reporting. In  response to our recommendations, MDA made improvements to the  BAR that include providing details on variances to its test plan from  year to year and including information on its use of contract actions  known as an Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCA) and Unpriced  Change Orders (UCO).", "Improved Stakeholder Outreach: MDA has increased its outreach to  DOD stakeholders over the past few years. Our prior work on defense  acquisitions has shown that establishing buy-in from decision makers  is a key factor in achieving better acquisition outcomes because DOD  components provide varying perspectives due to their unique areas of  expertise and experience. For example, as we reported in December  2019, MDA has recently increased its interaction with the defense  intelligence community. Specifically, MDA engaged the defense  intelligence community on an analysis of alternatives the agency  completed in February 2017 that assessed future sensor options for  the BMDS. In addition, MDA reached out to the defense intelligence  community on another analysis of alternatives pertaining to defense  against hypersonic missiles. In fact, officials from several DOD  organizations we met with over the past two years observed that  MDA\u2019s engagement with their organizations was improving.", "Reducing Concurrency: MDA continues to take steps to reduce  concurrency, an issue we have reported on for many years.  Concurrency is broadly defined as the overlap of development,  testing, and production; coupled with an aggressive testing schedule.  MDA\u2019s concurrent development has often left the agency committing  to production and fielding before development is complete. This  approach has resulted in performance shortfalls, cost increases, and  schedule delays. MDA has taken steps to mitigate this risk consistent  with our recommendations. For example, as we found in May 2017,  MDA took steps to reduce concurrency in the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block  IB by adding in tests and delaying the full-rate production decision  until the tests were completed. Figure 1 represents a highly  concurrent acquisition schedule as compared to an approach based  on gaining knowledge before proceeding to the next acquisition  phase.", "Improving BMDS Testing: MDA has improved the accuracy of tools it  uses to assess integrated BMDS capabilities. The BMDS is a system  of systems that cannot be completely assessed using intercept flight  tests because of the system\u2019s scope and complexity, and because of  safety constraints. Consequently, MDA, independent DOD testing  organizations, and the warfighter must rely heavily on representations  of the integrated BMDS called models and simulations in ground  testing. This approach is used, rather than live tests, to test the  operational performance of the whole BMDS against attacks with  more threats represented. Our preliminary observations for fiscal year  2019 are that the number of accredited models and simulations that  are needed to assess the integrated performance of the BMDS has  steadily risen over the last 3 years.", "Over the past several years, we have reported on MDA\u2019s progress in  delivering assets and capabilities to counter attacks as well as cyber  threats. MDA delivered important BMDS capabilities for architectures in  the United States as well as those defending U.S. troops and allies in  Europe, the Middle East, and the Eastern Pacific. For example:", "Homeland Defense: In fiscal year 2017 and 2018, MDA delivered a  significant integrated capability for defending the United States,  including improvements in the ability to discriminate lethal objects in  targets, and increased capacity. This was a key achievement in  fulfilling a directive from the Secretary of Defense to increase  inventory of ground-based interceptors by the end of 2017.", "Regional BMD: In fiscal year 2016, MDA delivered capabilities for the  second phase of its effort in Europe, called European Phased  Adaptive Approach (EPAA). This effort required coordinated  development of a number of elements and their integration to provide  integrated BMDS-level integrated capabilities against short and  medium range ballistic missiles. More recently, in fiscal years 2018  and 2019, MDA rapidly delivered capabilities for its effort to meet an  urgent regional need.", "In addition, preliminary observations from our review covering fiscal year  2019 indicate that cybersecurity assessments in fiscal year 2019 informed  the network defense posture in U.S. Northern Command and provided  data on how to reduce mission risk for these elements operating in a  cyber-contested environment. Moreover, the agency is incorporating  lessons learned from prior cyber activities, and continues to address  issues discovered in prior testing, improving its overall cybersecurity  survivability. However, our preliminary observations indicate much  remains to be done to ensure cyber resiliency of the BMDS including the  completion of cybersecurity testing for capabilities delivered in 2017 and  2018, along with conducting element-level operational cooperative and  adversarial assessments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Faces Ongoing Challenges to Improve Transparency and Reduce High-Risk Acquisition Practices", "paragraphs": ["MDA has made efforts to put some programs on a more sound footing  and it has taken actions to address the issues I just mentioned. However,  MDA can go further to align itself with best practices for acquisitions.  Today, I will highlight certain acquisition challenges MDA still faces.", "Stakeholder involvement: While MDA has increased its outreach to  the stakeholders over the past few years, opportunities remain for  further engagement on key decisions. For instance, as we found in  December 2019, although MDA has been increasing its engagement  with the intelligence community, MDA provides the defense  intelligence community with limited insight into how the agency uses  threat assessments to inform its acquisition decisions. MDA is not  required to obtain the defense intelligence community\u2019s input;  however, the community is uniquely positioned to assist MDA keep  pace with rapidly emerging threats. Moreover, this limited insight has,  in part, prevented validation of threat models designed to assess  BMDS capabilities. Without validation, any flaws or bias in the threat  models may go undetected, which can have significant implications  for the performance of MDA\u2019s weapon systems. MDA and the defense  intelligence community recently began discussing a more suitable  level of involvement in the agency\u2019s acquisition processes and  decisions. As we recommended in May 2017 and December 2019,  MDA also needs to strengthen its collaboration with other  stakeholders, including the warfighting community and independent  cost and technical experts. In the early stages of the RKV program,  concerns raised about the design\u2014which ultimately was a key reason  for the cancellation of the RKV\u2014went unheeded. For example,  preliminary observations for our assessment covering fiscal year 2019  showed that MDA and contractors did not adequately address  technical risks despite numerous warnings from stakeholders about  the performance issues. However, MDA officials indicate they are  working with stakeholders more closely as they plan for the Next  Generation Interceptor, a new more advanced interceptor.", "Concurrency: Although MDA has taken steps to reduce concurrency  as we have previously recommended, the agency still turns to this  practice when experiencing developmental delays or schedule  pressures. For example, we reported in June 2019 that delays to  construction resulted in MDA\u2019s introduction of increasing levels of  concurrency into the delivery schedule for the Aegis Ashore site in  Poland. We found that key phases of the delivery process had been  shortened from 16.5 months to 6.5 months. While overlapping  acquisition activity, in theory, could speed up the construction  process, this risky practice ultimately failed to mitigate the effects of  problematic construction practices. However, program plans indicate  that the site has experienced further delays and will not be ready for  operational use until at least 2022\u2014a 4 year delay from the original  2018 delivery date. In addition, the recently canceled Redesigned Kill  Vehicle (RKV) program originally sought to avoid concurrency by  aligning production decisions with flight testing. However, later\u2014in  response to the advancement of the North Korean missile threat\u2014the  program accelerated RKV development by concurrently performing  development and production and reducing the number of necessary  flight tests. This acceleration altered the schedule for the previously  aligned flight tests and production decisions.", "Contracting: Although MDA has flexibilities in managing its acquisition  process, it must follow the same contracting regulations that apply to  DOD, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the  Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.  These regulations allow MDA to use a particular type of contract  action called an undefinitized contract action when the negotiation of a  definitive contract is not possible in sufficient time to meet the  government\u2019s requirements and government interests demand that  the contractor be given a binding commitment so that contract  performance can begin immediately. These actions authorize  contractors to begin work before an agreement on terms,  specifications, or price have been agreed upon. In May 2018, we  found that the average length of the undefinitized period and the not- to-exceed price of MDA\u2019s undefinitized contract actions had increased  over the past 5 years. While MDA policy permits use of undefinitized  contracts on a limited basis, we and others have found that they can  place unnecessary cost risks on the government. As we reported in  June 2019, while MDA improved its performance in timely  definitization of these contract actions, the total not-to-exceed value of  the undefinitized contract actions MDA initiated in 2018 far exceeded  previous years we reviewed.", "Transparency in test cost estimates: As we reported in May 2017,  MDA requests more than $1 billion in funding each fiscal year for the  tests outlined in its integrated test schedule based on MDA\u2019s internally  developed test cost estimates. However, our analysis found these  estimates were inconsistent and lacked documented traceability. A  cost estimate is the summation of individual costs using established  methods and valid data. Developing and maintaining reliable cost  estimates ensures the appropriate amount of funds are needed when  requested and for the expressed purpose. We found, however, in May  2017, MDA\u2019s testing budget lacked transparency and could be  improved. Specifically, we found that MDA\u2019s annual budget  submission did not provide insight into the funding for each specific  test. MDA regularly makes changes to its test schedule without  reporting the impacts to its costs and funding needs. Without a  breakout of MDA\u2019s costs by test in its annual budget submission and  BAR, how many times or how much funding has been requested,  received, or used for a specific test will continue to be unclear.  Therefore, we recommended that MDA break out funding request by  test. DOD did not concur with our recommendation and stated that  MDA\u2019s current approach for assigning resources prior to the test  execution, is adequate. We continue to believe that breaking out  funding requests by test will improve transparency into planned  versus actual test costs and aid departmental and congressional  decision makers as they make difficult choices of where to invest  limited resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes to MDA\u2019s Test Schedule Persist, Reducing Knowledge to Support Asset and Capability Deliveries", "paragraphs": ["MDA also continues to struggle with fully achieving its annual flight testing  goals. After MDA revised its approach to developing the annual  Integrated Master Test Plan in 2009, in February 2010, we recognized the  new test schedule\u2019s potential to address prior issues with shifting testing  requirements or test dates, and adding or deleting tests. MDA also  focused its testing to collect data necessary to support the development  of models and simulations.", "However, MDA\u2019s test plan has not stabilized. Since it formalized its  approach in 2010, MDA has continued to revise its test schedule  frequently by adding new tests, and deleting or delaying tests, in some  cases, multiple times and further into future fiscal years. As a result, less  testing is being conducted prior to delivery than originally planned, which  means less data are available to understand BMDS capabilities and  limitations. Specifically, preliminary observations from our fiscal year 2019  review show that from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2019, MDA has  conducted only 37% of its planned testing as originally scheduled, while  the remainder has been either been delayed, deleted or conducted in a  later fiscal year, as shown in figure 2.", "In addition, we reported in June 2019 that European Phased Adaptive  Approach (EPAA) Phase 3 testing against intermediate range ballistic  missiles (IRBM) had been reduced by 80 percent and MDA no longer  planned to conduct a flight test against a raid\u2014a likely tactic in a real- world attack\u2014prior to delivery. The lack of raid flight testing prevented the  accreditation of Aegis BMD models for assessment under those  circumstances in all fiscal year 2019 ground tests that included Aegis  BMD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balancing New Efforts with Existing Portfolio Needs will be Challenging", "paragraphs": ["MDA is currently at a pivotal crossroads, needing to balance its ability to  pursue new and advanced efforts while also maintaining its existing  portfolio of BMDS elements that have not transferred to the military  services as originally planned. The new and advanced efforts, such as  hypersonic defense and a Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) for GMD,  are research and development-intensive tasks, which carry significant  technical risks and financial commitments. If MDA\u2019s elements are not  transferred as originally intended, as they move further into production  and operations and sustainment these elements will continue to consume  a growing portion of the agency\u2019s budget.", "MDA and military services have taken some actions to prepare for  transferring the BMDS elements; however, the actions have not enabled  transfer primarily due to a lack of early and frequent coordination,  according to officials from the Undersecretary of Defense for Research  and Development and Acquisitions and Sustainment. Consequently, there  are overarching concerns related to transfer such as who funds the  sustainment of the elements which have not been resolved.
