Witnesses at a 2009 Subcommittee on Health, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, hearing raised concerns about inappropriate copayment charges, including some associated with veterans' service-connected conditions. As a result, members of the Subcommittee asked GAO to review (1) VHA copayment charge accuracy, including error rates and related causes, and (2) VHA efforts to monitor copayment charge accuracy. To assess the accuracy of VHA's billed copayment charges, GAO evaluated samples of fiscal year 2010 billed and unbilled medical services to determine copayment error rates and related causes. GAO also reviewed VHA practices related to monitoring the accuracy of copayment charges.."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the more than 56 million fiscal year 2010 veteran copayment charges billed by VHA, GAO estimates, based on its test of a probability sample of copayment charges, that 96 percent (or approximately 54.2 million) of the copayment charges were accurate and 4 percent (or approximately 2.3 million) were inaccurate. GAO's tests of a separate probability sample of the approximately 519 million VHA medical services that did not result in copayment charges showed that each of those VHA determinations was accurate. These and other estimated percentages are based on test results of probability samples and are subject to sampling error. Appendix I of this report contains additional information on the samples and the 95 percent confidence intervals for the estimates contained in this report. (1) Since the errors identified in GAO's probability sample all involved copayment overbilling, GAO estimates that 4 percent of the copayment charges involved overbilling of veterans. The errors GAO found were due to various factors, including inadequate review of previously billed copayment charges following retroactive changes in a veteran's service-connected conditions and the incorrect application of related medical reimbursements received from veterans' third-party insurance. (2) In tests GAO performed on another probability sample to identify underbilling errors in the approximately 519 million medical services that did not result in copayment charges, GAO found that VHA correctly determined that each tested service should not have resulted in a copayment charge. As a result, GAO tests showed that VHA accurately did not bill copayment charges for these services, which made up more than 90 percent of the approximately 576 million medical services provided during fiscal year 2010. While VHA performed various activities that involved reviewing the accuracy of some individual billed copayment charges, these activities do not constitute a systematic process for providing VHA-wide information on the accuracy and completeness of its copayment charges over time. In addition, GAO found that VHA had not established a performance measure for the accuracy level it wants to achieve in billing copayment charges. Without such a measure, it is not clear how the error rates GAO found would compare to error rates that VHA would consider acceptable, or if VHA would determine whether corrective actions need to be taken to reduce the error rates to lower levels. In addition, without a performance measure and periodic, systemwide information on the accuracy of its copayment charges, VHA cannot monitor changes in error rates and related causes over time. VHA also does not have meaningful performance information that it can provide to interested stakeholders when questions or concerns are raised concerning the accuracy of VHA's copayment charges billed to veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes two recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to (1) establish a copayment accuracy performance measure and (2) establish and implement a formal process for periodically assessing the accuracy of veteran copayment charges VHA-wide.

VHA is  authorized by law to bill certain veterans for copayments for some  medical services that are unrelated to conditions that VA has determined  to be a result of their military service. Medical services provided by VHA  include inpatient and outpatient services, prescription medication, home  health care, and extended care services, including nursing home and  respite care. Representatives of veterans service organizations testified  at a congressional hearing about their concerns that veterans were  being billed for inappropriate copayment charges, including copayments  billed for medical services linked to their service-connected conditions  and injuries and multiple copayment charges billed for the same medical  treatment. In light of these concerns, you asked us to review VHA\u2019s billing  practices. This report addresses (1) the accuracy rate of VHA\u2019s  copayment charges, including causes and rates of any over- and  underbilling errors and (2) whether VHA had systems and processes in  place to adequately monitor the accuracy of copayment charges billed to  veterans.", "In assessing the accuracy of VHA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 copayment charges  (the most recent fiscal year for which the information was available), we  first gained an understanding of VHA copayment billing practices by  reviewing information on VHA\u2019s systems and processes related to  determining which medical services should result in veteran copayment  charges and then for billing applicable copayment charges. In conducting  our work on copayment accuracy, including understanding VHA activities  related to assessing the accuracy of copayment charges, we reviewed  policies and procedures related to VHA\u2019s copayment billing process and  veterans\u2019 eligibility for medical care and copayment billing.

For each sampled medical service, we reviewed  relevant supporting documentation from VHA and from the Veterans  Benefits Administration (VBA), which included information regarding the  veterans\u2019 service-connected conditions. From this review, we determined  whether a veteran should have been billed a copayment charge for the  underlying medical service and, if so, whether the billed copayment  charge amount was correct or, if not, whether the copayment charge was  an over- or underbilling error. For each error identified, we determined the  causes. In addition, for three types of medical services\u2014inpatient,  extended care, and fee basis services\u2014that were not selected in our  sample because they infrequently result in copayment charges, we  selected and tested three nongeneralizable probability samples of a  limited number of copayment charges as case studies to gain some  insight into the types and causes of any errors that we identified in  copayment charges arising from these services. Finally, to determine  whether VHA has systems and processes in place to adequately monitor  the accuracy of billed veteran copayment charges, we obtained and  reviewed available information on VHA practices related to monitoring the  accuracy of billed veteran copayment charges.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2010 through August  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

As a result, we are 95 percent confident that for fiscal  year 2010, VHA\u2019s rate of error in the population of unbilled medical  services associated with incorrectly determining that medical services  should not have resulted in a copayment charge was between 0 percent  and 3 percent. (See table 3.)", "With respect to erroneous copayment charges and our estimated error  rate of 4 percent, we found that each of the four copayment errors  occurred in overbilling to a veteran because   the veteran was billed for an incorrect amount,   the charge should have been reversed or offset, or   if paid, the amount should have been refunded to the veteran.", "Also, three of the four errors we found had not been identified by VHA  prior to our selection of the copayment charges for testing. For the fourth  error, VHA learned about the error when the veteran notified VHA after  receiving a monthly statement containing the wrong copayment charge  amount.", "The four overbilling errors we found resulted from three causes. For one  of the errors, the copayment should not have been billed to the veteran  because, prior to billing the veteran, VHA had received sufficient third- party insurance reimbursement to offset the copayment and eliminate any  amount owed by the veteran. Two of the errors involved copayment  charges that were paid by the veterans but were not later refunded by  VHA as would have been correct following VBA decisions that resulted in  a retroactive change to the veterans\u2019 priority group status. VBA had  informed VHA that it had retroactively awarded the veterans either an  additional service-connected condition or increased a veteran\u2019s disability  rating, which led VHA to change the two veterans\u2019 priority groups. With a  (retroactive) change in priority group back to an effective date prior to the  medical service that led to the copayment charge we tested, each of the  veterans was no longer responsible for the copayment charge they had  paid. Once VHA revised the veterans\u2019 priority group status in response to  VBA\u2019s retroactive decisions, the veterans were due refunds for the two  paid copayment charges we tested. VHA had been aware of VBA\u2019s  retroactive award decisions for at least 4 months prior to our identification  of the copayments as errors; however, VHA had not determined that the  veterans were due refunds for the tested copayment charges. Following  our test-related inquiries, VHA officials provided us with documentation  that refunds to the veterans had been approved by VHA. The fourth  copayment error resulted when VHA incorrectly billed a veteran a  copayment amount for a 90-day prescription, instead of the smaller  copayment amount that was due for the 30-day prescription supply the  veteran received.

In each case, VHA had not identified the  copayment errors we found prior to our selecting the copayment charges  for testing. Two of the three overbilling errors we found in our case study  tests involved VHA\u2019s incorrect application of the veterans\u2019 third-party  insurance reimbursement to offset the veterans\u2019 copayment charges. The  third overbilling error occurred when VHA billed the veteran for a second  copayment charge in the same day, which generally is not permitted  under VHA\u2019s policy.

These data are key to correctly determining whether a medical service  should be billed to a veteran as a copayment charge and, if so, the  correct amount of the copayment. Of the 200 medical services we tested,  we found that the key data for 197 veterans were consistently and  correctly recorded by VBA and VHA\u2019s HEC and local medical centers. We  found two instances where specific elements of veteran data were not  consistently recorded in VHA records and one instance in which the  recorded data were incorrect. After following up with VHA on these  instances, VHA corrected the data. While these data recording errors did  not cause the particular copayment\u2013related charge or \u201cno bill\u201d decision  we tested to be inaccurate, they could have affected other VHA  copayment\u2013related decisions for these veterans.", "In one of the two data inconsistencies we found, HEC and the local VHA  medical center\u2019s records had the veteran\u2019s combined service-connected  condition percentage lower than what VBA had established, which  resulted in the veteran being assigned to an incorrect priority group. As a  result, if the veteran had been provided certain other medical services,  the data inconsistency could have caused the veteran to be incorrectly  charged a copayment. VHA officials said that the cause for the incorrect  data related to the data transfer from VBA to VHA\u2019s HEC and local  medical centers. According to VHA, the data transfer issue and the  incorrect data have since been corrected. In the other data inconsistency  instance, the disability rating recorded in HEC\u2019s and the medical center\u2019s  records were inconsistent, resulting in the medical center having the  veteran in an incorrect priority group. According to VHA, the data error  was due to problems during registration at the medical center, which have  since been resolved. The third data error involved a local medical center\u2019s  records having an incorrect priority group for a veteran. The medical  center had not received the information needed to update the veteran\u2019s  financial assessment (also known as a means test), which was necessary  to keep the veteran in a priority group that would have made him exempt  from paying certain copayments. After our follow-up inquiries, VHA  confirmed that at the time the medical service was provided, the veteran\u2019s  recorded priority group was incorrect, and the center has since received  the information necessary to update the financial assessment, and the  veteran\u2019s recorded priority group is now correct."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Does Not Monitor Its Systemwide Copayment Error Rates", "paragraphs": ["While various activities performed by VHA staff involve examining or  reviewing the accuracy of some individual veteran copayment charges,  we found that those activities do not provide VHA with systematic VHA- wide information on the accuracy of copayment charges needed to  effectively monitor\u2014over time\u2014the rates of and causes for copayment  errors.

VHA responds to veteran-related  questions or inquiries concerning specific copayment charges. In  doing so, VHA may evaluate some individual copayment charges and  determine whether they were accurate. However, VHA does not  systematically track and analyze the results of these individual  reviews, including whether the copayment charges were accurate or  inaccurate and, if applicable, the cause of any inaccuracies.   \uf0b7  Revenue reviews. Staff from VA\u2019s Management Quality Assurance  Service\u2019s (MQAS) Health Care Financial Assurance Division may  evaluate specific veteran copayment bills on a limited, ad hoc basis as  part of the recurring reviews of VA revenue activities at selected  individual medical centers. During these reviews, MQAS officials said  they devote most of their resources to evaluating third-party insurance  collections, as they make up the majority of the Medical Care  Collections Fund (MCCF). These revenue reviews are focused on  third-party insurance recoveries and in only some instances may  involve reviewing the accuracy of individual veteran copayment  charges.    \uf0b7  Local compliance programs. Individual medical centers and  Consolidated Patient Account Centers (CPAC) have decentralized  compliance programs that include varied processes and procedures  related to reviewing some individual copayment charges. The scope  and results of these compliance reviews may involve reviewing  copayment\u2013related charges but do not routinely include a systematic  assessment of a probability sample of copayment charge accuracy. In  addition, the results of any reviews of copayment charge accuracy at  medical centers and CPAC locations are not consolidated and  reported to VHA management.   \uf0b7  Targeted reviews of certain copayment charges. VHA instituted a  policy in October 2006, in response to a VA Inspector General  report, requiring VHA\u2019s Compliance and Business Integrity (CBI)  Office to identify delinquent copayment debts for certain veterans  whose accounts were being referred to debt collection. VHA facilities  were required to review the accounts to help ensure that the referrals  were not based on inaccurate copayment charges. Initially, the policy  required the VHA facilities to report to the CBI Office the results of  their targeted reviews until the error rate in the applicable copayment  charges went below 10 percent for two consecutive quarters. As a  result of a sustained decrease in the related billing error rate, in  October 2009, the CBI Office stopped collecting national monitoring  results from VHA facilities, and in March 2010, VHA rescinded the  requirements for facilities to report the results of their quarterly  reviews to the CBI Office.

In doing so, VBA adjudicates  veteran claims by determining whether a veteran\u2019s illness or injury was  incurred in or aggravated by the veteran\u2019s military service (i.e., a service- connected condition). Once awarded to a veteran, a service-connected  condition is considered a \u201crated\u201d service-connected condition. Additional  service-connected conditions may also result in a change to a veteran\u2019s  disability rating. VBA sends the veteran a notification letter informing him  or her of the award decision, including the additional service-connected  condition, applicable changes in disability rating, and the effective date of  the award determination.

Veterans covered by section 1710(e) are enrolled in  priority group 6.

For example, an outpatient visit for  immunizations or preventive screenings is included in the no copayment  tier. A basic (nonspecialty) outpatient service, which includes primary  care visits for diagnosis and management of acute and chronic  conditions, has a $15 copayment. A specialty outpatient service, which  requires a referral, includes cardiology services and radiology services,  such as magnetic resonance imagery, has a $50 copayment. If the  medical service, which might otherwise have an applicable copayment, is  determined to be related to a veteran\u2019s service-connected condition or  special treatment authority, then no copayment charge would be due.

The billing system  also tracks all prescription copayment charges billed to a veteran at all  medical center sites to ensure that the annual maximum prescription  billing cap is not exceeded. For fee basis care, staff at the local VHA  facilities who process claims submitted by non-VHA providers for  reimbursement for the cost of medical services provided to veterans  outside of VHA medical centers also manually establish a veteran  copayment charge in the billing system if the medical service in question  would have resulted in a copayment charge had the service been  provided in a VHA facility.", "If a veteran has active third-party health insurance, VHA\u2019s policy is to file  a claim with the veteran\u2019s third-party insurer seeking reimbursement of  costs related to medical services covered by the veteran\u2019s third-party  insurance that were not related to a veteran\u2019s service-connected  conditions or special treatment authorities. VHA is authorized to pursue  reimbursement from third-party insurers regardless of whether the  services were provided by VHA or non-VHA providers. Under this policy,  VHA is required to apply any related insurance reimbursement received  to reduce or eliminate any related pending copayment charges due from  the veteran. As a result, if a veteran has third-party insurance and is  subject to a copayment charge, the copayment charge is not billed to the  veteran on the monthly statement for up to 90 days to allow time for VHA  to receive and apply reimbursement from the veteran\u2019s third-party insurer.  If the reimbursement received does not fully cover or offset the veteran\u2019s  copayment obligation, the veteran is responsible for any balance.", "Unless reimbursement received from a veteran\u2019s third-party health insurer  is applied to eliminate or reduce the pending copayment charge, the  original copayment charge is released after 90 days, and the charge  appears on the veteran\u2019s subsequent monthly billing statement.  Applicable third-party insurance reimbursement received after the  copayment charge is billed to the veteran should still be applied to reduce  or eliminate a copayment charge if still unpaid, or used to provide a  refund of the billed amount if the veteran has paid the amount. According  to VHA procedures, this process, which is known as the third-party  insurance offset, is manual and is to be performed on a daily basis after  third-party insurance reimbursement is received by local facility staff.", "VHA is expected to adjust copayment charges or issue copayment  refunds when certain matters related to the billed amount change. When  a third-party insurance reimbursement that would fully offset or reduce a  billed copayment charge is received, VHA is expected to eliminate or  reduce the amount billed to the veteran\u2019s account, and if the amount was  previously paid by the veteran, VHA is responsible for initiating a refund  to the veteran. In addition, when VBA notifies VHA of a new retroactively  awarded service-connected condition or an increased disability rating for  a veteran, VHA staff are to review the veteran\u2019s account to determine  whether any previously billed copayment charges for services provided  after the effective date of the retroactive VBA award determination should  be canceled (if unpaid) or refunded (if paid)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, John J.
