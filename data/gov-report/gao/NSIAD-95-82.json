The MTCR, the only multilateral missile nonproliferation regime, is a voluntary arrangement among countries that share a common interest in arresting missile proliferation. It is not a treaty. The regime consists of common export policy guidelines applied to a common list of controlled items that each MTCR member implements in accordance with its national legislation. Currently, 25 states are formal partners to the MTCR, while an additional  7 states, including China, have adhered or declared an intention to adhere to the MTCR Guidelines. (See app. I for a complete list of current MTCR partners and adherents or declared adherents.)", "The MTCR Annex divides controlled items into two categories, Category I and Category II items. Category I items are subject to a strong presumption of denial and are rarely licensed for export. They include such items as complete missile systems; unmanned air-vehicle systems, such as cruise missiles; and certain complete subsystems, such as rocket engines and guidance sets. Category II (dual-use) covers a wide range of commodities, including propellants, test equipment, and flight instruments, that could be used for missiles or satellite launches. Category II items must be evaluated case-by-case against specified criteria and if judged to be destined for use in weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, or biological) are subject to a strong presumption of denial.", "Federal law regulates the exports of missiles and related technology and requires licenses for the export from the United States of certain missiles, components, and technology specified in the MTCR Annex. The State Department supervises and directs all governmental arms transfers and licenses commercial arms transfers, including U.S. exports of missile items and technology. The Commerce Department licenses exports of dual-use goods and technology, which are controlled for missile technology reasons pursuant to the MTCR Annex to all countries. It has jurisdiction over production equipment for MTCR Annex items, which is controlled as either Category I or Category II, depending on the type of equipment involved.", "Violators of U.S. export laws are subject to criminal and civil penalties and economic sanctions. Federal laws require the President to impose sanctions on U.S. and foreign individuals and entities that improperly conduct trade in controlled missile technology. Also, such sanctions would apply to a country with a nonmarket economy, such as China, to all activities of that government, with some qualifications (1) relating to the development or production of any missile equipment or technology and (2) affecting the development or production of electronics, space systems or equipment, and military aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of MTCR-Related Exports to China", "paragraphs": ["MTCR-related licenses comprised a very small portion of total export license activity for China. However, DOD has questioned whether Commerce has been adequately identifying for interagency referral and review all the applications for the export of dual-use missile-related technologies.", "The Commerce Department initially determines which commodities might contain missile technology. It independently determines that dual-use license applications do not involve missile technology, but if it believes that they might contain missile technology and the destination is a country of concern, Commerce is to refer these applications to the interagency Missile Technology Export Controls (MTEC) group. The group consists of working-level representatives of DOD, the Departments of State and Commerce, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, U.S. Customs Service, the intelligence community, and others at the invitation of the Chair and concurrence of the group. The MTEC\u2019s charter calls for it to meet as required to review license applications for U.S. exports of missile proliferation concern, referred according to agreed criteria. The MTEC evaluates the transfer in terms of the MTCR and U.S. nonproliferation policy. Commerce can also refer applications to the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s Nonproliferation Center for information on the suitability of end-users.", "In addition to the multilateral MTCR, the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of December 1990, a unilateral U.S. control, provides a \u201ccatch-all\u201d control by directing that items going to destinations of concern, regardless of whether they are on proliferation control lists, are to be referred to the interagency review process. The Initiative expanded missile technology export controls by requiring U.S. exporters to request an export license for any item that they know or have been informed by the U.S. government is destined for a project of proliferation concern. The Initiative was designed to give the U.S. government a safety net by allowing it to apply export controls when it learns about a pending transaction that risks helping a weapon program, but which is not explicitly covered by the current Commerce Control List.", "To deter and detect the diversion of dual-use exports to proliferation activities, Commerce or other consulting agencies may request pre-license checks or post-shipment verifications. Pre-license checks are used to establish the legitimacy of the end user or verify the intended use of the export; post-shipment verifications are used to ascertain whether exported items are being used appropriately. The State Department operates a similar program of end-use checks, called the BLUE LANTERN program. The government may also seek assurances from foreign governments that items will not be diverted to proliferation-related uses.", "The Commerce and State Departments approved a total of 67 export licenses worth about $530 million for missile-related items for China for fiscal years 1990 through 1993.

As a result, there is little transparency into the dual-use missile technology licensing process by officials outside of the Commerce Department. Increasing the transparency of the license applications that Commerce reviews would have the result of either allowing other agencies to find deficiencies in Commerce\u2019s efforts at identifying missile-related exports or, conversely, of reassuring them that Commerce\u2019s review procedures are appropriate and properly implemented.", "Commerce officials said that Commerce has sole responsibility for classifying commodities on the Commerce Control List.

However, high-level Defense Technology Security Administration officials said that they were unfamiliar with referral criteria for MTCR Annex items and that there was no written agreement on such referrals between DOD and the Commerce Department. In fact, DOD requested a review of criteria and referral procedures in May 1994 and corresponded with Commerce several times on how to implement it. Also, the current and past chairmen of MTEC criticized Commerce\u2019s referral of missile technology cases for interagency review. The current chairman said that Commerce would not release to State the Licensing Officer\u2019s Operating Manual, which contains referral criteria. The officials further said that Commerce does not have the technical expertise to properly review missile technology applications and should not be pre-screening them.", "Commerce Department officials believe that the question of referrals and other agencies\u2019 concerns has already been resolved by the executive branch\u2019s 1994 proposal to amend the Export Administration Act. According to Commerce officials, that proposal would have afforded all relevant agencies, including DOD, the right to see all dual-use license applications.

These types include some foreign government entities whose activities are usually self-explanatory, public service organizations, and some foreign trade organizations. Available data showed that about 31 percent of all 10,860 license applications for China during fiscal years 1990 through 1993 were referred to the Nonproliferation Center. However, Commerce officials said that this percentage would be higher because inconsistent recording of license application referrals by licensing officers precluded an accurate accounting of the number of applications referred to the Nonproliferation Center.", "Officials from various U.S. government agencies indicated that it is difficult to determine which companies in China are truly privately owned and operated and which are adjuncts to the Chinese government.

In addition, we discussed the MTCR, China, and missile proliferation issues with officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and the National Air Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. We reviewed annual proliferation reports to Congress, a report on exports of sensitive technologies to Chinese sensitive end users, hard copy of a database on sensitive end users in China, and excerpts pertaining to China of the log of an MTCR interagency group.

This was important because the Commerce Department makes unilateral determinations that license applications are not MTCR-related and, therefore, do not require full interagency review for approval. We also asked that they identify sensitive end users among the listed ultimate consignees on the applications to be provided. After we presented this request to the teams of analysts and one team agreed to provide this analysis, we were told that a high-level interagency meeting of involved agencies resulted in directing the agencies of the three teams not to provide an analysis of the need for interagency review because it was not within their authority to do so. Consequently, two teams agreed to perform the analysis of sensitive end users only. As a result, we were unable to benefit from the expertise of the technical specialists in assessing the technology of the sample of licenses and the appropriateness of Commerce Department decisions. In addition, the agency of the third team of analysts did not decide within our required timeframes whether or not it would participate in the requested analysis.", "To evaluate the Commerce Department\u2019s pre-license check/post-shipment verification program in China for dual-use items, we reviewed records at both the Commerce Department in Washington, D.C., and at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. We also talked to officials at both locations. Our review included gathering statistical data and reviewing cable traffic on checks and verifications done in China for all types of technology for the period of fiscal years 1990 through 1993.
