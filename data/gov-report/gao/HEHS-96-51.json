The DI program offers partial income replacement for disabled workers who have earned Social Security benefits. The SSI program provides federal and state cash assistance to people who are elderly, blind, or disabled, regardless of insured status, whose income and resources are below a specified amount. In the legislation authorizing the SSI and DI programs, the Congress articulated its aim to rehabilitate into productive activity as many disability benefit recipients as possible.", "Consistent with this goal, the Congress has passed several work incentive provisions to reduce the risks of seeking employment for recipients, by safeguarding cash and medical benefits while a recipient tries to work. One such provision authorized the plan for achieving self-support (PASS) program as part of the SSI program in 1972. In explaining this provision, the pertinent House Report stated that the Ways and Means Committee wanted to \u201cprovide every encouragement and opportunity\u201d for participants to work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The DI and SSI Programs", "paragraphs": ["The DI program, authorized in 1956, provides cash and medical benefits to workers under age 65 who become disabled and cannot continue working, as well as to their dependents. The DI program is funded through Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes paid into a trust fund by employers and workers. In 1994, 3.3 million people with disabilities were enrolled in DI and received, on average, cash benefits of about $660 a month.", "The SSI program was authorized in 1972 under title XVI of the Social Security Act as a means-tested income assistance program for people who are elderly, blind, or disabled. Unlike DI beneficiaries, SSI recipients do not need to have a work history to qualify for benefits, but need only have low income and limited assets. General government revenues provide the federal funding for the SSI program, while some states supplement federal payments with their own funds. SSI disabled beneficiaries receive an average monthly cash benefit of about $380 (beneficiaries in the 43 states that provide a monthly supplement received, on average, an additional $110 in 1993) and immediate Medicaid eligibility in most states. In 1994, 2.3 million blind and disabled adults under age 65 and 893,000 children were enrolled in SSI. Individuals who are insured under Social Security, but fall below SSI\u2019s income and resource eligibility threshold, can qualify for both DI and SSI benefits. An additional 671,000 people under age 65, called concurrent beneficiaries, were enrolled in both programs in 1994.", "To be considered disabled under either program, a person must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last not less than 12 months or result in death. The severity of the impairment must prevent the applicant not only from doing his or her previous work, if any, but also from engaging in any other kind of substantial work in the national economy, considering his or her age, education, and work experience. The process used to determine eligibility for benefits is the same for both programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PASS Program Structure and Participants", "paragraphs": ["In establishing the SSI and DI programs, the Congress considered it very important that disabled persons be helped to return to self-supporting employment wherever possible. To this end, over the years the Congress has enacted numerous work incentive provisions in both the SSI and DI programs to encourage more people to work their way off the disability rolls. These include the PASS program and extended eligibility for Medicare benefits to working DI beneficiaries. During a beneficiary\u2019s work attempt, these work incentive provisions allow varying degrees of safeguards for cash and medical benefits, as well as program eligibility. However, despite the Congress\u2019 aim to return the maximum number of DI and SSI beneficiaries to work, few beneficiaries have actually done so. Only 1 in every 500 DI beneficiaries is terminated from the rolls because he or she has returned to work. While SSA has no comparable measures for the SSI population, we recently reported that this population\u2019s return-to-work rate is similarly low.", "The PASS program was established by the Congress as part of the SSI program to assist disability benefit recipients with beginning or returning to work. The PASS program is administered by staff in the approximately 1,300 SSA field offices nationwide, based on policy and regulations developed by SSA headquarters staff in the Office of Program Benefits Policy. The Program Operations Manual System (POMS) is the primary policy guidance to staff on the PASS program. Work incentive staff in SSA\u2019s 10 regional offices provide additional guidance and oversight to field office staff. In December 1994, about 10,300 individuals participated in the PASS program and had active PASSes.", "In commenting on the PASS provision, the pertinent House Report stated that it should be \u201cliberally construed,\u201d and SSA headquarters has chosen to place few constraints on the program in regulations or in the POMS. For example, there is no required application format and no limit on the number of approved plans an individual can have in a lifetime. PASSes are written plans, developed specifically for an individual, that identify a work goal and the items and services needed to achieve that goal. (For a sample plan format, see app. I.) To purchase these items and services, PASS program participants may use any non-SSI income or resources they have\u2014for example, DI benefits or wages from a job. Anyone can write a PASS\u2014the disability benefit recipient, an SSA staff member, a vocational rehabilitation professional, staff from another agency, or a relative or friend; no vocational rehabilitation expertise is required.", "Normally, any additional income or resources would reduce the amount of the SSI payment, but SSA disregards the income and resources included in a PASS when determining income available to the SSI recipient. Consequently, excluding income and resources to pursue a work goal under a PASS can result in additional monthly SSI cash payments. For example, an SSI recipient earning $300 a month in a part-time job is normally eligible for about $350 in SSI benefits, if he or she is single and lives alone. However, using a PASS, this individual could use these earnings to pay for classes and transportation to school to become an accountant and receive the maximum 1995 federal benefit of $458 each month.", "As currently implemented, the PASS program can also be used to establish eligibility for SSI by disabled individuals whose incomes or resources would otherwise exceed program eligibility limits. If a DI beneficiary who receives $620 a month in benefits, for example, can set $300 of this income aside under a PASS to pursue a work goal, he or she becomes eligible for SSI payments because his or her countable income is less than the federal SSI eligibility rate. Eligibility for SSI usually brings eligibility for other means-tested benefits, including Medicaid and food stamps.", "PASSes are submitted to staff in one of the SSA field offices for review. These staff approve or deny plans on the basis of the work goal\u2019s feasibility and adjust SSI payment levels for approved plans. Work goals must be stated in terms of specific job titles or professions. For example, education can be part of a plan but cannot be a goal in itself. As long as applicants specify a different work goal in each PASS, there is also no limit placed on the number of plans one individual can have, although only one plan can be active at a time and each PASS is limited to a maximum of 48 months. However, interim guidelines issued in January 1995, in response to a mandate in the Social Security Independence and Program Improvement Act of 1994, allow additional 6-month extensions to ongoing plans.", "In December 1994, PASS participants represented only about three-tenths of 1 percent of the working-age disabled SSI population. The number of PASSes varies by state, with clusters in areas where outreach by professional PASS preparers and service providers has been greatest. As a result, knowledge of and experience with the PASS program varies greatly among field offices and staff. Some offices have no active PASSes, while administering the PASS program constitutes a significant workload in others. Compared with other SSI recipients, PASS program participants are generally younger and more often men. In addition, PASS program participants are more likely to have mental illness as their disabling condition. For a more detailed description of the demographics of program participants, see appendix II.", "The PASS program is unique among all DI and SSI work incentives because it is available to disabled individuals who are not already working. Specifically, the PASS provision allows participants to exclude unearned, as well as earned, income for consideration in determining benefit amount. All other work incentive protections, such as extended eligibility for health and cash benefits for working recipients, apply to earned income only. Furthermore, while SSI and DI beneficiaries who work can use the impairment-related work expense provision to deduct from their gross wages the cost of items and services needed to work, only half these costs are offset by increased SSI benefits. In contrast, PASS expenses are deducted after all other exclusions when determining an individual\u2019s countable income, and therefore fully subsidized by additional SSI cash payments, up to the maximum benefit amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["House Conference Report 103-670, accompanying the Social Security Independence and Program Improvement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-296), asked that we review SSA\u2019s PASS program. Specifically, we were asked to provide data for the last 5 years, to the extent possible, on (1) the number and characteristics of individuals who have applied for a plan, (2) the number and characteristics of those whose plans have been approved, (3) the kinds of plans that have been approved and their duration, (4) the success of individuals in fulfilling their plans, and (5) the extent to which individuals who have completed a PASS have become economically self-sufficient. We were also asked to study whether improvements can or should be made to the PASS program, including the process used to approve plans. Because SSA\u2019s Office of Program Integrity Review was already tracking PASS program participants\u2019 compliance with their plans and the outcome of PASS program participation, we focused our efforts on PASS program management and internal controls.", "To analyze PASS program implementation and determine what changes and improvements were needed, we reviewed PASS guidance, legislation, and regulations. We also interviewed Social Security headquarters staff responsible for the program and monitored an SSA work group charged with considering PASS program policy changes. In addition, we met with staff in 19 SSA field offices, located in California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont, and Wisconsin, that had high numbers of active PASSes to discuss their experience with the work incentive. (For a list of locations visited, see app. III.) In these same states, we met with 38 individuals, representing 32 different organizations, who prepare PASSes for disability benefit recipients. In addition, we spoke with the PASS program liaison in each of the 10 SSA regional offices to learn about program trends nationwide.", "To determine the numbers and characteristics of PASSes and program participants, we analyzed an extract of the Supplemental Security Record (SSR), the main database of SSI participants. We also used data from the SSR, the Master Beneficiary Record (MBR) of DI beneficiaries, and SSA\u2019s Master Earnings File maintained for all workers to assess the current earnings and benefit status of former PASS participants. We were unable to evaluate program impact, because most program participation has been recent, and SSA has only 4 years of historical data on the PASS program, which includes no data on the outcomes of program participation. In addition, individuals self-select into the PASS program, and may already be different from other SSI and DI beneficiaries in ways that would affect their future employment and earnings. Finally, we reviewed 380 randomly selected PASS files in 17 field offices to gather additional data about PASSes, including the types of work goals and proposed purchases. We did not, however, verify that specific program participants complied with the goals and activities specified in their PASSes. For more information about our methodology, see appendix IV.", "We did our work between January and November 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PASS Program Reflects Management Inattention", "paragraphs": ["SSA has not translated the PASS program\u2019s goals of providing opportunities for participants to work into a well-defined program structure with specific objectives. Confusion about program objectives has resulted in different and sometimes conflicting PASS approvals and denials across field offices. In addition, SSA field office staff find it difficult to approve or deny PASSes because SSA headquarters has not developed clear criteria for evaluating PASSes. Most field office staff do not have expertise or training in evaluating work opportunities for people with disabilities, whose needs are extremely diverse. Reflecting this diversity, the PASSes we reviewed encompassed a wide array of work goals, from janitorial work to professional positions, and included expenditures ranging from business cards to new cars. Finally, the PASS program includes primarily DI beneficiaries, many of whom use the PASS program to gain eligibility for federal SSI payments.", "Because SSA has not developed measures to evaluate how well the PASS program is helping participants become or stay employed, the agency lacks adequate management data on PASS use. For this reason, we could not accurately measure PASS program impact. We did find that many former PASS participants are earning enough income to at least reduce their SSI payments, compared with other SSI recipients, although many had worked prior to participating in the PASS program. Few, however, have earned enough to end SSI payments. In addition, nearly all concurrent beneficiaries continue to receive DI benefits after their plans end, even if they leave the SSI program, limiting the potential federal savings stemming from the PASS program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PASS Goals and Expenditures Vary", "paragraphs": ["The 380 PASSes we reviewed encompassed a wide variety of goals, including increasing hours and responsibilities at a current job, seeking a new job, or pursuing education as a step toward work. (See fig. 2.1.) About one-third of plans had education as a major component, although the level of education desired ranged from attending culinary school to pursuing a Ph.D. in philosophy. Another one-third of PASS program applicants were seeking new jobs, while about 10 percent proposed to maintain or increase their hours or responsibilities at a current job. For those individuals proposing specific occupational goals, the demands of these jobs, as well as their likely income, were highly variable. We found that many PASSes were written to help applicants achieve low-skill, low-wage service jobs, such as janitorial work, product assembly, or employment in fast-food restaurants; however, we also saw plans written to help participants become psychotherapists, computer programmers, engineers, and college professors. Some program participants\u2019 goals were more unusual, involving self-employment in music, arts, and crafts. Self-employment was the goal in 15 percent of the PASSes we reviewed, including small businesses in tailoring, tree stump removal, and window washing. In addition, some PASS program participants were approved to support themselves as professional PASS preparers, writing plans for other disability benefit recipients for a fee. (See app. V for a sample of occupational goals listed on the approved PASSes we reviewed.)", "The proposed purchases listed on PASSes varied, as did their cost. Automobiles (new and used vehicles as well as insurance, maintenance, and modification costs), tuition, and computers were common items in PASS budgets. More than 80 percent of the plans we reviewed included at least one of these items. Costs for these items ranged from a $41,000 wheelchair-modified van or thousands of dollars in highly specialized computer equipment to a $19 monthly bus pass. SSA has placed no absolute limits on the types or costs of items that PASSes can be used to purchase as long as they are necessary to achieve the work goal and reasonably priced. The wide range of approved purchases we saw included photographic film, cellular telephone service, business advertising, professional attire, job coaching, and school supplies.", "The total budget also ranged considerably in the PASSes we reviewed, depending on the amount of the income excluded and the plan\u2019s time length. The average monthly exclusion for all PASSes in December 1994 was $400, although some individuals were excluding more than $1,000 a month. Total costs associated with a single PASS could be significant; for example, one plan had a budget of $67,233 for an individual to return to work as a radiological technologist, which included items such as a standing wheelchair, a modified van and insurance, a track lift system, and a computer. Field staff in at least eight of the offices we visited raised concerns about PASS applications in which proposed purchases were exactly equal to total excludable income. Several PASS preparers confirmed that they develop budgets based on the maximum excludable income, regardless of the occupational goal.", "We were not able to determine the average time length of PASSes, because extensions and end-dates were not always documented in the files we reviewed. In addition, this information is not captured in the Supplemental Security Record (SSR), the database of SSI recipients. We found, however, that half of the current exclusions as of December 1994 had been active 9 or fewer months. In addition, more than 1,700 PASSes begun in 1993 were no longer active in December 1994. No comprehensive data are currently available on the total number of PASS applications, because SSA does not track denied plans. However, staff in almost all the field offices we visited agreed that the majority of PASSes are approved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PASS Program Not Well Defined, Growing", "paragraphs": ["SSA has neither clearly articulated the objectives of the PASS program nor established criteria for evaluating whether an individual plan will be successful. This lack of clear goals is reflected in inadequate guidance to field office staff and inconsistent and inefficient PASS program administration. Our interviews revealed a wide range of standards applied by SSA field office staff and third-party PASS preparers in assessing the feasibility of individual PASSes, ranging from cessation of all disability benefits to improved quality of life. Current PASS participants constitute less than 1 percent of the working-age SSI population; nonetheless, the number of PASSes has grown by more than 500 percent in the last 5 years. As a result of congressional direction to liberally construe the PASS provision, SSA has permitted individuals to become eligible for SSI by using a PASS.

As a result, the SSA field office staff and third-party PASS preparers we interviewed used different, and sometimes conflicting, interpretations of successful outcomes when developing and reviewing individual PASSes. For example, some field office staff will not approve a PASS unless they believe it will result in the applicant leaving the disability rolls, while the preparer may have written it to give the applicant a chance to attend school and try working, but not become self-supporting.", "SSA field office staff in nearly all the offices we visited said that PASS use should result in a reduction, if not cessation, of SSI benefits. While 10 of the 38 PASS preparers we interviewed shared this view, others offered broader definitions of success, including working or attending school, improved self-esteem, and fuller participation in society. Some PASS preparers and SSA staff expressed concern that immediate economic self-sufficiency was not feasible for some members of the SSI population, and that the appropriate PASS outcome depended on the individual.", "PASS program guidance from SSA headquarters to the field offices contributes to confusion over the goal of the work incentive. Prior to January 1995, the POMS, SSA\u2019s primary written guidance to field office staff who administer the PASS program, stated that the occupational objectives on PASSes must ultimately produce enough additional earned income to reduce or eliminate SSI payments. The guidance also noted that the PASS program was \u201cnot intended to subsidize a continuing level of current work activity.\u201d In contrast, the POMS transmittal concerning PASS issued in January 1995 directed field office staff to evaluate individual PASSes in terms of the applicant\u2019s higher earnings potential upon completion of the PASS, and weakens the link between earnings and benefits payments. In addition, this guidance includes increased on-the-job independence and decreased reliance on employment support, irrespective of earnings, as acceptable PASS goals. According to field office staff, the verbal guidance they receive from regional and headquarters staff encourages them to be liberal and err on the side of approving individual PASSes. Agency literature available to SSI recipients primarily defines the PASS program in terms of employment goals, with little or no focus on reduced or eliminated benefits, or increased earnings potential.", "SSA field office staff in half the offices we visited said PASS approvals and denials were inconsistent, and nearly all field office staff expressed frustration with the inadequate guidance they received from SSA headquarters on approving or denying PASSes. Some SSA field and regional offices have developed their own guidance for approving PASSes to compensate for gaps they see in the POMS. As a result, we found that the PASS program was implemented differently by location or even by individuals in the same location, depending on the prevailing beliefs about program goals. For example, some field offices in Wisconsin use a PASS evaluation form that requires applicants to estimate their pre- and post-PASS earnings to demonstrate increased earnings capacity before they will approve a plan. Staff in other field offices said they only look to see if there is even a \u201cremote chance\u201d of achieving a proposed occupational goal. The basis for decisions about acceptable cost items also varies. For example, some field office staff approved computer expenditures for students without documentation that computers were required, while staff in another office denied a request for computer equipment, noting that the university the applicant planned to attend did not require students to have computers. Work incentive staff in some regional offices review PASS approvals and denials made by the field offices; however, staff in SSA\u2019s headquarters do not provide direct oversight of this process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Has Few Participants, but More Growth Predicted", "paragraphs": ["PASS program participants in December 1994 represented only three-tenths of 1 percent of the working-age SSI population. Nonetheless, the number of PASSes has risen dramatically in recent years, from 1,546 in March 1990 to 10,329 in December 1994. PASS program growth has been much slower during 1995; the number of plans increased by only 169 between December 1994 and June 1995. However, SSA field staff in 15 of the 19 offices we visited predicted that the number of PASSes will continue to grow. Several PASS preparers also told us they believe that more outreach will increase PASS use. Outreach efforts, especially by outside organizations, have already increased awareness of the PASS program. For example, in the Denver area, several professional PASS preparers have established businesses that seek out clients. Since the late 1980s, individuals and organizations across the nation have assisted disability benefit recipients to understand and use work incentives, especially the PASS program. At the same time, some state agencies that provide employment services to the disabled have started to use PASSes to supplement other funds. Private agencies, too, are being encouraged to look at the PASS program as a funding source for their clients.", "The potential universe of PASS program participants is significant and increasing with the recent tremendous growth in the number of federal disability benefit recipients.

Of the approximately 10,300 PASS participants in December 1994, about 75 percent were concurrent beneficiaries, many of whom would not receive federal SSI benefits without a PASS. In comparison, about 30 percent of disabled adults in the overall SSI program also received DI benefits. We estimated that, overall, more than 40 percent of all PASS program participants had earned or unearned income, primarily DI benefits, in excess of the eligibility level for federal SSI benefits. These individuals received, on average, $318 in monthly federal SSI payments. Without the PASS program, they would not have been eligible to receive any federal SSI payments. The federal cost of PASS program participation for these individuals who use a PASS to establish SSI eligibility is often higher than just the SSI payment, because the participants may also gain access to other means-tested benefits, such as Medicaid and food stamps, while retaining access to DI payments and Medicare. In these instances, Medicaid supplements Medicare benefits, covering deductibles, medications, and other medical costs not covered by Medicare. Nearly one-fourth of recipients whose plans started in 1994 first applied for SSI benefits that year.", "PASS program participation for SSI recipients who are not concurrent beneficiaries is generally limited to those who are already working and can exclude their earned income or who receive other types of income or resources, such as an inheritance.

This information may not be otherwise available to field office staff. Because of this inconsistency, staff may approve or deny PASSes without knowledge of the applicant\u2019s skills, education, work history, impairments, or even the disabling condition. Further, PASSes are not required to provide any information about the demands of the proposed job, and required skills and qualifications. We also found that diagnosis information was missing on the SSR, which is accessible by field office staff, for more than 40 percent of recipients with PASSes in December 1994.

As a result, staff in every office we visited reported that they do not feel equipped to adequately evaluate PASS work goals and expenditures. Staff in half of these field offices described the evaluation process as inconsistent between and often within offices, and some noted it was unfair to PASS program applicants. SSA headquarters staff are aware of the field staff\u2019s concerns, which were discussed at a 1994 work group on the PASS program.

In addition, at least 14 of 38 PASS preparers raised concerns about field office staff\u2019s lack of awareness and understanding about disability issues, including the vocational capabilities of people with disabilities.

When no licensed or accredited vocational rehabilitation agency or individual has been involved in developing a PASS, field office staff can seek outside input from a vocational rehabilitation or other employment services agency, or use their \u201cjudgment and intuition\u201d to determine PASS feasibility. As a result, SSA field office staff can make highly individual decisions about plans based on their personal beliefs. For example, one field office staff member told us she denied a plan with the goal of writing a cookbook because she believed there were already too many cookbooks on the market. Furthermore, if they seek guidance outside of SSA, field office staff are limited to vocational agencies willing to provide evaluations of the feasibility of proposed work goals at no cost, unless the program applicant agrees to include the cost of the evaluation on his or her PASS. These agencies, however, are not required to advise SSA, and we found that some public agencies did not provide assistance to SSA field offices for individuals who were not already their clients. Field office staff also contact regional or central office work incentive staff with questions about feasibility; however, the staff in the regional and central offices are not necessarily trained in vocational rehabilitation.", "The field office staff\u2019s lack of vocational rehabilitation knowledge and the limited guidance they receive also limits their ability to evaluate whether charges for particular items in PASS budgets are reasonable or necessary.

In addition, some field office staff said they have difficulty evaluating specialized or highly technical equipment with which they are not familiar.

According to the current POMS, PASS preparation fees should be evaluated on the basis of the preparer\u2019s involvement in formulating the plan, including the type of work done and number of hours. However, the absence of preparer standards and qualifications and the lack of nationwide SSA guidelines on appropriate charges make this guidance difficult for SSA field staff to administer.

Through its recently assembled work group, SSA is planning to address some of the design and internal control weaknesses we identified, but it is too early to determine whether SSA\u2019s actions will be effective."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["The Congress may wish to consider whether individuals otherwise financially ineligible for SSI because their DI benefits or other income exceeds the eligibility threshold should continue to gain eligibility for SSI through the PASS program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["SSA needs to make major improvements in the management of the PASS program to achieve more consistent administration, better support field staff, collect data sufficient to control and evaluate the program, and provide internal controls against program waste and abuse. We recommend that the Commissioner take the following actions, or, if necessary, seek legislation to do the following: clarify the goals of the PASS program; decide whether fees paid to third parties should continue to be disregarded when calculating benefit payment amounts and whether the amount of disregarded fees should be capped; standardize the PASS program, including the application, reporting guidelines on expenditures for compliance reviews, and informational and educational materials for PASS preparers; improve support to field staff, including enhancing their ability to evaluate the feasibility of proposed work goals, and requiring PASSes to incorporate additional data relevant to determining their feasibility, including the applicant\u2019s disability, previous work experience, if any, and education; gather additional management data on PASS program participation and impact, and use these data to evaluate the impact of PASS program participation on employment; and strengthen internal controls by establishing more specific guidelines on acceptable PASS expenditures, developing penalties for willful noncompliance with the PASS program, including a determination of whether subsequent plans are permissible, examining the role of third-party preparers, including their potential financial conflicts of interest, and considering the strength of existing safeguards against abuse when determining the appropriate limits on the length and number of PASSes individual participants may have."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["SSA generally concurred with our recommendations, and cited in its comments actions it intends to take to address them, including such actions as developing a standardized application form and providing improved support to field office staff.
