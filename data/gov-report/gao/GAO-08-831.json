Our prior work examining successful organizational transformations shows the need to communicate to stakeholders often and early and to clearly define specific objectives. Since the Joint ORS Office was established in May 2007, it has developed a process for converting warfighter needs into formal requirements and identifying potential ORS solutions. Moreover, DOD issued the ORS Implementation Plan in April 2008 and is also developing new ORS guidance documents. However, GAO found disparity in stakeholder understanding of the ORS concept within the warfighter and national security space communities. This disparity exists because DOD has not clearly defined key elements of the ORS concept and has not effectively communicated the concept with key stakeholders. For example, initial ORS planning documents are broad and lack the specificity needed to guide the ORS concept, according to some members of the warfighter and national security space communities. Moreover, officials from the intelligence community were concerned about DOD's lack of consultation and communication with them regarding the ORS concept. Without having a well-defined and commonly understood concept, DOD's ability to fully meet warfighter needs may be hampered. DOD has acknowledged the need to integrate ORS into existing DOD and intelligence community processes and architecture, but it has not fully addressed how it will achieve this integration. The 1999 DOD Space Policy states that an integrated national security space architecture that addresses defense and intelligence missions shall be developed to the maximum extent feasible in order to minimize unnecessary duplication of missions. DOD plans to begin integrating any new ORS processes or systems that are developed for ORS sometime between 2010 and 2015. However, integrating national security space systems can be a complex activity, involving many entities within DOD and the intelligence community. GAO previously reported that DOD's existing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) processes activities already face significant integration challenges, and adding new ORS systems into the existing ISR enterprise will increase the challenges of an already complex and challenging environment. Given the concept's immaturity, members of the national security space community have raised concerns about how the ORS concept will be integrated with existing DOD and intelligence processes and architecture, and voiced concerns about being burdened by an additional new requirements process specific to ORS. Nonetheless, as GAO described earlier, DOD is developing a process unique to ORS for submitting ORS warfighter requirements. The complexity of the national security space environment calls for DOD to begin to adequately plan integration of the ORS concept now to help ensure that DOD avoids the risk of duplicative efforts and wasted resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) depends on space assets to support a  wide range of military missions to include intelligence collection;  battlefield surveillance and management; global command, control, and  communications; and navigation assistance.

This includes demonstrating the capacity to  respond to unexpected loss or degradation of selected capabilities or  providing timely availability of tailored or new capabilities or both. In that  regard, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Director of  Central Intelligence, shall develop the requirements and concept of  operations for launch vehicles, infrastructure, and spacecraft to provide  operationally responsive access to and use of space to support national  security. DOD designated Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) as the  concept to implement one of the policy goals contained in the U.S. Space  Transportation Policy. DOD defines ORS as assured space power focused  on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders\u2019 needs.", "In the conference report accompanying the John Warner National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, Congress made a finding that  access to and use of space are critical to preserving and protecting U.S.  national security. The Act required the Secretary of Defense to establish an  Operationally Responsive Space Program Office within DOD whose  mission is (1) to contribute to the development of low-cost, rapid-reaction  payloads, buses, spacelift, and launch-control capabilities in order to  fulfill joint military operational requirements for on-demand space support  and reconstitution and (2) to coordinate and execute operationally  responsive space efforts across DOD with respect to planning, acquisition,  and operations.

The Air  Force is DOD\u2019s primary procurer and operator of space systems. The Army  controls a defense satellite communications system and operates ground  mobile terminals. The Navy procures DOD narrowband satellite  communications capability and operates several space systems that  contribute to surveillance, meteorology, and warning. The National  Reconnaissance Office designs, procures, and operates space systems  dedicated to intelligence activities. The National Security Space Office  facilitates the integration and coordination of defense, intelligence, civil,  and commercial space activities.

Subsequently, the John Warner National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 directed DOD to submit a  report that sets forth a plan for DOD acquisition of ORS capabilities to  support military users and military operations. This plan was submitted to  Congress in April 2007. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s development of a higher- level strategy to guide the ORS concept, as well as other future space  efforts, and issued a report regarding the need for the Secretary of Defense  and the Director of National Intelligence to identify and resolve any  remaining differences of opinion and issue a National Security Space  Strategy.

To provide short-term  tactical capabilities as well as identify and implement long-term solutions  to developing low-cost satellites, DOD initiated the ORS concept. The ORS  concept aims to quickly deliver low-cost, short-term tactical capabilities to  address unmet needs of the warfighter. Unlike traditional large satellite  programs, the ORS concept is intended to address only a small number of  unmet tactical needs\u2014one or two\u2014with each delivery of capabilities.

Officials in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense  for Policy questioned whether these time frames could really meet an  urgent need. Additionally, officials from one combatant command told us  that a time frame of 1 year to get a need met would not be considered  responsive enough for them unless a satellite was already in orbit so that  they could task it directly.

However, DOD did not initially involve the geographic  combatant commands in the development of the ORS concept. For  example, officials from one geographic combatant command told us that  they did not have any input into the development of the Initial Concept of  Operations for ORS and were not involved in any of the ORS working  groups. These officials were concerned that failing to involve the  geographic combatant commands in the ORS concept development would  lead to new capabilities that drive warfighter requirements instead of  warfighter requirements determining how to develop ORS capabilities.  Additionally, officials from a functional combatant command told us that  key ORS meetings took place in August 2007 but they were not invited to  participate and neither were the geographic combatant commands. These  officials were concerned that failing to invite these combatant commands  to the meetings might result in the development of requirements that really  do not benefit the warfighter.", "The first extensive outreach to the combatant commands was in  preparation for the November 2007 ORS Senior Warfighters Forum, which  took place 6 months after the standup of the Joint ORS Office. A senior  space planner, who is the lead for ORS for one combatant command, told  us that during preparatory briefings for the ORS Senior Warfighters  Forum, participants were told that the purpose of the forum would be to  learn what space capabilities the combatant commands needed that ORS  might be able to address. However, after a couple of briefings, he learned  that the purpose of the ORS Senior Warfighters Forum had shifted to that  of educating the combatant commands on the ORS process and how to get  an ORS capability. The senior space planner explained that rather than  asking the warfighter what they need, the focus was now on placing their  needs into a process that had already been developed. This same  combatant command official told us that no clear answers were provided  to questions asked at the ORS Senior Warfighters Forum regarding the  submission of warfighter needs or how these needs would be prioritized  and, as of the end of February 2008, they had received no updates from  U.S. Strategic Command on any of the issues discussed at the forum.

We previously reported that DOD is often presented with  different and sometimes competing organizational cultures and funding  arrangements, and separate requirements processes among the agencies  involved in the defense and national space communities. This complex  environment has prevented DOD from reaching some of its past  integration goals. For example, in 2005, changes at the National  Reconnaissance Office resulted in the removal of National Reconnaissance  Office personnel and funding from the National Security Space Office, and  restricted the National Security Space Office\u2019s access to a classified  information-sharing network, thereby inhibiting efforts to further integrate  defense and national space activities\u2014including ISR activities\u2014that had  been recommended by the Space Commission. If the Joint ORS Office  does not successfully integrate the ORS concept into the existing space  architecture within established time frames, this may result in a lack of  coordination among various members of the warfighter and national  security space communities.", "Officials from the Joint ORS Office and U.S. Strategic Command  acknowledged that they have not yet determined how any future ORS  processes and systems will be integrated into existing national security  space processes and systems, because the concept is still too new for  them to determine the best way to achieve integration. Furthermore, the  ORS Implementation Plan states that the Joint ORS Office will be working  with the military departments and appropriate agencies to prepare for a  smooth transition of systems when they are developed and acquired by the  Joint ORS Office. However, the Joint ORS Office does not yet have any  new space capabilities to be transitioned. Senior ORS officials told us that  they cannot develop a comprehensive plan for the integration of ORS  processes into existing DOD and intelligence community processes and  architecture until they know more about the nature of ORS capabilities  that they will be able to develop.", "Moreover, U.S. Strategic Command officials said that integration of new  systems will have to take place on a case-by-case basis depending on the  type of capability that is developed. They also said that it is conceivable  that in certain situations, integrating some ORS solutions might not be the  most cost-effective and efficient way to provide an urgent capability to a  warfighter. For example, some of the architecture for addressing ISR  needs requires high levels of data classification. If a warfighter had a need  that could be met at a lower classification level than a particular ISR  system would allow, it might be faster and less expensive to not integrate  that particular ORS capability in order to preserve a lower classification of  the data obtained and avoid the expense and complications associated  with processing data with higher classifications.", "For these reasons, DOD has not laid out any specific steps toward the  longer-term goal of integrating the ORS concept into the existing space  architecture, which has raised some concern within the warfighter and  national security space communities about the possible creation of  unnecessary duplicative processes. For example, combatant command  officials told us that they are already burdened by multiple processes for  submitting their warfighter requirements. They emphasized that any  processes developed for submitting ORS requirements should be  integrated into existing requirements submission processes so as not to  require a new process for them to learn to use and manage. However, the  Deputy Director of the ORS Office said that the process of submitting ORS  requirements currently under development is a separate and parallel  process to existing methods of submitting warfighter needs and he does  not yet know how it will be integrated. He explained that the ORS concept  has only been tested with two warfighter needs so it is too soon for them  to determine how particular ORS processes\u2014such as the requirements  submission process\u2014will be integrated into existing warfighter  requirements processes. U.S. Strategic Command officials told us that in  the future, they envision receiving ORS requirements from multiple  existing processes already in place, but time is needed to allow the  concept to mature and develop before integration can be fully addressed.", "Intelligence community officials also raised concerns about the  importance of using their current processes and architecture so as not to  create unnecessary duplicative processes to get data to the warfighter.  Furthermore, officials from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  told us that their analysts cannot keep up with the data being collected  from existing space assets, and they do not know who will process  information from any new assets that might be developed under ORS.", "DOD officials have acknowledged the need to integrate ORS into the  existing ISR enterprise; however, accomplishing this goal will be  especially challenging. We recently reported that DOD\u2019s existing roadmap  for integrating current ISR capabilities does not provide DOD with a long- term comprehensive vision of the desired end state of the ISR enterprise.  We also reported that DOD has not been able to ensure that ISR  capabilities developed through existing processes are really the best  solutions to minimize inefficiency and redundancy. Therefore, it will be  difficult for the Joint ORS Office to reduce inefficiency by integrating its  processes and systems into the current ISR enterprise, which already faces  numerous integration challenges. The Deputy Director of the Joint ORS  Office said that the office has not yet determined how data collected by  any new ORS solutions developed for ISR needs will be integrated into  existing intelligence community back-end processes for analyzing and  distributing data collected from space assets.", "Integrating the ORS concept will involve many agencies across the  warfighter and national security space communities and may take more  time than anticipated. If the integration of the ORS concept is not  adequately planned, DOD may not meet its time frames for integrating the  ORS concept. If the ORS concept is not integrated into the existing space  architecture as integration issues arise, the ORS concept could create  duplicative efforts resulting in wasted resources and inhibiting the ORS  concept\u2019s ability to fully meet warfighter needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While DOD has taken a number of steps to advance the ORS concept and  to develop a process for providing ORS capabilities to the warfighter, its  ability to implement the concept will be limited until it more clearly  defines key aspects of the ORS concept and increases its outreach and  communication activities. Without a complete and clearly articulated  concept that is well communicated and practiced among key stakeholders,  DOD could encounter difficulties in fully implementing the ORS concept  and building the relationships necessary to ensure ORS\u2019s success.  Furthermore, even though it may be too early to develop a comprehensive  plan for integrating ORS processes and systems into the existing national  security space architecture, DOD can identify the steps necessary to  achieve integration as the concept matures. Integrating the ORS concept  will be very challenging, especially as it pertains to ISR activities that will  have to be coordinated among many agencies across DOD and intelligence  community agencies. Identifying the incremental steps toward integration  could help DOD meet its time frames for integrating the ORS concept,  prevent the ORS concept from creating duplicative efforts, ensure that the  ORS concept meets warfighter needs, and ensure its future satellites are  adequately supported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend the DOD Executive Agent for Space take the following  three actions:    Direct the Joint ORS Office, in consultation with U.S. Strategic Command,  to define ORS key terms including what qualifies as an urgent need, how  timely satisfaction of a need is evaluated, and what Joint Force  Commander needs the ORS concept is trying to satisfy.", "Direct the Joint ORS Office, in consultation with U.S. Strategic Command,  to establish an ongoing communications and outreach approach for ORS  to help guide DOD\u2019s efforts to promote, educate, and foster acceptance  among the combatant commands, military services, intelligence  community, and other DOD organizations.

DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II.   The National Reconnaissance Office also provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to define ORS key  terms including what qualifies as an urgent need, how timely satisfaction  of a need is evaluated, and what Joint Force Commander needs the ORS  concept is trying to satisfy. In its comments, DOD stated that it codified  the definition of ORS on July 9, 2007, and U.S. Strategic Command  developed an Initial Concept of Operations containing additional terms  intended to further define and clarify ORS activities. However, our work  showed that the warfighter and intelligence community believe that key  ORS terms need to be better defined and clearer. As we stated in our  report, the initial guidance documents\u2014such as the Plan for ORS and the  Initial Concept of Operations\u2014are considered broad by users and lack the  specificity needed to guide the ORS concept. Based on our work, this has  led to a lack of a common understanding of the concept among the  warfighter and national security space communities. DOD also stated that  responsibility for providing overarching definitions and policy guidance  will remain with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy,  and U.S. Strategic Command will continue to validate ORS requirements  and provide additional clarification, definition, and direction to the ORS  Office as the capability matures. However, our recommendation focuses  on the need for better-defined and clear ORS terms. Therefore, we  continue to believe that DOD should take additional steps now to define  and clarify ORS and provide more definition of key terms.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to establish an  ongoing communications and outreach approach for ORS to help guide  DOD\u2019s efforts to promote, educate, and foster acceptance among the  combatant commands, military services, intelligence community, and  other DOD organizations. In its comments, DOD stated that  communicating a clear, concise message was vitally important to the  success of ORS and it is currently conducting outreach efforts in  numerous forums. We acknowledged DOD\u2019s efforts to promote the ORS  concept in our report; however, despite these efforts, confusion regarding  the ORS concept persists. As stated in our report, the lack of a clear  definition combined with the lack of a consistent and comprehensive  outreach strategy has affected the acceptance and understanding of the  ORS concept throughout the warfighter and national security space  communities. DOD\u2019s comments also stated that the burden of outreach  should not be placed solely upon the ORS Office and that all ORS  stakeholders will continue to play an active role in promoting and  fostering acceptance of the ORS concept. Apart from who is designated to  develop and implement it, our work showed that a comprehensive  communication and outreach approach or strategy that reflects agreed- upon definitions and direction for the ORS concept is needed or DOD  could encounter difficulties in fully implementing the ORS concept and  may miss opportunities to meet warfighter needs.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to identify the steps  necessary to ensure the integration of the ORS concept into existing DOD  and intelligence community processes and architecture as the Joint ORS  Office continues its long-term planning of the ORS concept. In its  comments, DOD stated that integration of ORS capabilities into current  processes and architecture will depend upon the value provided by the  current processes and architectures and that integration into existing  systems will be considered by the ORS Office as a matter of course. DOD  also stated that personnel assigned to the ORS Office from across DOD  and the intelligence community bring knowledge and experience that will  help to identify ways to selectively integrate ORS capabilities into current  systems, when appropriate, in order to streamline delivery of products to  the customers. However, based on our work, if integration of the ORS  concept is not timely and adequately planned, DOD may not meet its time  frames for integrating the ORS concept into the existing space architecture  between 2010 and 2015. Moreover, if the ORS concept is not developed  and integrated well in advance of launching future satellites, the ORS  concept could create duplicative efforts resulting in wasted resources and  inhibiting the ORS concept\u2019s ability to fully meet warfighter needs.   Therefore, we believe our recommendation to take a more proactive  approach to integrating the ORS concept, once better defined and  communicated with the warfighter and national security space  community, continues to have merit.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the  Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.
