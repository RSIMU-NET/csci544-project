FERSA also established three TSP  investment funds: the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund),  Common Stock Index Investment Fund (C Fund), and Fixed Income  Investment Fund (F Fund). In 1996, Congress authorized TSP to broaden  its offerings with the International Stock Index Investment Fund (I Fund)  and Small Capitalization Stock Index Investment Fund (S Fund).

To identify our  sample, we contacted plans that were signatories of the United Nations\u2019  Principles for Responsible Investment and employed a snowball sampling  technique based on recommendations of interviewees. To assess how the  addition of an index fund tracking an SRI index would have affected past  TSP stock fund portfolio performance, we identified the best performing  U.S.-based SRI stock index based on 10-year risk-adjusted performance  data, and analyzed its potential impact on the TSP stock portfolio over the  past 20 years (1992 through 2011).

The law stipulated that  the Board had to ensure that any expenses charged for use of the mutual  fund window would be borne solely by the participants who used it. The  Board has not implemented the mutual fund window. According to TSP  officials, both the Board and ETAC were similarly split on whether to  include a mutual fund window and the Board tabled the discussion of the  mutual fund window to address more immediate issues, such as adding a  Roth TSP option.

While none of the plan officials that we  contacted had plans that were identical to TSP in terms of its federal  scope or participant demographics, many of them shared similar  challenges and concerns with TSP. As shown in figure 3, participant  demand, SRI screening criteria, and costs were the most common  challenges identified by public retirement plans.", "TSP and most other public plan officials we contacted identified low  participant demand for SRI as a challenge to adopting SRI. TSP officials  told us that based on the results of their participant surveys and the  experiences of ETAC there was little demand for an SRI fund among TSP  participants. Specifically, they noted that the results of periodic participant  surveys have consistently indicated that there was no overwhelming  demand for any new investment options, including an SRI option. In  addition, ETAC members told us that they were unaware of demand for  SRI among TSP participants. They said that they would respond if  demand ever presented itself. While consultants and fund managers that  we contacted reported a growing demand for SRI in the United States,  public plan officials that we spoke with generally reported low participant  interest in SRI adoption. Officials at several plans noted that continued  pressure and repeated demands from small vocal groups of participants  in support of SRI had been a principal driver in the plans\u2019 decision to have  an SRI option. However, officials at several of these plans said that, while  the SRI option did attract a small percentage of participants, overall  participation in the SRI funds ranged from less than 0.5 percent (in one  plan with 20 investment options) to about 10 percent (in a plan that  offered 9 investment options).", "TSP and most other public plan officials we contacted identified the  difficulty of finding broadly acceptable SRI criteria as a distinct challenge to  adopting SRI. According to TSP officials, different interpretations of what  social criteria to apply to an SRI fund could lead to the need to develop  multiple funds to satisfy participants. Officials also noted that it would be  hard to reach agreement on what values an SRI fund should endorse.  Moreover, officials at most of the other plans we contacted said that the  lack of a common definition of SRI and the selection of SRI criteria was  challenging. For example, officials at one plan noted that social issues were  difficult to incorporate into an investment approach because, while some  basic social issues, such as child labor, imprisonment, and forced slavery,  were generally acceptable screens, reaching broad consensus on other  issues, such as labor laws, workers\u2019 rights, weapons, guns, and tobacco,  was more difficult. An official at another plan noted that it was incumbent  upon participants to tell them what social policy they wished to pursue.  Officials at the plans we contacted that considered selection of screening  criteria to be a challenge overcame this challenge by either using an off-the  shelf SRI fund, or relying on the expertise and experience of the SRI fund  managers, or educating participants on why fund managers selected the  investments they did.", "TSP and other public plan officials we contacted had varied opinions on  the degree to which the costs associated with the creation and  administration of an SRI index fund presented a challenge to adopting  SRI. According to TSP officials, the costs to create a new index fund  would be considerable. In addition, they said an SRI index fund would  cost more because it requires additional screening and monitoring. Under  TSP\u2019s current cost structure, any costs associated with a new SRI index  fund would be borne by all participants whether or not they chose to  invest in the SRI index fund.had varied opinions on the degree to which these costs presented a  challenge. While there would be certain upfront costs associated with  adding an SRI fund, which could include member communication and  manager selection, officials at several plans said that adding a new fund  to its existing portfolio would not adversely affect administrative costs.  According to some investment managers we contacted, the key factors  affecting cost of any fund are (1) its asset size\u2014the larger the asset base,  the better the economies of scale and the lower the overall cost ratio\u2014 and (2) whether the fund\u2019s investment strategy requires active  management or passively tracking of a market index.", "Other public plan officials we contacted  While TSP and some public plan officials we contacted asserted that their  role as fiduciary was a challenge in that it precluded the adoption of SRI,  officials at other public plans with an SRI option said there were no  fiduciary concerns surrounding the inclusion of an SRI option in a DC plan.  According to a 1990 memorandum sent from the TSP executive director to  the Board, Congress considered and rejected the concept of social  investment when creating TSP. The memorandum noted that the strict  fiduciary provisions of the law, which require the Board to discharge its  responsibilities solely in the interest of participants, excluded the possibility  of social investing, and that any authorization outside the realm of interest  of all participants would be inconsistent with the notion of employee  ownership of TSP assets. Officials at all of the public plans that had not  implemented an SRI option considered fiduciary issues a challenge to  adopting SRI, while officials at other plans did not. For example, an official  at one plan with an SRI option stated that fiduciary duty was not a  challenge when adding an SRI fund to the investment options to a DC plan  because participants have individual account ownership, are free to choose  how they invest, and must assume responsibility for any risks associated  with the underlying investments. One plan official noted that the fiduciary  responsibility of a DC plan extends to exercising due diligence in the  selection of a fund manager, providing appropriate participant  communications about the fund, offering enough investment options, and  acting in the best interest of the majority of participants.", "TSP and some public plan officials that we contacted asserted that  investment decisions made on any basis other than the economic welfare  of participants could present a challenge in that it would expose the plan  to potential political interference. In its 2006 investment option review, a  consulting firm hired by TSP eliminated SRI from consideration in part on  the grounds that identifying screening criteria that all could agree to would  be difficult to find and likely draw attention from opposing parties of  interest. According to the 1990 memorandum from the TSP executive  director, the laws that established the current TSP funds prevent the  political manipulation of TSP funds, and officials told us that TSP has  taken steps in the past to avoid political interference. Officials at the  public plans we contacted had different views on the extent to which  political interference was a challenge. For example, officials at some  public plans that did not implement SRI identified political interference as  one of the reasons they chose not to do so. On the other hand, officials at  other public plans that had implemented SRI said that political  interference was not a challenge. For example, officials at one public plan  noted that the state\u2019s legislative mandate to maximize returns and  improve levels of risk prevented political interference. An official at  another public plan that adopted SRI told us that although they had  anticipated political interference by state officials following their decision  to divest from alcohol or tobacco companies, it had not materialized.", "Officials at TSP and some other public plans identified SRI fund  performance as a challenge to adopting an SRI fund. According to TSP  officials, participants who allocated assets to an SRI fund instead of a  standard fund that included all relevant companies would narrow the  number of companies in which they were indirectly investing, thereby  limiting their exposure to the performance of the broader, more diversified  market. While officials at some public plans that we contacted believed  that SRI funds had lower performance than other funds, other officials  had mixed views on whether the performance of SRI funds was any more  challenging than the performance of non-SRI funds. Officials at several  plans, which had considered but not implemented SRI, cited SRI  performance as a reason for not incorporating SRI in their plans. Officials  at one plan said they would reconsider offering an SRI fund if it  demonstrated better long-term performance than non-SRI funds.", "However, officials at several other plans that implemented SRI told us  that the SRI fund produced comparable and sometimes better returns  than other funds in their portfolio. Officials at one plan said the plan would  terminate its working relationship with an external fund manager if its SRI  investments did not perform as well as other funds.", "While TSP officials considered the lack of peer implementation of SRI as  a challenge to adopting an SRI fund, officials at other public plans we  contacted said that it was not a challenge. As part of its investment  options review in 2006, a consulting firm advised TSP that SRI funds  were not a common practice among TSP\u2019s peers and identified this  criterion as a reason for eliminating SRI from further consideration.  According to TSP officials, the fact that similar plans had not adopted SRI  was a challenge in that TSP had no precedent to follow. We found a  number plans similar in asset size and membership to TSP that applied  SRI principles through investment screening. Officials at several plans we  contacted said that peer implementation of SRI did not factor in their  decision to incorporate SRI into their investment strategy.", "Officials at most of the public plans we contacted had no restrictions  regarding investment overlap between funds and thus did not view such  overlap as a challenge to adopting SRI. According to TSP officials, the  Board is permitted to suggest legislation to address any gaps in  investment options as long as there is no evident overlap. In the past, for  example, TSP proposed legislation authorizing the addition of the S Fund  and the I Fund to provide participants with options for greater  diversification of investments in the small capitalization and international  markets. According to TSP officials, each of the current funds tracks  different companies in different segments of the overall financial market  without overlap, helping to reduce the risk of incurring large losses on a  broader portfolio. Officials at other public plans, which did not face the  same restrictions as TSP, said that overlap was not a consideration, and  that certain amount of overlap with existing investments was both  expected and accepted.

Officials at other plans said that  having an SRI option could serve as a recruiting tool for the plan in that it  encouraged more eligible employees to join the plan. Regarding the long- term benefits of SRI, officials at two of the public plans stated that it was  still too early to judge the benefit of SRI.

For example, they told us that, in the late 1990s, the index was  relatively overweighted in technology, consumer, and finance stocks and  underweighted in energy and utilities, resulting in higher performance in  the \u201cdot com\u201d boom of the late 1990s and lower performance in the 2001  recession. Moreover, the SRI index also excludes companies involved in  the production of military weapons, which may have contributed to lower  returns over the past decade while the country has been at war.", "In addition to providing less return overall than the C Fund over the 20- year period, the inclusion of this SRI Fund would have resulted in overlap  with the C Fund and not have provided a substantial opportunity for  additional portfolio diversification.

Fifty-seven percent of the companies included in the  SRI Fund index, which includes large, mid, and small capitalization  stocks, overlap with companies included in the C Fund index. In part, as  a result of this overlap, the SRI Fund and the C Fund are highly  correlated in their returns, and thus adding this SRI Fund would not  provide a substantial opportunity for additional portfolio diversification.  Portfolio diversification aims to reduce risk by investing in various  financial instruments and markets so that market events will not affect all  assets in the same way. Diversification opportunities exist if investments  have independent price movement, and therefore, independent returns.  The price movement between these two funds over the last 20 years was  1.94 percent independent, suggesting that the same external causes  affected their returns to nearly the same degree.

Finally, under TSP\u2019s current  structure, the costs of adding a new fund would be distributed among all  participants regardless of whether they participated in that fund. We note  that the Board has the authority to open a mutual fund window for  participants to invest in mutual funds managed outside TSP. If the Board  decides to act on this authority and allow the mutual fund window,  participants seeking other forms of investment, including SRI, could invest  in mutual funds and would bear the costs associated with this investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of this draft report to the Federal Retirement Thrift  Investment Board, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the  Treasury for review and comment.

For example, we reviewed the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement  System Act of 1986, the Federal Retirement Reform Act of 2009, and the  2006 United Nations\u2019 Principles for Responsible Investment. We also  interviewed officials from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), the Employee Thrift  Advisory Council, investment management and consultant firms, and 15  selected public pension plans. Our nonrepresentative sample of pension  plans included 9 domestic defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit  (DB) plans that incorporated SRI, and 6 plans that considered but did not  adopt an SRI component. To identify our sample, we contacted plans that  were signatories of the United Nations\u2019 Principles for Responsible  Investment and employed a snowball sampling technique based on  recommendations of interviewees. We analyzed interview responses of  pension plan officials and other SRI experts on the challenges and benefits  associated with SRI, and how these experiences might affect TSP.", "To determine how the addition of an SRI index fund to a TSP stock portfolio  would have affected past TSP stock portfolio performance, we identified the  best performing U.S.-based SRI index and assessed its potential impact on  the TSP stock portfolio based on historical performance data of the three  TSP stock fund underlying indices. To identify the best performing U.S.- based SRI stock index (SRI Fund) we (1) identified all U.S.-based SRI stock  indices with at least a 10-year history, and (2) selected the index with the  best 10-year Sharpe ratio (dating back from December 2011). To determine  how the SRI Fund would have affected TSP stock portfolio performance from  1992 to 2011, we analyzed monthly total return data for the SRI Fund and  the underlying indices of the three TSP stock funds provided by Morningstar,  Inc.\u2014a leading independent financial market research firm. We used these  data to analyze changes in annual returns and volatility, in a manner similar  to past analysis conducted by TSP when considering whether to add funds  to the TSP portfolio. An important element of any performance statistic is the  unit of time measurement. Our analysis measures returns on an annual  basis, and measures risk based on the variation in year-to-year returns.  Using a different unit of time, such as a month or even a multi-year period,  could give a different picture of the risk/reward tradeoff. We calculated the  compound rates of return and standard deviation based on annual rates of  return from 1992 to 2011 for an annually rebalanced, evenly distributed  portfolio of the three existing TSP stock fund indices (a distribution of 33  percent, 33 percent, and 33 percent). We then calculated the change in  compound rates of return and standard deviation of annual returns for the  following evenly distributed portfolios: a four-way combination (25 percent, 25 percent, 25 percent, and 25  percent) of the SRI Fund and the three TSP stock funds indices, all of the three-way combinations (33 percent, 33 percent, and 33  percent) of the SRI Fund with two of the TSP stock fund indices, all two-way combinations (50 percent and 50 percent) of the SRI Fund  with one of the TSP stock fund indices, and  the SRI Fund alone (100 percent).", "Another decision in any performance assessment is whether to do the  analysis on a time-weighted or a dollar-weighted basis. A time-weighted  basis gives equal weight to each unit of time; thus, the annual rate of  return in 1992 gets just as much weight in the analysis as the annual rate  of return in 2011. A dollar-weighted basis gives greater weight to the  periods when more money is at stake. For example, for a TSP participant  who made regular contributions to the plan during the 1992 to 2011  period, the overall rate of return would be more influenced by particular  performance in the later years, when more contributions are at stake,  than in the earlier years. We used a time-weighted basis for our analysis,  in order to focus on investment performance itself, rather than on the  particular economic consequences in the time period under study.", "To further assess the performance of the SRI Fund, we compared annual  rates of return and compound cumulative rates of return for the three TSP  stock fund indices over various time periods. Specifically, we reviewed  performance over the 20-year period (1992 to 2011), the 10-year period  (2002 to 2011), and periods of market weakness. Because this analysis is  strictly based on past performance, this result does not guarantee or  imply that the addition of an SRI index would have the same effect on  future TSP stock fund portfolio performance. In addition, we analyzed the  overlap of holdings of the SRI Fund and the C Fund as of April 2012. To  analyze the diversification potential of the SRI Fund for the TSP stock  portfolio, we analyzed the correlation coefficient, common variance, and  independence of price movement between the SRI Fund and the C Fund  over the last 20 years.", "To determine how the performance and cost of SRI mutual funds compare  with those of non-SRI mutual funds, we compared performance over the  past 15 years (1997 to 2011)\u2014 the longest time period for which data were  available\u2014and costs as of fiscal year 2010 provided by Morningstar. To  identify the universe of SRI mutual funds, we included mutual funds from  Morningstar considered to be SRI mutual funds based on ethical screen  employed and data on SRI mutual funds maintained by US SIF. analyze performance and cost of SRI and non-SRI mutual funds active as  of December 2011, we focused our analysis exclusively on three  institutional grade share classes\u2014institutional, front-load and no-load\u2014of  U.S. domiciled open-end mutual funds, which experts identified as the most  common form of SRI funds. We did not examine other forms of SRI, such  as exchange traded funds, hedge funds, or variable annuities. Because this  analysis is strictly based on past performance, these results do not  guarantee or imply that these asset classes would perform similarly in the  future.

US SIF is a U.S. membership  association for professionals, firms, institutions and organizations engaged in sustainable  and responsible investing.", "Some mutual funds had more recent inception dates, thus limiting the  number of funds in longer-term performance comparisons. Risk-adjusted  return statistics include the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. Cost measures  include fiscal year 2010 annual report net-expense ratios.", "To investigate why SRI and non-SRI mutual funds differed in  performance, we ran regressions with and without controls for fund size,  share class, and investment strategy not inherently related to SRI. We  used the risk-adjusted performance measures, Sharpe and Sortino ratios,  as the dependent variables. Table 2 summarizes the results of 24  regressions for U.S. stock funds. The numbers in the columns labeled  \u201cOutcome Variable 1\u201d and \u201cOutcome Variable 2\u201d are coefficient estimates  on a flag indicating that a fund was non-SRI.", "As shown above, the Sharpe ratio served as the outcome variable for the  first set of regressions (second column of the table). The Sortino ratio  served as the outcome variable for the second set of regressions (third  column of the table). The last column shows the average impact on the  non-SRI flag coefficient of inclusion of the control variables for the row. For  each outcome variable, inclusion of the control variables generally reduced  the estimated performance premium of non-SRI funds versus SRI funds.  The fund size and strategy variable sets both had substantial impacts on  the estimated difference in SRI and non-SRI fund performance.", "The rows of the table show regression results for the 5-, 10-, and 15-year  time frames. The rows indicating no control variables included only the  non-SRI flag. The rows indicating \u201cwith fund size\u201d included fund size,  along with the SRI variable as explanatory variables. The row indicating  \u201cwith strategy categories\u201d include controls for whether a fund is actively  managed or passively tracks an index, the broad investment category of a  fund based on portfolio statistics and composition (e.g., natural resources,  real estate, or financial), the more narrowly defined institutional  investment category of a fund based on portfolio statistics and  composition (e.g., materials, domestic energy, technology, or utilities),  and the market capitalization and type of stock (value, blend, and growth).  The row indicating \u201cwith all controls\u201d provides results for regressions with  share class as an explanatory variable in addition to the fund size and  strategy variables.", "Table 3 shows results from 24 regressions for balanced funds. The  methodology for these regressions was the same as that used for the  regressions in table 2. Accounting for covariates did not have a consistent  impact on the estimated difference in performance between SRI and non- SRI funds for these funds, with the addition of control variables to the  regressions sometimes increasing the estimated difference in  performance and sometimes decreasing it.", "Table 4 shows results for 24 regressions for bond funds. The  methodology for these regressions was the same as that used for the  regressions in table 2 except that one field (equity style box) was not  included as an explanatory variable because it was not populated for 90  percent of these funds. Accounting for covariates generally decreased the  estimated difference in performance between the SRI and non-SRI funds.", "To investigate disparities between SRI and non-SRI mutual fund costs,  we ran regressions that controlled for fund size, share class, and  investment strategy.
