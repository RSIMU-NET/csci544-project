They maintain that the structural imbalance largely stems from the federal government's presence and restrictions on the District's tax base. Accordingly, at various times District officials have asked the Congress for additional funds and other measures to enhance revenues. In a preliminary September 2002 report, GAO concluded that the District had not provided sufficient data and analysis to discern whether, or to what extent, it is facing a structural imbalance. At that time, GAO also agreed to perform a more comprehensive analysis and was asked to (1) determine whether, or to what extent, the District faces a structural imbalance between its revenue capacity and its public service responsibilities, (2) identify any significant constraints on the District's revenue capacity, (3) discuss factors beyond the control of District officials that influence the District's spending in key program areas as well as factors within its control, such as management problems, and (4) report on the District's deferred infrastructure projects and outstanding debt service and related expenses that might be affected by a structural imbalance. The District concurred with our key findings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO used a multifaceted approach to measure structural imbalance that GAO defines as a fiscal system's inability to fund an average level of public services with revenues that it could raise with an average level of taxation, plus the federal aid it receives. This approach compared the District's circumstances to a benchmark based on the average spending and tax policies of the 50 state fiscal systems (each state and its local governments). However, the benchmark is adjusted by taking into account circumstances that are beyond the control of state and local government officials (e.g., number of school-age children and value of tax bases). GAO supplemented this analysis with reviews of the District's key programs to provide insights on factors influencing spending, and reviewed deferred infrastructure and outstanding debt. The cost of delivering an average level of services per capita in the District far exceeds that of the average state fiscal system due to factors such as high poverty, crime, and a high cost of living. The District's per capita total revenue capacity is higher than all state fiscal systems but not to the same extent that its costs are higher. In addition, its revenue capacity would be larger without constraints on its taxing authority, such as its inability to tax federal property or the income of nonresidents. The District faces a substantial structural deficit in that the cost of providing an average level of public services exceeds the amount of revenue it could raise by applying average tax rates. Data limitations and uncertainties surrounding key assumptions in our analysis made it difficult to determine the exact size of the District's structural deficit, though it likely exceeds $470 million annually. Consequently, even though the District's tax burden is among the highest in the nation, the resulting revenues plus federal grants are only sufficient to fund an average level of public services, if those services were delivered with average efficiency. The District's significant management problems in key programs waste resources and make it difficult to provide even an average level of services. Examples include inadequate financial management, billing systems, and internal controls, resulting in tens of millions of dollars being wasted, and hindering its ability to receive federal funding. Addressing management problems would not offset the District's underlying structural imbalance because this imbalance is determined by factors beyond the District's direct control. However, addressing these management problems would help offset its current budget gap or increase service levels. The District continues to defer major infrastructure projects and capital investment because of its structural imbalance and its high debt level. These two factors make it difficult for the District to raise taxes, cut services, or assume additional debt. Although difficult, District officials could address a budget gap by taking actions such as cutting spending, raising taxes, and improving management efficiencies. In contrast, a structural imbalance is largely beyond District officials' direct control. If this imbalance is to be addressed, in the near term, it may be necessary to change federal policies to expand the District's tax base or to provide additional financial support. However, given the existence of structural imbalances in other jurisdictions and the District's significant management problems, federal policymakers face difficult choices regarding what changes, if any, they should make in their financial relationship with the District."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report discusses the results of our review of the District of  Columbia\u2019s (the District) reported structural imbalance between its revenue capacity and the cost of  meeting its public service responsibilities.

The federal budget has moved from  unprecedented federal surpluses in the late 1990s to deficits, with the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) now projecting the federal government  to run deficits of $246 billion in fiscal year 2003 and $200 billion in fiscal  year 2004.  At the same time, spending demands are also on the rise, as the  federal government deals with funding entitlement programs, such as  Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, along with new and rapidly  increasing health care costs and recent defense and homeland security  needs.", "Similarly, states are experiencing significant, recurring revenue declines\u2014 estimates show state budget shortfalls of about $80 billion by 2004.  States  are not only facing a major decline in revenues\u2014attributed to the  recession, steep stock market declines and other factors\u2014but also  increased spending in areas like Medicaid due to increased enrollment and  health care costs.  This shortfall translated into reductions in aid to local  governments, hiring and salary freezes, cuts in infrastructure projects and  discretionary programs aimed at low-income individuals and families and  even across the board spending reductions.  Many states have also taken  other actions like tapping \u201crainy day funds\u201d or tobacco settlement money,  or raising \u201csin\u201d taxes.", "Like those of other state and local governments, the District\u2019s finances have  been adversely affected by the recent economic slowdown.  The CFO\u2019s  office projects that total local source revenues for fiscal year 2003 will be  $53.5 million (or 1.5 percent) lower in inflation-adjusted terms than they  were in fiscal year 2000.  The principal reason for this decline is a  significant deterioration in individual income tax revenue.  In fact, the  decline of $214.1 million in the individual income tax far exceeds the  decline in overall revenues.  The CFO\u2019s office attributes much of this  decline to a steep drop-off in capital gains earned by residents, although the  office does not have sufficiently detailed data to quantify the decline in this  specific source of income.", "Sales tax and business franchise tax revenues have also declined, but in  smaller absolute amounts compared to the individual income tax.  In  contrast, revenues from property taxes (the District\u2019s second most  important revenue source after the income tax), gross receipts, other taxes,  and nontax sources have increased since fiscal year 2000.  Table 4 shows  the change in revenue from each principal source from fiscal year 2000  through fiscal year 2003.", "The District\u2019s approved fiscal year 2003 budget was $5.6 billion.

To address our requesters\u2019 questions,  we used a body of evidence approach that combined quantitative and  programmatic analyses to identify any possible structural imbalance.", "Our approach was not intended to provide a definitive point estimate of any  imbalance, rather, it was expected to show whether the District\u2019s ability to  provide an average level of services with its given revenue capacity is  substantially different from that of most jurisdictions.  The approach was  also designed to examine cost conditions in key program areas and to  identify management problems that could lead to wasted resources.  In  addition, we attempted to identify the effects of the District\u2019s fiscal  situation on deferred infrastructure projects and debt capacity.  Our  methodology was vetted among key experts, including individuals who  designed the underlying methodology and District economists.  We revised  our methodology based on expert consultation as appropriate.  (See apps.  I, II, and III for more detail on our overall approach.)", "Our methodology was based on previous efforts to define an objective  measure of a fiscal system\u2019s structural balance.  No consensus exists  regarding the appropriate level of services and taxation, and this issue has  been a matter of perennial debate in every state.  For this reason, when  public finance analysts have, in the past, compared the underlying or  \u201cstructural\u201d fiscal position of jurisdictions, they have attempted to estimate  objective measures of each jurisdiction\u2019s spending that are independent of  that jurisdiction\u2019s particular preferences and policies.  Similarly, analysts  have estimated measures of revenue capacity that are independent of each  jurisdiction\u2019s decisions regarding tax rates and other tax policy choices.", "As we explain in more detail below, these objective benchmarks for levels  of service and for revenue capacity are based on the national average  spending and the national average tax rates for state fiscal systems.   Consequently, the benchmarks are \u201crepresentative\u201d of the level of services  that a typical fiscal system provides and the tax rates that it imposes on its  tax bases.  A fiscal system is said to be in structural balance if it is able to  finance a representative basket of services by taxing its funding capacity at  representative rates.", "Our use of an average level of services and average tax rates should not be  interpreted as an indication that these are the levels of spending and  taxation that jurisdictions should seek to provide.  Each jurisdiction is an  autonomous governmental entity responsible for providing the package of  services and level of taxation desired by its citizens.  Depending on the  preferences of local citizens and their representatives, levels of taxation  and the services they support may be higher in some jurisdictions and  lower in others.  The use of average levels in our analysis should only be  thought of as a convenient benchmark against which to gauge relative  differences in the cost of providing public services over which local  officials have little direct control and as providing an indication of the  potential availability of revenue sources from which to finance those costs.", "Because the District has all the fiscal responsibilities generally shared by  state, city, county, and special district governments, we used two baskets of  services as benchmarks.  The first is a basket of services typically provided  by state fiscal systems (the state and all of its local governments), and the  second is a basket of services typically provided in more densely populated  urban areas.  Both baskets include such functions as elementary and  secondary education, higher education, public welfare, health and  hospitals, surface transportation, public safety, and other public service  functions.", "For the basket of services provided by state fiscal systems, we combined  our separate estimates by weighting each spending function by its  proportionate share of total spending of the average state fiscal system.   For the second basket of services provided by governments serving densely  populated urban areas, we combined our separate estimates by weighting  each spending function by its proportionate share of total spending of the  average urban areas.", "To calculate the cost of providing an average, or representative, basket of  public services, we used the national average per capita spending for each  expenditure function as a benchmark for an average service level.  For  example, the national average per capita spending for elementary and  secondary education was $1,338 per capita.  We used this figure as a  benchmark indicator of an average level of educational services.  However,  this benchmark has to be adjusted to account for the fact that an average  level of spending does not support the same level of service in each fiscal  system.", "To estimate the cost of an average level of services for each state fiscal  system, we adjusted our benchmark by cost drivers that reflect specific  demographic, economic, and physical characteristics that are beyond the  direct control of government officials to affect.  For example, we used the  number of school-age children (excluding children attending private  schools) rather than actual school enrollments to represent the overall  scope of government responsibility for elementary and secondary  education since actual enrollments can be affected by the decisions of  policymakers.  Similarly, we used the average wage rate in private sector  employment to measure the personnel cost of delivering public services  rather than using actual government labor compensation rates since these  too are affected by negotiations with public employees and, therefore,  reflect government policy choices.", "Our estimates of the cost of providing an average level of services are likely  to understate to some unknown extent the District\u2019s cost of an average  service level for a number of reasons.  First, by using the average per capita  spending of all state fiscal systems as our benchmark of an average service  level, by necessity the benchmark excludes any unique public service costs  associated with being the nation\u2019s capital.  Such unique costs would  include, for example, above average costs for crowd control for political  demonstrations and increased public safety and sanitation costs based on  the disproportionate number of visitors.  In addition, data for the various  cost drivers (e.g., school-age children and low-income residents) are  limited and may not fully reflect all relevant cost drivers affecting a  jurisdiction\u2019s cost environment.", "In addition, a degree of uncertainty exists regarding the relative importance  each should have in the overall cost calculation.  In these instances, we  have generally attempted to choose conservative assumptions so as not to  overstate the cost impact of factors used in our analysis. (See app. I for a  more detailed discussion of our methodology and examples of instances  where conservative assumptions were employed in calculating the cost of  providing an average level of public services.)", "To estimate total revenue capacity, we combined revenue estimates for the  two principal sources from which state fiscal systems finance their  expenditures: (1) revenues that could be raised from a fiscal system\u2019s own  revenue sources and (2) the federal grants that the system would receive if  it provided an average basket of services.", "In the past, two basic approaches have been employed to estimate the own- source revenue capacity of states: (1) those that use income to measure the  ability of governments to fund public services and (2) those that attempt to  measure the amount of revenue that could be raised in each state if a  standardized set of tax rates were applied to a specified set of statutory tax  bases typically used to fund public services.  Total taxable resources (TTR),  developed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), is a leading  example of the first type of measure and the representative tax system  (RTS), developed by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental  Relations, is a leading example of the second.", "Because experts disagree as to which approach is superior, we present  separate results using both methodologies.  Both RTS and TTR take into  account the restrictions placed on the District\u2019s taxing authority.  For  example, they do not include tax-exempt property or the income earned by  nonresidents who work in the District.  However, since other states may  tax nonresidents\u2019 incomes, those incomes are included in their tax bases.", "We generally used the actual amounts that state fiscal systems received  from the federal government as proxies for the actual amounts that each  system would receive if it provided an average basket of services.  We do so  because grant amounts generally are not likely to change significantly in  response to changes in state and local spending choices.  However, in the  case of the Medicaid program, the federal government provides open- ended matching funds to the District and other state fiscal systems that  automatically adjust to changing state policy choices regarding the  coverage of their Medicaid programs and the benefits that are provided.  In  this case, we used an estimate of the Medicaid funding amount that state  fiscal systems would likely receive if average Medicaid services were  provided.  We have not attempted to estimate the extent to which the  District and state fiscal systems take advantage of all of their opportunities  to receive federal grants.  As a consequence, our grant estimates may  understate the true potential that these fiscal systems have to receive  grants.  (See app. II for a more detailed description of the methodology we  used to estimate the revenue capacity of state fiscal systems.)", "To obtain information on federally imposed constraints on the District\u2019s  revenue authority, we interviewed officials from the office of the District\u2019s  CFO and several local experts on the District\u2019s economy and finances.  We  also reviewed a number of studies prepared by the District, independent  commissions, and other researchers that contained information,  evaluations, and estimates relating to these constraints.", "In addition to the quantitative analysis, we conducted a programmatic  analysis of the District\u2019s reported structural imbalance by evaluating the  levels of service, costs, management, and financing of three of the District\u2019s  highest cost program areas: Medicaid; elementary and secondary  education; and public safety, particularly police, fire, and emergency  medical services.  We also conducted case study work on two similar  jurisdictions: San Francisco, California and Boston, Massachusetts.  These  jurisdictions were selected based upon a literature search for empirically  based comparisons of cities; opinions of experts of District finances; and a  cluster analysis, using demographic and economic variables such as  populations, measures of poverty, and number of school-age children.   Cluster analysis is a technique that groups units (in this case, cities) into  clusters based on their closeness on a set of measures.", "The case study work was conducted to assess how the District compares to  other jurisdictions regarding the types and costs of similar services in  Medicaid, education, and public safety, as well as to provide contextual  sophistication to the quantitative analysis.  In conducting the programmatic  work, we collected and analyzed program data and interviewed  government officials in the District, California, Massachusetts, San  Francisco and Boston governments and in federal agencies responsible for  overseeing or providing major funding in these three program areas.", "Finally, we conducted companion work to identify the effects of the  District\u2019s fiscal situation on deferred infrastructure projects and debt  structure.  To examine the factors involved, we met with officials of the  District CFO\u2019s office and Capital Improvement Program (CIP).  We also  obtained and reviewed prior-year District budget and financial plans,  current year expenditure reports for the capital projects, internal studies,  and statistics and financial information on the current expenditures for the  District\u2019s CIP.  Our approach to analyzing the District\u2019s infrastructure  projects differed from the approaches used to address the other objectives  in this report.  Because of the variety of ways infrastructure projects are  owned, managed, and reported by other jurisdictions, comparative  information on infrastructure across states and local jurisdictions was not  readily available; therefore, we did not do a comparative analysis of the  District\u2019s infrastructure with states or other jurisdictions.  We reviewed the  data that the District had available in its annual budget and financial plans  and CAFRs, and other documents.  To assess the District\u2019s debt service, we  obtained and analyzed information from the District\u2019s CFO on the District\u2019s  debt levels and projected infrastructure needs.  We also compared selected  debt service measures for the District to other state fiscal systems.", "Our work was performed from August 2002 through May 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The District\u2019s Cost of Meeting Its Public Service Responsibilities Exceeds Its Revenue Capacity, Resulting in a Structural Deficit", "paragraphs": ["To determine if a jurisdiction has a structural deficit, we estimated, for the  District of Columbia and the 50 state fiscal systems, the spending needed to  provide an average level of public services, the revenues that could be  raised with average tax rates and the amount of grant funding the  jurisdiction can expect to receive.  Our analysis indicated that the District\u2019s  cost of delivering an average level of services per capita is the highest in the  nation due to factors such as high poverty, crime, and a high cost of living.   Our analysis also indicated that the District\u2019s total revenue capacity (own- source revenues plus grants) is higher than all state fiscal systems, but not  to the same extent that its costs are higher.  The District\u2019s own-source  revenue capacity ranked among the top five when compared to those of the  50 state fiscal systems, and its federal grant funding is over two and one  half times the national average.", "To estimate a structural imbalance, we performed several sensitivity  analyses to show how our estimates changed as we varied specific  judgments and assumptions regarding cost circumstances and the value of  specific tax bases.  The consistency of our basic result over a broad range  of alternative assumptions and approaches led us to conclude that the  District does have a substantial structural deficit, even though considerable  uncertainty exists regarding its exact size.  Using fiscal year 2000 data, our  lowest estimate was $470 million and our highest estimate was over   $1.1 billion annually.", "Our analysis did not take into account the unique public service costs  associated with being the nation\u2019s capital; however, our analysis did take  into account the significant federal restrictions on the District\u2019s taxing  authority.  The primary reason for the structural deficit is high costs due to  conditions beyond District officials\u2019 direct control.  To cope with its high  cost conditions, the District uses its relatively high revenue capacity to a  greater extent than almost all state fiscal systems.  However, this relatively  high tax burden, in combination with federal grants, is just sufficient to  fund an average level of public services if delivered with average efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Spending Necessary to Fund an Average Basket of Public Services Exceeds That of All State Fiscal Systems", "paragraphs": ["Using an average of the 50 state fiscal systems as a benchmark, our analysis  indicates that the per capita cost of funding an average level of services in  the District exceeds that of the average state fiscal system by  approximately 75 percent (and is over a third more than the second highest  cost fiscal system, New York).  In dollar terms, the District would have to  spend $2.3 billion more each year to fund an average level of public  services compared to what it would have to spend if it faced average cost  circumstances.  When we adjusted the basket of services to reflect those  typically provided in more densely populated urban areas, we estimated  that the District would annually have to spend over 85 percent more than  the average state fiscal system per capita.  As a result, to provide an  average level of services the District would have to spend $2.6 billion more  than if it faced average cost circumstances.  Figure 1 compares the  District\u2019s per capita costs of funding an average level of services with those  of the five state fiscal systems with the highest costs.", "We used the U.S. average per capita spending for each specific expenditure  function (for example, Medicaid, education, and public safety) as a  benchmark for an average service level for that function.  We then adjusted  this benchmark to account for differing workloads and costs to reflect the  fact that an average level of spending does not support the same level of  services in each fiscal system because cost conditions differ across  locations.", "For example, adjustments are necessary to reflect the fact that the District  must compete with a high-wage private sector in attracting public  employees, and high real estate costs push up the cost of government office  space, making the provision of public services more expensive than in most  states.  The adjustments also reflect the fact that the District faces  unusually high workloads per capita, such as large numbers of low-income  people and high crime rates that increase the cost of Medicaid and public  safety.", "The public service functions that contribute most to the District\u2019s high cost  circumstances are Medical Vendor Payments (Medicaid), health and  hospitals, and police and corrections.  To provide average Medicaid  coverage and benefits to its low-income population residents, the District  would have to spend about $1,315 per capita, which is more than twice the  national average of $551 per capita.  (See table 5.) This added Medicaid cost  accounts for $437 million of the $2.3 billion difference between what the  District would have to spend to meet its high costs and what it would have  to spend if it faced only average costs (based on the state basket of  services).  Similarly, we estimated the per capita cost of providing police  services is more than four times the average state fiscal system, adding  $436 million to the District\u2019s cost of providing an average level of services  annually.", "One area of the budget where costs are not as high is elementary and  secondary education, where, due to a comparatively small percentage of  school-age children, the estimated per capita cost of an average level of  services is 18 percent above that of the average state fiscal system.  The  only expenditure function in which the District\u2019s per capita cost of an  average service level is estimated to be well below the national average is  highways, of which the District has comparatively few miles per capita.

First, by using the average per capita spending of all  state fiscal systems as our benchmark for an average level of public  services, the benchmark by necessity, excludes any unique public service  costs associated with the District being the nation\u2019s capital.  Such costs  would include, for example, crowd control for political demonstrations  that occur disproportionately in the nation\u2019s capital and a disproportionate  number of tourists and out of town visitors that impose public safety and  sanitation costs on the District\u2019s budget.", "In addition, limited data are available for the various indicators of  workload used in our analysis and there is a degree of uncertainty  regarding their relative importance in our overall cost estimates.  In these  instances, we generally chose conservative assumptions so as not to  overstate the cost impact of factors used in our analysis.  For example, in  adjusting for differences in the cost of living, we took into account only  differences in the cost of housing, but due to data limitations, we were  unable to take into account other potential sources of such cost variation.   Such conservative assumptions likely result in an underestimate of the  number of low-income residents in our analysis.

As noted earlier, the District\u2019s total revenue capacity equals the  sum of its own-source revenue capacity (the revenue that it could raise  from its own economic base), plus the amount of federal grants that the  District would receive if it provided a representative level of services.", "Experts disagree on the best approach for estimating revenue capacity and  numerous data limitations exist; thus, in the course of our analyses we  made a variety of methodological decisions and assumptions.  For this  reason, we present a range of estimates for the District\u2019s revenue capacity  based on two fundamentally different approaches that have been used in  the past.  All of the estimates we present include adjustments designed to  account for significant constraints on the District\u2019s taxing authority, which  are discussed in chapter 3.", "For one measure of the District\u2019s own-source revenue capacity we used the  U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) estimates of total taxable  resources (TTR).  TTR is a comprehensive measure of all income either  received by state residents (from state or out-of-state sources) or income  produced within the state but received by nonresidents.  We also  developed a second set of estimates of own-source revenue capacity, using  the representative tax system (RTS) methodology.

Proponents  of the RTS approach believe that administrative and political constraints  should be taken into account, even though it may be subjective to say what  is a constraint and what is a choice.", "In producing our RTS estimates, data limitations compelled us to use a  variety of assumptions and, in some cases, several different approaches  when estimating individual tax bases.

According to our RTS estimates for  that same year, the District\u2019s per capita own-source revenue capacity was  from 19 percent to 29 percent greater than the average.

We estimated that, if the  District had provided an average level of services in fiscal year 2000, its  federal grants would have been more than two and one-half times as large  as the average per capita federal grants received by state fiscal systems and  over 50 percent more than the second largest recipient of federal  assistance, Alaska.  Adding these grants to the TTR estimate of own-source  revenue capacity yields an estimated total revenue capacity for the District  that is 60 percent greater than that of the average state fiscal system.

For example, we estimated that the cost to the  District of providing a representative level of police and fire services, solid  waste management, parking facilities, local libraries, and transit subsidies  in fiscal year 2000 was from $44 million to $77 million more than it would  have been if the daily inflow of commuters to the District had only equaled  the daily outflow.

Again, no data are collected  on the amount of taxes paid directly by commuters or the tax revenues  attributable to jobs supported by them.  Some rough indications of the  revenue contributions are available.

Particularly important is the nature of the crediting mechanism that  would be established under such a tax.  For example, if the District\u2019s tax  were made fully creditable against the federal income tax liabilities of the  commuters, as was proposed in the \u201cDistrict of Columbia Fair Federal  Compensation Act of 2002\u201d (H.R. 3923), then the federal government would  bear the cost and would have to either reduce spending or make up for this  revenue loss by other means.

This, in turn, would reduce the amount of revenue the  District would gain from the tax.  Conversely, the higher taxes paid by  commuters could result in decisions to relocate to the District to avoid  paying the commuter tax.

The District\u2019s high costs for Medicaid are caused by a high  demand for Medicaid that, in part, can be attributed to its special  population consisting of people at a very high poverty rate and a high  proportion of citizens who lack private health insurance because their  employers do not offer it or they cannot afford it; thus, a large number of  District residents rely on Medicaid for public health care coverage.  These  factors lead to the District spending disproportionately more to fund an  average level of Medicaid coverage and services.  Specifically, the District\u2019s  poverty level is the second highest among states, and many District  residents meet income-based coverage criteria.

The District ranks near the bottom in many  health indicators relative to other states, a situation that affects the types  and levels of services the population needs.

The costs of treating Medicaid beneficiaries with  HIV/AIDS are very high and because the District has the highest infection  rate in the country and a disproportionately large number of Medicaid  beneficiaries, the fiscal burden of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the District\u2019s  Medicaid program is likely disproportionately larger than most states.", "Another factor influencing the District\u2019s high Medicaid costs relates to the  ways in which health and long-term care services are delivered. Providers  generally are located in densely populated urban areas with high real estate  and personnel costs, a situation which drives providers\u2019 costs upward.   Specifically, many providers have high operating costs in the District,  largely due to the high costs of purchasing or renting office space and the  necessity of paying higher salaries to medical personnel.  Moreover,  according to District officials, many of the District\u2019s provider payment  rates, particularly for physicians, are below average relative to operating  costs.", "The combined effects of high operating costs and low payment rates may  contribute to physicians not accepting beneficiaries of the District  Medicaid program.  This could be a reason why many of the District\u2019s  Medicaid beneficiaries rely on emergency rooms more so than in other  jurisdictions.  District Medicaid beneficiaries may also not obtain  preventive care when needed, thus allowing health conditions to worsen,  which could lead to hospital stays.

For example, DMH, which was  removed from federal receivership in May 2001, did not have an adequate  billing process or information management systems in place.  District  officials told us that DMH\u2019s billing system contained system edits that  permitted unallowable costs to go through undetected and then forwarded  these claims to the Medical Assistance Administration\u2019s (MAA) fiscal agent  for reimbursement, which would reject them after the services were  already provided.  As a result, Medicaid charges, as well as Medicare, were  not properly documented and deemed unreimbursable by the federal  government.  In fact, officials said the problems were so severe that DMH  voluntarily ceased billing for Medicaid federal funds\u2014as well as  Medicare\u2014for most of 2001 to resolve these problems and avoid almost  certain disallowances from the federal government.  DMH did not provide a  precise estimate of the federal reimbursement that was lost during this  period.", "The District also does not have an effective centralized monitoring process  for Medicaid.  Officials of MAA told us they have a limited ability to control  and monitor CFSA, DMH, and DCPS\u2014unlike the private third parties that  provide services under the regular Medicaid program.  Because these  public provider agencies are distinct units of the District government, the  District\u2019s budget makes it clear that MAA does not have authority over  these agencies in terms of financial management, programs, budget, claims  for submission or billing, or estimation of federal reimbursement.", "Officials told us that historically individual agencies, such as DMH or  DCPS, made their own Medicaid projections for inclusion in the District\u2019s  budget and the projections were almost always highly inflated.   Accordingly, the baseline of the District\u2019s budget would indicate a large  influx in federal Medicaid funds that would never materialize due to billing  and claims management problems.  For example, DCPS\u2019s original estimate  of expected federal reimbursement for fiscal year 2002 was $43 million,  which was later reduced to $15 million by the District chief financial officer  (CFO).  In fiscal year 2001, the District wrote off over $78 million of several  years worth of such unpaid federal claims, which were still in the baseline  of its budget.

These reports estimate that the  local costs of management problems could be in the millions of dollars.", "However, our cost analysis did not take into account the costs associated  with fiscal resources that are wasted due to inefficient management.  This  limitation likely results in significant amounts of DCPS\u2019s fiscal resources  being lost.", "Many of the management problems at DCPS can be attributed to  inadequate financial management, including a lack of effective internal  controls and clearly defined and enforced policies and procedures.  For  example, the independent audit of the District\u2019s financial statements for  fiscal year 2001 classified DCPS\u2019s accounting and financial reporting as a  \u201cmaterial weakness.\u201d  The auditors found that DCPS did not ensure timely  loading of budget information into its accounting system, which prevented  DCPS from monitoring expenditures and having accurate financial  reports.  In another instance, DCPS\u2019s procurement procedures were not  routinely enforced, as exemplified by capital project purchase orders being  processed directly through the DCPS CFO instead of through the  procurement office.  Recently, DCPS officials acknowledged that they face  difficulties in tracking procurement costs, and as a result, individuals at  schools may purchase goods without completing a purchase order.  Often  through a process known as a \u201cfriendly lawsuit,\u201d vendors will deliver goods  without a purchase order and subsequently notify DCPS of the purchase to  receive payment.  Last year, DCPS set aside $17 million to compensate for  such unauthorized purchases, and spent $10 million of it.", "DCPS officials provided us with other examples of the limitations of  DCPS\u2019s electronic financial management system.  These limitations prevent  DCPS from adequately tracking personnel costs, which represent  approximately 80 percent of the school district\u2019s budget.  The system also  does not allow DCPS officials to track either the total number of employees  or whether particular positions are still available or have been filled.   Recently reported problems with managing personnel expenses further  highlight DCPS\u2019s financial management problems.  In March 2003, DCPS  officials announced that the school system had hired about 640 more  employees than its budget authorized, resulting in DCPS exceeding its  personnel budget by a projected amount of $31.5 million over the entire  fiscal year.  Also, in December 2002, DCPS officials announced that it paid  $5 million for employee insurance benefits and contributed to tax-free  retirement accounts for employees who no longer worked for DCPS.", "Reports have also identified management problems in particular  educational programs, which influence costs and negatively affect the  quality and level of service provided to students, particularly in special  education.  For example, a September 2002 investigation by the District  Auditor found that DCPS paid $1.2 million to vendors for providing special  education services to individuals whose eligibility could not be determined  from information on vendors\u2019 invoices.  In November 2000, the District IG  reported that DCPS paid more than $175,000 in tuition to nonpublic special  education schools that failed to meet the standards for special education  programs.  The District IG also reported inaccuracies in DCPS\u2019s database  for special education students, inadequate oversight of special education  tuition payments, and insufficient monitoring of nonpublic special  education schools.  Finally, the District IG concluded that DCPS lacked  adequate management controls to ensure that transportation services were  adequately procured, documented, and paid.  The IG concluded that by  implementing certain cost saving measures DCPS could save at least $2.4  million annually.", "In addition, DCPS has longstanding issues regarding its ability to comply  with the laws and regulations of federal education programs, including  IDEA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) food and nutrition  programs.  The extent of DCPS\u2019s compliance issues with IDEA have been  serious, and by 1998 the U.S. Department of Education (Education) entered  into a compliance agreement with DCPS that mandated improvements in  DCPS\u2019s special education program.  Further, the District has experienced  longstanding issues of complying with USDA\u2019s requirements for the  National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program.   DCPS\u2019s poor management of USDA\u2019s food and nutrition programs resulted  in the Mayor and the City Council removing oversight and monitoring  responsibilities from DCPS and placing them under a new, independent  District State Education Office (SEO).  SEO officials told us that while  oversight and monitoring have improved, they still face many problems in  effectively managing USDA\u2019s food and nutrition programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Special Education Costs May Result in Less Funding Available for All Other Elementary and Secondary Education Services", "paragraphs": ["Our program review revealed that the District has a high demand for  special education and related costs, which are not adequately captured in  our quantitative analysis.  The District has a disproportionately large share  of special education due process hearings that often result in it having to  provide more expensive services and pay large legal fees; relies heavily on  costly non-public schools; and operates under an array of court orders  springing from class action lawsuits, many of which mandate additional  types and levels of services.", "Accordingly, our cost analysis does not sufficiently consider a major  education cost driver for the District because we assumed that the  District\u2019s special education costs were typical of the average state system,  which we found is not the case.  For example, the number of special  education students has grown rapidly in recent years.  Between the 1998- 1999 and 2000-2001 school years, the number of special education students  in DCPS grew by over 25 percent, while the total number of nonspecial  education students decreased slightly.  Over the same period of time, the  percentage of special education students attending Boston Public Schools  and the San Francisco Unified School District declined about 9 percent and  4 percent respectively.  DCPS projects that the number of special education  students will continue to grow even as the general student population is  expected to continue declining, which will likely cause the special  education program to pose an increasingly significant financial burden on  DCPS.  Overall, the size of the special education population as a percentage  of students attending DCPS exceeds the average size for 100 of the largest  urban school districts in the United States.  Further, evidence suggests that  DCPS may also pay a higher cost per special education student than other  urban systems.", "The high costs associated with the District\u2019s large number of due process  hearings divert resources from other critical education services.  As  required by IDEA, a due process hearing gives parents of special needs  children the opportunity to present complaints on any matter relating to  the education of their children and seek remedies to any shortcomings.   Some shortcomings that frequently spur due process hearings in the  District include a lack of sufficient educational programs, older school  buildings that are not handicapped accessible, failure to meet deadlines for  providing services in accordance with students\u2019 individualized education  plans (IEP), and not sufficiently involving parents in the development of  IEPs.  The number of due process hearings held in the District in 2000  exceeded every state except New York, and DCPS estimates that the  number of hearings requested will continue to grow as these shortcomings  continue.", "DCPS officials also acknowledged that their special education program  suffers from a range of shortcomings, such as a lack of early intervention  and prevention and underinvestment in program capacity.  For example,  DCPS officials noted that many special education teachers are not certified  to provide special education.", "According to some officials, due process hearings in the District often  become forums for parents to advocate moving their child out of public  schooling and into a private facility\u2014at the District\u2019s expense.  Due process  hearings may result in the placement of a child in a much more costly  setting, such as the transfer of the student from a public to an out-of- District private facility at the expense of DCPS, or mandating additional  types or levels of services.  Furthermore, the due process hearings result in  legal costs to the District because the parents of a student often use a law  firm to handle their cases, and if the student prevails in the hearing, the  District must pay the legal fees.  DCPS officials and other key observers  have told us that many parents in the District want their children to be  moved into private facilities and lawyers respond to parents wishes and  DCPS\u2019s deficiencies, thereby realizing financial gains.  For example, DCPS  staff informed us that one law firm alone represented students in over 900  due process cases between September 2002 and January 2003 and earned  approximately $1 million in fees from the District in 1 year.  Even though  Congress implemented a cap on legal fees related to special education,  District officials told us the cap does not appear to have affected the  incidence of due process hearings, but we did not independently verify  these claims.", "DCPS officials indicated that DCPS has also incurred additional costs to  comply with court orders and settlements resulting from class action  lawsuits.  For example, DCPS officials said that the costs of transporting  special education students doubled after implementing service  improvements as required by the court in the Petties case.   However,  DCPS could not verify that some of the costs attributed to the Petties case  were court ordered.  DCPS officials stated that even with increased  spending and greater services, they do not think they will be able to meet  all of the court ordered service improvements.  According to DCPS  officials, another significant case was the Nelson case, which required  DCPS to develop emergency evacuation plans for students with mobility  impairments.  DCPS officials said that complying with the court order  required DCPS to make significant capital expenditures.", "DCPS also reported that it has a high percentage of special education  students attending nonpublic special education schools because it lacks  the staff and facilities to adequately serve its special education students.   DCPS officials acknowledged that the school system historically has relied  on contracting with non-public education facilities, and DCPS has never  built up the capacity to deliver sufficient special education services within  DCPS.  Services provided in non-public special facilities services are much  more costly to DCPS than services provided in public institutions, as non- public schools charge much more for their services.  For example, a special  education student attending a nonpublic institution costs about twice as  much as one receiving special education within DCPS.  Spending on these  services draws resources away from other public education services, as  well as helping to build up the capacity to deliver more special education  services within DCPS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Provides Technical Assistance to the District, Recognizing Its Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In recognition of the District\u2019s special circumstances and management  problems, the federal government, to some extent, has provided technical  assistance to the District.
