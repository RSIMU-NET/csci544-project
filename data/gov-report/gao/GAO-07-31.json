Since the CMP office relies on current UN procurement practices, implementation of future CMP procurements could become vulnerable to numerous UN procurement weaknesses that GAO previously reported in April 2006 (GAO-06-577), such as the lack of guidance for construction procurement in the procurement manual. The estimated total cost of the CMP increased from about $1.19 billion to almost $1.75 billion between 2002 and 2005 to reflect inflation arising from a later start date, refinements to the design, and a change in the renovation approach. The UN continued to follow construction industry practices to develop the 2005 cost estimate and has included expected elements. However, the cost estimate is still preliminary and will likely change. While the UN has passed a resolution expressing a preference for cash assessments, it has yet to decide how to finance the remaining renovation costs. In June 2006, the General Assembly passed a resolution stating that a cash payment option would be the simplest and most cost-effective approach for funding the CMP. Under this approach, the UN would assess member states for the cost of the renovation through single- or multiyear payments. The amount the UN assessed member states would be likely based on each country's rate for its annual regular budget contributions. The General Assembly plans to revisit the financing issue by the end of 2006. Without certain General Assembly decisions by the end of 2006, the renovation's current schedule could be delayed and costs could increase. Specifically, a General Assembly decision on a financing arrangement for the total CMP budget would be needed to ensure that funds could be available by December 2007. Without these decisions, the CMP office cannot finalize a start date for the renovation. UN oversight entities have continued to oversee the CMP while the Department of State has monitored its progress. OIOS has conducted audits on CMP procurements and has issued several reports of its findings and recommendations. However, OIOS relies on funds from the CMP budget and must negotiate for those funds with the UN budget office, which may impair its ability to secure sufficient funds. The UN Board of Auditors has also conducted oversight of the CMP office by reviewing its financial records and internal controls and has found no material weaknesses in its review. Similarly, State's monitoring efforts have not identified any significant concerns, according to State officials."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations (UN) headquarters complex in New York City neither  conforms to current safety, fire, and building codes nor meets UN  technology or security requirements.

In  May 2003, we reported that the UN had decided on a single-phased  approach to the renovation, in which most UN staff and activities would  be temporarily relocated so that the buildings could be renovated  concurrently. The U.N. Development Corporation would have built a new  building, referred to as UNDC-5, adjacent to the UN headquarters where  UN activities could continue during the renovation. However, the UN  determined that this option was no longer viable when the corporation  could not secure approval for the new building from the New York State  legislature in time for the beginning of construction. In June 2006, the  General Assembly approved proceeding with the renovation project using  a multiphased approach. This approach consists of renovating the  Secretariat building, 10 floors at a time, and moving UN staff and functions  displaced by the renovation to rented commercial office space and a  temporary building to be constructed on the North Lawn above the  existing North Lawn extension.

The CMP office\u2019s cost estimator  determined that the New York City construction industry for projects  similar to the UN renovation experienced about 11 percent inflation  between 2002 and 2004, which accounts for almost $103 million of the  estimated cost increase. In addition, the escalation costs in the estimate  increased by $185 million to account for the expected inflation over the  duration of the project, including the additional 2 years that were added to  the project schedule for the multiphased approach.

The 2002 estimate is based on a broad conceptual design,  whereas the 2005 estimate was based on a more detailed project design.  For example, the 2005 estimate was based on the actual number and size  of the systems needed, rather than an overall cost estimate for the heating  and air conditioning systems, as in the 2002 estimate. These types of  design refinements increased the cost estimate by about $80 million. The  Secretary-General\u2019s third annual progress report on the CMP noted that  the process of controlling the scope and cost of the CMP would continue  to be part of the project management process during design development  and contract document preparation. According to CMP officials, efforts  are under way to reduce the construction cost through value engineering  and detailed scope review.", "The change to using a multiphased renovation approach, in which parts of  the buildings will be renovated while other parts remain in operation,  increased the project\u2019s complexity and required the CMP office to make  numerous adjustments to the estimate. For example, 20 percent was added  to the expected cost of replacing the window structure on the outside of  the Secretariat building because it will have to be done in more than one  stage and additional waterproofing will be required. There was also a cost  associated with isolating those floors being renovated from those that will  be occupied by UN staff during the renovation. In addition, the source of  temporary space needed for UN complex occupants during the renovation  changed after the 2002 estimate was completed. In the 2002 estimate, the  UN had expected to lease about 800,000 square feet of office and  conference space in the new UNDC-5 building at below market rates.  Since the proposed UNDC-5 building will not be built and the rental rates  in New York City have increased considerably, the 2005 estimate reflects  the UN\u2019s revised plan to (1) lease about 228,000 square feet of office space  and 80,000 square feet of library space at market rates for displaced staff  and functions and (2) construct a 100,000 square foot temporary building  on the UN complex to meet the conference needs of the UN during the  renovation. While the projected amount of necessary office space has  decreased since the last estimate, it will be needed for a longer period of  time, and the projected rental rates have increased substantially. The CMP  office estimated that the change to a multiphased renovation approach  added about $188 million to the 2005 estimated CMP cost.", "In November 2006, the Secretary-General\u2019s fourth annual progress report  on the CMP updated the total project cost estimate from about $1.75  billion to about $1.88 billion, an increase of approximately $128 million.  According to the report, this increase is due primarily to increases in the  cost of swing space ($50 million) and further development of the scope  options ($69 million). The report also identifies some areas where the  project cost is at risk of increasing further.

Generally, OIOS derives its funding through its regular budget and through  extrabudgetary resources that come from the budgets for a variety of  specific projects and activities, including the CMP office. To oversee the  CMP, OIOS submitted work plans to the OPPBA and requested  extrabudgetary funds from the CMP budget. OIOS noted in October 2004  and August 2005 that it required two full-time auditors to provide  adequate audit coverage of the CMP.

When relying on extrabudgetary funds, OIOS  must obtain permission to perform audits or investigations from the  managers of funds and programs, and negotiate the terms and funds for its  oversight work. In addition, UN rules and regulations severely limit OIOS\u2019s  ability to reallocate resources from different sources. Therefore, OIOS  cannot always direct resources to oversight of high-risk areas as they  arise.

Much of the design work has  been done and the UN has funded completion of design and leasing of  temporary space to relocate UN staff and activities for the duration of the  renovation. The UN has also begun the process of procuring a  construction management firm to undertake the renovation work. The UN  could spend more than an additional $1.4 billion to complete the  renovation.
