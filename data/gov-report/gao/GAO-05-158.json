For example, it would address the judiciary's need for additional space and alleviate some security concerns. There would be space to accommodate the 47 current district and magistrate judges and the 14 additional judges expected by 2011, with room to expand, if needed, for additional judges. The new building would also improve security by providing additional holding cells and separate prisoner walkways and elevators. However, the operational and security concerns related to housing a trial court in multiple buildings (split court) that was a significant factor in Los Angeles's high urgency score would remain. For example, U.S. Marshals Service officials said that a split court would require them to duplicate much of their security equipment and personnel necessary for fulfilling its mission of protecting the courthouses. To meet judiciary and related needs in Los Angeles, the federal government will likely incur additional construction and operational costs beyond the estimated $400 million for the new courthouse. Like other courthouse projects in recent years, GSA officials acknowledge that there is a potential for the L.A. Courthouse to incur future escalation in construction costs due to changes during the design and construction phases, such as increases in raw material and labor costs. Furthermore, additional construction costs will also be incurred to meet the judiciary's space needs over the long term. Preliminary estimates by GSA show that these costs may exceed $100 million. For example, GSA will need to build four additional magistrate courtrooms in the Roybal building and renovate the current courthouse to convert courtrooms into office space for the U.S. Attorneys and other federal agencies. GSA also plans a long-term expansion project to construct seven more courtrooms to meet judiciary space needs by 2031. Judiciary officials also acknowledge that a split court would result in additional operational costs due to duplicate offices and staff in the Roybal building and the new courthouse."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1990s, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the  federal judiciary have been carrying out a multibillion dollar courthouse  construction initiative to address the judiciary\u2019s growing needs. In 1993, the  judiciary identified 160 court facilities that required either the construction  of a new building or a major annex to an existing building. To prioritize  requests for these new courthouse projects, Congress, the Office of  Management and Budget, and GSA rely on a rolling 5-year plan prepared  annually by the judiciary. The 5-year plan ranks projects using a  methodology that assigns an urgency score to each project based on four  criteria\u2014the year a courthouse runs out of space, the number of judges  without courtrooms, security concerns, and operational inefficiencies. In  recent years, the Los Angeles (L.A.) Courthouse has been ranked as the  highest-priority project in the judiciary\u2019s 5-year plan based on its high  urgency score.", "Currently, the L.A. Courthouse operations are split between two  buildings\u2014the Spring Street Courthouse built in 1938 and the Roybal  Federal Building built in 1992. The current proposal is to expand the  judiciary\u2019s use of the Roybal building for the magistrate judges while  constructing a new courthouse to house the district judges. At a cost of  approximately $400 million, the new courthouse could be one of the most  expensive projects in the federal government\u2019s courthouse construction  program to date. Because of the project\u2019s significance, GAO was asked:  1. To what extent does GSA\u2019s current L.A. Courthouse project proposal  address the underlying conditions that led to Los Angeles\u2019s high  urgency score? 2. What construction and other costs, if any, may be required to meet  judiciary and related needs in Los Angeles?", "To determine whether the current project proposal would address the  courthouse space, security, and operational concerns in Los Angeles, we  inspected the current and planned sites for the U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles. We also interviewed judges and officials from the U.S. District  Court in Los Angeles, and officials from the Administrative Office of the  U.S. Courts (AOUSC), GSA, and U.S. Marshals Service (Marshals Service).   We reviewed the urgency score criteria developed by the judiciary and  planning studies developed for GSA and the judiciary for the L.A.  Courthouse project. To obtain information on courthouse construction and  other costs, we reviewed relevant laws related to the construction of  courthouses, appropriations laws, project prospectuses, and budgetary  data. We also interviewed officials from GSA and the judiciary. To ensure  the reliability of information presented in this report, we corroborated  much of the documentation on construction cost estimates, planning  studies and prospectuses, and urgency score criteria through testimonial  interviews with GSA and judiciary officials. A list of related GAO reports on  courthouse construction appears at the end of this report. We conducted  our work from June 2004 through September 2004 in Los Angeles,  California, and Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. This report summarizes the information  we provided to your staff during our September 23, 2004, briefing.

In downtown Los Angeles, the District Court  operations are split between two buildings\u2014the Spring Street Courthouse  and the Roybal Federal Building\u2014that are approximately one-quarter mile  apart. The Spring Street building, considered by the court to be the main  courthouse in Los Angeles, is more than 65 years old and, according to  judiciary and GSA officials, requires major renovations and does not  currently meet the security or space needs of the judiciary. By contrast, the  Roybal building was constructed in the early 1990s and, according to GSA  officials, complied with design and security specifications that were in  place at the time it was built. However, inefficiencies occur because the  court\u2019s operations are split between these two buildings.", "Federal courthouse construction projects are prioritized based on urgency  scores assigned by the judiciary\u2014the higher the score, the more urgent the  project is considered (see table 1).", "The Los Angeles court has the highest urgency score of any project in the 5- year plan due to the space, security, and operational inefficiencies  presented by the Spring Street Courthouse. To address these concerns,  GSA and the judiciary prepared a series of feasibility studies looking at  different options for accommodating the court\u2019s long-term needs. One  option involved constructing a stand-alone building that would consolidate  all of the court operations into a single building.  GSA and the judiciary also  considered constructing a companion building physically connected to the  Roybal building. A third alternative that was studied involved the partial or  complete demolition of an existing federal building to provide a site for a  new courthouse.", "According to judiciary and GSA officials, after years of study and debate,  these options were not selected because of cost or space limitations. For  example, AOUSC noted that a consolidated courthouse would cost  approximately $480 million. Currently, GSA is proposing the construction  of a new 41-courtroom building, as shown in figure 1, to house district  court judges and related operations at a location approximately 6/10 of a  mile from the Roybal building. Under this proposal, the judiciary would  expand its use of the Roybal building for magistrate and bankruptcy judges  and related operations. GSA\u2019s plan also involves consolidating the U.S.  Attorneys Office in the Spring Street building, along with other federal  agencies and grand jury suites. The briefing slides in appendix I also  contain a map showing the locations of these sites.", "GSA estimates that constructing the new courthouse will cost  approximately $400 million. Funding for this project is contingent on  multiple appropriations. In fiscal year 2000, the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure authorized site acquisition and design of  the proposed courthouse, and in the following fiscal year Congress  appropriated $35 million for this purpose. In fiscal year 2004, the House  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure authorized additional  design and construction of the proposed courthouse in Los Angeles. In that  same fiscal year, Congress appropriated $50 million for the project and  appropriated $314 million in fiscal year 2005. On November 17, 2004, the  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works also authorized the  construction of the new courthouse in Los Angeles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Proposal Addresses Some Conditions That Led to the High Urgency Score, but Certain Operational and Security Concerns Would Remain", "paragraphs": ["The current project proposal would address the judiciary\u2019s need for more  space and alleviate some security concerns, but the operational and  security concerns related to a split court that contributed to the L.A.  Courthouse\u2019s high urgency score would remain. More specifically, while  Los Angeles\u2019s Spring Street Courthouse received a total score of 85 out of a  possible 100 points, making it the most urgent project in the judiciary\u2019s 5- year plan, 50 of these points were related to the trial court being split into  two buildings, a situation that the new project would not resolve.", "The L.A. Courthouse on Spring Street received high scores in all four  criteria that the judiciary considers in assigning an urgency score (see fig.  2). Because the L.A. Courthouse ran out of space in 1995, the judiciary  assigned the courthouse a score of 19.5 points using its urgency scoring  methodology. In addition, court officials projected that seven judges would  not have their own courtrooms within 10 years, resulting in 10.5 points for  number of judges without courtrooms.", "The Spring Street building also received the maximum possible scores for  security concerns and operational inefficiencies (30 and 25 points,  respectively) because the trial court is split between two separate buildings  and, according to the judiciary, the Spring Street building lacks a sufficient  number of holding cells for prisoners. According to judiciary officials, it is  also difficult to keep prisoners separate from judges and the public in the  hallways. To address this last problem, the courthouse has colored,  numbered lines designed to guide the U.S. Marshals as they lead prisoners  from the detention cells to the courtrooms (see fig. 3). However, court  officials said that this system is too confusing and difficult to follow  through the narrow halls. Furthermore, many of the building\u2019s courtrooms  are less than half the size required under the U.S. Courts Design Guide or  have major visual obstructions.", "The current proposal\u2014constructing a new courthouse and expanding the  judiciary\u2019s use of the Roybal building\u2014addresses some of the conditions  that led to the high urgency score. For example, it addresses the judiciary\u2019s  space constraints by providing additional courtrooms\u2014sized to meet the  Design Guide standards\u2014to accommodate the 47 current district and  magistrate judges and the 14 additional judges expected by 2011. According  to GSA officials, there is also room to build an additional district judge  courtroom in the new building and additional magistrate judge courtrooms  in the Roybal building to address the judiciary\u2019s projected 30-year needs. In  addition, the proposal addresses some of the more serious security and  operational inefficiencies associated with the Spring Street building, such  as providing additional prisoner holding cells, secure prisoner elevators,  and separate, secured hallways for prisoners, judges, and the public.  Marshals Service officials also told us that a split court would be  acceptable from a security standpoint, provided the Marshals Service  security standards are followed. In addition, the court would receive the  operational benefits of a new building, and under the current proposal,  avoid the major structural deficiencies of using the 66-year-old Spring  Street building as a courthouse. For example, according to the judiciary  and GSA, the Spring Street building has outdated electrical and plumbing  systems and requires a seismic retrofit to meet GSA\u2019s standards. In  contrast, the Roybal Federal Building, which was constructed in the early  1990s, was designed to meet modern operational and security  requirements. For example, it is connected to the Metropolitan Detention  Center, which houses federal prisoners prior to arraignment and trial, via a  secure underground passageway, so that prisoners do not have to be led  through public areas on their way to and from the Roybal building cell  block.", "The current proposal\u2019s major limitation is that it would still result in a split  court, even though consolidating the district court into a single building  was one of the main priorities in the judiciary\u2019s most recent long-range plan  for Los Angeles, published in 1996. Operational and security concerns  stemming from a split court led to 50 of the 85 points in the Spring Street  Courthouse\u2019s urgency score. For example, the building received the  maximum possible security score (30 points) because the trial court was  split between two buildings\u2014the Roybal building and Spring Street  Courthouse. With the court still split between buildings under the current  proposal, related operational inefficiencies and security concerns would  remain. According to AOUSC and Marshals Service officials, operational  inefficiencies would include the need to continue to transport judges,  prisoners, and evidence between buildings; confusion among jurors and  attorneys over which facility they should report to; and possible delays,  misrouting, and loss of time-sensitive documents (such as restraining  orders) as they flow between buildings. A split court would also require  duplication of several offices and activities. For example, Marshals Service  officials said that a split court would require them to replicate much of  their security equipment and contract guards to operate the equipment and  protect each building.", "We noted during our review that the judiciary refined its urgency scoring  methodology in March 2002 and gave less weight to split court factors. In  the judiciary\u2019s current 5-year plan, 26 projects are scored under the original  methodology and 31 are scored under the refined methodology. The L.A.  Courthouse was scored under the original methodology and has not  officially been rescored. As a result, we use the original methodology to  discuss the L.A. Courthouse\u2019s urgency score in this report. In September  2004, the Judicial Conference adopted a 2-year moratorium on 42  courthouse construction projects currently listed on the judiciary's 5-year  plan. During this moratorium period, AOUSC officials said that they plan to  re-evaluate the urgency scoring methodology as part of a larger review of  the design guide standards and the courthouse construction planning  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Construction and Operational Costs Beyond the Estimated $400 Million for the New Courthouse Are Likely", "paragraphs": ["To meet the long-term judiciary and related needs in Los Angeles, the  federal government will likely incur additional construction and  operational costs beyond the estimated $400 million for the new  courthouse. These funds are designated for costs associated with the  proposed courthouse, including the site acquisition and the design and  construction costs. However, GSA recognizes that in recent years other  courthouse construction projects have had cost escalations. Cost  escalations may occur because of planning or design problems, such as  changes in the scope or specific design elements in a project, or they may  be the result of changes outside of the control of the planners, such as  increases in the cost of labor or particular construction materials, such as  steel. GSA has initiated actions intended to mitigate this problem, including  improving the design modeling process and more closely reviewing project  changes during construction. Nevertheless, GSA acknowledges that a  potential still exists for all courthouse projects, including the L.A.  Courthouse, to incur future escalation in construction costs.", "In addition to construction costs for the new courthouse, GSA has  indicated that additional funds will be needed for construction related to  the long-term space needs of the judiciary and other related agencies in Los  Angeles. Preliminary estimates from GSA show that these additional costs  may exceed $100 million. Specifically:  To accommodate the anticipated need for additional magistrate judge  courtrooms, GSA told us that it will need to build four additional  magistrate courtrooms in the Roybal building to increase the total  number of magistrate courtrooms from 16 to 20. GSA has estimated the  cost of this renovation to be approximately $10 million.", "Once the District Court moves out of the Spring Street Courthouse and  into the new courthouse, GSA said that it will need to renovate the  Spring Street building to convert courtrooms into office space for U.S.  Attorneys and other federal agencies. The costs for this project are not  currently known, but a 1997 GSA study estimated the cost to be  approximately $77 million in 2003 dollars. However, according to GSA,  the Spring Street building will require major renovations, whether the  judiciary or other federal agencies use it.", "GSA estimates the costs associated with future expansion in the Roybal  building and the new courthouse needed to meet expected judiciary  space needs by 2031 to be $21 million. According to GSA, this  expansion, if necessary, would involve constructing six additional  magistrate courtrooms and judges\u2019 chambers in the Roybal building and  one district courtroom and judge\u2019s chambers in the proposed new  courthouse.", "GSA and judiciary officials have also told us that there will likely be  additional operational costs associated with constructing a new  courthouse, although the extent of these costs is currently unknown.   These officials indicated that there will be moving expenses for the  judiciary to relocate to the new courthouse as well as to place all the  magistrate judges in the Roybal building. According to GSA officials, the  judiciary may also need to lease offsite parking spaces to accommodate  court needs, although the total number of parking spaces needed, if any, is  unknown at this time. In addition, in order to accommodate additional  magistrate courtrooms in the Roybal building, GSA officials indicated that  there may be a need to relocate some of the existing federal tenants to  leased space or to another federal building in downtown Los Angeles.", "Judiciary officials in Los Angeles also expressed concerns about additional  operational costs that would be incurred as the result of a split court.  According to the judiciary, some of the office space and/or staff that would  be duplicated in both the new courthouse and the Roybal building include  the clerk\u2019s office, pretrial services, jury assembly, Marshals Service, and the  U.S. Attorneys Office. The additional costs associated with duplicating  these offices are unknown at this time because a larger staff and more  equipment would be necessary in a consolidated courthouse due to its  larger size.
