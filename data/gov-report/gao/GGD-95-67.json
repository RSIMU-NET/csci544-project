During the 1980s, the industry ran into financial difficulties, and the number of insolvent savings and loan institutions, also known as thrifts, rose dramatically. Between 1980 and 1988, over 500 thrifts failed\u2014more than three and a half times as many as in the previous 45 years combined. Furthermore, hundreds more thrifts remained insolvent or appeared likely to become insolvent.", "Faced with a crisis of national dimensions, 1989 legislation, among other things, created RTC as a temporary mixed-ownership government corporation to resolve thrifts that were insolvent or in imminent danger of becoming insolvent. Initially, RTC was given 7 1/2 years to resolve the failed thrifts and dispose of their assets, but subsequent legislation reduced the time RTC will be in existence. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is to inherit from RTC resolution responsibility for any thrifts that fail after July 1, 1995. RTC is scheduled to cease all of its operations on December 31, 1995, when any remaining RTC asset disposition workload and supporting operations are to be transferred to FDIC. As of February 1995, RTC estimated that assets with a book value of approximately $8 billion will be transferred to FDIC for disposition.", "GAO identified RTC as 1 of 18 high-risk areas that were particularly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and mismanagement. This identification was made mainly because of the large dollar value of the assets under RTC\u2019s control, the heavy reliance to be placed on private sector contractors, and the need for strong management information systems and oversight capabilities. Because RTC has taken actions that improved its operations, the level of risk is not as great as it once was. Thus, as discussed in our February 1995 High-Risk Series report, we removed RTC\u2019s high-risk designation.", "Also, in our High-Risk report, we stated that the transition of RTC operations and workload to FDIC by January 1996 is a continuing risk. The task of winding down a large and complex organization with thousands of personnel and billions of dollars in assets, while minimizing the adverse consequences, is a very difficult one. For a successful transition, RTC and FDIC will need to ensure that sufficient controls are in place over the assets that will be sold during the final year of RTC\u2019s existence, as well as over the assets that will be transferred to FDIC. It is also important that the transition planners give early attention to the quality of data that FDIC will receive from RTC so that RTC will have sufficient time to prepare for and respond to FDIC\u2019s information needs.", "Throughout RTC\u2019s existence, its management and support systems have evolved in response to changing conditions and legislative mandates, as well as internal and external criticism of its operations. However, certain problems have continually hampered RTC\u2019s ability to effectively accomplish its mission. These problems included weaknesses in its contracting system that contributed to excessive contract costs and in its automated systems that could not adequately support RTC\u2019s asset management and disposition activities. In December 1993, due to concerns about RTC\u2019s performance, Congress included in the RTC Completion Act a number of reforms to improve the management of RTC.", "Despite such problems and the difficult economic environment in which RTC had to operate, it has accomplished a great deal in resolving a large number of failed thrifts and selling assets during its relatively short existence. From its inception in August 1989 through December 1994, RTC accepted responsibility for 745 failed thrifts. Figure 1 shows the locations of the thrifts that were placed under RTC\u2019s control.", "By the end of December 1994, RTC had resolved 744 of these 745 thrifts. It is currently working to resolve one New Jersey thrift; it expects to accomplish this resolution by March 31, 1995.", "RTC had under its control assets with a total book value of about $463 billion. As of November 30, 1994, RTC had disposed of about 93 percent of these assets ($432 billion) and had about $31 billion in assets remaining in its inventory.

Later, a tenth item\u2014the establishment of an interagency transition task force made up of RTC and FDIC personnel\u2014was added to the plan to address the transfer of RTC\u2019s personnel and systems to FDIC when RTC ceases operations on December 31, 1995. Secretary Bentsen said that such a task force was needed to help ensure an orderly transition to FDIC without impairing RTC\u2019s operations.", "The RTC Completion Act, which became law in December 1993, included 21 management reforms\u2014those in Secretary Bentsen\u2019s 9-point plan along with 12 others.

The memorandum also required written justifications for including these assets in multiasset sales initiatives if they did not sell during the 120-day period. For reform 3, RTC issued a memorandum informing staff of the requirements to prepare written justifications for selling certain nonperforming real estate loans and other real property.

However, RTC has the discretion to use other data that may indicate more accurate neighborhood boundaries. This rule was the subject of extensive review and debate because its implementation could have a significant effect on the extent to which minority individuals or minority-owned institutions can acquire failed thrifts in PMNs. In addition, RTC established a program that provides minority acquirers of thrifts in PMNs with opportunities to purchase performing 1-4 family mortgage loans.

As of January 23, 1995, the percentage of completed corrective actions to implement GAO, IG, and OCOS audit recommendations was about 76 percent (3,485 of 4,587).

To implement the act\u2019s reform, RTC decided to address only the first two objectives that it initially established to address the reform under Secretary Bentsen\u2019s plan. According to officials in DIRM, the third objective was dropped because RTC\u2019s senior executives had not identified any information needs that would require systems\u2019 modifications.", "RTC\u2019s information systems remain critical to its efforts to manage and sell failed thrift assets and to FDIC\u2019s task of assuming responsibility for any remaining RTC operations after December 31, 1995.

Over the last 2 years, RTC has made many improvements. Its system requirements are now better defined, and it has completed all of its system development projects. In addition, it has modified its systems to improve response times and make them easier to use.", "Accurate and complete information is still critical to RTC\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively dispose of assets. Poor information can increase the uncertainty faced by investors and, therefore, may reduce the prices that they are willing to pay for RTC\u2019s assets. In June 1994, RTC completed initial data quality action plans for its 17 critical information systems. RTC uses these 17 systems to manage unsold assets, support financial transactions, and report on activities in which congressional oversight committees have had significant interest. A major component of RTC\u2019s strategy to improve the quality of data in these systems is the use of computer software to identify problems such as missing or inconsistent data.", "While RTC is making progress in improving the quality of data in its systems, some data quality problems continue. On November 30, 1994, RTC had unsold real estate with a total book value of about $2 billion and unsold loans with a total book value of about $17 billion. RTC\u2019s December 1994 internal reports showed that about 9 percent of unsold real estate records in the Real Estate Owned Management System (REOMS) had computer detectable errors, such as missing data, and about 19 percent had potential errors called warnings. For example, a large discrepancy between the book value and appraised value of an asset is called a warning. Warnings require follow up to determine whether the questionable data is correct. Also, RTC reports showed data quality improvements in the Central Loan Database (CLD), which includes information on loans and which is used to help develop loan sales initiatives. As of October 1994, the number of loan records with one or more computer detectable errors was about 19 percent compared to 57 percent when we analyzed the CLD data in December 1993.", "Although RTC is continuing its data quality program, RTC officials stated that further reductions in the percentage of computer detectable errors in both REOMS and CLD will be difficult to achieve, and errors may increase over the next several months. Officials gave three reasons for this view: (1) as asset sales occur, those assets for which there is deficient data are more likely to remain unsold and become an increasing percentage of the total loan portfolio or real estate property inventory; (2) much of the deficient data predates 1992 and is either unavailable or not easily accessible; and (3) as RTC reduces staffing levels, there will be fewer resources to research potential data errors. In addition, with fewer resources, it will become increasingly difficult to ensure that data errors are corrected.", "For these reasons, RTC is reassessing its efforts to improve the quality of data in the 17 major systems to help ensure that these efforts are properly focused on the data most critical to completing its mission. Its goal is to target critical data elements that, if not correct, could have a significant negative impact on the management of assets or the accuracy of information reported to oversight committees. This reassessment is expected to be completed by the end of March 1995.", "We agree with this approach in RTC\u2019s final year of existence. The ultimate value of RTC\u2019s efforts, however, depends on its ability to complete the implementation of the data quality action plans in time to affect current operations and on RTC\u2019s ability to sustain improvements in data quality. By concentrating on the most critical data elements that are important to managing and selling assets, RTC should make the best use of its efforts. In addition, the benefits of better data should also help FDIC when it assumes responsibility for those assets that remain to be sold after RTC\u2019s termination. Furthermore, RTC\u2019s ongoing need for up-to-date, accurate, and complete corporate information is intensified by its need for information to support appropriate short-term business decisions, given that RTC\u2019s responsibilities will soon transfer to FDIC.", "The Secretary of the Treasury, in his capacity as Chairman of the Oversight Board, will need similar information to carry out his responsibility for overseeing the transfer of RTC personnel and systems to FDIC, as required under section 7 of the RTC Completion Act. This section requires that in the transfer of RTC systems to FDIC, any RTC management, resolution, or asset disposition system that the Secretary of the Treasury determines, after considering the recommendations of the interagency RTC/FDIC transition task force, has benefited RTC shall be transferred to and used by FDIC. Also, section 7 requires that RTC personnel involved with these systems who are eligible for transfer to FDIC shall be transferred for continued employment. In this area, RTC has begun working with FDIC to identify systems and data that could be transferred to FDIC as it picks up responsibility for RTC\u2019s activities.", "Under the second objective, RTC is selectively enhancing its primary information systems that support its financial operations and asset disposition activities. A total of 11 enhancements are under way or have been completed for 4 primary systems at an estimated cost of about $1 million. RTC expects this work to be completed by the end of March 1995. The systems to be enhanced are the (l) Control Totals Module, which is used to post summary asset related financial transactions to the general ledger; (2) Warranties and Representations Accounts Processing System, which tracks information for each asset sale that includes a representation and warranty; (3) Seller Financing System\u2019s Commercial and Multi-Family module, which maintains data RTC needs to close on loans secured by commercial real estate properties; and (4) Asset Manager System, which is a cash management system that captures all income and expenses associated with RTC assets managed by Standard Asset Management and Disposition Agreement (SAMDA) contractors.", "Although RTC dropped the third objective\u2014to improve information to senior executives for decisionmaking\u2014RTC officials told us that the needs of senior executives continue to be considered as they implement the second objective of enhancing systems to support business needs and modify management information reports. Our interim report noted that we believed that the third objective was still relevant because of RTC\u2019s ongoing need for up-to-date, accurate, and complete information, especially in light of the pending transition of RTC responsibilities to FDIC.
