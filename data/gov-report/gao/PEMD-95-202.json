This issue is of particular concern because families started by teenage mothers represent almost half the families receiving welfare and are likely to receive assistance for long periods of time, at great cost to the public. While low-income teenage mothers stand a better chance of avoiding long-term welfare dependency if they obtain a high school education, there is uncertainty about how to achieve this outcome.", "Because of this uncertainty, you asked us to provide you with information on (1) approaches that show promise in helping teenage mothers complete their secondary education as a step toward self-sufficiency and (2) Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program activities that enable teenage mothers on welfare to complete their secondary education.", "To develop this information, we visited 13 local programs in New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin that were recognized by experts as being exemplary in helping disadvantaged teenage mothers complete their secondary education. Since most of these programs had not been formally evaluated, we also examined published impact evaluations of programs serving teenage mothers to determine which approaches had demonstrated success. We synthesized the results of the five impact evaluations whose methods we judged to be rigorous enough to produce credible results. (App. I provides additional information about these evaluations and our synthesis of their results.) Finally, we conducted interviews with AFDC and JOBS program administrators in the 15 cities across the country that had the highest numbers of births to unwed mothers under the age of 20 in 1992.", "We did our work between June 1994 and July 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We did not, however, verify the information given to us by the AFDC and JOBS program administrators."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The birth rate for unmarried women aged 15 to 19 increased threefold between 1960 and 1992 (see fig. 1). While the increase in births to unwed teenagers is part of an increasing trend in births to unwed mothers of all childbearing ages, the economic consequences are usually more severe for teenagers because many teenagers who have a child forgo their high school education. Having disrupted her education, the teenage mother may never attain the diploma that the labor market increasingly demands, even for low-wage jobs. Women who begin childbearing during their teenage years are significantly more likely than women who postpone having children to live in poverty, to receive public assistance, and to have long periods of welfare dependency.", "Nearly half of all unmarried teenage mothers are likely to go onto AFDC within the first 48 months after giving birth. While unwed teenage mothers as a group tend to stay on welfare for a relatively long time, those who have not completed high school are likely to remain on public assistance even longer. We reported last year that AFDC families headed by women who did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent were less likely to leave AFDC than those with at least a high school diploma or equivalent.", "Estimates of the public costs associated with supporting teenage mothers and their children are high and growing. The Center for Population Options estimates that in 1992 the federal government spent $34 billion in AFDC, Medicaid, and Food Stamp benefits to support families started by teenagers. This was a 17-percent increase from 1991 and a 36-percent rise from 1990.", "In passing the Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), the Congress recognized the importance of a high school education to avoiding long-term welfare dependence, especially for young parents. The act created the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training program to provide employment training and assistance for recipients of AFDC benefits. JOBS directs states to require custodial parents aged 16 to 19, regardless of the age of their child(ren), who have not completed their secondary education to participate in educational activities directed toward the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent, to the extent that these activities are available and that state resources permit.", "States are afforded substantial discretion in deciding how they will serve AFDC recipients, including teenage mothers in the JOBS program. Although FSA emphasizes the importance of education for teenage mothers on AFDC, it does not require states either to provide all their high school dropout teenage mothers slots in JOBS or to ensure that these teenage mothers actually participate in educational activities by tracking their attendance. As a result, teenage mothers who have dropped out of high school may not be required to participate in JOBS if a state lacks the resources to provide child care, transportation, or JOBS education or training. Moreover, those referred to educational activities through JOBS may not actually attend. In fact, states have moved unevenly to enroll teenage AFDC mothers, including those who have dropped out of school, in JOBS. We reported recently, for example, that one state enrolled as few as 7 percent of AFDC teenage parents, while another enrolled more than half. The number who actually attend high school or GED classes is unknown.", "The Congress is now considering welfare reform proposals that include provisions that relate directly or indirectly to the AFDC program\u2019s approach to teenage mothers. A provision in the House proposal would deny cash benefits to unmarried mothers under age 18, but permit provision of noncash benefits such as child care or transportation assistance. Both the House and Senate propose to increase the proportion of welfare recipients who must participate in a work program and to reduce states\u2019 funding if they fail to meet participation goals. Most importantly for teenagers, the House proposal would no longer consider enrollment in a high school or equivalency program as work program participation unless the student was also employed an average of 20 hours a week. In contrast, although the Senate\u2019s proposal permits states to deny cash benefits to unwed teenage mothers, they are not required to do so. However, if states do pay benefits to teenage mothers, those teenagers must live under an adult\u2019s supervision and be working toward high school completion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Approaches Show Promise in Helping Young Mothers Complete High School or GED", "paragraphs": ["Numerous programs have been established in communities throughout the country to reduce the negative consequences of teenage parenting. Our synthesis of rigorous impact evaluations of five such programs operating in multiple sites identified one feature that distinguished the programs that increased high school or GED completions from those that did not: active monitoring and follow-up of school attendance. All five programs also provided child care and transportation assistance; otherwise, these programs were quite different. Table 1 outlines the programs\u2019 major characteristics (see app. II for descriptions of the programs and their outcomes). While many of the programs we visited shared the common features found in the five evaluated programs, they also provided examples of, but had not yet evaluated, promising approaches to helping teenage mothers overcome obstacles to high school completion. These approaches included providing services in special schools, residential centers, or the teenagers\u2019 homes, as well as offering school-based programs for all at-risk youth."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Successful Programs Had Attendance Monitoring and Follow-Up in Common", "paragraphs": ["All five program evaluations provided outcome data on secondary education completion. Although all five programs increased school enrollment, only three were successful in helping young mothers complete high school or obtain a GED: Learning, Earning, and Parenting (LEAP), New Chance, and Jobstart. While the ultimate goal is for teenage mothers to be economically self-sufficient, only three of the evaluations included in our synthesis measured economic impacts 2 years or more after teenagers entered the program, and only one had successful results on postprogram employment or AFDC receipt. No feature clearly set this program apart.Consequently, we focused on how to help teenagers complete their secondary education. Although currently there is some debate as to whether the GED provides the same earnings potential as a high school diploma, we combined these measures because the programs we reviewed encouraged either or both as routes to prepare teenagers for employment.", "One program feature clearly distinguished between programs that increased school completions and those that did not: The three successful programs actively monitored school attendance and followed up either with financial incentives and sanctions or with intensive case management. However, attendance monitoring and follow-up took place in different forms in the three programs that practiced them.", "The LEAP program, run by the Ohio welfare department, combined active monitoring with financial sanctions and incentives. AFDC offices coordinated closely with school districts to obtain teenage AFDC parents\u2019 attendance records on a monthly basis. When attendance problems arose, LEAP followed up by reducing teenage parents\u2019 monthly AFDC checks by $62 for unexcused absences from school. When attendance was good, LEAP followed up with a comparable bonus in recipients\u2019 AFDC checks. LEAP participants in Cleveland had statistically significant, higher rates of high school graduation or GED completion than those of nonparticipants 1 and 3 years after enrollment. The statewide program also resulted in slightly higher GED completion rates over the short term (18 months after enrollment) but had no information on high school graduations.", "The community-based New Chance and Jobstart programs combined direct attendance monitoring with either financial rewards or case management. In both, most classes and other activities were held on-site so attendance could be monitored through personal observation. When classes or activities were held off-site, these programs coordinated with providers to monitor the teenagers\u2019 attendance. New Chance\u2019s follow-up consisted of intensive case management to help resolve participants\u2019 problems that were identified through monitoring. For example, case managers approached teenagers who had attendance problems to help identify the barriers to good attendance. They then offered assistance, such as counseling, on-site child care, or, for more specialized needs, help in accessing the appropriate resources. Jobstart\u2019s follow-up at a majority of sites involved small financial rewards for maintaining good attendance or for making academic progress; financial sanctions were not used. New Chance participants had significantly higher rates of high school or GED completions than did nonparticipants 1 and 1-1/2 years after enrollment. The Jobstart program participants had higher rates of high school or GED completions than did nonparticipants 4 years after enrollment in the program.", "Neither Project Redirection nor the Teenage Parent Demonstration was successful in increasing high school or GED completions. The community-based Project Redirection was largely a mentoring program that offered service referrals and sent teenagers to other sites for classes, but did not routinely observe or keep track of their attendance, nor did it follow up on their daily absences. This program, as well as others, experienced attendance problems. In fact, teenagers attended GED classes only about half the time, and those enrolled in regular and alternative school classes failed to attend about a quarter of the time. The Teenage Parent Demonstration staff kept track of participants\u2019 mandated enrollment in educational and other activities, but did not monitor or keep track of daily attendance, nor did the program routinely follow up on an individual\u2019s attendance problems. Project Redirection participants did not have significantly higher rates of high school or GED completions than did nonparticipants at 1, 2, or even 5 years after enrollment in the program. Teenage Parent Demonstration participants\u2019 completions of high school or GED were also not different from those of nonparticipants at 2-1/2 years after enrollment in the program.", "We observed close monitoring of teenagers\u2019 school attendance in many of the 13 programs we visited. In six of these programs, monitoring and follow-up were carried out formally through intensive case management. The residential centers in Albuquerque and El Paso provided strict supervision of the teenage mothers\u2019 school attendance and performance, as well as their other program activities, along with clear consequences when teenagers failed to comply with rules. In some cases, teenagers who did not obey rules were required to leave the facility; in some centers, they could earn privileges by, for example, making good progress in school or attending counseling sessions.", "Other innovative programs monitored the activities of the young women on-site in the public or alternative schools that they attended. For example, students in the alternative schools we visited were required to sign in daily. Child care centers in the schools offered additional opportunities for monitoring because child care administrators and teachers were quick to connect the absence of an infant from the center with the possibility that a problem had emerged in the teenage mother\u2019s life."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Care and Transportation Assistance Also Seen as Crucial", "paragraphs": ["Teenage mothers\u2019 need for child care was viewed as so important that all 5 of the evaluated programs as well as the 13 programs we visited attempted to provide it, either directly or through reimbursement. Some programs provided child care directly in the schools, in the residential facilities, at the job training sites, or in the community. In some instances, the teenage mothers chose to rely on family members rather than the more formal care provided by the programs. Unfortunately, some programs could not meet the needs of all program participants, either because of limitations in the number of available child care slots or because they lacked the resources to reimburse the teenagers for the care. Program directors told us that there were waiting lists for child care at many of the on-site centers, and at one alternative school, teenage mothers who arrived at school with their children after the center was full were sent home for the day. Without child care, these young mothers were unable to attend school.", "Many programs also recognized lack of transportation as a barrier to teenagers\u2019 ability to complete high school. In addition to having to get to and from school themselves, teenage mothers often have to take their child to and from a child care provider. As a result, many teenage mothers were given transportation assistance, either directly or through reimbursement, which was considered crucial by most program administrators to the success of these programs. The Director of the rural Salem, New Jersey, School-Based Youth Services Program (SBYSP) told us of the complicated provisions she had to make\u2014sometimes arranging special school bus rides\u2014to get teenagers to and from appointments, school, and home."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Different Program Models Helped Teenage Mothers Complete High School or GED", "paragraphs": ["Aside from monitoring and following up on attendance problems and providing child care and transportation assistance, the three programs that demonstrated increased school completions\u2014Jobstart, New Chance, and LEAP\u2014represent quite different program models. Their differences in approach and the nature and extent of services offered demonstrate that a variety of approaches can help young mothers complete their high school education. Many of the programs that we visited resembled the evaluated programs in the types of services they provided. (See fig. 2 for a summary of services provided by the 13 programs visited.) However, because of differences in the populations they served, we cannot directly compare the effectiveness of these programs.", "The Jobstart program represented a vocational preparation model for disadvantaged high school dropouts\u2014not just teenage mothers, but other young women and men. It provided GED preparation and basic skills instruction as well as training and job placement assistance. Counseling and assistance with child care and work expenses were provided, as needed, to facilitate participation. Many of the programs we visited recognized the importance of employment-related services. For example, the New Jersey School-Based Youth Services Program offered job training and placement services, assistance with career development, and preparation for the world of work. Program directors remarked on these teenagers\u2019 need to develop the good work habits\u2014such as punctuality, self-discipline, and reliability\u2014that are required for school completion as well as for future success on the job. In addition to offering special workshops, the Plainfield, New Jersey, Teenage Parenting Program also engaged volunteer mentors from AT&T and the community to provide moral support and counseling, as well as career development and training services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providing a Comprehensive Package of Educational, Vocational, and Social Services", "paragraphs": ["New Chance represented a comprehensive services model designed to meet the wide range of needs of young AFDC mothers who had dropped out of school and those of their children. It combined education and employment preparation with case management and an array of health and social services. New Chance\u2019s one-stop, drop-in centers offered basic education (or GED preparation) in an initial phase and employment preparation in a later phase; classes in parenting and life skills; and workshops on family planning and substance abuse to most participants on-site. Comprehensive health services for mothers and children and job skills training were often provided off-site.", "While few of the programs we visited incorporated the diverse components of the New Chance model, many found the need to provide a range of supportive social services. The majority of programs we visited provided personal counseling or support groups to help teenagers deal with a range of personal problems that slowed their progress toward attaining a diploma. A number of programs offered courses in life skills covering a variety of topics, including substance abuse prevention and communication skills. Several administrators identified low self-esteem among these young women as a contributor to school failure. Consequently, some programs, like Milwaukee\u2019s Time of Your Life, provided group workshops specifically designed to build self-esteem.", "Most of the programs we visited offered parenting education in which the young women learned about child development, maternal and child health, and appropriate methods of discipline. Such training was considered especially important because of the relative immaturity of these young women facing the challenges of parenting, as well as the history of abuse that many of these teenagers had experienced. Programs reinforced parenting skills in a variety of ways, such as by pairing communication and parenting skills in a job training program, and by incorporating instruction with modeling and observation in their child care centers.", "New Chance, as well as many of the programs we visited, explicitly aims to improve the life chances of both the teenager and her child. Routine health care for mother and child was provided on-site in some of the programs we visited, while other programs developed close connections with local community providers to ensure continuity of care.

Teenage parents were enrolled in JOBS (including many still in high school), and program follow-up took the form of tying AFDC benefit levels to their attendance records. AFDC programs in Wisconsin and California, which are experimenting with similar ways of using financial incentives to back up their requirement for teenage parents (in Wisconsin, all teenagers) to attend school, are discussed later in this report.", "The fact that LEAP successfully increased the rate of school completions without providing extensive services may mean that such services are not required to obtain improvements on average, or it may reflect other differences between the evaluated programs. In particular, the three programs served different populations of teenage mothers: LEAP served both students and dropouts, and was less successful with dropouts; New Chance and Jobstart served only high-school dropouts. It is possible that the less extensive LEAP services may not be successful with young women who have already been out of school for some time. On the other hand, many of the social services offered by programs like New Chance are aimed not so much toward helping these teenagers complete high school as toward improving their parenting behavior and breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.", "We are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the individual services offered in these programs because there were no independent tests of their contribution to the effects of each program as a whole. Each evaluation provides evidence only on the impact of the services as they were delivered, that is, in a package with monitoring and follow-up.

Although a student could choose to return to a regular high school after the birth of her child, she could also continue at the alternative school, which provided on-site child care and a range of other services to enable teenagers to continue their education while raising a child. Parenting education classes at the Academy taught skills vital to young teenagers in their multiple roles of child, student, parent, and future employee. New Futures had on-site prenatal and perinatal clinics for teenagers, and all students participated in child development classes. Students were required to work in the child care centers as part of their curriculum, and pregnant teenagers were to take a personal and child health care class.

In Albuquerque, homelessness was identified as a reason that some teenage mothers were unable to continue their high school education. In response, a teenage parent residence was developed. In addition, the El Paso Transitional Living Program aimed to enable homeless young women to remain with their children as well as to strengthen their ability to become self-sufficient. Transitional housing for teenage mothers and their children was one component of the Teenage Services Act (TASA) program in Syracuse, New York: Families could remain there for 2 to 3 years, or until they became self-sufficient. These programs offered more than just shelter.

The Time of Your Life approach reflected the staff\u2019s belief that since most of their teenage mothers came from multigeneration AFDC families and continued to live at home, the teenage mothers\u2019 problems could not be addressed without educating and supporting the entire family unit. A prenatal community nurse and a family therapist visited clients in their homes, developing a unique program for each client that involved the entire family, then attempted to link the families to the appropriate services. Individual teenagers and their families signed contracts saying that the teenager would complete school and that all concerned would provide a loving and healthy environment for the teenager and her baby.

In two of the three sites, the teenage parenting program provided on-site child care, in addition to the other services necessary to keep pregnant and parenting teenagers in school. This included life skills and parenting training, mentors who provided moral support, and other community volunteers who were once teenage mothers themselves. Further, Plainfield used its on-site child care center as a tool to provide the teenage parents with the information and support they needed to assist them in their parenting role. To have access to this child care center, teenage mothers had to maintain at least a \u201cC\u201d average, perform community service, participate in case management and support services, and not have another child.

Dropouts were required either to return to high school or to attend a GED preparation program. Each program monitored attendance routinely, but these programs differed in their use of rewards and sanctions and in whether they offered case management services before applying sanctions. The Cleveland demonstration of the LEAP program operated like the statewide program, but also provided case management and supportive services for teenage parents with recurrent attendance problems.", "California\u2019s Cal-Learn program used financial incentives and sanctions to reward attendance and academic achievement and also provided case management and supportive services. A welfare family with a teenage parent or parents might receive up to four $100 bonuses in a 12-month period for each teenage parent who maintained a C average or better, or, conversely, up to four $100 reductions in its AFDC benefit for each teenage parent who failed to make adequate progress.

Further, it is unclear whether these three AFDC offices would continue to monitor the attendance of teenage mothers 18 years and older if certain provisions to strengthen work program requirements were enacted. These provisions would raise work program participation goals and no longer permit states to count a parent\u2019s high school attendance as participation in a work program unless the parent also was employed.

Our analysis suggests that close monitoring of teenage mothers\u2019 educational activities with follow-up, when their attendance drops, is effective in increasing the likelihood that they complete their education.

Providing supportive services to overcome barriers to continued attendance, with or without financial incentives, also seems to be effective, especially for dropouts. Finally, assistance in meeting their child care and transportation needs may be particularly helpful but did not appear to be sufficient, without attendance monitoring, to enable these young mothers to complete their secondary education.", "Although current federal AFDC policy emphasizes the importance of teenage mothers\u2019 participation in the JOBS program, it does not require states to serve all teenage mothers in JOBS, nor does it require states to monitor the school attendance of all teenage mothers on AFDC. This was confirmed by local welfare officials who indicated that teenagers\u2019 attendance is not monitored, nor are they referred to JOBS, unless they have already dropped out of school. A preventive strategy of monitoring the attendance of all teenagers, such as that observed in LEAP, was reported in only 3 of the 15 cities we surveyed.

Because the evaluated programs were too dissimilar to be aggregated for a statistical analysis, we employed the evaluation synthesis method, which is not intended to yield statistically significant conclusions. Although it may not provide conclusive answers, this analysis did show that certain factors were consistently associated with positive educational outcomes, while others were not. Second, ACF believed that we should more prominently discuss the difference between voluntary and mandatory programs. However, this characteristic did not distinguish between programs that did and did not increase school completions. Third, ACF asked us to clarify that the limitation on work program participation requirements would not apply to teenagers if they were excluded from receiving cash benefits. The text has been changed to clarify this. Fourth, ACF pointed out that the education system also bears responsibility for helping teenage parents complete school. We agree, but examination of this issue was outside the scope of this report. Fifth, ACF believed that we should note that the follow-up periods for these evaluations were too short to see employment and earnings impacts. We do recognize and discuss this issue in explaining the focus of our analysis on school completions (see p. 6). Finally, although ACF believed that we had failed to cite the latest report on the Teenage Parent Demonstration program, the report referred to was included in our evaluation synthesis (see p. 40, Maynard, Nicholson, and Rangarajan, 1993).

The first step was locating programs serving teenage mothers, and screening them to identify rigorous impact studies with reliable results on the desired outcomes. In the second step, we identified the commonalities and differences among the programs and assessed whether these were related to whether the programs demonstrated the desired impacts. From this analysis, we drew conclusions from the cumulative picture of existing rigorous research about which approaches have been demonstrated to be successful in assisting these young women.

Each program offered basic education, but most also offered vocational preparation or training. Some programs required mandatory participation; others were voluntary. Some served primarily young, first-time mothers (aged 14 to 17), whereas others served older teenage mothers (19 to 22 years old), and one served other young men and women as well.

First, we compared the programs\u2019 results by the general program approach they represented: education, training, and comprehensive services. We then compared them along more detailed single features that were discussed in the literature as being important for serving this population. These features included the set of services provided; whether the program created services specially tailored to the needs of teens, such as an alternative school; whether participation was mandatory or voluntary; the age group served; and service delivery method used. We also examined features of the studies themselves that might influence the likelihood of demonstrating statistically significant results, such as whether the comparison group received services similar to those provided by the program.

Thus, for example, we also looked for similarities and differences in features within the set of comprehensive service programs.", "After we found no single unique program feature, we looked beyond individual program features to combinations that might explain the results. We reviewed the comments of the evaluators about any problems encountered in program or study implementation. We considered not only which services were delivered and how, but how they might influence the participants and their behavior. All of the programs monitored program participation, but we noted that one of the programs with no school completion gains, Project Redirection, had problems with school absenteeism.

However, a sample of five studies cannot provide conclusive answers, since many potential differences between them might be related to why one program had significant results and another did not.
