As part of its mission, OPM defines recruiting and hiring processes and procedures; provides federal employees with various benefits, such as health benefits; and administers the retirement program for federal employees. OPM\u0092s use of information technology (IT) is critical in carrying out its responsibilities; in fiscal year 2011 the agency invested $79 million in IT systems and services. For over 2 decades, OPM has been attempting to modernize its federal employeeretirement process by automating paper-based processes and replacing antiquated information systems. However, these efforts have been unsuccessful, and OPM canceled its most recent large-scale retirement modernization effort in February 2011.", "GAO was asked to summarize its work on challenges OPM has faced in attempting to modernize the federal employee retirement process.

For example, in 2005, GAO made recommendations to address weaknesses in the following areas:", "Project management : While OPM had defined major components of its retirement modernization effort, it had not identified the dependencies among them, increasing the risk that delays in one activity could have unforeseen impacts on the progress of others.", "Risk management : OPM did not have a process for identifying and tracking project risks and mitigation strategies on a regular basis. Thus, OPM lacked a mechanism to address potential problems that could adversely impact the cost, schedule, and quality of the modernization effort.", "Organizational change management : OPM had not adequately prepared its staff for changes to job responsibilities resulting from the modernization by developing a detailed transition plan. This could lead to confusion about roles and responsibilities and hinder effective system implementation.", "In 2008, as OPM was on the verge of deploying an automated retirement processing system, GAO reported deficiencies in and made recommendations to address additional management capabilities:", "Testing : The results of tests 1 month prior to the deployment of a major system component revealed that it had not performed as intended. These defects, along with a compressed testing schedule, increased the risk that the system would not work as intended upon deployment.", "Cost estimating : The cost estimate OPM developed was not fully reliable. This meant that the agency did not have a sound basis for formulating budgets or developing a program baseline.", "Progress reporting : The baseline against which OPM was measuring the progress of the program did not reflect the full scope of the project; this increased the risk that variances from planned performance would not be detected.", "In 2009, GAO reported that OPM continued to have deficiencies in its cost estimating, progress reporting, and testing practices and made recommendations to address these deficiencies, as well as additional weaknesses in the planning and oversight of the modernization effort. OPM agreed with these recommendations and began to address them, but the agency terminated the modernization effort in February 2011.", "More recently, in January 2012, OPM released a new plan to improve retirement processing that aims at targeted, incremental improvements rather than a largescale modernization. Specifically, OPM plans to hire new claims-processing staff, take steps to identify potential process improvements, and work with other agencies to improve data quality. Further, OPM intends to make IT improvements that allow retirees to access and update their accounts and automate the retirement application process. However, the plan reflects a less ambitious retirement processing timeliness goal and does not address improving or eliminating the legacy systems that support retirement processing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations at this time.

The use  of information technology is integral to carrying out this important  responsibility; for over two decades, OPM has been attempting to  modernize the retirement process by automating paper-based processes  and replacing antiquated information systems. However, the agency has  experienced challenges in managing its modernization initiatives. Reports  that we issued in 2005, 2008, and 2009 on the agency\u2019s efforts toward  planning and implementing a modernized retirement system highlighted a  long history of undertaking retirement modernization projects that have  not yielded the intended outcomes. At your request, my testimony today  summarizes the history of OPM\u2019s retirement modernization efforts and the  findings from our reports on challenges the agency has faced in  managing these efforts.", "The information in my testimony is based on our previous work at OPM.  We also obtained and reviewed the agency\u2019s recent plan for improving  retirement services. We performed our work in support of this testimony  during January 2012.

To carry out this mission, OPM delivers human resources  products and services including policies and procedures for recruiting and  hiring, provides health and training benefit programs, and administers the  retirement program for federal employees. According to the agency,  approximately 2.7 million active federal employees and nearly 2.5 million  retired federal employees rely on its services. The agency\u2019s March 2008  analysis of federal employment retirement data estimates that nearly 1  million active federal employees will be eligible to retire and almost  600,000 will most likely retire by 2016.", "According to OPM, the retirement program serves current and former  federal employees by providing (1) tools and options for retirement  planning and (2) retirement compensation. Two defined-benefit retirement  plans that provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to federal  employees are administered by the agency. The first plan, the Civil  Service Retirement System (CSRS), provides retirement benefits for most  federal employees hired before 1984. The second plan, the Federal  Employees Retirement System (FERS), covers most employees hired in  or after 1984 and provides benefits that include Social Security and a  defined contribution system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Employee Retirement Application Processing Is Complex", "paragraphs": ["OPM and employing agencies\u2019 human resources and payroll offices are  responsible for processing federal employees\u2019 retirement applications.  The process begins when an employee submits a paper retirement  application to his or her employer\u2019s human resources office and is  completed when the individual begins receiving regular monthly benefit  payments (as illustrated in fig. 1).", "Once an employee submits an application, the human resources office  provides retirement counseling services to the employee and augments  the retirement application with additional paperwork, such as a separation  form that finalizes the date the employee will retire. Then the agency  provides the retirement package to the employee\u2019s payroll office. After the  employee separates for retirement, the payroll office is responsible for  reviewing the documents for correct signatures and information, making  sure that all required forms have been submitted, and adding any  additional paperwork that will be necessary for processing the retirement  package. Once the payroll office has finalized the paperwork, the  retirement package is mailed to OPM to continue the retirement process.  Payroll offices are required to submit the package to OPM within 30 days  of the retiree\u2019s separation date.", "Upon receipt of the retirement package, OPM calculates an interim  payment based on information provided by the employing agency. The  interim payments are partial payments that typically provide retirees with  80 percent of the total monthly benefit they will eventually receive.then starts the process of analyzing the retirement application and  associated paperwork to determine the total monthly benefit amount to  which the retiree is entitled. This process includes collecting additional  information from the employing agency\u2019s human resources and payroll  offices or from the retiree to ensure that all necessary data are available  before calculating benefits. After OPM completes its review and  authorizes payment, the retiree begins receiving 100 percent of the  monthly retirement benefit payments. OPM then stores the paper  retirement folder at the Retirement Operations Center in Boyers,  Pennsylvania.", "The agency recently reported that the average time to process a new  retirement claim is 156 days. According to the Deputy Associate Director  for the Center of Retirement and Insurance Services, about 200  employees are directly involved in processing the approximately 100,000  retirement applications OPM receives annually. Retirement processing  includes functions such as determining retirement eligibility, inputting data  into benefit calculators, and providing customer service. The agency uses  over 500 different procedures, laws, and regulations, which are  documented on the agency\u2019s internal website, to process retirement  applications. For example, the site contains memorandums that outline  new procedures for handling special retirement applications, such as  those for disability or court orders. Further, OPM\u2019s retirement processing  involves the use of over 80 information systems that have approximately  400 interfaces with other internal and external systems. For instance, 26  internal systems interface with the Department of the Treasury to provide,  among other things, information regarding the total amount of benefit  payments to which an employee is entitled.", "OPM has reported that a greater retirement processing workload is  expected due to an anticipated increase in the number of retirement  applications over the next decade, although current retirement processing  operations are at full capacity. Further, the agency has identified several  factors that limit its ability to process retirement benefits in an efficient and  timely manner. Specifically, OPM noted that:  current processes are paper-based and manually intensive, resulting  in a higher number of errors and delays in providing benefit payments;  the high costs, limited capabilities, and other problems with the  existing information systems and processes pose increasing risks to  the accuracy of benefit payments;  current manual capabilities restrict customer service;  federal employees have limited access to retirement records, making  planning for retirement difficult; and attracting qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated  retirement systems, which have about 3 million lines of custom  programming, is challenging."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Has a Long History of Unsuccessful Retirement Modernization Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the need to modernize its retirement processing, in the late  1980s OPM began initiatives that were aimed at automating its antiquated  paper-based processes. Initial modernization visions called for developing  an integrated system and automated processes to provide prompt and  complete benefit payments. However, following attempts over more than  two decades, the agency has not yet been successful in achieving the  modernized retirement system that it envisioned.", "In early 1987, OPM began a program called the FERS Automated  Processing System. However, after 8 years of planning, the agency  decided to reevaluate the program, and the Office of Management and  Budget requested an independent review of the program that identified  various management weaknesses. The independent review suggested  areas for improvement and recommended terminating the program if  immediate action was not taken. In mid-1996, OPM terminated the  program.", "In 1997, OPM began planning a second modernization initiative, called  the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program. The agency  originally intended to structure the program as an acquisition of  commercially available hardware and software that would be modified in- house to meet its needs. From 1997 to 2001, OPM developed plans and  analyses and began developing business and security requirements for  the program. However, in June 2001, it decided to change the direction of  the retirement modernization initiative.", "In late 2001, retaining the name RSM, the agency embarked upon its  third initiative to modernize the retirement process and examined the  possibility of privately sourced technologies and tools. Toward this end,  the agency determined that contracting was a viable alternative and, in  2006, awarded three contracts for the automation of the retirement  process, to include the conversion of paper records to electronic files and  consulting services to redesign its retirement operations.", "In February 2008, OPM renamed the program RetireEZ and deployed an  automated retirement processing system. However, by May 2008 the  agency determined that the system was not working as expected and  suspended system operation. In October 2008, after 5 months of  attempting to address quality issues, the agency terminated the contract  for the system. In November 2008, OPM began restructuring the program  and reported that its efforts to modernize retirement processing would  continue. However, after several years of trying to revitalize the program,  the agency terminated the retirement system modernization in February  2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IT Management Weaknesses Have Contributed to OPM\u2019s Unsuccessful Retirement Modernization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["OPM\u2019s efforts to modernize its retirement system have been hindered by  weaknesses in several key IT management disciplines. Our experience  with major modernization initiatives has shown that having sound  management capabilities is essential to achieving successful outcomes.  Among others, these capabilities include project management, risk  management, organizational change management, system testing, cost  estimating, progress reporting, planning, and oversight. However, we  found that many of the capabilities in these areas were not sufficiently  developed. For example, in reporting on RSM in February 2005, we noted  weaknesses in key management capabilities, such as project  management, risk management, and organizational change  management.", "Project management is the process for planning and managing all  project-related activities, including defining how project components  are interrelated. Effective project management allows the  performance, cost, and schedule of the overall project to be measured  and controlled in comparison to planned objectives. Although OPM  had defined major retirement modernization project components, it  had not defined the dependencies among them. Specifically, the  agency had not identified critical tasks and their impact on the  completion of other tasks. By not identifying critical dependencies  among retirement modernization components, OPM increased the risk  that unforeseen delays in one activity could hinder progress in other  activities.", "Risk management entails identifying potential problems before they  occur. Risks should be identified as early as possible, analyzed,  mitigated, and tracked to closure. OPM officials acknowledged that  they did not have a process for identifying and tracking retirement  modernization project risks and mitigation strategies on a regular  basis but stated that the agency\u2019s project management consultant  would assist it in implementing a risk management process. Without  such a process, OPM did not have a mechanism to address potential  problems that could adversely impact the cost, schedule, and quality  of the retirement modernization project.", "Organizational change management includes preparing users for the  changes to how their work will be performed as a result of a new  system implementation. Effective organizational change management  includes plans to prepare users for impacts the new system might  have on their roles and responsibilities, and a process to manage  those changes. Although OPM officials stated that change  management posed a substantial challenge to the success of  retirement modernization, they had not developed a detailed plan to  help users transition to different job responsibilities. Without having  and implementing such a plan, confusion about user roles and  responsibilities could have hindered effective implementation of new  retirement systems.", "We recommended that the Director of OPM ensure that the retirement  modernization program office expeditiously establish processes for  effective project management, risk management, and organizational  change management. In response, the agency initiated steps toward  establishing management processes for retirement modernization and  demonstrated activities to address our recommendations.", "We subsequently reported on OPM\u2019s retirement modernization again in  January 2008, as the agency was on the verge of deploying a new  automated retirement processing system. We noted weaknesses in  additional key management capabilities, including system testing, cost  estimating, and progress reporting.", "Effective testing is an essential activity of any project that includes  system development. Generally, the purpose of testing is to identify  defects or problems in meeting defined system requirements or  satisfying system user needs. At the time of our review, 1 month  before OPM planned to deploy a major system component, test  results showed that the component had not performed as intended.  We warned that until actual test results indicated improvement in the  system, OPM risked deploying technology that would not accurately  calculate retirement benefits. Although the agency planned to perform  additional tests to verify that the system would work as intended, the  schedule for conducting these tests became compressed from 5  months to 2-1/2 months, with several tests to be performed  concurrently rather than in sequence. The agency identified a lack of  testing resources, including the availability of subject matter experts,  and the need for further system development, as contributing to the  delay of planned tests and the need for concurrent testing. The high  degree of concurrent testing that OPM planned to meet its February  2008 deployment schedule increased the risk that the agency would  not have the resources or time to verify that the planned system  worked as expected.", "Cost estimating represents the identification of individual project cost  elements, using established methods and valid data to estimate future  costs. The establishment of a reliable cost estimate is important for  developing a project budget and having a sound basis for measuring  performance, including comparing the actual and planned costs of  project activities. Although OPM developed a retirement  modernization cost estimate, the estimate was not supported by the  documentation that is fundamental to a reliable cost estimate. Without  a reliable cost estimate, OPM did not have a sound basis for  formulating retirement modernization budgets or for developing the  cost baseline that is necessary for measuring and predicting project  performance.", "Earned value management (EVM) is a tool for measuring program  progress by comparing the value of work accomplished with the  amount of work expected to be accomplished. Fundamental to reliable  EVM is the development of a baseline against which variances are  calculated. OPM used EVM to measure and report monthly  performance of the retirement modernization system. The reported  results provided a favorable view of project performance over time  because the variances indicated the project was progressing almost  exactly as planned. However, this view of project performance was  not reliable because the baseline on which it was based did not reflect  the full scope of the project, had not been validated, and was unstable  (i.e., subject to frequent changes). This EVM approach in effect  ensured that material variances from planned project performance  would not be identified and that the state of the project would not be  reliably reported.", "We recommended that the Director of OPM address these deficiencies  by, among other things, conducting effective system tests prior to system  deployment, in addition to improving program cost estimation and  progress reporting. In response to our report, OPM stated that it  concurred with our recommendations and stated that it would take steps  to address the weakness we identified. Nevertheless, OPM deployed a  limited initial version of the modernized retirement system in February  2008. After unsuccessful efforts to address system quality issues, the  agency suspended system operation, terminated the system contract,  and began restructuring the modernization effort.", "In April 2009, we again reported on OPM\u2019s retirement modernization,  noting that the agency still remained far from achieving the modernized  retirement processing capabilities that it had planned. Specifically, we  noted that significant weaknesses continued to exist in three key  management areas that we had previously identified\u2014cost estimating,  progress reporting, and testing\u2014while also noting two additional  weaknesses related to planning and oversight.", "Despite agreeing with our January 2008 recommendation that OPM  develop a revised retirement modernization cost estimate, the agency  had not completed initial steps for developing a new cost estimate by  the time we reported again in April 2009. At that time, we reported that  the agency had not yet fully defined the estimate\u2019s purpose,  developed an estimating plan, or defined the project\u2019s characteristics.  By not completing these steps, OPM increased the risk that it would  produce an unreliable estimate and not have a sound basis for  measuring project performance and formulating retirement  modernization budgets.", "Although it agreed with our January 2008 recommendation to  establish a basis for effective EVM, OPM had not completed key  steps as of the time of our April 2009 report. Specifically, despite  planning to begin reporting on the retirement project\u2019s progress using  EVM, the agency was not prepared to do so because initial steps,  including the development of a reliable cost estimate and the  validation of a baseline, had not been completed. Engaging in EVM  reporting without first performing these fundamental steps could have  again rendered the agency\u2019s assessments unreliable.", "As previously discussed, effective testing is an essential component  of any project that includes developing systems. To be effectively  managed, testing should be planned and conducted in a structured  and disciplined fashion. Beginning the test planning process in the  early stages of a project life cycle can reduce rework later. Early test  planning in coordination with requirements development can provide  major benefits. For example, planning for test activities during the  development of requirements may reduce the number of defects  identified later and the costs related to requirements rework or change  requests. OPM\u2019s need to compress its testing schedule and conduct  tests concurrently, as we reported in January 2008, illustrates the  importance of planning test activities early in a project\u2019s life cycle.  However, at the time of our April 2009 report, the agency had not  begun to plan test activities in coordination with developing its  requirements for the system it was planning at that time.  Consequently, OPM increased the risk that it would again deploy a  system that did not satisfy user expectations and meet requirements.", "Project management principles and effective practices emphasize the  importance of having a plan that, among other things, incorporates all  the critical areas of system development and is to be used as a  means of determining what needs to be done, by whom, and when.  Although OPM had developed a variety of informal documents and  briefing slides that described retirement modernization activities, the  agency did not have a complete plan that described how the program  would proceed in the wake of its decision to terminate the system  contract. As a result, we concluded that until the agency completed  and used a plan that could guide its efforts, it would not be properly  positioned to move forward with its restructured retirement  modernization initiative.", "Office of Management and Budget and GAO guidance call for  agencies to ensure effective oversight of IT projects throughout all life- cycle phases. Critical to effective oversight are investment  management boards made up of key executives who regularly track  the progress of IT projects such as system acquisitions or  modernizations. OPM\u2019s Investment Review Board was established to  ensure that major investments are on track by reviewing their  progress and determining appropriate actions when investments  encounter challenges. Despite meeting regularly and being provided  with information that indicated problems with the retirement  modernization, the board did not ensure that retirement modernization  investments were on track, nor did it determine appropriate actions for  course correction when needed. For example, from January 2007 to  August 2008, the board met and was presented with reports that  described problems the retirement modernization program was facing,  such as the lack of an integrated master schedule and earned value  data that did not reflect the \u201creality or current status\u201d of the program.  However, meeting minutes indicated that no discussion or action was  taken to address these problems. According to a member of the  board, OPM guidance regarding how the board is to communicate  recommendations and needed corrective actions for investments it is  responsible for overseeing had not been established. Without a fully  functioning oversight body, OPM could not monitor the retirement  modernization and make the course corrections that effective boards  are intended to provide.", "Our April 2009 report made new recommendations that OPM address the  weaknesses in the retirement modernization project that we identified.  Although the agency began taking steps to address them, the  recommendations were overtaken by the agency\u2019s decision in February  2011 to terminate the retirement modernization project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Has a New Plan to Improve Retirement Processing", "paragraphs": ["In mid-January 2012, OPM released a new plan that describes the  agency\u2019s intention to improve retirement processing through actions that  include hiring and training 56 new staff to adjudicate retirement claims and 20  additional staff to support the claims process; establishing higher production standards and identifying potential  retirement process improvements; and working with other agencies to improve the accuracy and  completeness of the data they provide to OPM for use in retirement  processing.", "Additionally, OPM\u2019s new plan identifies existing and planned IT  improvements to support the retirement process. Recognizing that its  previous, large-scale efforts to automate the retirement process have  failed, the agency characterizes its new plan as representing partial,  progressive IT improvements. These efforts include providing retirees with the capability to access and update their  accounts to change addresses, banking information, and tax  exemptions and planning to automate retirement applications and to automatically  collect retirement data from agencies\u2019 payroll processing centers.", "Under this approach, OPM expects to eliminate the agency\u2019s retirement  processing backlog within 18 months and to accurately process 90  percent of its cases within 60 days. However, this goal represents a  substantial reduction from the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2009 retirement  modernization goal to accurately process 99 percent of cases within 30  days. Moreover, the plan does not describe whether or how the agency  intends to modify or decommission the over 80 legacy systems that  support retirement processing.", "In summary, despite OPM\u2019s recognition of the need to improve the  timeliness and accuracy of retirement processing, the agency has thus far  been unsuccessful in several attempts to develop the capabilities it has  long sought. For over two decades, the agency\u2019s retirement  modernization efforts have been plagued by weaknesses in management  capabilities that are critical to the success of such endeavors. Among the  management disciplines the agency has struggled with are project  management, risk management, organizational change management,  cost estimating, system testing, progress reporting, planning, and  oversight. Although the agency is now considering modest, incremental  efforts to improve retirement processing, the development and  institutionalization of the aforementioned management capabilities remain  important to OPM\u2019s success in improving the delivery of retirement  services.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement today.
