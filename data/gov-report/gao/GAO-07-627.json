The Global Fund now requires that fund portfolio managers more consistently document factors, such as grant ratings and contextual information that support disbursement and grant renewal decisions. Our current review of 80 grant disbursements and 45 grant renewal decisions confirmed that Global Fund grant files consistently contained explanations of the information used in its funding decisions. For example, all grant disbursement files in our sample contained a written narrative explaining the ratings that portfolio managers gave the grants, based in part on reports completed by grant recipients. Although we noted that many of the grant recipients' reports lacked some information needed for disbursement and renewal decisions, Global Fund officials said that portfolio managers obtain this information informally from the recipients or other stakeholders. The Global Fund did not implement the risk assessment model that it was developing at the time of our 2005 report, because it determined that the model did not accurately identify grant risk. To identify risks that may affect grant implementation, the organization currently relies on elements of its structures and processes, including its initial technical review, disbursement decision-making form, periodic grant ratings, oversight by country stakeholders, information from technical partners, and LFA oversight. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to risk management, the Global Fund has begun developing a risk assessment framework for the organization that includes an early alert and response system to address poorly performing grants. The Global Fund has limited access to the information it needs to manage and oversee LFAs because it does not require systematic assessments of LFAs' performance. As a result, the Global Fund has limited ability to determine the quality of LFAs' monitoring and reporting and to identify situations in which more oversight of LFAs' performance may be required. Previously, the Global Fund introduced a tool to assess LFA performance more systematically; however, this effort was unsuccessful, because use of the tool was not mandatory. Numerous sources raise concerns about the quality of grant monitoring and reporting provided by LFAs, particularly their ability to assess and verify recipients' procurement capacity and program implementation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global  Fund) was created to help finance the fight against three infectious  diseases that kill more than 6 million people each year.

The lack of standardized LFA performance  expectations also presents challenges among those responsible for  managing the LFAs. According to the manager of one LFA central team  with a large grant portfolio, variations in Global Fund expectations made it  difficult to establish best practices for its LFA country teams. Likewise,  several Global Fund officials noted that secretariat staff have conflicting  ideas about LFA performance criteria. In one instance, according to Global  Fund officials, a group of fund portfolio managers were unable to agree on  what constituted a high-quality report.

Similarly, a procurement officer described a country team  that focused on supply management issues throughout the life of the grant  and proved instrumental in resolving a large corruption problem.

The  Global Fund will continue to face important challenges, including  evaluating the effectiveness of its investment of the billions of dollars it  receives annually from the United States and other donors and the impact  of its programs over time. The Global Fund has improved the transparency  of its periodic disbursement and grant renewal decisions by providing  better documentation in its grant files. Delays in developing a systematic  approach to assessing grant risk have left the Global Fund vulnerable to  some of the risks associated with implementing grants in developing  countries. However, the Global Fund board recognizes the importance of  developing a more comprehensive approach to risk management, and the  secretariat has recently drafted principles to guide its development of a  risk framework for the organization. In addition, the Global Fund\u2019s lack of  a formal process for setting expectations and assessing and analyzing LFA  performance constrains its ability to determine the quality of the LFAs\u2019  services, track LFA performance over time, and address ongoing capacity  issues.

The  second sample consisted of 45 of the 65 grants that the Global Fund  assessed for phase 2 grant renewal during the same time period.

To summarize the  open-ended responses and developed categories for the analysis, we first  grouped interview responses by general categories, based on our  objectives, criteria, and inductive observation. Within each of these  general categories, we then further grouped the data into subcategories  based on the emerging themes. To ensure the validity and reliability of our  analysis, these subcategories were reviewed by a methodologist, who  proposed modifications.
