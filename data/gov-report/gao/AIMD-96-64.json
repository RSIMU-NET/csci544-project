Having valuable, accurate, and accessible financial and programmatic information is a critical element for any improvement effort to succeed. Furthermore, increasing the quality and speed of service delivery while reducing costs will require the government to make significant investments in three fundamental assets\u2014personnel, knowledge, and capital property/fixed assets.", "Investments in information technology (IT) projects can dramatically affect all three of these assets. Indeed, the government\u2019s ability to improve performance and reduce costs in the information age will depend, to a large degree, on how well it selects and uses information systems investments to modernize its often outdated operations. However, the impact of information technology is not necessarily dependent on the amount of money spent, but rather on how the investments are selected and managed. This, in essence, is the challenge facing federal executives: Increasing the return on money spent on IT projects by spending money wiser, not faster.", "IT projects, however, are often poorly managed. For example, one market research group estimates that about a third of all U.S. IT projects are canceled, at a estimated cost in 1995 of over $81 billion. In the last 12 years, the federal government has obligated at least $200 billion for information management with mixed results at best. Yet despite this huge investment, government operations continue to be hampered by inaccurate data and inadequate systems. Too often, IT projects cost much more and produce much less than what was originally envisioned. Even worse, often these systems do not significantly improve mission performance or they provide only a fraction of the expected benefits. Of 18 major federal agencies, 7 have an IT effort that has been identified as high risk by either the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or us.", "Some private and public sector organizations, on the other hand, have designed and managed IT to improve their organizational performance. In a 1994 report, we analyzed the information management practices of several leading private and state organizations. These leading organizations were identified as such by their peers and independent researchers because of their progress in managing information to improve service quality, reduce costs, and increase work force productivity and effectiveness. From this analysis, we derived 11 fundamental IT management practices that, when taken together, provide the basis for the successful outcomes that we found in leading organizations. (See figure 1.1.)", "One of the best practices exhibited by leading organizations was that they manage information systems projects as investments. This particular practice offers organizations great potential for gaining better control over their IT expenditures. In the short term (within 2 years), this practice serves as a powerful tool for carefully managing and controlling IT expenditures and better understanding the explicit costs and projected returns for each IT project. In the long term (from 3 to 5 years), this practice serves as an effective process for linking IT projects to organizational goals and objectives. However, managing IT projects as investments works most effectively when implemented as part of an integrated set of management practices. For example, project management systems must also be in place, reengineering improvements analyzed, and planning processes linked to mission goals.", "While the specific processes used to implement an investment approach may vary depending upon the structure of the organization (e.g., centralized versus decentralized operations), we nonetheless found that the leading organizations we studied shared several common management practices related to the strategic use of information and information technologies. Specifically, they maintained a decision-making process consisting of three phases\u2014selection, control, and evaluation\u2014designed to minimize risks and maximize return on investment. (See figure 1.2.)", "The Congress has passed several pieces of legislation that lay the groundwork for agencies to establish a investment approach for managing IT. For instance, revisions to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (Public Law 104-13) have put more emphasis on evaluating the operational merits of information technology projects. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act (Public Law 101-576) focuses on the need to significantly improve financial management and reporting practices of the federal government. Having accurate financial data is critical to establishing performance measures and assessing the returns on IT investments. Finally, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) (Public Law 103-62) requires agencies to set results-oriented goals, measure performance, and report on their accomplishments.", "In addition, the recently passed Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA) (Division E of Public Law 104-106) requires federal agencies to focus more on the results achieved through IT investments while streamlining the federal IT procurement process. Specifically this act, which became effective August 8 of this year, introduces much more rigor and structure into how agencies approach the selection and management of IT projects. Among other things, the head of each agency is required to implement a process for maximizing the value and assessing and managing the risks of the agency\u2019s IT acquisitions. Appendix V summarizes the primary IT investment provisions contained in ITMRA.", "ITMRA also heightens the role of OMB in supporting and overseeing agencies\u2019 IT management activities. The Director of OMB is now responsible for promoting and directing that federal agencies establish capital planning processes for IT investment decisions. The Director is also responsible for evaluating the results of agency IT investments and enforcing accountability. The results of these decisions will be used to develop recommendations for the President\u2019s budget.", "OMB has begun to take action in these areas. In November 1995, OMB, with substantial input from GAO, published a guide designed to help federal agencies systematically manage and evaluate their IT-related investments.This guide was based on the investment processes found at the leading organizations. Recent revisions to OMB Circular A-130 on federal information resources management have also placed greater emphasis on managing information system projects as investments. And the recently issued Part 3 of OMB Circular A-11, which replaced OMB Bulletin 95-03, \u201cPlanning and Budgeting for the Acquisition of Fixed Assets,\u201d provides additional guidance and information requirements for major fixed asset acquisitions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman, Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the District of Columbia, Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, requested that we compare and contrast the management practices and decision processes used by leading organizations with a small sample of federal agencies. The process used by leading organizations is embodied in OMB\u2019s Evaluating Information Technology Investments: A Practical Guide and specific provisions contained in the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996. The agencies we examined are the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ($1.6 billion spent on IT in FY 1994), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ($296 million spent on IT in FY 1994), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ($302 million spent on IT in FY 1994), Coast Guard ($157 million spent on IT in FY 1994), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ($1.3 billion spent on IT in FY 1994).", "We selected the federal agencies for our sample based on one or more of the following characteristics: (1) large IT budgets, (2) expected IT expenditure growth rates, and (3) programmatic risk as assessed by GAO and OMB. In addition, the Coast Guard was selected because of its progress in implementing an investment process. Collectively, these agencies spent about $3.7 billion on IT in FY 1994\u201416 percent of the total spent on IT. Our review focused exclusively on how well these five agencies manage information technology as investments, one of the 11 practices used by leading organizations to improve mission performance, as described in our best practices report. As such, our evaluation only focused on policies and practices used at the agencywide level; we did not evaluate the agencies\u2019 performance in the 10 other practices. In addition, we did not systematically examine the overall IT track records of each agency.", "During our review of agency IT investment decision-making processes, we did the following: reviewed agencies\u2019 policies, practices, and procedures for managing IT investments; interviewed senior executives, program managers, and IRM professionals; and determined whether agencies followed practices similar to those used by leading organizations to manage information systems projects as investments.", "We developed the attributes needed to manage information systems projects as investments from the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, OMB Circular A-130, GAO\u2019s \u201cbest practices\u201d report on strategic information management, GAO\u2019s strategic information management toolkit, and OMB\u2019s guide Evaluating Information Technology Investments: A Practical Guide. Many of the characteristics of this investment approach are contained in the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (as summarized in appendix V). However, this law was not in effect at the time of our review.", "To identify effects associated with the presence or absence of investment controls, we reviewed agencies\u2019 reports and documents, related GAO and Inspector General reports, and other external reports. We also discussed the impact of the agencies\u2019 investment controls with senior executives, program managers, and IRM professionals to get an agencywide perspective on the controls used to manage IT investments. Additionally, we reviewed agency documentation dealing with IT selection, budgetary development, and IT project reviews.", "To determine how much each agency spent on information technology, we asked each agency for information on spending, staffing, and their 10 largest IT systems and projects. The agencies used a variety of sources for the same data elements, which may make comparisons among agencies unreliable. While data submitted by the agencies were validated by agency officials, we did not independently verify the accuracy of the data.", "Most of our work was conducted at agencies\u2019 headquarters in Washington, D.C. Similarly, we visited NOAA offices in Rockville, Maryland, and the National Weather Service in Silver Spring, Maryland. We also visited NASA program, financial, and IRM officials at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and Ames Research Center in San Francisco, California, to learn how they implement NASA policy on IT management. We performed the majority of our work from April 1995 through September 1995, with selected updates through July 1996, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We updated our analyses of IRS and NASA in conjunction with other related audit work. In addition, several of the agencies provided us with updated information as part of their comments on a draft version of the report. Many of these changes have only recently occurred and we have not fully evaluated them to determine their effect on the agency\u2019s IT investment process.", "We provided and discussed a draft of this report with officials from OMB, EPA, NASA, NOAA, IRS, and the Coast Guard, and have incorporated their comments where appropriate.

For instance, the Coast Guard had a selection process with decision criteria that included an analysis of cost, risk, and return data;", "EPA had created a executive management group to address cross-agency IT", "NASA and NOAA utilized program control meetings to ensure senior management involvement in monitoring the progress of important ongoing IT projects; and IRS had developed a systems investment evaluation review methodology and used it to conduct postimplementation reviews of some Tax Systems Modernization projects.", "However, none of these five agencies had implemented a complete, institutionalized investment approach that would fulfill requirements of PRA and ITMRA. Consequently, IT decision-making at these agencies was often inconsistent or based on the priorities of individual units rather than the organization as a whole. Additionally, cost-benefit and risk analyses were rarely updated as projects proceeded and were not used for managing project results. Also, the mission-related benefits of implemented systems were often difficult to determine since agencies rarely collected or compared data on anticipated versus actual costs and benefits.", "In general, we found that the IT investment control processes used at the case study agencies at the time of our review contained four main weaknesses. While all four weaknesses may not have been present at each agency, in comparison to leading organizations, the case study agencies lacked a consistent process (used at all levels of the agency) for uniformly selecting and managing systems investments; focused their selection processes on selected efforts, such as justifying new project funding or focusing on projects already under development, rather than managing all IT projects\u2014new, under development, and operational\u2014as a portfolio of competing investments; made funding decisions without giving adequate attention to management control or evaluation processes, and made funding decisions based on negotiations or undefined decision criteria and did not have the up-to-date, accurate data needed to support IT investment decisions.", "Appendix IV provides a brief overview of how each agency\u2019s current processes for selecting, controlling, and evaluating IT projects worked."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Need Consistent Processes to Select and Manage IT Investments", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations use the selection, control, and evaluation decision-making processes in a consistent manner throughout different units. This enables the organization, even one that is highly decentralized, to make trade-offs between projects, both within and across business units.", "Figure 2.1 illustrates how this process can be applied to the federal government where major cabinet departments may have several agencies under their purview. IT portfolio investment processes can exist at both the departmental and agency levels. As with leading organizations, the key factor is being able to determine which IT projects and resources are shared (and should be reviewed at the departmental level) and which are unique to each agency. Three common criteria used by leading organizations are applicable in the federal setting. These threshold criteria include (1) high-dollar, high-risk IT projects (risk and dollar amounts having been already defined), (2) cross-functional projects (two or more organizational units will benefit from the project), and (3) common infrastructure support (hardware and telecommunications). Projects that meet these particular threshold criteria are discussed, reviewed, and decided upon at a departmentwide level. The key to making this work is having clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and criteria for determining the types of projects that will be reviewed at the different organizational levels.", "As described in ITMRA, agency heads are to implement a process for maximizing the value and assessing and managing the risks of IT investments. Further, this process should be integrated with the agency\u2019s budget, financial, and program management process(es). Whether highly centralized or decentralized, matrixed or hierarchial, agencies can most effectively reap the benefits of an investment process by developing and maintaining consistent processes within and across their organizations.", "One of the agencies we reviewed\u2014the Coast Guard\u2014used common investment criteria for making cross-agency IT decisions. IRS had defined some criteria, but was not yet using these criteria to make decisions. The three other agencies\u2014NASA, EPA, and NOAA\u2014chose IT projects based on inconsistent or nonexistent investment processes. There was little or no uniformity in how risks, benefits, and costs of various IT projects across offices and divisions within these three agencies were evaluated. Thus, cross-comparisons between systems of similar size, function, or organizational impact were difficult at best. More important, management had no assurance that the most important mission objectives of the agency were being met by the suite of system investments that was selected.", "NASA, for instance, allowed its centers and programs to make their own IT funding decisions for mission-critical systems. These decisions were made without an agencywide mechanism in place to identify low-value IT projects or costs that could be avoided by capitalizing on opportunities for data sharing and system consolidation across NASA units. As a result, identifying cross-functional system opportunities was problematic at best.", "The scope of this problem became apparent as a result of a special NASA IT review. In response to budget pressures, NASA conducted an agencywide internal information systems review to identify cost savings. The resulting March 1995 report described numerous instances of duplicate IT resources, such as large-scale computing and wide area network services, that were providing similar functions. A subsequent NASA Inspector General\u2019s (IG) report, also issued in March 1995, substantiated this special review, finding that at one center NASA managers had expended resources to purchase or develop information systems that were already available elsewhere, either within NASA or, in some cases, within that center itself.", "While this special review prompted NASA to plan several consolidation efforts, such as consolidating its separate wide area networks (for a NASA projected savings of $236 million over 5 years), the risk of purchasing duplicate IT resources remained because of weaknesses in its current decentralized decision-making process. For example, NASA created chief information officer (CIO) positions for NASA headquarters and for each of its 23 centers. These CIOs have a key role in improving agencywide IT cooperation and coordination. However, the CIOs have limited formal authority and to date have only exercised control over NASA\u2019s administrative systems\u2014which account for about 10 percent of NASA\u2019s total IT budget. With more defined CIO roles, responsibility, and authority, it is likely that additional opportunities for efficiencies will be identified.", "NASA recently established a CIO council to establish high-level policies and standards, approve information resources management plans, and address issues and initiatives. The council will also serve as the IT capital investment advisory group to the proposed NASA Capital Investment Council. NASA plans for this Capital Investment Council to have responsibility for looking at all capital investments across NASA, including those for IT. NASA\u2019s proposed Capital Investment Council may fill this need for identifying cross-functional opportunities; however, it is too early to evaluate its impact.", "By having consistent, quantitative, and analytical processes across NASA that address both mission-critical and administrative systems, NASA could more easily identify cross-functional opportunities. NASA has already demonstrated that savings can be achieved by looking within mission-critical systems for cross-functional opportunities. For instance, NASA estimated that $74 million was saved by developing a combined Space Station and Space Shuttle control center using largely commercial off-the-shelf software and a modular development approach, rather than the original plan of having two separate control centers that used mainframe technology and custom software.", "EPA, like NASA, followed a decentralized approach for making IT investment decisions. Program offices have had control and discretion over their specific IT budgets, regardless of project size or possible cross-office impact. As we have previously reported, this has led to stovepiped systems that do not have standard data definitions or common interfaces, making it difficult to share environmental data across the agency. This is important because sharing environmental data across the agency is crucial to implementing EPA\u2019s strategic goals. In 1994, EPA began to address this problem by creating a senior management Executive Steering Committee (ESC) charged with ensuring that investments in agencywide information resources are managed efficiently and effectively. This committee, comprised of senior EPA executives, has the responsibility to (1) recommend funding on major system development efforts and (2) allocate the IT budget reserved for agencywide IRM initiatives, such as geographical information systems (GIS) support and data standards.", "At the time of our review, the ESC had not reviewed or made recommendations on any major information system development efforts. Instead, the ESC focused its activity on spending funds allocated to it for agencywide IRM policy initiatives, such as intra-agency data standards. The ESC met on June 26, 1996, to assess the impact of ITMRA upon EPA\u2019s IT management process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Need to Manage Their IT Projects as a Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["In conducting their selection processes, leading organizations assess and manage the different types of IT projects, such as mission-critical or infrastructure, at all different phases of their life cycle, in order to create a complete strategic investment portfolio. (See figure 2.2.) By scrutinizing and analyzing their entire IT portfolio, managers can examine the costs of maintaining existing systems versus investing in new ones. By continually and rigorously reevaluating the entire project portfolio based on mission priorities, organizations can reach decisions on systems based on overall contribution to organizational goals. Under ITMRA, agencies will need to compare and prioritize projects using explicit quantitative and qualitative decision criteria.", "At the federal agencies we studied, some prioritization of projects was conducted, but none made managerial trade-offs across all types of projects. IRS, NOAA, and the Coast Guard each conducted some type of portfolio analyses; EPA and NASA did not. Additionally, the portfolio analyses that were performed generally covered projects that were either high dollar, new, or under development. For example, in 1995 we reported that IRS executives were consistently maintaining that all 36 TSM projects, estimated to cost up to $10 billion through the year 2001, were equally important and must all be completed for the modernization to succeed.This approach, as well as the accompanying initial failure to rank the TSM projects according to their prioritized needs and mission performance improvements, has meant that IRS could not be sure that the most important projects were being developed first.", "Since our 1995 report, IRS has begun to rank and prioritize all of the proposed TSM projects using cost, risk, and return decision criteria. However, these decision criteria are largely qualitative, the data used for decisions were not validated or reliable, and analyses were not based on calculations of expected return on investment.", "In addition, according to IRS, its investment review board uses a separate process with different criteria for analyzing operational systems. IRS also said that the board does not review research and development (R&D) systems or field office systems. Using separate processes for some system types and not including all systems prevents IRS from making comparisons and trade-offs as part of a complete IT portfolio.", "Of all the agencies we reviewed, the Coast Guard had the most experience using a comprehensive selection phase. In 1991, the Coast Guard started a strategic information resources management process and shortly thereafter initiated an IT investment process. Under this investment process, a Coast Guard working group from the IRM office ranks and prioritizes new IT projects and those under development based on explicit risk and return decision criteria. A senior management board meets annually to rank the projects and decide on priorities.", "The Coast Guard has derived benefits from its project selection process. During the implementation of its IT investment process, the Coast Guard identified opportunities for systems consolidation. For example, the Coast Guard reported that five separate personnel systems are being incorporated into the Personnel Management Information System/Joint Military Pay System II for a cost avoidance of $10.2 million. The Coast Guard also identified other systems consolidation opportunities that, if implemented, could result in a total cost savings of $77.4 million.", "However, at the time of our review, the Coast Guard\u2019s selection process was still incomplete. For example, R&D projects and operational systems were not included in the prioritization process. As a result, the Coast Guard could not make trade-offs between all types of proposed systems investments, creating a risk that new systems would be implemented that duplicate existing systems. Additionally, the Coast Guard was at risk of overemphasizing investments in one area, such as maintenance and enhancements for existing systems, at the expense of higher value investments in other areas, such as software applications development supporting multiple unit needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Control and Evaluation Processes Were Often Absent", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations continue to manage their investments once selection has occurred, maintaining a cycle of continual control and evaluation. Senior managers review the project at specific milestones as the project moves through its life cycle and as the dollar amounts spent on the project increase. (See figure 2.3.) At these milestones, the executives compare the expected costs, risks, and benefits of earlier phases with the actual costs incurred, risks encountered, and benefits realized to date. This enables senior executives to (1) identify and focus on managing high-potential or high-risk projects, (2) reevaluate investment decisions early in a project\u2019s life cycle if problems arise, (3) be responsive to changing external and internal conditions in mission priorities and budgets, and (4) learn from past success and mistakes in order to make better decisions in the future. The level of management attention focused on each of the three investment phases is proportional based on such factors as the relative importance of each project in the portfolio, the relative project risks, and the relative number of projects in different phases of the system development process.", "The control phase focuses senior executive attention on ongoing projects to regularly monitor their interim progress against projected risks, cost, schedule, and performance. The control phase requires projects to be modified, continued, accelerated, or terminated based on the results of those assessments. In the evaluation phase, the attention is focused on implemented systems to give a final assessment of risks, costs, and returns. This assessment is then used to improve the selection of future projects.", "Similarly in the federal government, GPRA forces a shift in the focus of federal agencies\u2014away from such traditional concerns as staffing and activity levels and towards one overriding issue: results. GPRA requires agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report on their accomplishments. Just as in leading organizations, GPRA, in concert with the CFO Act, is intended to bring a more disciplined, businesslike approach to the management of federal programs.", "The agencies we reviewed focused most of their resources and attention on selecting projects and gave less attention to controlling or evaluating those projects. While IRS, NASA, and NOAA had implemented control mechanisms, and IRS had developed a postimplementation review methodology, none of the agencies had complete and comprehensive control and evaluation processes in place. Specifically, in the five case study agencies we evaluated, we found that control mechanisms were driven primarily by cost and schedule concerns without any focus on quantitative performance measures, evaluations of actual versus projected returns were rarely conducted, and information and lessons learned in either the control or evaluation phases were not systematically fed back to the selection phase to improve the project selection process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management Control Processes Were Focused Primarily on Cost and Schedule", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations maintain control of a project throughout its life cycle by regularly measuring its progress against not only projected cost and schedule estimates, but also quantitative performance measures, such as benefits realized or demonstrated in pilot projects to date.

When problems are identified, they take immediate action to resolve them, minimize their impact, or alter project expectations.", "Legislation now requires federal executives to conduct this type of rigorous project monitoring. With the passage of ITMRA, agencies are required to demonstrate, through performance measures, how well IT projects are improving agency operations and mission effectiveness. Senior managers are also to receive independently verifiable information on cost, technical and capability requirements, timeliness, and mission benefit data at project milestones. Furthermore, pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), if a project deviates from cost, schedule, and performance goals, the agency head is required to conduct a timely review of the project and identify appropriate corrective action\u2014to include project termination.", "Two of the agencies we reviewed\u2014the Coast Guard and EPA\u2014did not use management control processes that focused on IT systems projects. The other three agencies\u2014IRS, NOAA, and NASA\u2014had management control processes that focused primarily on schedule and cost concerns, but not interim evaluations of performance and results. Rarely did we find examples in which anticipated benefits were compared to results at critical project milestones. We also found few examples of lessons that were learned during the control phase being cycled back to improve the selection phase.", "To illustrate, both IRS and NASA used program control meetings (PCMs) to keep senior executives informed of the status of their major systems by requiring reports, in the form of self-assessments, from the project managers. However, these meetings did not focus on how projects were achieving interim, measurable improvement targets for quality, speed, and service that could form the basis for project decisions about major modifications or termination. IRS, for instance, used an implementation schedule to track different components of each of its major IT projects under TSM. Based on our discussions with IRS officials, the PCMs focused on factors bearing on real or potential changes in project costs or schedule. Actual, verified data on interim application or system testing results\u2014compared to projected improvements in operational, mission improvements\u2014were not evaluated.", "At NASA, senior program executives attended quarterly Program Management Council (PMC) meetings to be kept informed of major programs and projects and to take action when problems arose. While not focused exclusively on IT issues, the PCMs were part of a review process that looked at implementation issues of programs and projects that (1) were critical to fulfilling NASA\u2019s mission, particularly those that were assigned to two or more field installations, (2) involved the allocation of significant resources, defined as projects whose life-cycle costs were over $200 million, or (3) warranted special management attention, including those that required external agency reporting on a regular basis. During the PMC meetings, senior executives reviewed self-assessments (grades of green, yellow, and red), done by the responsible project manager, on the cost, schedule, and technical progress of the project.", "Using this color-coded grading scheme, NASA\u2019s control process focused largely on cost, schedule, and technical concerns, but not on assessing improvements to mission performance. Additionally, the grading scheme was not based on quantitative criteria, but instead was largely qualitative and subjective in nature. For instance, projects were given a \u201cgreen\u201d rating if they were \u201cin good shape and on track consistent with the baseline.\u201d A \u201cyellow\u201d rating was defined as a \u201cconcern that is expected to be resolved within the schedule and budget margins,\u201d and a \u201cred\u201d rating was defined as \u201ca serious problem that is likely to require a change in the baseline determined at the beginning of the project.\u201d However, the lack of quantitative criteria, benefit analysis, and performance data invited the possibility for widely divergent interpretations and a misunderstanding of the true value of the projects under review.", "As of 1995, three IT systems had met NASA\u2019s review criteria and had been reviewed by the PMC. These three systems constituted about 7 percent of NASA\u2019s total fiscal year 1994 IT spending. No similar centralized review process existed for lower dollar projects, which could have resulted in problem projects and systems that collectively added up to significant costs being overlooked. For instance, in 1995 NASA terminated an automated accounting system project that had been under development for about 6 years, had cost about $45 million to date, and had an expected life-cycle cost of over $107 million.", "In responding to a draft of this report, the NASA CIO said that the current cost threshold of $200 million is being reduced to a lower level to ensure that most, if not all, agency IT projects will be subject to PMC reviews. In addition, the CIO noted that NASA\u2019s internal policy directive on program/project management is being revised to (1) include IT evaluation criteria that are aligned with ITMRA and executive-branch guidance and (2) clearly establish the scope and levels of review (agency, lead center, or center) for IT investment decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluations of Actual Versus Projected Returns Are Rarely Conducted", "paragraphs": ["Once projects have been implemented and become operational, leading organizations evaluate them to determine whether they have achieved the expected benefits, such as lowered cost, reduced cycle time, increased quality, or increased the speed of service delivery.

NOAA headquarters, with half a staff year devoted to this review program, generally conducted reviews in collaboration with other organizational units and had participated in only four IT reviews over the last 3 fiscal years. Additionally, these reviews generally did not address the systems\u2019 projected versus actual cost, performance, and benefits.", "IRS had developed a PIR methodology that it used to conduct five systems postimplementation reviews. A standardized methodology is important because it makes the reviews consistent and adds rigor to the analytical steps used in the review process. The IRS used the June 1994 PIR on the Corporate Files On-Line (CFOL) system as the model for this standardized methodology. In December 1995, IRS used the PIR methodology to complete a review of the Service Center Recognition/Image Processing System (SCRIPS). Subsequently, three more PIRs have been completed (TAXLINK, the Enforcement Revenue Information System, and the Integrated Collection System) and five more are scheduled. IRS estimated that the five completed systems have an aggregate cost of about $845 million.", "However, the PIR methodology was not integrated into a cohesive investment process. Specifically, there were no mechanisms in place to take the lessons learned from the PIRs and apply them to the decision criteria and other tools and techniques used in their investment process.", "As a result, the PIRs that were conducted did not meet one of their primary objectives\u2014to ensure continual improvement based on lessons learned\u2014and IRS ran the risk of repeating past mistakes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency IT Decisions Are Not Based on Adequate Data", "paragraphs": ["To help make continual decisions on IT investments, leading organizations require all projects to have complete and up-to-date project information.

Return criteria are measured in financial and nonfinancial terms. Financial measurements can include return on investment and internal rate of return analyses while nonfinancial assessments can include improvements in operational efficiency, reductions in cycle time, and progress in better meeting customer needs.", "Of the five agencies in our sample, only the Coast Guard used a complete set of decision criteria. These decision criteria included (1) risk assessments of schedule, cost, and technical feasibility dimensions, (2) cost-benefit impacts of the investment, (3) mission effectiveness measures, (4) degree of alignment with strategic goals and high-level interest (such as Congress or the President), and (5) organizational impact in the areas of personnel training, quality of work life, and increased scope of service. The Coast Guard used these criteria to prioritize IT projects and justify final selections. The decision criteria were weighted and scored, and projects were evaluated to determine those with the greatest potential to improve mission performance.", "Generally, officials in other agencies stated that they determine which projects to fund based on the judgmental expertise of decisionmakers involved in the process. NOAA, for instance, had a board of senior executives that met annually to determine budget decisions across seven strategic goals. Working groups for each strategic goal met and each created a prioritized funding list, which was then submitted to the executive decision-making board. These working groups did not have uniform criteria for selecting projects. The executive board accepted the prioritized lists as submitted and made funding threshold decisions based on these lists. As a result, the executive board could not easily make consistent, accurate trade-offs among the projects that were selected by these individual working groups on a repeatable basis.", "In addition, to maximize funding for a specific working group, project rankings may not have been based on true risk or return. According to a NOAA senior manager and the chair of one of the NOAA working groups, one group ranked high-visibility projects near the bottom of the list to encourage the senior decision-making board to draw the budgetary cut-off line below these high visibility projects.

However, this information was not readily available and gathering it required agency officials to rely on a variety of sometimes incomparable sources for system cost, life-cycle phase, and staffing levels.", "In addition, some of the agencies could not comparatively analyze IT projects because they did not keep a comprehensive accounting of data on all of the IT systems. For example, EPA had to conduct a special information collection to identify life-cycle cost estimates on its major systems and projects for this report. While the individual system managers at EPA did have system life-cycle cost estimates, the fact that this information was decentrally maintained made cross-system comparisons unlikely. In a 1995 report, the NASA IG found that neither NASA headquarters nor any of the NASA centers had a complete inventory of all information systems for which they were responsible.", "All of the agencies we reviewed conducted cost-benefit analyses for their major IT projects.

In addition, the cost-benefit projections were rarely used to evaluate actual project results.", "The NWS modernization, for instance, has a cost-benefit analysis that was done in 1992. This analysis covers the four major systems under the modernization. To be effective, an analysis should include the costs and benefits of each project, alternatives to that project, and finally, a combined cost-benefit analysis for the entire modernization. However, the cost-benefit analysis that was conducted only compares the aggregate costs and benefits of the NWS modernization initiative against the current system. It does not assess or analyze the costs and benefits of each system, nor does it examine alternatives to those systems. As a result, NWS does not know if each of the modernization projects is cost-beneficial, and cannot make trade-offs among them. If using only this analysis, decision-makers are forced to choose either the status quo or all of the projects proposed under the modernization.", "Without updated cost-benefit data, informed management decisions become difficult.

However, the federal case study agencies we examined used decision-making processes that lacked many essential components associated with an investment approach. Critical weaknesses included the absence of reliable, quantitative cost figures, net return on investment calculations, rigorous decision criteria, and postimplementation project reviews. With sustained management attention and substantive improvements to existing processes, these agencies should be able to meet the investment-related provisions of ITMRA.", "Implementing and refining an IT investment process, however, is not an easy undertaking and cannot be accomplished overnight. Maximizing the returns and minimizing the risks on the billions of dollars that are spent each year for IT will require continued efforts on two fronts. First, agencies must fundamentally change how they select and manage their IT projects. They must develop and begin using a structured IT investment approach that encompasses all aspects of the investment process\u2014selection, control, and evaluation.", "Second, oversight attention far beyond current levels must be given to agencies\u2019 management processes and to actual results that are being produced.

OMB has already initiated several changes to governmentwide guidance to encourage the investment approach to IT decision-making, and has drawn upon the assistance of several key interagency working groups comprised of senior agency officials. Such efforts should be continued and expanded, to ensure that the federal government gets the most return for its information technology investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Given its significant leadership responsibility in supporting agencies\u2019 improvement efforts and responding to requirements of ITMRA, it is imperative that OMB continue to clearly define expectations for agencies and for itself to successfully implement investment decision-making approaches. As such, we are recommending four specific actions for the Director of OMB to take.", "OMB\u2019s first challenge is to help agencies improve their investment management processes. With effective processes in place, agencies should be in much stronger positions to make informed decisions about the relative benefits and risks of proposed IT spending. Without them, agencies will continue to be vulnerable to risks associated with excessively costly projects that produce questionable mission-related improvements. Under Sections 5112 and 5113 of the Information Technology Management Reform Act, the Director of OMB has responsibility for promoting and directing that federal agencies establish capital planning processes for information technology investment decisions. In designing governmentwide guidance for this process, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget require agencies to: Implement IT investment decision-making processes that use explicitly defined, complete, and consistent criteria applied to all projects, regardless of whether project decisions are made at the departmental, bureau, or program level. With criteria that reflect cost, benefit, and risk considerations, applied consistently, agencies should be able to make more reasonable and better informed trade-offs between competing projects in order to achieve the maximum economic impact for their scarce investment dollars.", "Periodically analyze their entire portfolios of IT investments\u2014at a minimum new projects, as well as projects in development and operations and maintenance expenditures\u2014to determine which projects to approve, cancel or delay. With development and maintenance efforts competing directly with one another for funding, agencies will be better able to gauge the best proportion of investment in each category of spending to move away from their legacy bases of systems with excessive maintenance costs.", "Design control and evaluation processes that include cost, schedule, and quantitative performance assessments of projected versus actual improvement in mission outcomes. As a result, they should increase their capacity to both assess actual project results and learn from their experience which operational areas produce the highest returns and how well they estimate projects and deliver final results.", "Advise agencies in setting minimum quality standards for data used to assess (qualitatively and quantitatively) cost, benefit, and risks decisions on IT investments. Agencies should demonstrate that all IT funding proposals include only data meeting these quality requirements and that projected versus actual results are assessed at critical project milestones. The audited data required by the CFO Act should help produce this accurate, reliable cost information. Higher quality information should result in better and more consistent decisions on complex information systems investments.", "OMB\u2019s second challenge is to use the results produced by the improved investment processes to develop recommendations for the President\u2019s budget that reflect an agency\u2019s actual track record in delivering mission performance for IT funds expended. Under Section 5113 of ITMRA, the Director of OMB is charged with evaluating the results of agency IT investments and enforcing accountability\u2014including increases or reductions in agency IT funding proposals\u2014through the annual budget process. In carrying out these responsibilities, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget:", "Evaluate information system project cost, benefit, and risk data when analyzing the results of agency IT investments. Such analyses should produce agency track records that clearly and definitively show what improvements in mission performance have been achieved for the IT dollars expended.", "Ensure that the agency investment control process are in compliance with OMB\u2019s governmentwide guidance, and if not, assess strengths and weaknesses and recommend actions and timetables for improvements. When results are questionable or difficult to determine, monitoring agency investment processes will help OMB diagnose problem causes by determining the degree of agency control and the quality of decisions being made.", "Use OMB\u2019s evaluation of each agency\u2019s IT investment control processes and IT performance results as a basis for recommended budget decisions to the President. This direct linkage should give agencies a strong, much needed incentive to maximize the returns and minimize the risks of their scarce IT investments.", "To effectively implement improved investment management processes and make the appropriate linkages between agency track records and budget recommendations, OMB also has a third challenge. It will need to marshal the resources and skills to execute the new types of analysis required to make sound investment decisions on agency portfolios.

Agency senior IRM management could benefit greatly from a high quality, easily accessible means to solicit advice from capital planning and investment experts outside the federal government. Identify the type and amount of skills required for OMB to execute IT portfolio analyses, determine the degree to which these needs are currently satisfied, specify the gap and both design and implement a plan, with timeframes and goals, to close the gap. Given existing workloads and the resilience of the OMB culture, without a determined effort to build the necessary skills, OMB will have little impact on the quality of IT investment decision-making. If necessary to augment its own staff resources, OMB should consider the option of obtaining outside support to help perform such assessments.", "Finally, as part of its internal implementation strategy, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget should consider developing an approach to assessing OMB\u2019s own performance in executing oversight responsibilities under the ITMRA capital planning and investment provisions.
