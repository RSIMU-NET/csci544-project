Since 1994, just prior to the recent wave of mergers, the number of independent railroad systems with at least one Class I railroadhas decreased from 12 to 7. In 1999, the five largest Class I railroads accounted for about 94 percent of the total Class I operating revenue and about 95 percent of total Class I revenue ton-miles. Railroads have consolidated largely to reduce costs and increase efficiency and competitiveness.", "Industry consolidation has raised concerns from companies that ship and receive their goods by rail (rail shippers) and others about the lack of competition in the industry. In general, rail shippers are concerned that mergers have led to a reduction in railroad competition and consequently higher rail rates, poorer service, or both. In the context of railroad mergers, the Surface Transportation Board (the Board), which reviews railroad merger proposals, has defined \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d as the extent to which merging parties gain sufficient market power to profitably raise rates, reduce service, or both. (See app. I for a chronology of Class I railroad mergers since August 1995.)", "This report responds to your request that we review the Board\u2019s oversight of railroad mergers. In particular, this report discusses (1) the role the Board plays in reviewing proposed railroad mergers and overseeing mergers that have been approved and how postmerger oversight is conducted, (2) how the Board mitigates potential harm to competition, and (3) how the Union Pacific/Southern Pacific merger affected rail rates in selected geographic areas. This report primarily focuses on mergers of Class I railroads since the Board was created in 1996. However, information on prior mergers is included to show how merger oversight has changed over time. Moreover, this report primarily focuses on issues pertaining to competition and not other issues that might arise from a merger.", "To accomplish our objectives, we reviewed applicable laws, regulations, and decisions and met with Board officials, representatives of shippers\u2019 trade associations, and railroad officials. We also developed an econometric model to analyze selected merger-related rail rates using data from the Board\u2019s Carload Waybill Sample for the period 1994 through 1999. We focused our analysis on selected geographic areas associated with the 1996 merger of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) with the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP) because of the significant competition issues pertaining to this merger.

The act transferred many of ICC\u2019s core rail functions to the Board, including the responsibility to review and approve railroad mergers. The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to review proposed rail mergers, and if approved by the Board, such mergers are exempt from other laws (including federal antitrust laws that would otherwise apply to the transaction) as necessary to carry out the transaction. The Board also conducts oversight of mergers that have been approved. However, there is no statutory requirement for merger oversight. ICC had approximately 400 employees in 1995, its last year of operation. For fiscal year 2001, the Board received an appropriation to support 143 employees.", "In October 2000, the Board proposed modifications to its regulations governing major rail consolidations. According to the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Board recognized that current merger regulations are outdated and inappropriate for addressing future major rail mergers that, if approved, would likely result in the creation of two North American transcontinental railroads.  In June 2001, the Board adopted final regulations governing proposed major rail consolidations.  The final regulations recognize the Board\u2019s concerns about what the appropriate rail merger policy should be in light of a declining number of Class I railroads, the elimination of excess capacity in the industry, and the serious service problems that have accompanied recent rail mergers.  The final rules substantially increase the burden on applicants to demonstrate that a merger is in the public interest, in part by providing for enhanced competition and protecting service.

These include the effect of a proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public; the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction; and the impact of the proposed transaction on competition among rail carriers in the affected region or in the national rail system. The act also establishes a 15-month time limit for the Board to complete its review of accepted applications for mergers between Class I railroads and reach a final decision. Since the Board was created, two applications for merger between Class I railroads have been submitted\u2014Conrail\u2019s acquisition by CSX and Norfolk Southern and Canadian National/Illinois Central\u2014both of which were approved.  The Board also approved the Union Pacific\u2019s acquisition of Southern Pacific, an application that had originally been submitted to ICC.", "During the merger review process, the Board considers comments and evidence submitted by all interested parties, which, together with the application, form the record upon which the Board bases its decision. The applicants as well as interested parties may submit information on the potential public benefits and potential harm of a proposed merger. Public benefits can include such things as gains in a railroad\u2019s efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced opportunities for single-line service. Potential harm can result from, among other things, reductions in competition and harm to a competing carrier\u2019s ability to provide essential services\u2014that is, services for which there is a public need but for which adequate alternative transportation is not available.", "Whenever necessary and feasible, the Board imposes conditions on mergers that it approves so as to mitigate potential harm associated with a merger, including harm to competition. In determining whether to approve a merger and to impose conditions on its approval, the Board\u2019s concern has focused on the preservation of competition and essential services\u2014 not on the survival of particular carriers or enhancing competition. Board officials told us that, while the Board\u2019s efforts to preserve competition have primarily focused on maintaining competitive options for those shippers that could face a reduction in service from two railroads to service by only one railroad, competition that is the result of having two \u201cnearby\u201d railroads has also been preserved.", "Conditions can include such things as trackage rights, switching arrangements, access to another railroad\u2019s facilities or terminal areas, or divestiture of lines. For example, in the UP/SP merger, the Board granted about 4,000 miles of trackage rights to the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) to address competition-related issues for those rail corridors and shippers that could have potentially faced a reduction in service from two railroads (UP and SP) to service by only one railroad (UP). (See fig. 1.) The Board may also impose privately negotiated settlement agreements as conditions to mergers. The Board will normally impose conditions only when a merger would produce effects harmful to the public interest (such as a significant reduction in competition) and the condition will ameliorate or eliminate these harmful effects. In addition, a condition must be operationally feasible, produce net public benefits, and be tailored to address the adverse effects of a transaction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Board Conducts Oversight of Mergers", "paragraphs": ["If a merger is approved, the Board has broad discretion to impose oversight conditions, as well as flexibility in how it conducts oversight. Such oversight conditions establish the Board\u2019s intent to monitor a merger\u2019s implementation and to conduct annual oversight proceedings (called formal oversight in this report). An oversight condition may also establish a time period during which the Board will monitor the effects of a merger. Although oversight conditions are not necessary for the Board to retain jurisdiction over a merger\u2014particularly with regard to carrying out conditions the Board has imposed\u2014oversight conditions ensure that the Board\u2019s retained jurisdiction will be meaningfully exercised and gives parties an added opportunity to demonstrate any specific anticompetitive effects of a merger. According to the Board, oversight also (1) permits the Board to target potential problem areas for the subsequent imposition of additional conditions if this proves warranted in light of experience, (2) puts applicants on notice that they consummate the transaction subject to reasonable future conditions to mitigate harm in limited areas, and (3) helps to ensure cooperation by the merging carriers in addressing problems and disputes that may arise following merger approval. As such, oversight provides an additional check that Board-approved mergers are in the public interest. When an oversight period ends, the Board has stated that it continues to retain jurisdiction and can reopen a merger proceeding, if necessary, to address concerns pertaining to competition and other problems that might develop.", "Board officials described postmerger oversight as a process consisting mainly of an annual oversight proceeding. This proceeding is an examination of the implementation of merger conditions and whether conditions have effectively met their intended purpose. Oversight is generally conducted each year for 5 years after a merger has been approved. As part of the oversight proceeding, public comments and supporting information are formally submitted into the record by shippers, carriers, and other interested parties. Periodic progress reports, which provide, among other things, details on the implementation of conditions, are also submitted by merging railroads as required. Board officials told us that reporting requirements are frequently used as part of oversight and that such reporting has served to replace the industry and merger monitoring once conducted by ICC\u2019s field staff.", "As an adjudicatory body, the Board relies on parties affected by a merger to identify whether a proposed transaction has harmed competition and, if so, to what extent; the Board does not independently collect this type of information.  Board officials noted that it has been standard practice in merger oversight to require relevant railroads, such as UP and BNSF in UP/SP oversight, to make available under seal to interested parties the railroads\u2019 confidential 100 percent traffic tapes\u2014tapes that include information such as shipments moved and freight revenue generated\u2014so that parties other than the merging carriers would also have the opportunity to submit postmerger rate analyses to the Board. As part of the oversight process, the Board may consider information obtained from monitoring industry operations, such as service levels, as well as any studies conducted, whether specific to that merger or industrywide. In conducting formal oversight, the Board may modify existing conditions if they are not achieving their intended purpose or may impose additional reporting requirements if necessary. The Board also has the authority to initiate a new proceeding to determine if additional conditions should be imposed to address unforeseen merger-related issues.", "Board officials noted that the agency engages in other activities associated with oversight. Included are such things as informal monitoring of merging railroads\u2019 operations and service performance and responding to certain filings, such as petitions to clarify or modify a merger condition based on competition-related issues or other claims of merger harm."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight Has Changed Over Time", "paragraphs": ["Although the Board retains some form of oversight jurisdiction for all rail mergers, the use of formal merger oversight has become standard only since the mid-1990s. Board officials told us that before 1995, formal postapproval oversight of mergers was rare and was instituted only in unusual situations when strong concerns about competition were present. These officials pointed to only two cases when a period of formal oversight was imposed prior to 1995: once in 1984 in a rail/barge merger between CSX Corporation and American Commercial Lines, Inc., and in 1992 as part of the merger of Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation and Fox Valley & Western, Ltd. Neither case involved the merger of two or more Class I railroads. In both cases, however, oversight conditions were imposed in response to concerns raised about potential harm to competition.", "In recent years, in light of the complexity of transactions and the service and competitive issues that have arisen, the Board has expanded its use of formal oversight of railroad mergers. ICC did not impose specific oversight conditions on its approval of the 1995 Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway merger because, according to Board officials, there were few concerns raised in that merger about service issues or potential harm to competition. Since August 1995, when the BNSF merger was approved, the Board has imposed oversight on all three Class I railroad mergers that it has approved: the 1996 UP/SP merger, the 1998 Conrail acquisition by CSX and Norfolk Southern, and the 1999 Canadian National/Illinois Central merger. For two of the three transactions (UP/SP and Conrail), the oversight period was set for 5 years. In the third merger\u2014Canadian National and Illinois Central\u2014a 5-year oversight period was established with continuation to be reviewed annually. All three oversight periods are ongoing.", "The Board has significant discretion and flexibility to adapt its oversight as circumstances warrant. For example, in conducting oversight in recent years, the Board has, when necessary, incorporated additional monitoring elements to supplement its oversight activities. For example, it has added more reporting requirements. The UP/SP merger provides a good illustration of service monitoring. As the result of a service crisis that developed during the implementation of this merger, the Board required both UP/SP and BNSF to provide weekly and monthly reports to its Office of Compliance and Enforcement\u2014information which, according to Board officials, had never been available before. These reports included statistics on such things as average train speed, cars on line, and terminal dwell time\u2014the time loaded railcars spend in a terminal awaiting continued movement. This information allowed the Board to monitor the operations and service levels of both railroads. Similar reporting requirements were imposed on both CSX and Norfolk Southern in the Conrail merger. In this instance, the Board, anticipating possible transitional service problems during the integration process, required the weekly and monthly reports both to monitor the merger\u2019s implementation and to identify potential service problems.", "Board officials told us that as a result of the lessons learned in the UP/SP merger, oversight has expanded to incorporate monitoring of operational and service issues\u2014in part to serve as an early warning of problems that might occur during the merger integration process.  Future mergers will also be subject to operational monitoring.  The merger rules adopted by the Board in June 2001 state that the Board will continue to conduct significant postapproval operational monitoring of mergers to insure that service levels after a merger are reasonable and adequate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Board Has Acted to Address Harm to Competition, but Some Shippers and Carriers Are Concerned About Merger Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In general, the Board has found few competition-related problems when conducting oversight of recent mergers but has acted to modify some conditions designed to address such problems when it felt such action was necessary.

Board officials also told us they believe that, to date, the conditions originally imposed on mergers have met their intended purpose and have mitigated any potential harm to competition. In determining whether to modify a condition, the Board reviews the evidence presented, considers the nature and extent of the alleged harm, and assesses what action may be warranted. In general, the Board has not found it necessary to modify or add conditions during oversight of recent mergers. However, the Board has found such action to be appropriate in some cases. For example, in December 1998, the Board added a condition and modified a condition in the UP/SP merger. The added condition addressed traffic congestion in the Houston/Gulf Coast area; the modified condition changed the location where BNSF railcars are transferred to another railroad. Similarly, in 1998 and 1999, the Board modified four conditions in the Conrail transaction. These modifications were designed to preserve competition by, among other things, introducing a second carrier and requiring carriers to negotiate an acceptable transfer point to interchange railcars bound for an Indiana power plant.", "Providing specific evidence of harm to competition is critical in obtaining additional Board relief. According to the Board\u2019s decisions, shippers and others have sometimes alleged harm to competition during oversight without presenting specific evidence of such harm. For example, as part of the UP/SP merger, the Board granted over 2,100 miles of trackage rights to BNSF on the Central Corridor to preserve competition for those shippers that could have been reduced from service by two carriers (UP and SP) to service by only one (the merged UP/SP) and for those exclusively served shippers who benefited from having another railroad nearby. Some organizations have asserted that, despite the trackage rights, postmerger competition has not been adequate on this corridor. However, in its UP/SP oversight decisions, the Board has concluded that postmerger competition on this corridor has been adequate, in part because no shippers came forward with specific evidence of harm. In another instance, in the Conrail merger, the Board granted trackage rights to Norfolk Southern to access a power plant in Indiana. In order to use the trackage rights, Norfolk Southern negotiated a fee with CSX. The power plant owner believed that the negotiated fee was too high to allow adequate competition between the railroads and requested a lower fee so that Norfolk Southern could compete for its business. In denying this request, the Board stated that the evidence of harm presented was not sufficient, in part because both CSX and Norfolk Southern demonstrated that the negotiated fee would amount to only a minimal cost increase ($0.004 per ton) over the amount the Board had previously found to be reasonable.", "A review of merger oversight documents shows the Board has acted to address competition-related postmerger issues when it believed such action was necessary. For example, during oversight of the Conrail acquisition, the Board reduced fees for trackage rights and switching charged to Canadian Pacific to permit competition between CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway in the Albany, New York, to New York City corridor. Although the Board had initially set these fees in a postmerger decision, the Board later determined that the fees were too high to allow Canadian Pacific to use CSX tracks to provide meaningful competition between the carriers. Consequently, the Board acted to reduce the fees to promote competition. The Board also acted during the Conrail oversight period to void provisions in two contracts between CSX Intermodal, Inc., a rail shipper, and Norfolk Southern that required Norfolk Southern to be the primary carrier of CSX Intermodal goods between northern New Jersey and Chicago during the contract period. Voiding these provisions allowed CSX immediately to compete with Norfolk Southern for these shipments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Parties Believe Oversight Is Valuable, but Some Shipper and Railroad Associations Are Dissatisfied", "paragraphs": ["Shipper and railroad trade associations and railroad companies with whom we spoke believe postmerger oversight is a valuable process. Officials from the National Grain and Feed Association and the National Industrial Transportation League told us that the Board has always been willing to listen to their concerns. Officials from Norfolk Southern and BNSF said the merger oversight process provides shippers and railroads with an opportunity to submit merger-related questions, problems, and concerns. Railroad and railroad association officials stated that the Board acts to protect the interests of the public and the shipping community by allowing railroads and shippers to work together during oversight to resolve actual and potential merger-related problems. Officials from one trade association said that without an oversight process, their members might be faced with a less desirable alternative. For example, officials from the American Chemistry Council told us that the only other option for shippers would be to use the Board\u2019s time-consuming and expensive complaint process. Officials from the American Chemistry Council, as well as officials from UP and BNSF, said a 5-year oversight period has been a benefit to both railroads and shippers. However, an American Chemistry Council official said some mergers may need oversight for a longer or shorter period than 5 years and that it is unclear what type of oversight will occur after the 5-year oversight period for the UP/SP merger expires in 2002.", "Despite seeing oversight as a valuable process, some shipper and small railroad associations are dissatisfied with aspects of the Board\u2019s oversight procedures. A number of reasons were cited. The Board has been viewed as unresponsive to concerns of shippers and small railroads. For example, an official representing the Edison Electric Institute told us that it had expressed concern to the Board in 2000 about the degree of competition for the transport of Utah and Colorado coal in the Central Corridor, but that the Board declined to answer questions about this issue. An official from the American Chemistry Council expressed similar frustration that the Board did not adopt any part of a plan developed by shippers and others to address the Houston/Gulf Coast service crisis that occurred during the implementation of the UP/SP merger. This plan had broad support from both private sector and state government officials.Dissatisfaction was also expressed about the time and resources required for preparing and submitting comments during the postmerger oversight period, especially for small shippers. For example, officials from the Edison Electric Institute and the American Chemistry Council told us that small shippers might not have the time or the money to invest in the formal oversight process. Finally, officials from several shipper associations and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (an association representing smaller railroads) said their members are discouraged from participating in the oversight process, in part because of the reasons cited above.", "Although generally satisfied with the Board\u2019s oversight process, officials at some Class I railroads have cited certain drawbacks to it. For example, officials at Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation, and UP said some shippers use the formal oversight process as a mechanism to raise non- merger-related issues, which they claim have protracted the oversight process. Railroad officials told us that inviting comments by interested parties allows them to reintroduce issues that were initially denied during the merger approval process. They noted that, as a result, they must invest their time to address non-merger-related issues. Officials with Norfolk Southern said that if the Board allows parties to reintroduce issues already decided, this could delay implementation of a merger.", "Board officials told us that oversight is an open process and anyone can submit comments. The basis for making decisions is the merger and postmerger oversight record and Board officials said they encourage parties such as shippers, railroads, and others to submit information into the record so that the Board can act with as much information as possible. However, Board officials acknowledged that parties sometimes reargue issues during oversight that were not decided in their favor in the merger decision. For example, in its November 2000 oversight decision in the Canadian National/Illinois Central merger, the Board refused to require that Canadian National sell its share of the Detroit River Tunnel as requested by various parties. The parties were concerned that Canadian National would competitively disadvantage the Detroit River Tunnel by not allowing needed capital investments to be made and favoring another nearby tunnel it owned. The Board found that this issue was not directly related to the merger and was a matter being privately negotiated between the parties. Finally, Board officials have said the oversight process has evolved over time and the Board has incorporated additional reporting and other requirements to provide more information on actual and potential problems experienced during merger implementation. Moreover, the Board has focused on preserving, not enhancing, competition and does not seek to restructure the competitive balance of the railroad industry during postmerger oversight.", "Both shipper association and railroad officials with whom we spoke recognized that the Board has a limited number of staff to conduct formal oversight. According to officials from the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association, the Board\u2019s perceived slowness in handling oversight issues may be attributable to the significant amount of information that needs to be processed during the annual oversight proceeding\u2014information that is generally handled by a core team of 15 employees (who, Board officials noted, also work on agency matters other than mergers). Board officials acknowledged that their resources are limited. However, they said oversight offers an open, no-fee process in which any interested party may participate. They also said the Board has issued in a timely manner its decisions in the annual oversight proceeedings, as well as in matters involving specific material issues during oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Merger Rules Could Change Oversight but May Not Address All Concerns of Shippers and Carriers", "paragraphs": ["The rail consolidation rules issued in June 2001 could change how the Board conducts oversight by providing for merger applications to include plans to enhance competition and to ensure reasonable service and by holding applicants accountable if they do not act reasonably to achieve promised merger benefits. Shifting the focus of merger review towards enhancing competition and ensuring reasonable service, as well as including some degree of accountability for postmerger benefits, could require the Board to expend additional time and resources reviewing these issues. For example, the final rules would call upon merger applicants to enhance competition so as to offset any negative effects resulting from a merger, such as potential harm to competition and disruptions of service. This could affect the way the Board uses and oversees conditions during the merger approval and oversight processes. Similarly, to require railroads to calculate the net public benefits to be gained through a proposed merger and to hold them accountable for acting reasonably to achieve these benefits, such as improved service, the Board will monitor as part of the general oversight proceeding the realization of merger benefits claimed. These activities would enlarge the current focus of assessing whether conditions are working as intended. In the event that public benefits fail to materialize after a merger is approved, the Board said it would consider the applicant\u2019s proposals for additional measures.", "It is not likely that the final merger rules will resolve all concerns expressed by shipper and railroad organizations about oversight. The final rules will not change the basic process established for oversight. While the final rules may address concerns of shippers and railroads about service levels by requiring merger applicants to develop service assurance plans, they will not address more general concerns that the Board is not responsive to their issues. Furthermore, the final rules will not likely address concerns about the time and resources necessary to participate in postmerger oversight. Rather, the amount of time and resources required could increase, given that during oversight the Board will assess enhancement of competition, service issues, and accountability for proposed merger benefits as well as whether conditions are working as intended. In addition, issues may continue to be introduced that are not directly related to the merger under review. Board officials said they do not consider participation in oversight to be an expensive or burdensome process. However, they acknowledged that the new merger rules would require applicants to provide more detailed information on competition, service, and benefits as part of the merger application and that the amount of time and resources required during oversight could increase.", "Finally, the final rules may also not address all of the shippers\u2019 concerns about the extent of competition in the rail industry resulting from mergers. While provisions regarding the enhancement of competition may address some competition-related issues, it is not clear how these provisions will be implemented. Both shipper and railroad officials told us that enhanced competition had not been defined in the proposed rules and, therefore, they were not clear how the provisions might affect specific situations involving competition. The final rules acknowledge that the Board cannot predict in advance the type and quantity of competitive enhancements that would be appropriate in a particular merger proposal.

This enhanced market power could be used to profitably increase rail rates if no action were taken to preserve competition. Board officials told us that rate trends are a good indicator of postmerger competition. In 1996, UP acquired SP in a transaction that raised significant competition-related issues. This merger encompassed a number of geographic areas where the loss of competition from SP could have reduced the number of carriers from 2 to 1. Most of these areas were in Texas and Louisiana, but some were in the Central Corridor between California and Colorado. (See fig. 1.) In granting trackage rights to BNSF in this merger, the Board sought to replace the competition for potential 2-to-1 shippers in these geographic areas. To understand how the UP/SP merger affected rail rates, we looked at rail rates in two geographic areas\u2014Reno, Nevada, and Salt Lake City, Utah\u2014 both in the Central Corridor. We selected these areas because they had high concentrations of potential 2-to-1 shippers and, according to BNSF and UP/SP officials, were less affected by the service crisis that developed during implementation of the UP/SP merger. They also provided relatively clear examples of where BNSF service substituted for SP service.", "The primary commodities shipped to and from Reno and Salt Lake City were nonmetallic minerals (such as barites) and chemicals (such as sulfuric acid or sodium). (See table 1.) Farm products (such as corn and wheat) accounted for about 13 percent of the traffic shipped to Salt Lake City. We also included coal in our analysis of Salt Lake City rail rates, since it accounted for the highest percentage of carloads shipped to and from that area. However, BNSF officials told us that, in general, they have not yet used the trackage rights they were granted to transport coal to or from the Salt Lake City area. In its decision approving the UP/SP merger, the Board noted that BNSF was granted access to only a small portion of coal traffic on the Central Corridor, mostly in the northwestern section of Utah. As the table shows, the potential 2-to-1 shippers served by BNSF, as a percentage of total shippers in these geographic areas, ranged from 10 to 22 percent. This is consistent with comments made by Board officials that BNSF received trackage rights to serve about 20 percent of the postmerger UP/SP traffic on the Central Corridor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UP/SP Merger Generally Decreased Rail Rates, but Not for All Commodities and Not for All Shippers", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis found that by itself the merger would have served to reduce rates for four of the six commodities shipped to or from the geographic areas we chose.

However, the rates for shipments of chemicals to the Reno area would have increased by 21 percent because of the merger, while rates for shipments of nonmetallic minerals originating in the Reno area would have been relatively unchanged by the merger (i.e., the merger-related change was not statistically significant). The effect of a merger on rail rates depends on the cost savings the merger might generate relative to the exercise of any enhanced market power by the railroad carriers. Since the Board acted to preserve the level of competition by granting trackage rights to BNSF to serve potential 2-to-1 shippers in these geographic areas, the rate decreases from the merger likely reflect cost savings from the consolidation. Another way in which the merger could result in lower rates is if BNSF provided more effective competition to UP in the postmerger period than SP did in the premerger period.", "While the effects of a merger can put downward (or upward) pressure on rates, an analysis focused on overall rate changes alone could lead to an inaccurate conclusion about whether conditions imposed on a merger to mitigate potential harm to competition have been effective. The results of our analysis indicate that, in addition to merger effects, other factors, such as the volume of shipments, had an equal or greater influence on overall rate changes for the specific movements we examined. In some cases, the effects of these other factors were strong enough to offset or even reverse the downward pressure of the merger on rates. (See table 2.) For example, for shipments of chemicals from the Salt Lake City area and for shipments of coal to and from the Salt Lake City area, while the merger alone would have decreased rates, the rates nevertheless increased overall. On the other hand, while rates decreased overall for chemicals shipments to the Reno area, the merger by itself put an upward pressure on rates.", "Finally, we found that postmerger rates for potential 2-to-1 shippers (served by BNSF) in the Reno and Salt Lake City areas decreased for one of the commodities we looked at but were essentially unchanged in three other instances. (See table 3.) The rate changes for potential 2-to-1 shippers (served by BNSF) shipping chemicals from the Salt Lake City area were about 16 percentage points less than similar rates for shippers shipping similar products but served solely by UP. However, rail rate changes for potential 2-to-1 shippers (served by BNSF) who shipped farm products to the Salt Lake City area, nonmetallic minerals from the Reno area, and chemicals to the Reno area were all higher than for shippers served exclusively by UP, but this difference was not statistically significant, meaning that the rates were essentially unchanged. These results are not wholly unexpected, since the levels of rail competition for the two kinds of shippers\u2014potential 2-to-1 and non-2-to-1\u2014differ and rail rates are set using differential pricing. Under differential pricing, shippers with less effective transportation alternatives generally pay a proportionately greater share of a railroad\u2019s fixed costs than shippers with more effective transportation alternatives.", "There are limitations in the analysis and data we used. The results presented are only for the two geographic markets we reviewed and cannot be generalized to other geographic locations or for rate changes from the UP/SP merger as a whole. In addition, although econometric models of the factors that determine rail rates have been used to analyze a variety of policy-related issues in rail transportation and have been useful, such a model can be sensitive to how it is specified. We tested the model\u2019s key results to ensure that our findings were reliable and are confident that the results are reasonable for the commodities in the geographic areas we examined. Finally, the Carload Waybill Sample data used in our model also have limitations.

Although the results in this study are not directly comparable to those in other studies of rates that are based on broader geographic areas, our analysis suggests that overall rate changes do not identify the specific impact of mergers on rates. In general, the Board has been presented with rate studies that have focused on overall rate changes, not on the portion of changes caused by a merger. For example, rate studies prepared by UP during merger oversight indicate that, overall, rates decreased immediately after the merger and have continued to decrease at 2-to-1 points and for traffic moving in the Houston-Memphis and Houston-New Orleans corridors. Similarly, both CSX and Norfolk Southern have conducted studies of rail rates in the Buffalo, New York, area since their acquisition of Conrail in 1999. Again, these studies have focused on the overall direction of rate changes and have shown that rail rates in the Buffalo area have generally decreased.

However, the Board is amenable to seeing this general approach developed in the context of a public merger oversight record where it would be subject to scrutiny and refinement by relevant parties.  Board officials noted that presenting and rebutting econometric studies, because of their sophisticated nature, could increase the burden of participating in the merger oversight process.

The Carload Waybill Sample is a sample of railroad waybills (in general, documents prepared from bills of lading authorizing railroads to move shipments and collect freight charges) submitted by railroads annually. We used these data to obtain information on rail rates charged by different railroads for specific commodities in specific markets subject to potential reduction in competition in the UP/SP merger. We focused on this merger because it was identified by the Board as having significant competition-related issues, especially in the number of shippers potentially going from service by two railroads to service by only one railroad (called 2-to-1 shippers).", "Using documents submitted by the Union Pacific Railroad, as well as discussions with officials from both the Union Pacific Railroad and the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway, we identified those locations and corridors containing the majority of potential 2-to-1 shippers. Using economic areas defined by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, our analysis focused on those economic areas containing the majority of these potential 2-to-1 shippers. We used the Carload Waybill Sample instead of more specific data on rates for individual shippers because of the lack of sufficient premerger rate data from SP\u2019s operations. Although it is possible to get rates for 2-to-1 shippers from the Carload Waybill Sample, the sample is not designed for use in analyzing rates for specific shippers. However, the sample can be used to analyze rail rates within and between geographic areas. For these reasons, we used economic areas containing a majority of potential 2-to-1 points in conjunction with the Carload Waybill Sample to conduct our analysis. The rate data obtained from the Carload Waybill Sample were then used in an econometric model that analyzed the effects of the UP/SP merger on changes to rail rates for various commodity shipments to and from the economic areas with the majority of potential 2-to-1 shippers.

However, according to UP officials, the latter traffic substantially comprises shippers that are served solely by one railroad because they could be served in the premerger period only by UP or SP, but not both, and in the postmerger period, only by UP. The two broad types of shippers identified reflect different levels of rail competition. The potential 2-to-1 traffic (served by BNSF) is considered more competitive than the traffic served solely by UP because direct rail competition was preserved or maintained for the potential 2-to-1 shippers, while the traffic solely-served by UP had only indirect competition, which was preserved through build- in/build-out and new facilities conditions.", "Finally, because our study focuses on potential 2-to-1 shippers, we included only the commodity groups for which BNSF had presence.

TON had mixed results, meaning that larger shipment volumes sometimes resulted in higher or lower rates. DISTANCE generally decreased rates.
