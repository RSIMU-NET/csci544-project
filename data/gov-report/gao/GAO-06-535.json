Comparing data for fiscal years 2004 and 2006, overseas operations budgets have increased, with the largest percentage increases going to regional bureaus with significant Muslim populations. However, the number of authorized overseas positions in all regional bureaus increased slightly or not at all. As part of the Secretary of State's newly announced transformational diplomacy initiative, the department intends to reposition staff to better align with policy priorities. Since 2002, State has initiated three public diplomacy activities focused on the Muslim world--a media campaign, a youth-oriented magazine, and a group of youth-focused exchange programs--but these initiatives have been largely terminated or suspended. However, several exchange programs continue to target youth in the Muslim world. In addition, posts in the Muslim world use a range of standard programs and tools which the Under Secretary plans to supplement with several new initiatives. GAO's fieldwork revealed that posts' public diplomacy efforts generally lacked important strategic communication elements found in the private sector, which GAO and others have suggested adopting as a means to better communicate with target audiences. These elements include having core messages, segmented target audiences, in-depth research and analysis to monitor and evaluate results, and an integrated communication plan that brings all these elements together. These findings were reinforced by State's own post-level review. State established a new strategic framework for public diplomacy in fiscal year 2006, calling for, among other things, marginalizing extremists and demonstrating respect for Muslim cultures. However, posts have not been given written guidance on how to implement this strategy. Such guidance is a critical first step to developing in-depth communication plans in the field. Posts in the Muslim world face several challenges in implementing their public diplomacy programs, including the need to balance security with public outreach and concerns related to staff numbers and language capabilities. For example, we found that 30 percent of language designated public diplomacy positions in the Muslim world were filled by officers without the requisite language skills. State has begun to address many of these challenges, but it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of many of these efforts. Further, State lacks a systematic, comprehensive means of sharing best practices in public diplomacy, which could help transfer knowledge and experience across posts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, foreign public opinion polls  conducted by the State Department (State) and firms such as Zogby  International have shown that negative attitudes toward the United States  have generally grown worse in many countries around the world.

Lacking specifically targeted programs,  posts in Muslim-majority countries continue to use the same information  and exchange programs available to posts throughout the world. GAO and  others have suggested the adoption of private sector best practices as a  means to improve the department\u2019s communication efforts in Washington  and at the post level. These practices call for the use of central messages or  themes, target audience segmentation and analysis, in-depth audience  research and evaluation, and the preparation of detailed communication  plans to pull these various elements together. Communication efforts at the  posts we visited generally lacked these strategic elements. State has taken  several steps to address this problem, including the development of a  strategic framework with goals and tactics, the creation of a  transformational diplomacy initiative to implement some of these best  practices, and the issuance of updated guidance to improve fiscal year 2008  mission performance plans. These are all positive steps. However,  Washington still lacks written guidance to implement the strategic  framework developed by the current Under Secretary. In addition, posts  have not prepared in-depth analyses or detailed communication plans to  support their strategic communication decisions. Compounding this lack of  strategic planning and evaluation are challenges related to staffing and  security at posts in the Muslim world.
