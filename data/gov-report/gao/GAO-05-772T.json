However, the single-employer insurance program's long-term viability is in doubt, and this may have significant implications for the federal budget. In fiscal year 2004, PBGC's single-employer pension insurance program incurred a net loss of $12.1 billion, and the program's accumulated deficit increased to $23.3 billion. Further, PBGC has estimated that it is exposed to almost $100 billion of underfunding in plans sponsored by companies with credit ratings below investment grade.

Lower interest rates and equity prices since 2000 have increased the present value of pension liabilities and lowered the value of significant portions of pension plan assets. Meanwhile, PBGC is exposed to significant risk from underfunded plans in key industries at the same time that its revenue base is threatened by the long-term decline in defined benefit plan participation. In addition, the basic legal framework governing pension insurance and plan funding has failed to help ensure that plan sponsors deliver on their pension promises and safeguard the PBGC's financial condition. PBGC's current premium structure does not properly reflect the risks to its insurance program and facilitates moral hazard behavior by plan sponsors. Further, current pension funding rules have not provided sufficient incentives for plan sponsors to properly fund their benefit obligations. As a result, bankrupt plan sponsors, acting rationally and within the rules, have transferred the obligations of their large and significantly underfunded plans to PBGC. These weaknesses contribute to and are exacerbated by a lack of timely, accurate and transparent information that make it difficult for participants, investors, and others to have a clear understanding of the true financial condition of pension plans. Comprehensive reform is required to ensure that workers and retirees receive the benefits promised to them. Ideally, effective reform would (1) improve the accuracy of plan funding measures while minimizing complexity and maintaining contribution flexibility; (2) revise the current funding rules to create incentives for plan sponsors to adequately finance promised benefits; (3) develop a more risk-based PBGC insurance premium structure and provides incentives for sponsors to fund plans adequately; (4) address the issue of underfunded plans paying lump sums and granting benefit increases; (5) modify PBGC guarantees of certain plan benefits (6) resolve outstanding controversies concerning hybrid plans by safeguarding the benefits of workers regardless of age; and (7) improve plan information transparency for pension plan stakeholders without overburdening plan sponsors. Pension reform is only part of a broader fiscal, economic and retirement security challenge. Looking ahead in the federal budget, Social Security, together with Medicare and Medicaid, will dominate the federal government's future fiscal outlook. Reform should also be considered in the context of the problems currently facing our nation's Social Security system. Importantly, as is the case with Social Security, acting sooner rather than later will make comprehensive pension reform less costly and more feasible."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the problems and long-term  challenges facing the defined benefit (DB) pension system, the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the retirement security of workers  and retirees covered by DB plans, and American taxpayers. In particular, I  will discuss the factors contributing to those problems and suggest  elements of the comprehensive reform necessary to address them. As I  have noted before, these problems are a subset of the broader challenges  facing the federal government and our nation\u2019s retirement income system.  These programs, which include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,  represent large, growing, and unsustainable claims on the federal budget  because America\u2019s population is aging, life expectancies are increasing,  workforce growth is slowing, and health care costs are rising.", "The long-term effect of federal retirement programs on the budget is so  significant that neither slowing the growth of discretionary spending nor  allowing tax cuts to expire\u2014nor both options combined\u2014would by  themselves eliminate our long-term fiscal imbalance (see fig. 1). Therefore,  as we discussed in our 21st Century Challenges report, tough choices  need to be made about the appropriate role and size of the federal  government\u2014and how to finance that government\u2014and how to bring the  panoply of federal policies, programs, functions and activities into line  with the realities of today\u2019s world and tomorrow\u2019s challenges. More  specifically to federal retirement policy, we need to make choices about  how to promote current and long-term economic security in retirement. In  that latter context, comprehensively considering our citizens\u2019 needs for  income, health care, and long-term care is important.", "From our nation\u2019s overall fiscal perspective, continuing on our current  unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our  economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national security.", "Therefore, we must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax  policies and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and  ensure that our programs and priorities respond to emerging security,  social, economic and environmental changes and challenges.", "PBGC is an excellent example of the need for Congress to reconsider the  role of government programs, in general, and federal retirement programs,  in particular, in light of past changes and 21st century challenges. In 1974,  Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)  to respond to trends and challenges that existed at that time. Among other  things, ERISA established PBGC to pay the pension benefits of defined  benefit plan participants, subject to certain limits, in the event that an  employer could not. When ERISA was enacted, defined benefit pension  plans were the most common form of employer-sponsored private pension  and were growing both in number of plans and in number of participants.  Today, defined benefit pensions cover an ever-decreasing percentage of  the U.S. labor force, a fact that raises questions about federal policy on  pensions in general, and defined benefit plans and the PBGC, in particular.", "I would now like to outline the challenges facing the defined benefit  pension system and PBGC and suggest a framework for evaluating  potential policy responses. In summary, a combination of recent events,  long-term structural problems, and weaknesses in the legal framework  governing pensions has left PBGC with a significant long-term deficit and  many large plans badly underfunded. Lower interest rates and equity  prices since 2000 have combined to significantly increase pension  underfunding through an increase in the present value of pension  liabilities, and decreases in the value of pension plan assets. Meanwhile,  intense cost competition as a result of globalization and deregulation has  led to bankruptcies of plan sponsors in key industries like steel and  airlines, and is exposing PBGC to the risk of significant future losses in  these and other industries. This competitive restructuring has occurred  simultaneously with a long-term decline in defined benefit plan  participation that threatens PBGC\u2019s revenue base. In addition, the basic  legal framework governing pension insurance and plan funding has failed  to safeguard the benefit security of American workers and retirees and the  PBGC\u2019s financial condition. Too many companies are making pension  promises that they are not required to deliver on, in part because of  perverse incentives and \u201cput options\u201d created under the current pension  insurance system.", "PBGC\u2019s current premium structure does not properly reflect the risks to  its insurance program and facilitates moral hazard by plan sponsors.", "Further, as we have shown in a recent report, current pension funding  rules have not provided sufficient incentives, transparency, and  accountability mechanisms for plan sponsors to properly fund their  benefit obligations and deliver on their promises.

Both systems require meaningful,  comprehensive reform that restores solvency, assures sustainability, and  protects the benefits of participants. Similar to that of Social Security,  PBGC\u2019s current condition does not represent a crisis, though delaying  reform will result in serious adverse consequences for individuals, the  federal budget, and our economy. Furthermore, like Social Security, PBGC  has plenty of cash on hand today to pay benefits to participants in the  short term, but it faces large and growing unfunded obligations and  escalating cash flow deficits in the future.", "The termination of United Airlines\u2019 defined benefit pension plans is just  the latest in a recent series of large, underfunded plans taken over by  PBGC, and will not be the last.

At the end of fiscal year  2004, PBGC estimated that it was exposed to almost $100 billion of  underfunding in plans sponsored by companies with credit ratings below  investment grade. Though smaller in scale than Social Security, Medicare,  and Medicaid, PBGC\u2019s deficit threatens to worsen our government\u2019s long- term fiscal position. While PBGC is not explicitly backed by the full faith  and credit of the U.S. government, policymakers would undoubtedly face  intense pressure to provide PBGC the resources to continue paying earned  pension benefits to millions of retirees if PBGC were to become insolvent.", "In light of the intrinsic problems facing the defined benefit system,  meaningful and comprehensive reform will be needed to ensure that  workers and retirees receive the benefits promised to them and to secure  PBGC\u2019s financial future. At this time, the Administration, members of  Congress, and others have proposed reforms that seek to address many of  the problems facing PBGC and the defined benefit system.

Among other things, ERISA created the PBGC to  protect the benefits of plan participants in the event that plan sponsors  could not meet the benefit obligations under their plans. ERISA also  established rules for funding defined benefit pension plans, instituted  pension insurance premiums, promulgated certain fiduciary rules, and  developed annual reporting requirements. When a plan is terminated with  insufficient assets to pay its guaranteed benefits, PBGC takes over the plan  and assumes responsibility for paying benefits to participants. According  to PBGC\u2019s 2004 annual report, PBGC provides insurance protection for  over 29,000 single-employer pension plans, which cover 34.6 million  workers, retirees, and their beneficiaries.", "PBGC receives no direct federal tax dollars to support the single-employer  pension insurance program. Instead, the program receives the assets of  terminated underfunded plans and any of the sponsor\u2019s assets that PBGC  recovers during bankruptcy proceedings. PBGC finances the unfunded  liabilities of terminated plans with premiums paid by plan sponsors and  income earned from the investment of program assets. Premiums have  two components: a per participant charge paid by all sponsors (currently  $19 per participant), and a variable-rate premium that some underfunded  plans pay based on the level of unfunded benefits.", "The single-employer program has had an accumulated deficit\u2014that is,  program assets have been less than the present value of benefits and other  obligations\u2014for much of its existence. (See fig. 2.) In fiscal year 1996, the  program had its first accumulated surplus, and by fiscal year 2000, the  accumulated surplus had increased to about $10 billion, in 2002 dollars.  However, the program\u2019s finances reversed direction in 2001, and at the end  of fiscal year 2002, its accumulated deficit was about $3.6 billion. In fiscal  year 2004, the single-employer program incurred a net loss of $12.1 billion,  and its accumulated deficit increased to $23.3 billion, up from $11.2 billion  a year earlier. Furthermore, PBGC estimated that total underfunding in  single-employer plans exceeded $450 billion, as of the end of fiscal year  2004.", "In defined benefit plans, formulas set by the employer determine employee  benefits. DB plan formulas vary widely, but benefits are frequently based  on participant earnings and years of service, and traditionally paid upon  retirement as a lifetime annuity, or periodic payments until death. Because  DB plans promise to make payments in the future, and because tax- qualified DB plans must be funded, employers must use present value  calculations to estimate the current value of promised benefits. The  calculations require making assumptions about factors that affect the  amount and timing of benefit payments, such as an employee\u2019s retirement  age and expected mortality, and about the expected return on plan assets,  expressed in the form of an interest rate. The present value of accrued  benefits calculated using mandated assumptions is known as a plan\u2019s  current liability. Current liability provides an estimate of the amount of  assets a plan needs today to pay for accrued benefits.", "ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) prescribe rules regarding the  assumptions that sponsors must use to measure plan liabilities and assets.  While different assumptions will change a plan\u2019s reported assets and  liabilities, sponsors eventually must pay the amount of benefits promised;  if the assumptions used to compute current liability differ from the plan\u2019s  actual experience, current liability will differ from the amount of assets  actually needed to pay benefits.", "Funding rules generally presume that a pension plan and its sponsor are  ongoing entities, and plans do not necessarily have to maintain an asset  level equal to current liabilities every year. However, the funding rules  include certain mechanisms that are intended to keep plans from  becoming too underfunded. One such mechanism is the additional funding  charge (AFC), which applies to plans with more than 100 participants.  The AFC requires plan sponsors to make additional contributions to plans  that fall below a prescribed funding level. With some exceptions, plans  with reported asset values below 90 percent of current liabilities are  affected by the AFC rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC\u2019S Problems Stem from Recent Events, Long-Term Structural Trends, and Weaknesses in the Legal Framework Governing DB Pensions", "paragraphs": ["A combination of recent events, long-term structural problems, and  weaknesses in the legal framework governing the DB system has left  PBGC with a significant long-term deficit and many large plans badly  underfunded.

Poor investment returns from stock market declines affected  the asset values of pension plans to the extent that plans invested in  stocks. According to the ERISA Industry Committee, assets in private  sector defined benefit plans totaled $2.056 trillion at the end of 1999,  dropped to $1.531 trillion at the end of 2002, and climbed back to  $1.8 trillion by the end of 2004. Lower equity values since the end of 1999  have been particularly problematic because interest rates have also  declined and thus increased the present value of plan liabilities. Some  sponsors of large pension plans that were terminated were not in  sufficiently strong financial condition to meet their pension funding  requirements because of weaknesses in their primary business activities.

A  potentially exacerbating risk to PBGC is the cumulative effect of  bankruptcy in these industries: if a critical mass of firms go bankrupt and  terminate their underfunded pension plans, their competitors may also  declare bankruptcy to similarly avoid the cost of funding their plans.", "PBGC also faces the possibility of long-term revenue declines from  demographic changes in the population of defined benefit plan  participants and a shrinking number of DB plans. Over the long term, an  aging population of defined benefit plan participants threatens to reduce  PBGC\u2019s ability to raise premium revenues as participants die and are not  replaced by enough new participants. The percentage of participants who  are active workers has declined from 78 percent in 1980 to just under 50  percent in 2002. Furthermore, PBGC cannot effectively diversify its risk  from the terminations of plans in declining economic sectors because  companies in other growing industries have generally not sponsored new  defined benefit plans. As plan sponsors in weak industries go bankrupt  and terminate their pension plans, PBGC not only faces immediate  changes in its financial position from taking over underfunded plans, but  also faces losses of future revenues from these terminated plans.", "A related factor eroding PBGC\u2019s premium base is the growth of lump-sum  pension distributions. More and more plan participants are exiting the  defined benefit system by taking lump-sum distributions from their plans.  After a lump-sum distribution is paid, the participant is out of the defined  benefit system and the plan sponsor no longer has to contribute to the  pension insurance system on the participant\u2019s behalf. In addition, lump- sum distributions to participants in underfunded plans can create the  effect of a \u201crun on the bank\u201d and worsen a plan\u2019s underfunding. In such  cases, the plan may terminate without enough assets to pay full benefits to  other participants and PBGC may incur losses.", "The increasing prevalence of lump-sum distributions in defined benefit  plans and the growth of defined contribution plans also raise significant  questions about whether many Americans will enjoy an economically  secure retirement.

PBGC also charges plans a  variable-rate premium based on the plan\u2019s level of underfunding. However,  these premiums do not consider other relevant risk factors, such as the  economic strength of the sponsor, plan asset investment strategies, the  plan\u2019s benefit structure, or the plan\u2019s demographic profile.

Similarly, PBGC may face risk from  insuring plans concentrated in vulnerable industries affected by certain  macroeconomic forces such as deregulation and globalization that have  played a role in multiple bankruptcies over a short time period, as has  happened recently in the airline and steel industries. One study estimates  that the overall premiums collected by PBGC amount to about 50 percent  of what a private insurer would charge because its premiums do not  adequately account for these market risks.

However, since that time,  some firms with underfunded pension plans may have come to view PBGC  coverage as a fallback, or \u201cput option,\u201d for financial assistance. The very  presence of PBGC insurance may create certain perverse incentives that  represent what economists call moral hazard\u2014where struggling plan  sponsors may place other financial priorities above funding up their  pension plans because they know PBGC will pay guaranteed benefits.  Firms may even have an incentive to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order  to escape their pension obligations. As a result, once a plan sponsor with  an underfunded pension plan experiences financial difficulty, these moral  hazard incentives may exacerbate the funding shortfall for PBGC.", "This moral hazard effect has the potential to escalate, with the initial  bankruptcy of firms with underfunded plans creating a vicious cycle of  bankruptcies and terminations. Firms with onerous pension obligations  and strained finances could see PBGC as a means of shedding these  liabilities, thereby providing these companies with a competitive  advantage over other firms that deliver on their pension commitments.  This would also potentially subject PBGC to a series of terminations of  underfunded plans in the same industry, as we have already seen with the  steel and airlines industries in the past 20 years.", "Moral hazard effects are likely amplified by current pension funding and  pension accounting rules that may also encourage plans to invest in riskier  assets to benefit from higher expected long-term rates of return. In  determining funding requirements, a higher expected rate of return on  pension assets means that the plan needs to hold fewer assets in order to  meet its future benefit obligations. And under current accounting rules,  the greater the expected rate of return on plan assets, the greater the plan  sponsor\u2019s operating earnings and net income. However, with higher  expected rates of return comes greater risk of investment volatility, which  is not reflected in the pension insurance program\u2019s premium structure.  Investments in riskier assets with higher expected rates of return may  allow financially weak plan sponsors and their plan participants to benefit  from the upside of large positive returns on pension plan assets without  being truly exposed to the risk of losses.

Also, actuarial asset values may have  differed by as much as 20 percent from current market value of plan  assets. The funding rules allow for smoothing out year-to-year fluctuations  in asset and liability values so that plan sponsors are gradually, and not  suddenly, affected by significant changes in interest rates and the values of  their assets. When current interest rates decline, the use of a 4-year  weighted average interest rate lags behind, and thus measurements of the  present value of plan liabilities do not accurately reflect the cost of settling  a plan\u2019s benefit obligations.", "The terminations of the Bethlehem Steel and LTV Steel pension plans in  2002 (two of the largest plan terminations, to date) illustrate the potential  discrepancies between reported and actual funding. In 2002, the  Bethlehem Steel Corporation reported that its plan was 85.2 percent  funded on a current liability basis, yet the plan terminated later that year  with assets of less than half of the value of promised benefits. In 2001, LTV  Steel reported that its plan for hourly employees was 80 percent funded,  yet when the plan terminated in March 2002, it was only 52 percent  funded.

This minimum contribution requirement may be met by the plan  sponsor putting cash into the plan or by applying earned funding credits.

Annual cash contributions for the 100 largest plans averaged  approximately $97 million on plans averaging $5.3 billion in current  liabilities (in 2002 dollars). This average contribution level masks a large  difference in contributions between 1995 and 2001, during which period  annual contributions averaged $62 million (in 2002 dollars), and in 2002,  when contributions increased significantly to $395 million per plan.  Further, in 6 of the 8 years in our sample, a majority of the largest plans  made no cash contribution to their plan.

From 1995 to  2002, an average of only 2.9 of the 100 largest DB plans each year were  assessed an additional funding charge, even though on average 10  percent of plans each year reported funding levels below 90 percent.  Over the entire 8-year period, only 6 unique plans that were among the  100 largest plans in any year from 1995 to 2002 owed an AFC. These 6  plans owed an AFC during the period a total of 23 times in years in  which they were among the 100 largest plans, meaning that plans that  were assessed an AFC were likely to owe it again.  2.  AFC rules also specify a current liability calculation method that may  overstate actual plan funding, relative to market-value measures,  thereby reducing the number of plans that might be assessed an AFC.  The specified interest rate for this calculation exceeded current  market rates in 98 percent of the months between 1995 and 2002.  3.  The AFC rules generally call for sponsors to pay only a percentage of  their unfunded liability, rather than requiring restoration of full  funding. On average, by the time a plan was assessed an AFC, it was  significantly underfunded and was likely to remain chronically  underfunded in subsequent years. Among the 6 plans that owed the  AFC, funding levels rose slightly from an average of 75 percent when  the plan was first assessed an AFC to an average of 76 percent, looking  collectively at all subsequent years. All of these plans were assessed an  AFC more than once.  4.  Plan sponsors can meet the AFC requirement by applying funding  credits earned in prior years in place of cash contributions. The  account value of these credits, which accumulate interest, may not  reflect the underlying value of the assets in the plan. Many plans  experienced significant market value losses of their assets between  2000 and 2002 while they were able to apply these funding credits.  Among the 100 largest plans, just over 30 percent of the time a plan  was assessed an AFC, the funding rules allowed the sponsor to forgo a  cash contribution altogether that year.", "The experience of two large terminated plans illustrates the  ineffectiveness of the AFC. For example, Bethlehem Steel\u2019s plan was  assessed an AFC of $181 million in 2002, but the company made no cash  contribution that year, just as it had not in 2000 or 2001, years in which the  plan was not assessed an AFC. When the plan terminated in late 2002, its  assets covered less than half of the $7 billion in promised benefits. LTV  Steel, which terminated its pension plan for hourly employees in 2002 with  assets of $1.6 billion below the value of benefits, had its plan assessed an  AFC each year from 2000 to 2002, but for only $2 million, $73 million, and  $79 million, or no more than 5 percent of the eventual funding shortfall.  Despite these AFC assessments, LTV Steel made no cash contributions to  its plan from 2000 to 2002. Both plans were able to apply existing credits  instead of cash to satisfy minimum funding requirements. In addition, both  sponsors had unused funding credits at the time their plans were  terminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Funding Rules Amplified by Lack of Transparency Hinders Sound Policy making", "paragraphs": ["Unclear measures of pension funding and a lack of timely information  have made it difficult for plan participants, investors, regulators, and  policy makers to accurately assess the financial condition of pension  plans. Without timely and reasonably accurate data about the financial  condition of pension plans, the various stakeholders cannot make timely  and informed decisions on retirement savings, employment, and other key  life issues. The primary regulatory filing for pension plans\u2014the Form  5500--requires multiple measures of pension assets and liabilities, yet none  of these measures tell PBGC and plan participants what share of the  benefit obligations are funded in the event of plan termination.  Furthermore, by the time these regulatory reports are publicly available,  the information is usually at least 2 years old. In a time of significant  changes in interest rates and equity prices, it is possible that reported  measures of pension funding will substantially differ from current  measures of plan funding. PBGC does receive more current information  about plans that are underfunded by at least $50 million. This more current  information includes estimates of funding measures if the plan were to be  terminated; however, by law this information is not disclosed to the  public.", "Our cash-based budgetary framework for federal insurance programs also  contributes to a lack of transparency that, at worst, may create  disincentives for policy makers to enact reform measures. With the  current cash-based reporting, premiums for insurance programs are  recorded in the budget when collected, and outlays are reported when  claims are paid. This focus on annual cash flows generally does not  adequately reflect the government\u2019s cost for federal insurance programs  because the time between the extension of the insurance, the receipt of  premiums and other collections, the occurrence of an insured event, and  the payment of claims may extend over several budget periods. As a result,  the government\u2019s cost may be understated in years that a program\u2019s  current premium and other collections exceed current payments and  overstated in years that current claim payments exceed current  collections. This is especially problematic in the case of pension insurance  because of the erratic occurrence of plan terminations as well as the  mismatch between premium collections and benefit payments that can  extend over several decades.", "Cash-based budgeting also may not be a very accurate gauge of the  economic impact of federal insurance programs. Although discerning the  economic impact of federal insurance programs can be difficult, private  economic behavior generally is affected when the government commits to  providing insurance coverage. In the case of PBGC, the existence of  pension insurance may encourage plan sponsors and employees to agree  to pension benefit increases in lieu of wage increases when the plan  sponsor faces economic difficulties.", "Cash-based budgeting for federal insurance programs may provide neither  the information nor incentives necessary to signal emerging problems,  make adequate cost comparisons, control costs, or ensure the availability  of resources to pay future claims. Because the cash-based budget delays  recognition of emerging problems, it may not provide policy makers with  information or incentives to address potential funding shortfalls before  claim payments come due. Policy makers may not be alerted to the need to  address programmatic design issues because, in most cases, the budget  does not encourage them to consider the future costs of federal insurance  commitments. Thus, reforms aimed at reducing costs may be delayed. In  most cases, by the time costs are recorded in the budget, policy makers do  not have time to ensure that adequate resources are accumulated to pay  for them or to take actions to control them. The late budget recognition of  these costs can reduce the number of viable options available to policy  makers, ultimately increasing the cost to the government."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Retirement Income Security Requires Meaningful and Comprehensive Reform", "paragraphs": ["In light of the intrinsic problems facing the defined benefit system,  meaningful and comprehensive pension reform is required to ensure that  workers and retirees receive the benefits promised to them and to secure  PBGC\u2019s financial future.

In addition to debating changes to  the funding rules and PBGC premiums, participants also talked about  ways to address pension legacy costs (the costs of terminated and  underfunded pension plans) and features of pension plans that  government policy should encourage.", "According to participants in the GAO forum, resolution of pension legacy  costs and clarification of the legal status of cash balance and other hybrid  pension plans could play a significant role in shoring up the defined  benefit system. Separating legacy costs from the existing and future  liabilities of the remaining defined benefit plans might encourage plan  sponsors to remain in the defined benefit system. Many plan sponsors are  concerned that through increased PBGC premiums, they may be required  to pay for the failures of other companies to responsibly fund and manage  their pension plans. Some participants added that resolving legacy costs  could be a key component of any pension reform legislation that tightened  the funding rules and assessed premiums according to PBGC\u2019s risk. Also,  some participants supported, and other participants opposed, the idea of  separately addressing the pension legacy costs of specific industries, such  as airlines and steel, which have imposed the most significant costs on  PBGC. Separately addressing pension legacy costs does not necessarily  imply a taxpayer bailout, as some participants suggested other ways to  cover their cost, such as through an airline ticket fee to cover the airlines\u2019  share of PBGC\u2019s deficit. Others noted that resolving the uncertain legal  status of cash balance and other hybrid pension plans could encourage  greater participation in the defined benefit system. Expanding the universe  of pension plan sponsors could lead to an increase in PBGC\u2019s premium  income.", "Some forum participants also suggested that the debate over federal  retirement policy needs to move beyond distinctions between defined  benefit and defined contribution plans. Others added that discussions of  retirement policy need to focus on ways to create incentives and remove  barriers for employers to set up retirement plans, and how to get American  workers to build adequate retirement savings and security. This may be  achieved by thinking about the interaction of private pensions and Social  Security and by looking at hybrid pension plans, such as cash balance  plans and plans that combine the best features of defined benefit and  defined contribution plans. Participants suggested new pension plan  designs be developed that explore the following features:    allowing automatic participation of the covered population in order to  expand pension coverage generally; improving the portability of pension benefits to accommodate workers  who frequently change jobs;   providing for professional money management and pooled investment    minimizing early withdrawals and borrowing\u2014a problem known as  leakage\u2014from retirement savings; and   providing incentives to receive benefits in the form of a fixed annuity,  rather than a lump-sum distribution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Widely reported recent large plan terminations by bankrupt sponsors and  the resulting adverse consequences for plan participants and the PBGC  have pushed pension reform into the spotlight of national concern.

If you look ahead in the federal budget,  Social Security, together with the rapidly growing health programs  (Medicare and Medicaid), will dominate the federal government\u2019s future  fiscal outlook. These are far larger and more urgent challenges,  representing an unsustainable burden on future generations. Furthermore,  pension reform should be considered in the context of the problems facing  our nation's Social Security system.  How we reform DB pensions has  crucial implications for directions taken in reforming Social Security. For  example, pension reforms that reduce the scope of the private pension  system or change the dominant form of private pension design may have  consequences for those elements of Social Security reform packages that  reduce benefits or include an individual accounts feature.", "This also means that acting sooner rather than later will make reform less  costly and more feasible. Though smaller in scale than actuarial deficits in  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, PBGC\u2019s deficit threatens to  worsen our government\u2019s long-term fiscal position. Finally, as with Social  Security, it is also important to evaluate pension reform proposals as  comprehensive packages. The elements of any reform proposal interact;  every package will have pluses and minuses, and no plan will satisfy  everyone on all dimensions. If we focus on the pros and cons of each  element of reform by itself, we may find it impossible to build the bridges  necessary to achieve consensus.", "We look forward to working with Congress on these crucial issues.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
