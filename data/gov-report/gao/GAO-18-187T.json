To inform this work, FirstNet is consulting with a variety of stakeholders. In March 2017, FirstNet awarded a 25-year contract to AT&T to build, operate, and maintain the network. FirstNet's oversight of AT&T's performance is important given the scope of the network and the duration of the contract.", "This testimony provides information on (1) FirstNet's efforts to establish the network; (2) stakeholder views on network reliability, security, and interoperability challenges FirstNet faces and its efforts to address them; and (3) FirstNet's plans to oversee its network contractor. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report ( GAO-17-569 ). For this report, GAO reviewed FirstNet documentation, key contract oversight practices identified in federal regulations and other sources, tribal communication practices identified by federal agencies, and assessed FirstNet's efforts and plans against these practices. GAO also interviewed FirstNet officials and a nongeneralizable selection of public safety, tribal, and other stakeholders selected to obtain a variety of viewpoints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In June 2017, GAO reported that the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) had conducted key efforts to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal (RFP) for the network and awarding the network contract to AT&T. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network. Additionally, FirstNet consulted with state and local, federal, and tribal stakeholders. State officials GAO contacted were generally satisfied with FirstNet's efforts to engage them. However, tribal stakeholders GAO contacted expressed concern that FirstNet has not fully engaged in effective communication with tribes. FirstNet engaged tribes through a variety of mechanisms, such as through state points of contact and a working group, but tribes noted that individuals with first-hand knowledge of tribes' experiences are unable to represent tribal views directly among FirstNet's key decision makers. Although FirstNet is required to consult with tribes through state points of contact, a key principle of effective tribal communication is to seek full understanding of tribal concerns and reach consensus where possible. By fully exploring and proposing actions to address tribal stakeholders' concerns, FirstNet could help improve its relations with tribes and better meet stakeholders' needs.", "According to stakeholders GAO contacted, FirstNet faces various challenges to ensure the network's reliability, security, and interoperability. For example, stakeholders raised concerns related to:", "providing coverage to rural areas, in buildings, or underground;", "ensuring the network's overall resiliency and cybersecurity; and", "managing frameworks for user identity, credentialing of users, access management, and prioritization of users on the network.", "FirstNet has taken action to address these challenges, such as by opening a test lab to test public safety devices and applications before deploying them on the network. The majority of stakeholders GAO contacted were satisfied with FirstNet's efforts but many noted that much uncertainty remains about how the network will be implemented.", "FirstNet established offices to oversee its network contractor, developed policies and procedures to guide contract administration\u2014including management and oversight\u2014and is receiving assistance from another federal agency with contract administration experience, although FirstNet plans to assume full responsibility in the future. For example, FirstNet established the Network Program Office to oversee the contractor's performance and facilitate quality assurance of contract deliverables, among other things. Although this office will perform essential contract-administration functions, FirstNet had not conducted long-term projections of staffing needs for the office as of April 2017. As a result, FirstNet lacks reasonable assurance that it will have sufficient resources to handle increases in its responsibilities over time. Planning for and assigning adequate resources, including people, and assessing resource needs is a key practice for planning and executing effective contract oversight. By performing a long-term staffing assessment for the Network Program Office, FirstNet would be in a better position to fully understand its staffing needs and respond to staffing changes and risks as it assumes full responsibility of contract administration in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In June 2017, GAO recommended that FirstNet fully explore tribal stakeholders' concerns and assess its long-term staffing needs. FirstNet agreed with GAO's recommendations and described actions to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our June 2017 report on the First  Responder Network Authority (FirstNet). We have previously reported  and testified on FirstNet, including most recently in a July 2017 hearing  held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation\u2019s Subcommittee on Communications, Technology,  Innovation, and the Internet. Whether conducting daily operations,  overseeing planned events, or responding to emergencies, public safety  officials\u2014especially first responders such as police officers and  firefighters\u2014rely on communications systems to gather and share  information and coordinate their efforts. However, first responders often  have difficulty communicating with their counterparts in other agencies  and jurisdictions because existing systems lack interoperability.", "The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act)  created FirstNet and required it to establish a nationwide, interoperable  public-safety broadband network (hereafter, the network)\u2014setting aside  spectrum for the network to operate on and providing FirstNet with $7  billion to fund the network\u2019s initial build-out. FirstNet must be self-funding  beyond this initial $7 billion. Key to the network\u2019s success, given its  purpose, is its reliability, security, and interoperability. To inform its work,  FirstNet must consult with state and local, federal, and tribal  stakeholders. Since 2012, FirstNet has completed a number of tasks to  plan for the build-out of the network, the most significant of which was the  issuance of a request for proposal to solicit proposals from private  companies to build, operate, and maintain the network. From these  proposals, FirstNet selected AT&T as its network contractor and awarded  it a multi-billion dollar, 25-year contract. Due to the size of the project and  duration of the contract, the oversight mechanisms that FirstNet plans to  use to monitor AT&T\u2019s progress and performance in building, operating,  and maintaining the network are important.", "My remarks today are based on our June 2017 report and like the report,  addresses (1) FirstNet\u2019s efforts to establish and finance the network; (2)  stakeholder views on network reliability, security, and interoperability  challenges FirstNet faces and its research and other efforts to address  them; and (3) FirstNet\u2019s plans to oversee the deployment of the network  by its network contractor. In our report, we recommended that FirstNet  fully explore tribal stakeholders\u2019 concerns and assess its long-term  staffing needs. FirstNet agreed with these recommendations and, in  September 2017, reported to us on the actions it has taken to implement  them.", "For our report, we reviewed the 2012 Act, FirstNet documentation, and  documentation from other federal entities involved in FirstNet\u2019s efforts,  such as FirstNet\u2019s key research partner, the Public Safety  Communications Research (PSCR) program. We compared FirstNet\u2019s  efforts to respond to tribal stakeholders\u2019 concerns with the applicable key  principle of effective tribal communication on federal infrastructure  decisions developed by several federal agencies. We assessed the  PSCR\u2019s and FirstNet\u2019s research activities against our previously identified  criteria on key phases of sound research programs. We assessed  FirstNet\u2019s contract oversight plans against key acquisition and contract  oversight practices and actions established in federal acquisition  regulations, the Department of Commerce\u2019s (Commerce) acquisition  manual, prior GAO reports, and other academic and industry sources.  We also interviewed FirstNet and Commerce officials. To obtain  stakeholder views on all our objectives\u2014particularly the challenges  FirstNet faces\u2014we selected and contacted 33 stakeholders, including  public safety, state and local government, and tribal associations and  organizations; the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal  Communications Commission, and the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) and the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration; and state government and public safety  officials. We selected these stakeholders to obtain a variety of viewpoints  from a cross section of interests and geographic locations; their views are  not generalizable. Further details on our scope and methodology are  included in our report. The work on which this statement is based was  conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FirstNet\u2019s Progress Establishing and Financing the Network and Consulting Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["In our June 2017 report, we found that FirstNet has conducted key efforts  to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal for the  network in January 2016 and awarding the network contract to AT&T in  March 2017. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall  design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network,  as well as the marketing, product management, sales, distribution, and  customer care. Further, we found that FirstNet has established a  framework to meet the financial requirements established in the 2012 Act,  as depicted in figure 1. This framework focuses on leveraging FirstNet\u2019s  spectrum through the use of payments and fees with the aim of ensuring  that the network is financially sustainable over the life of the contract and  that FirstNet sustains self-funding operations.", "By establishing a single, dedicated network for public safety use,  FirstNet\u2019s network is expected to foster greater interoperability and meet  public safety officials\u2019 reliability and other needs. However, the actual use  (or \u201cadoption\u201d) of the network by public safety users will be voluntary.  Thus, even with the establishment of this framework, substantial  unknowns remain regarding how many public safety users will adopt the  network, the extent to which AT&T will be successful in monetizing the  spectrum to retain revenue from commercial users, and the extent to  which this revenue will be sufficient or appropriate in relation to the capital  needed to build, operate, and maintain the network. Therefore, we noted  that, at the time of our report, we could not assess the viability of this  framework and whether FirstNet\u2019s structures for overseeing the  contractor\u2019s use of the spectrum for commercial users will be appropriate.", "We also found that FirstNet has made progress consulting with state and  local, federal, and tribal stakeholders through a variety of mechanisms.  State officials we contacted were generally satisfied with FirstNet\u2019s efforts  to engage them. However, tribal stakeholders we contacted expressed  concern with FirstNet\u2019s efforts to consult with tribes per the 2012 Act\u2019s  requirements. In particular, four of the five tribal organizations we  contacted said that FirstNet has not fully engaged in effective  communication or has relied on state points of contact too much as  opposed to engaging directly with tribes; the other tribal organization was  not aware of FirstNet or its mission at all. Further, tribes noted that  individuals with first-hand knowledge of tribes\u2019 experiences are not able to  represent tribal views directly among FirstNet\u2019s key decision makers.  FirstNet has stated that, indeed, the 2012 Act requires that it consult with  tribes through state points of contact. Nevertheless, several federal  agencies have identified seeking a full understanding of tribal concerns\u2014 and reaching consensus where possible\u2014as a key principle of effective  tribal communication, noting that agencies should adapt to changing  circumstances, contemplate creative problem solving, identify options for  addressing concerns, and exhaust alternatives to achieve mutually  agreeable solutions.", "We concluded that, by fully exploring and proposing actions to address  tribal stakeholders\u2019 concerns, FirstNet could help improve its relations  with tribes and better meet stakeholders\u2019 needs. As such, we  recommended in our report that FirstNet fully explore tribal concerns and  propose actions, as needed, to address those concerns. FirstNet agreed  with this recommendation and, in September 2017, described to us the  actions it has taken to implement it. For example, according to FirstNet, in  September 2017 it began a process to formally explore the tribal outreach  concerns raised in our report and expects to propose improvements by  the end of this year. FirstNet has also said that it adopted an  organization-wide tribal consultation policy which it expects to take effect  towards the end of this year. If implemented as planned, these actions  should address the intent of the recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FirstNet\u2019s Network Reliability, Security, and Interoperability Challenges and Efforts to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["In our report, we found that\u2014according to stakeholders we contacted\u2014 FirstNet faces various challenges to ensure the network\u2019s reliability,  security, and interoperability.

For example, in November 2016, FirstNet opened an  Innovation and Test Lab at its technical headquarters in Boulder,  Colorado. According to FirstNet documentation, FirstNet plans to use\u2014 and allow AT&T to use\u2014the lab to test public safety devices and  applications before deploying them on the network. Additionally, the  PSCR has conducted research on behalf of FirstNet and, using $300  million in funds provided to NIST by the 2012 Act, is also planning for and  implementing other research activities to support FirstNet. For instance, in  January 2016, PSCR launched its Public Safety Innovation Accelerator  Program to support these research activities, and in December 2016,  NIST issued a funding announcement to fund research in several areas.", "At the time of our report, we found that PSCR\u2019s research process  generally aligned with key phases of sound research programs identified  by leading national organizations, including the American Evaluation  Association and the National Academy of Sciences. For example,  PSCR has established a structured process for developing research  priorities that includes both internal and external stakeholders, and has  identified criteria it uses to help it select the research areas to fund and  procedures to help it guide and monitor its research. Similarly, FirstNet  has determined its research priorities to date based on its network- planning needs and in consultation with internal and external  stakeholders, and worked with the PSCR to define criteria to help it select  research areas.", "Further, we found that the majority of stakeholders we contacted were  satisfied with the planning efforts to ensure the reliability, security, and  interoperability of the network. However, many stakeholders also said that  there is much remaining uncertainty about how this will be implemented in  practice. Additionally, one public safety official we contacted told us that  FirstNet and its contractor will have to balance the costs associated with  implementing features that make the network reliable and secure with the  need to establish compelling and competitively priced service packages  and fees that will encourage user adoption of the network. Indeed,  numerous stakeholders we contacted cited the cost of subscribing to the  network as a key factor affecting user adoption, noting that the pricing  must be comparable to what they pay for commercial service now, that  budgets are constrained in the public safety community, or that local  governments do not want costs to increase. Further, commercial carriers  could choose to compete with FirstNet. FirstNet has stated that it expects  AT&T to provide services at a competitive price and deliver affordable,  high-quality services that will encourage public safety users to adopt the  network. Ultimately\u2014because the network must be self-funding and  FirstNet has stated that revenue from network users will be critical to this  funding\u2014the success of the network depends on whether FirstNet and  AT&T generate enough revenue to operate it over the long term and  whether public safety users adopt it, no matter how reliable and secure it  is."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FirstNet\u2019s Contract Oversight Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["FirstNet must manage and oversee the implementation of the network  contract to build, operate, and maintain the network. Federal internal- control standards also state that an entity\u2019s management retains  responsibility for the performance of processes assigned to service  organizations (such as contractors) and that management should hold  these organizations accountable for their performance.", "In our report, we found that FirstNet has taken a number of steps to  establish contract oversight mechanisms, but has not fully assessed the  staffing needs of its oversight workforce. FirstNet\u2019s oversight mechanisms  include developing policies and procedures to guide contract  administration and establishing offices to oversee its network contractor.  In particular, FirstNet established the Network Program Office to oversee  the contractor\u2019s performance and facilitate quality assurance of contract  deliverables, among other things. FirstNet is also receiving assistance  from the Department of the Interior, which has experience with contract  administration, although FirstNet plans to assume full responsibility for  contract administration in the future. We also found that FirstNet\u2019s efforts  to develop contract oversight mechanisms aligned with several key  actions that we identified as contributing to effective contract oversight.  However, although FirstNet\u2019s Network Program Office will perform  essential contract administration functions, FirstNet had not conducted  long-term projections of staffing needs for the office as of April 2017.  Planning for and assigning adequate resources, including people, and  performing an assessment of the resources needed to oversee projects is  one of the key actions we identified for planning and executing effective  contract oversight.", "We concluded that FirstNet lacks reasonable assurance that it will have  sufficient resources to handle increases in its responsibilities over time  and that, by performing a long-term staffing assessment for the Network  Program Office, FirstNet would be in a better position to fully understand  its staffing needs and respond to staffing changes and risks as it assumes  full responsibility of contract administration in the future. As such, we  recommended in our report that FirstNet assess the long-term staffing  needs in the Network Program Office prior to assuming full responsibility  for administering the network contract. FirstNet agreed with this  recommendation and, in September 2017, described the actions it has  taken to implement it. According to FirstNet, in August 2017 the Network  Program Office adopted a strategic workforce plan for fiscal years 2018 to  2022, which it expects to update annually. According to FirstNet, this plan  provides a comprehensive view of current and future human capital  needs required to support the implementation of the network and  identifies strategies the office will employ to fill gaps between current and  future needs, among other things.
