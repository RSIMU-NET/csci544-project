GAO determined that the agency completed actions for 11 of the recommendations and took actions for the remaining 8, with actions for 4 of these 8 requiring further improvement (see table). In addition, OPM did not consistently update completion dates for outstanding recommendations and did not validate corrective actions taken to ensure that the actions effectively addressed the recommendations.", "OPM also made progress in implementing information security policies and practices associated with selected government-wide initiatives and requirements. However, it did not fully implement all of the requirements. For example, OPM identified its high value assets, such as systems containing sensitive information that might be attractive to potential adversaries, but it did not encrypt stored data on one selected system and did not encrypt transmitted data on another. Until OPM completes implementation of government-wide requirements, its systems are at greater risk than they need be.", "OPM's procedures for overseeing the security of its contractor-operated systems did not ensure that controls were comprehensively tested. Although the agency has implemented elements of contractor oversight such as recording security assessment findings for contractor-operated systems in remediation plans, it did not ensure that system security assessments involved comprehensive testing. The agency requires information system security officers to conduct quality assurance reviews that include reviewing security assessments of contractor-operated systems; however, its policy did not include detailed guidance on how the reviews are to be conducted.
