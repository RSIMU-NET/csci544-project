The amount of raw milk produced is influenced by federal and state dairy programs that affect minimum prices processors of dairy products must pay farmers for raw milk. These programs were established because of concern that dairy farmers lack the market power to substantially influence the prices that they are paid for raw milk, compared with the market power of processors and manufacturers of dairy products and retailers that sell these products to consumers. Minimum prices are based on, and vary according to, how the raw milk is to be used; minimum prices set for raw milk to be used for making drinking milk (fluid milk) are higher than those for milk used for manufacturing cheese, butter, and other dairy products. About 70 percent of the raw milk produced in the United States is regulated under the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) federal milk marketing order program. Some states, such as California and Maine, and portions of other states are not covered by the federal program but instead by state programs.", "The 1996 farm bill established another pricing program\u2014the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact (NEDC)\u2014which is administered by a commission that sets a minimum price for raw milk to be used for and sold as fluid milk in the six New England states\u2014Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The NEDC works in conjunction with federal and state dairy programs to establish an alternative minimum price for raw milk to be used for and sold as fluid milk in the Compact states. When the monthly NEDC minimum price exceeds the federal marketing order or state minimum price, the NEDC price becomes the minimum price. When the monthly federal marketing order or state minimum price exceeds the NEDC price, the federal or state price becomes the relevant minimum price. The NEDC's minimum pricing requirement became effective in July 1997, when the Compact commission set $16.94 as the minimum price for a hundredweight of raw milk used for and sold as fluid milk. Since then, the NEDC's price has usually been higher than the federal price. Proponents of the NEDC assert that the Compact is necessary to ensure the continued viability of dairy farming in New England and, thus, an adequate local supply of fluid milk. However, opponents counter that the NEDC causes retail prices in the Compact states to increase, harming consumers in those states. They also counter that the NEDC leads to lower milk prices paid to dairy farmers in other regions, harming those farmers.", "Legislation authorizing the NEDC is scheduled to expire at the end of September 2001, and the Congress is currently considering proposed legislation that would not only reauthorize and expand the NEDC but also establish additional interstate dairy compacts. Consequently, you asked us to provide information on the potential economic impacts of different compact alternatives. Specifically, you asked for information on the intraregional impacts (that is, the impacts within the six NEDC states) of the NEDC on dairy sector indicators such as (1) retail milk prices, (2) milk producer income, (3) dairy farm structure, (4) milk production, and (5) milk consumption; the impact of the NEDC on the costs to the federal government of its milk price support and nutrition assistance programs; and the interregional impacts (that is, impacts on other milk-producing regions) of the current NEDC, an expanded NEDC, and an expanded NEDC in conjunction with a southern compact on selected farm-level and wholesale-level indicators, such as prices, production, and revenue.", "To address the first objective, we sought, but did not find, a comprehensive economic model to estimate the Compact\u2019s intraregional impacts while holding constant other factors that affect the indicators. Further, time and resource constraints limited our ability to develop our own model or series of models to address the Compact's impact on some or all of the indicators. As a result, we analyzed federal, state, and other data on these indicators, covering a period of time before and after the NEDC\u2019s minimum pricing requirement became effective, to determine any changes in historic trends. We also reviewed available studies regarding the NEDC\u2019s potential intraregional impacts on these indicators. For the second objective, we analyzed information from USDA, the NEDC commission, and the six NEDC states. To address the third objective, we used an interregional dairy competition model developed by economists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This economic model is useful for estimating the impacts of different dairy policy options, such as compacts, on such indicators as milk production, farm revenue, and wholesale commodity prices in various regions of the country. In employing this model, we used 1999 data on such indicators as milk production, demand, and prices because they were the most recent, final data available at the time of our review. Using preliminary data for 2000, we also conducted some limited modeling to estimate the impacts of compacts in that year. In addition, we consulted with leading dairy economists from across the country and USDA officials on our use of the model and related assumptions, such as how milk production and purchases of different dairy products respond to price changes. Finally, we reviewed available studies of the potential interregional impacts of dairy compacts. Appendix I provides more detail on our scope and methodology. Appendix II provides information on the University of Wisconsin-Madison dairy model and the related assumptions that we used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Of the approximately 167.7 billion pounds of raw milk produced in the United States in 2000, about 55.5 billion pounds were processed into fluid milk products\u2014such as whole, 2-percent, 1-percent, and skim milk; flavored milks; and buttermilk\u2014that yielded approximately $22 billion in retail sales. The rest of the raw milk was used to produce manufactured products, such as butter, cheese, ice cream, powdered milk, and yogurt. In the United States, a complex pricing system has evolved that affects prices paid for raw milk used to produce processed milk (fluid drinking milk) and manufactured dairy products, such as cheese and butter. Various milk regulators\u2014USDA, some states, and the Northeast Dairy Compact\u2014 establish minimum prices that must be paid for raw milk to help stabilize the milk supply. In addition to USDA, the states, and the NEDC, other entities affect milk prices, including cooperatives, which may provide services to farmers such as collecting farmers\u2019 milk; milk processors, which convert raw milk to fluid milk; manufacturers of dairy products; and retailers, which stock and sell dairy products to consumers. Each of these groups contributes to the value of fluid milk and dairy products sold at the retail level, and each receives a portion of the difference between the prices that farmers receive and the retail price."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal and State Dairy Programs", "paragraphs": ["USDA's milk marketing and milk price support programs, as well as some states' dairy programs, are intended to ensure an adequate supply of milk by establishing milk prices and other milk marketing rules, which, in turn, are intended to stabilize milk marketing conditions and thus assist individual farmers as well as consumers. In effect, these programs ensure that farm prices do not fall below a minimum level and provide a safety net for individual farmers who lack the market power of other entities, such as wholesale milk processors.", "Currently, about 70 percent of the milk produced in the United States is regulated under the federal milk marketing order program created in 1937 and administered by USDA. Under this program, on the basis of national dairy market information, USDA sets the minimum prices that must be paid by processors for raw fluid grade milk in specified marketing areas, or orders. These prices vary by the type of dairy product for which the milk is used; the minimum price for raw milk used for fluid drinking purposes also varies by location. Even though USDA sets minimum prices for raw milk, buyers of milk can and sometimes do pay farmers prices in excess of the established minimums\u2014prices known as \u201cover-order premiums.\u201d Market forces play a role in determining any such premiums.", "Under the federal milk marketing order program, USDA has a classified pricing system for setting minimum prices, on a monthly basis, for milk that is based upon its intended use, as shown in table 2. Federal milk marketing order class prices are determined by using product price formulas that compute milk component values based on wholesale dairy product prices. For example, Class III formulas use monthly average butter, cheese, and dry whey prices to determine values for butterfat, protein, and other solids, respectively. Class IV formulas use monthly average butter and nonfat dry milk prices to determine values for butterfat and nonfat solids, respectively. The Class II price is determined by adding an amount\u2014a Class II differential\u2014to the Class IV price, while the Class I price is determined by adding a Class I differential to the higher of the Class III or IV price. Class I prices can vary from one milk marketing order to another.", "Dairy farmers selling raw milk within a federal milk marketing order receive an average, or \u201cblend,\u201d price that is the weighted average of the prices of Class I through IV milk, with the weights determined by the amount of milk sold for each class of use in each marketing order. The average price farmers receive, therefore, depends in part on the extent to which the total raw milk supply in a specific order is used to make fluid milk as opposed to the three classes of manufactured products.", "Dairy farmers located in one milk marketing order sometimes ship their milk to another order to obtain a higher price. Depending on the amount of milk shipped, a producer may qualify for a receiving order\u2019s blend price. If the producer meets the receiving milk marketing order's blend price requirements, not only can the milk shipped qualify for the blend price\u2014 all of that producer's milk can qualify for the blend price. However, farmers must consider whether the cost of transporting a sufficient amount of milk to qualify for the receiving order's blend price outweighs the benefit of receiving a higher blend price.", "Some states, such as California, Maine, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, and  Virginia, have established their own minimum farm-level milk pricing programs that cover all or portions of their states. These states have established commissions or boards to perform functions similar to those of USDA. For example, Virginia\u2019s milk commission, created in 1934, establishes monthly producer prices to ensure dairy farmers an adequate return on their investment and to preserve market stability. Similarly, Nevada\u2019s dairy commission, established in 1955, sets minimum prices for raw milk sold to processing facilities located within that state.", "The federal milk price support program, established in 1949, also influences farm-level prices. This program supports farm-level prices by providing a standing offer from USDA to purchase butter, cheese, and nonfat dry milk at specified prices. The prices offered for these dairy products are intended to provide sufficient revenue so that dairy product manufacturers can pay farmers, on average, a legislatively mandated support price. This program is intended to make the support price a floor price for raw milk used for manufacturing purposes, and it is unlikely that manufactured product prices will fall below the floor for very long. Because the price for raw milk used for fluid purposes is based, in part, on the price of raw milk used for manufacturing purposes, the price support program influences the price that farmers receive for raw milk used for fluid purposes as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dairy Compacts", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the federal and state milk marketing order programs that set minimum milk prices, in 1996, the Congress authorized the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact for the six New England states. The Compact supplements the federal milk marketing order and state programs by setting the monthly minimum price to be paid for raw milk used for fluid milk marketed in the six-state area. In July 1997, the Compact set a minimum price of $16.94 per hundredweight for raw milk used for Class I, or fluid milk, and that minimum price has not changed. In months when the federally set minimum price for Class I milk for the Northeast Milk Marketing Order falls below the Compact price, the Compact price takes effect. In other months, when the federally set Class I price is higher than the Compact Class I price, the federally set Class I price takes effect. Since the Compact was established, federally set minimum prices for the area of the Compact that is subject to federal milk marketing regulation have ranged from $13.50 to $20.50 per hundredweight but have usually been below the Compact price of $16.94 per hundredweight.", "In those months when the Compact Class I price is higher than the federally set Class I price, processors having sales of fluid milk in the six NEDC states are required to pay a monthly over-order obligation per hundredweight equal to the difference between $16.94 and the federally set Class I price. Processors multiply the monthly over-order obligation by the volume of their total fluid milk sales in the six NEDC states in hundredweight by this difference and pay this amount to the commission that administers the Compact. After deducting administrative fees and other expenses, the commission distributes the balance of the proceeds in accordance with the amount of milk produced that was actually used for fluid milk, as opposed to cheese or other manufactured products. The commission makes disbursements to farmer cooperatives and milk handlers, located both within and outside the NEDC states, who then make individual payments to farmers based on their production. Thus, dairy farmers from other states, such as New York, that supply raw milk used to make fluid milk that is sold in the Compact states also benefit from the Compact\u2019s minimum prices.", "The 1996 farm bill provided the Compact with considerable flexibility to establish regulations to carry out its intended purpose. The legislation authorized the establishment of a commission composed of delegates from the six NEDC states to administer the Compact. The state delegates are appointed by each of their respective states and include farmer, milk processor, and consumer representatives. In addition to being empowered to establish Compact prices, the commission may investigate costs associated with producing and selling milk; examine the economic forces affecting producers, including trends in production, consumption, and the financial conditions of dairy farmers; and prepare and provide periodic reports to the states regarding its efforts. While the commission is required to report annually to USDA, USDA is not required to investigate or report on the commission\u2019s efforts.", "States in other regions of the country, including some southern states, are considering the adoption of similar compact arrangements. The proposed Dairy Consumers and Producers Protection Act, a bill that was introduced in the Congress in May 2001, if enacted, would reauthorize the NEDC. The bill would also allow additional states to enter the NEDC. In addition, it would establish a southern dairy compact consisting of 17 states, as well as a Pacific Northwest dairy compact and an Intermountain dairy compact, each consisting of 3 states. The proposed bill, like the 1996 farm bill, would provide the compact commissions with broad flexibility to carry out their objective of ensuring the continued viability of the dairy industry in their states. Therefore, it cannot be known in advance whether commissions for these new compacts would regulate milk pricing in their respective states in a manner similar to the way that the NEDC commission has regulated milk pricing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors Affecting Milk Prices", "paragraphs": ["In addition to federal and state programs and the NEDC, other entities affect prices paid for milk at the wholesale and retail levels. For example, about 83 percent of all raw milk produced in the United States is marketed through dairy cooperatives that are owned by farmer-members. Cooperatives perform services for their members and buyers of milk such as (1) transporting milk among different milk producing areas, (2) scheduling milk deliveries, (3) testing milk, and (4) paying members for their marketings. Costs for these services are paid by processors and dairy product manufacturers that purchase milk from the cooperatives at prices above federally specified minimum prices and then process or manufacture, package, and distribute fluid milk and manufactured dairy products to retailers. The costs that processors and manufacturers incur in purchasing raw milk from farmers or cooperatives and in processing or manufacturing, packaging, and distributing fluid milk and manufactured dairy products are included in prices charged to retailers for these products. Finally, the prices that retailers set for selling milk and dairy products are affected by the retailers\u2019 operating costs, such as labor, rent, and utilities; their strategies for pricing milk and manufactured dairy products; and the demand for those products."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Isolating the Intraregional Impacts of the NEDC Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Although dairy sector indicators that we examined changed after the NEDC\u2019s milk pricing regulations took effect in July 1997, it is difficult to determine how much of the change is attributable to the Compact. Such a determination is difficult because the Compact\u2019s impact on these indicators cannot be easily isolated from the effects of other factors. For example, while retail milk prices increased by 15 to 20 cents per gallon in July 1997, and there is general agreement that the Compact contributed to these increases, the lack of an economic model that fully accounts for the influences of other factors, such as costs for processing fluid milk, makes it difficult to determine how much of that price increase can be attributed to the NEDC. Similarly, while the Compact has resulted in payments being made to dairy farmers that reflect the difference between USDA\u2019s marketing order minimum prices and the NEDC\u2019s minimum price, it is difficult to determine whether some portion or all of these payments would have been made to dairy farmers anyway, depending on market conditions. Although economic reasoning suggests that the Compact would be likely to cause increased milk production and reduced fluid milk consumption in the six NEDC states, analyses of relevant data on dairy farm structure, milk production, and milk consumption show little change in historic trends after the Compact\u2019s implementation.", "Retail milk prices increased by as much as 20 cents per gallon immediately following the NEDC\u2019s establishment\u2014which is an amount comparable to the immediate increase in the minimum farm-level price for raw milk to be used for and sold as fluid milk in the six New England states when the NEDC\u2019s price regulations became effective. For example, the NEDC minimum price of $1.46 per gallon was 18 cents higher than USDA\u2019s June 1997 Class I price for Boston of $1.28 per gallon and 26 cents higher than USDA\u2019s July 1997 Class I price of $1.20 per gallon. While this might appear to be a substantial increase, when compared with USDA\u2019s average Class I price of $1.41 per gallon during the prior year, the NEDC price did not actually represent such a large increase. However, without a model of farm-to-retail price transmission that accounts for how quickly and how fully farm-level price changes are passed on to wholesale and retail levels, we cannot estimate how much of the retail price change was due to the Compact.", "Furthermore, while retail milk prices in Boston and other selected cities in the NEDC states remain at the higher levels experienced since the Compact took effect, national average retail prices have also increased, but at rates lower than in the NEDC states. Even so, it is not certain what portion of the retail price increase in the NEDC states is attributable to the Compact, given that both the retail and farm-level prices for milk have fluctuated since July 1997. Some portion of the price increase could also be due to other factors, such as changes in the costs for processing or retailing milk, marketing strategies, or consumer demand. In addition, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which fluid milk processors would have paid more than the minimum farm-level price for milk without the NEDC; that is, we do not know the extent to which the NEDC price substituted for market-driven over-order premiums. Several studies analyzing the NEDC\u2019s impact on retail milk prices concluded that the NEDC has increased prices. However, the amount of the increase attributed to the NEDC varies from study to study, depending on assumptions made by the different researchers and the time periods that they examined. For example, estimates ranged from a low of 2.7 cents to as much as 20 cents per gallon.", "Data on farm income are limited, and while dairy farmers have received NEDC payments, it is unclear to what extent these payments replaced market-driven over-order premiums that farmers might have been paid in the absence of the Compact. We estimate that through calendar year 2000, the NEDC payments made to dairy farmers in the six NEDC states totaled about $99 million, assuming that all dairy farmers located in these states had their milk processed at fully regulated NEDC plants. The NEDC payments that an average dairy farmer in one of the six states would have received would have fluctuated widely from month to month and from year to year, however, depending on the difference between USDA\u2019s Class I price and the Compact price of $16.94 per hundredweight and the percentage of milk used for fluid milk in the NEDC states. For example, in 1998 the average NEDC over-order producer price payment was 67 cents per hundredweight. This would have provided dairy farmers supplying raw milk used to produce fluid milk sold in the NEDC states about 25 cents per hundredweight, based on the percentage of raw milk used for fluid milk. We estimate that these payments provided the average dairy farmer in the six NEDC states about $3,892 above the minimum amount that the farmer would have received in 1998 had USDA\u2019s Class I price of $16.78 been in effect. In 2000, the average NEDC over-order producer price payment was $2.14 per hundredweight. This amount would have provided a farmer supplying raw milk used to produce fluid milk sold in the NEDC states about 91 cents per hundredweight, based on the percentage of raw milk used for fluid milk. These payments provided an average dairy farmer in the six NEDC states about $15,301 above the minimum amount that the farmer would have received in 2000 had USDA\u2019s Class I price of $14.80 been in effect. These estimates are comparable to data developed by the Compact commission, which indicate that dairy farmers in the six NEDC states and New York received over-order payments totaling about $146 million from July 1997 through June 2001. In particular, the NEDC data indicate that about 4,200 dairy farmers, including 1,300 in New York, received average annual payments of about $9,800. Whether these payments were sufficient to alter the financial health of dairy farmers supplying raw milk used to produce fluid milk sold in the NEDC states is difficult to determine, however. USDA data are inconclusive as to whether the Compact had a positive impact on NEDC dairy farmer income, while NEDC analyses conclude that the Compact stabilized and enhanced farmer income.", "A limited number of studies have been conducted on the Compact\u2019s impact on farm income. In its 1998 report, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated a 6- to 8-percent increase in farm income from July through December 1997. In addition, an economist at the University of Vermont modeled the effect on Vermont dairy farmers of establishing a floor for Class I prices and concluded that stabilizing prices by having a price floor could have a positive impact on dairy farmer income.", "The NEDC\u2019s impact on farm structure is unclear. The number of dairy farms decreased, and the average size of herds increased, both prior to and following the NEDC\u2019s establishment in both the Compact states and the rest of the country. For example, the number of licensed dairy farms in the six NEDC states decreased by 32 percent between 1992 and 2000, from 4,079 to 2,772, while the number of licensed dairy farms in the rest of the country decreased by 37 percent during the same period, from 127,456 to 80,253. Regarding herd size, the average herd in the six NEDC states increased 36 percent, from 58 to 79 milk cows, between 1992 and 2000. In the rest of the United States, the average herd increased 57 percent during the same period, from 56 to 88 milk cows. According to USDA, this decline in the number of farms, along with the increase in herd size, most likely reflects fundamental changes in dairy farming caused by such factors as technological and genetic advances.", "Although economic reasoning suggests that higher farm-level milk prices would result in increased raw milk production, we have no basis on which to estimate the specific impact that the Compact has had on milk production in the six NEDC states. Data on milk production show an increase in total milk produced and milk produced per dairy cow, but these trends began prior to the Compact\u2019s establishment, making it difficult to estimate the specific impact of the NEDC. Farmers in the NEDC states increased their total milk production by 2.9 percent, from 4.5 billion pounds in 1993 to 4.7 billion pounds in 2000, while farmers in the rest of the nation increased production by 10.3 percent, from 148 billion pounds to 163.3 billion pounds during the same period. The average amount of milk produced per cow in the NEDC states increased by about 11.6 percent during the same period, from 15,633 pounds to 17,440 pounds. Milk production per cow in the rest of the United States increased by about 15.9 percent during this period, from 15,726 pounds to 18,226 pounds. Studies of the NEDC\u2019s impact on milk production, including OMB\u2019s study and an analysis by researchers at the University of Vermont, estimated that the Compact has resulted in a slight increase in milk production in the NEDC states.", "We cannot estimate the specific impact that the Compact has had on fluid milk consumption in the six NEDC states, in part because we cannot estimate how much of the retail price change since July 1997 has been due to the Compact. Data on fluid milk consumption show a decrease in per capita milk consumption, which reflects trends both within the NEDC states and in the rest of the country that began prior to the NEDC\u2019s establishment. Per capita consumption of fluid milk was higher in USDA\u2019s New England Milk Marketing Order than in some other USDA marketing orders prior to the Compact. Even so, consumption of fluid milk had been slowly declining, both in that marketing order and in the rest of the country, as the consumption of other fluid beverages increased and as the population aged. For example, annual per capita milk consumption for the New England Milk Marketing Order declined by 4 percent from 1993 to 1999, or from about 233 to 223 pounds. Similarly, annual per capita milk consumption for all the other USDA marketing orders declined 6 percent from 1993 to 1999, or from about 214 to 202 pounds. In its 1998 study, OMB\u2019s analysis of the NEDC\u2019s impact on fluid milk consumption during the last half of calendar year 1997 showed a 0.5-percent decline; while in a July 2000 study, an economist at Pennsylvania State University estimated that the NEDC had no appreciable impact from mid-1997 through 1999.", "Additional details about the intraregional impacts of the NEDC are included in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The NEDC Has Not Increased Net Federal Costs for the Milk Price Support Program, but Its Impact on a Major Nutrition Assistance Program Is Less Certain", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA, the NEDC has not resulted in a net increase in the federal government\u2019s costs for its milk price support program, while it is not certain whether it has affected federal costs for one of its major nutrition assistance programs. The Compact commission must, by law, compensate USDA for any estimated increase in costs to its price support program that are caused by the Compact, and the NEDC commission has done so. Regarding its nutrition assistance programs, USDA estimates that federal costs to its largest nutrition assistance program\u2014the Food Stamp Program\u2014could have increased but federal costs for its other nutrition assistance programs have likely not increased.", "As required by the 1996 farm bill, when the rate of increase in milk production in the NEDC states exceeds the rate of increase in national milk production, the Compact commission must compensate USDA for any additional costs to the milk price support program that result, and the commission has done so. According to USDA officials, the NEDC did not result in a rate of increase in production greater than the national rate of increase in 1997, during the first 6 months of the Compact. USDA calculated that in 1998, milk production in the NEDC states was 1.8 percent greater than the average of the prior 2 years, compared with a national increase of 1.3 percent. The NEDC compensated USDA $1.8 million for this higher rate of increase in production. USDA calculated that in 1999, milk production in the six states was 3.6 percent greater than the average of the prior 2 years, compared with a national increase of 3.2 percent. The NEDC compensated USDA $1.4 million for this higher rate of increase in production. USDA calculated that milk production in the six NEDC states increased by 0.1 percent in 2000, compared with a national increase of 5.1 percent. Thus, compensation was not required.", "USDA is not certain whether the Compact has affected federal costs for the Food Stamp Program, which is USDA\u2019s largest nutrition assistance program. According to USDA, if (1) retail milk prices in the NEDC states increased sufficiently to increase national average retail milk prices, and (2) the Compact was the cause of the full amount of the price increases in the NEDC states, then the Compact might have increased federal Food Stamp Program costs because program benefits are sensitive to the national average retail milk price. Benefit levels and federal Food Stamp Program funding have increased since July 1997, because of, among other things, increased national average retail milk prices. However, according to USDA, it is difficult to establish the Compact\u2019s impact on retail milk prices in the six NEDC states, and thus it is difficult to establish the Compact's role in affecting national average retail milk prices. If the Compact would have caused benefit levels to increase to the next dollar, USDA estimates that the Compact increased annual federal program costs by about $60 million. If the Compact did not cause benefit levels to increase to the next dollar, any increased retail milk prices caused by the Compact would have been absorbed by program participants in the NEDC states.", "Regarding USDA\u2019s other major nutrition assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, USDA has concluded that federal costs have not increased as a result of the NEDC. Federal WIC program costs have not increased because WIC is a discretionary grant program. Federal school breakfast and lunch program costs have not increased because the level of federal reimbursements is based on the average price of a large variety of food items, which is relatively insensitive to changes in the retail price of milk. Because federal funding for WIC and school breakfast and lunch programs have not increased, those state or local agencies or organizations that provide program benefits or program participants have had to absorb any increase in retail milk prices caused by the NEDC. Although the 1996 farm bill does not require the Compact to do so, the commission compensates the six states for the increased milk costs incurred by the WIC and school programs that are estimated to be attributable to the NEDC. Through December 2000, the NEDC provided state WIC programs a total of $3.8 million, and the schools a total of $662,606.", "Should compacts be expanded to include additional states, smaller increases in retail milk prices within the compact states would be necessary to increase the national average retail milk price and, hence the level of Food Stamp Program benefits and federal funding. For example, USDA estimates that should retail milk prices increase by about 20 cents per gallon\u2014an amount similar to the immediate increase in the NEDC states when the commission established an NEDC price\u2014within a compact of states that represents 50 percent of the nation\u2019s fluid milk sales, monthly food stamp allotments would be forced up by, on average, $1 to $2. USDA estimates that these increases in monthly food stamp allotments would increase annual Food Stamp Program costs by $60 to $120 million. Nonfederal costs to its other major nutrition assistance programs, including WIC and the school programs, could also increase should compacts be expanded.

The NEDC states account for only about 3 percent of the milk produced in the nation, and we estimate that in 1999 it had little to no impact in other regions of the country on farm-level prices or milk production and, hence, on farm revenue. An expanded NEDC would account for approximately 18 percent of the milk produced in the nation, and we estimate that in 1999 it would have had a larger but still relatively small impact on farm-level prices, milk production, and farm revenue in other regions of the country. An expanded NEDC, in conjunction with a southern compact, would account for approximately 27 percent of the quantity of milk produced in the nation, and we estimate that in 1999 it would have had a somewhat larger impact on farm-level prices, milk production, and revenue in other regions of the country. These estimates are comparable to other economists\u2019 estimates of the interregional impacts of dairy compacts of different sizes.", "In general, if dairy farmers located within a compact region received higher farm-level milk prices than they would otherwise have received, they would respond by increasing their raw milk production. Moreover, these higher farm-level milk prices would likely lead to higher fluid milk retail prices in the compact region\u2014prices that would lower consumer purchases of fluid milk in that region. These two effects in the compact region\u2014greater raw milk production and lower consumer fluid milk purchases\u2014would increase the national supply of raw milk that was available for the manufacture of other dairy products, such as cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. In turn, this increase in the national supply of milk for manufacturing purposes would result in lower farm-level prices for raw milk to be used for manufacturing purposes. Because minimum Class I prices are based on the prices paid for raw milk to be used for manufacturing purposes, farmers in noncompact regions would receive lower farm-level prices for all classes of milk and, thus, lower blend prices. Other things being equal, dairy farmers in noncompact regions would respond to lower farm-level prices by reducing their milk production.These two effects in noncompact regions\u2014lower farm-level prices and reduced production\u2014would cause farm revenue there to fall. This impact would be particularly significant for dairy farmers in regions such as the Upper Midwest, where most milk is used for manufacturing purposes. Farmers in noncompact regions who ship their milk to compact regions may be eligible to receive the compact region\u2019s farm-level price for that milk, which could offset the loss in revenue associated with lower farm- level prices for milk. If the compact price is sufficiently high, any increased transportation or shipping costs could be offset.", "To assess the likely interregional impacts of each compact alternative or scenario, we derived an initial set of estimates that represents the impact of that alternative in 1999, given an initial set of assumptions.  We then changed key assumptions to analyze how sensitive our initial estimates were to such changes. In general, these sensitivity analyses demonstrated that our initial estimates were not very sensitive to changes in the key assumptions. (For a more detailed description of our initial and subsequent sets of assumptions, see app. II.) Accordingly, we present our estimates of the impacts of the different compact scenarios as ranges that include our initial set of estimates and the results of our sensitivity analyses. In addition, we present these estimates as changes from our 1999 baseline estimates, which represent the estimated values of farm-level and wholesale-level dairy indicators in that year in the absence of any dairy compact\u2014our \u201cno-compact scenario.\u201d", "Our estimates apply only to 1999, and they may not represent the interregional impacts of compacts in all years.

Furthermore, farm-level milk prices in 1999 were higher than they were in some other years, and we anticipate that, other things being equal, compacts have less of an impact in years when farm-level prices are relatively high. In addition, although our estimated impacts of compacts on noncompact regions for both 1999 and 2000 are relatively small, the impacts on some individual dairy farmers, such as small producers with marginal profitability, in noncompact regions could be significant.", "Finally, as in any modeling effort, there is some uncertainty about a model's structure and the data and assumptions used. In addition, the model that we used was limited in its ability to distinguish between shipments of bulk raw milk and packaged fluid milk into regions that import milk to meet their demand because the model is an annual model, and such shipments are frequently seasonal. (See app. II for a discussion of this as well as other modeling limitations.) Despite this uncertainty and limitation, we believe that the process for developing our estimates was rigorous and that the model is comprehensive and sound. Given these conditions, our estimates should be interpreted as indicative of the order of magnitude of changes in farm and wholesale economic values, rather than as precise estimates.", "Appendix V provides more detailed information about our estimates of the impacts of the three compact alternatives on 1999 farm-level prices, production, and revenue in noncompact regions, as well as on national average wholesale-level prices and national wholesale-level production and expenditures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interregional Impacts of the NEDC in 1999 Were Small", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that the NEDC resulted in small economic impacts in noncompact regions in 1999.

With lower farm-level prices in 2000 than in 1999, the difference between a compact price in our model and the federal milk marketing order Class I minimum price was larger in 2000 than in 1999. As a result, the increase in milk production and decrease in fluid milk purchases that would have likely occurred within a compact region in 2000 would be expected to be greater than when farm- level prices were higher, as they were in 1999. This situation, in turn, would imply a greater increase in the supply of milk available for manufacturing dairy products in 2000, which, other things being equal, would lead to lower farm-level prices, reduced milk production, and lower farm-level revenue in noncompact regions.", "However, on the basis of preliminary data for 2000, we estimate that the impacts of our three compact scenarios, which are based on our initial set of assumptions, are generally similar to our initial estimates for each scenario in 1999.

For example, USDA estimated that in 2000 the NEDC would either have no impact on producer prices in noncompact regions or reduce producer prices by about 1 cent per hundredweight of milk, or by about 0.07 percent, depending on the noncompact region of the country. An analysis conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis, also estimated that the NEDC reduced producer prices in noncompact regions by about 2 cents per hundredweight of milk, or by about 0.15 percent, on the basis of 1999 data.

They also estimated that if the Compact had been expanded to include additional states that produced 9 percent of the nation\u2019s milk supply, producer prices in noncompact regions would have fallen by about 5 cents per hundredweight, or by about 0.35 percent. An analysis conducted by a researcher at Pennsylvania State University of an expanded NEDC in conjunction with a southern compact that produced 27 percent of the U.S. milk supply also concluded that compacts have a relatively small impact.Using a range of assumptions about milk prices and data for 1997, the researcher projected that in 2000, the compact would decrease producer prices in noncompact regions by 4 to 14 cents per hundredweight, or by about 0.3 to 1 percent. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, using a 1997 version of the Interregional Dairy Competition Model that we used in our analysis, also estimated that the NEDC had a small impact on producer prices. This analysis estimated that farm-level prices would fall from 5 to 10 cents per hundredweight under an expanded NEDC scenario; 13 to 15 cents per hundredweight under a southern compact scenario; and 14 to 28 cents per hundredweight under a combined expanded NEDC and southern compact scenario. In an analysis of the impact of compacts prepared for the International Dairy Foods Association, one researcher estimated that the NEDC reduced farm-level revenue in noncompact regions in 2000 by about $29 million, while an expanded 29-state compact would reduce farm-level revenue in noncompact regions by about $374 million.", "A more detailed discussion of these studies is included in appendix VII."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["By affecting the minimum prices that dairy farmers within the Compact region receive for their raw milk, the NEDC may have enhanced dairy farmer income in the six NEDC states, and other states such as New York, that supply raw milk used for and sold as fluid milk in the NEDC states.

Data indicate that the number of dairy farms in the six states continued to decrease following the NEDC's establishment in July 1997.

While West Virginia had also enacted such legislation as of the end of February 2001, we did not include that state in a southern compact for the purposes of our analysis because of the difficulties associated with accounting for that state\u2019s milk production in compact versus noncompact regions of the country.

This model is useful in estimating the impacts of different dairy policy options, such as dairy compacts. Dr. Thomas L.

Using nonlinear programming techniques, the model solves to ensure an efficient regional distribution of the different dairy commodity resources, given the demand for and supply of those resources at various prices.", "On a more technical basis, the model solution maximizes the sum of producer and consumer welfare minus processing, transportation, and U.S. Department of Treasury costs. The model defines aggregate wholesale dairy product demand and farm-level milk supply functions as follows: (1a) D =  (1b) where pregion, with \u2202p/\u2202w > 0, i = 1, \u2026, J, and pik  (w) is the price-dependent supply function for milk in the i-th  (zik) is the price-dependent demand function for the k-th dairy product consumed in the i-th region, /\u2202zik < 0, i = 1, \u2026, J, k = 1, \u2026, K. Equation (1a) is the sum of the areas under the K demand curves in the i-th region. This can be interpreted as a measure of consumer benefits generated by the K commodities in the i-th region. Equation (1b) is the area under the supply curve, a measure of milk production cost in the i-th region. The term (D \u2013 S), consumer benefits minus total production costs in the i-th region, minus transportation costs, is a measure of net social benefits to farmers and consumers in each region. Federal government costs are then subtracted.Two steps are used to create an IRCM that models the impact of compacts in 1999: IRCM99. First, the model is calibrated to 1999 data so that baseline estimates of key dairy sector measures of prices, production, consumption, and trade flows can be obtained on a regional basis. Second, simulation analyses are performed to estimate the impacts of the different compact scenarios.", "In the IRCM99, milk production and dairy product consumption in the country are divided into 12 regions that are based on the current 11 USDA federal milk marketing orders and California. In addition, the IRCM99 accounts for net private stocks, net government stocks/removals, and U.S. imports and exports. Table 8 compares the IRCM99 regions, the corresponding USDA marketing orders or states before January 2000, states included in the IRCM99 regions, and states that had enacted legislation as of February 2001 authorizing entry into any congressionally authorized dairy compact.", "Figure 1 shows USDA\u2019s marketing orders, the corresponding IRCM99 regions, the corresponding states included in the IRCM 99 regions, and states that had enacted legislation authorizing entry into a compact as of February 2001. With respect to modeling the impact of compacts, the states that have enacted legislation are part of four different federal milk marketing orders and their corresponding IRCM99 regions. Because of this, both compact and noncompact states are included in some IRCM99 regions when modeling some compact alternatives. This can influence the interpretation of modeled results. For example, some states that have enacted legislation authorizing entry into a dairy compact, such as West Virginia, which is part of the Mideast Marketing Order, produce only a small portion of the milk produced by dairy farmers in that marketing order and hence, estimating the effect of West Virginia\u2019s participation in a compact, would be difficult.", "IRCM99 solves for regional prices and production levels for farm-level raw milk on the basis of three milk components: milk fat, protein, and carbohydrates (primarily lactose). The model also solves for regional wholesale-level price, supply, demand, and trade flows for the following dairy products: (1) fluid milk, (2) soft dairy products, (3) American cheese, (4) Italian cheese, (5) other cheese, (6) butter, (7) frozen dairy products, (8) other manufactured dairy products (a residual product category), and (9) nonfat dry milk. The model uses a fixed component composition that converts farm milk into fluid milk and different types of manufactured dairy commodities, as shown in table 9.", "The regional supply of milk components (milk fat, protein, and carbohydrates) must be greater than or equal to the regional utilization of these milk components by the processing sector to ensure regional component supply/demand balance. The marginal value of this restriction (given by the corresponding Lagrange multiplier) measures the shadow value of each milk component in each region. The model subsequently generates empirical estimates of regional shadow prices for each milk component. The model also generates market prices that are consistent with milk component pricing for each commodity in each region."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Modeling Classified Pricing", "paragraphs": ["The basic structure of the IRCM99 is consistent with a competitive market equilibrium, where, at the optimum, the market price equals the marginal cost of each commodity. However, USDA and California use a system of classified pricing for milk that influences pricing in ways that differ from the competitive outcome. Therefore, to incorporate the classified pricing system, price wedges are used in the model to represent the difference between the minimum price of milk in a particular class and the minimum price of milk in a reference class. In the model, the reference class for USDA\u2019s milk marketing orders is Class III, and the reference class for California is 4b. For example, the price wedge for raw milk used for fluid milk is the difference between the price for milk used for Class I (fluid) and the price for milk used for Class III (cheese), plus potential over-order premiums. For USDA\u2019s milk marketing orders in 1999, we calculated the price of raw milk used for manufacturing (Classes II, III, and IV) as the implicit price of milk used for Class II and Class III in the Upper Midwest Milk Marketing Order (portions of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin). USDA milk marketing order prices for nonfat dry milk and butterfat differentials are computed by using USDA formulas and wholesale commodity prices. California milk prices are calculated for milk used in fluid products (Class 1); milk used for heavy cream, cottage cheese, yogurt, and sterilized products (Class 2); milk used in ice cream and other frozen dairy products (Class 3); milk used in butter and nonfat dry milk (Class 4a); and milk used in cheese other than cottage cheese (Class 4b). We computed California price wedges by using administered formulas for the fat and solids-not-fat component prices by class. These component prices are computed from wholesale commodity prices for butter, nonfat dry milk, and cheese that are endogenous to the model. Because Class 4a prices were lower than Class 4b prices in 1999, this method implies a negative price wedge in California for Class 4a. Finally, because dairy farmers are paid blend prices based on USDA and California\u2019s classified pricing systems, we incorporated price wedges that represent these blend prices in each of the respective modeled regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modeling Producer Settlement Pools", "paragraphs": ["We took into account pooling regulations for both USDA and the NEDC in modeling \u201cproducer settlement pools.\u201d The first step in this calculation is to compute total revenues from regional milk production under the assumption that all raw milk is pooled in the region where it is produced. This is done in each region by multiplying the price wedge for each commodity by the quantity of raw milk used to produce that commodity. However, by shipping some of their milk to another order, producers can sometimes become eligible to receive the minimum prices in the destination order for their milk, which might be higher than the minimum prices in their \"home\" order. As a result, in estimating how the proceeds from raw milk sales are distributed to producers, through producer settlement pools, the model can adjust its initial estimate to take into account that not all raw milk is pooled in the order where it is produced.", "When we estimated the impacts of the compact scenarios, no such adjustments were necessary because the model's solutions did not yield any pooling of raw milk outside any home order. As a result, before taking into account further adjustments described below, the revenue received from milk sales from farmers in any order were the same as they would have been had no adjustment been made and all producers' receipts from milk sales were based on the prices in their home order. We recognize that some milk is pooled outside the order in which it is produced. However, we did not have data on shipments of raw milk by individual farmers or shipments of fluid milk or other dairy commodities by individual processing plants, which limited the model's ability to estimate raw milk movements across orders. Instead, the model solution includes substantial movement of packaged fluid milk to balance supply and demand across orders. If enough packaged fluid milk moves out of an order, the model's structure allows for further adjustments to be made in the producer settlement pools, but there was no region affected in this way.", "However, the producer settlement pools were adjusted for the movement of packaged fluid milk into compact regions under the various scenarios that we analyzed. These adjustments were made because processors in exporting regions shipping packaged fluid milk into compact regions are required to pay a compact premium on this milk.

These states were included in the expanded NEDC and the southern compact on the basis that they had enacted legislation as of the end of February 2001 that would allow them to enter into a dairy compact, should the Congress enact legislation allowing them to do so. While West Virginia had also enacted such legislation as of the end of February 2001, we did not include it in our analysis of an expanded NEDC in conjunction with a southern compact because of the difficulty of modeling West Virginia as part of a southern compact, given that it would have been the only state in USDA\u2019s Mideast Marketing Order whose milk would fall under compact regulation.

This region encompasses the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont (and the District of Columbia). To account for the NEDC, we calculated the amount of milk produced by the six NEDC states as a percentage of the total amount of milk produced within the Northeast Milk Marketing Order. Therefore, while we are able to estimate the impact of the NEDC on other noncompact regions of the country that do not contain any compact states, we could not estimate the NEDC's impacts on other noncompact states within the Northeast region. Further, because we defined the impacts of the NEDC scenario to be based on the amount of milk produced by the six NEDC states, the impacts of this scenario do not account for  milk that noncompact states, such as New York, may ship into the NEDC states. Further, reductions in revenue in noncompact states are also not accounted for.

In this analysis, we varied the assumption regarding the Class I minimum price, or compact price, in the compact region. We increased the minimum price from $16.94 to $18.00 per hundredweight in the southern compact but retained the $16.94 minimum price in the expanded Northeast Compact. We conducted this analysis because data on cooperative pay prices in selected cities in USDA\u2019s Appalachia, Southeast, and Central milk marketing orders were about a dollar higher in 1999 than in the Northeast Milk Marketing Order.", "We also analyzed how sensitive the model was to trade limitations across regions. Our initial estimates and previous sensitivity analyses assumed that milk flowed relatively freely between noncompact and compact regions. We revised this assumption by limiting the amount of milk that could flow into a compact region from a noncompact region to that amount of milk produced within 100 miles of a compact region\u2019s border. Although we recognize that there are no regulations establishing such a limit, we performed this particular analysis to reflect the fact that the IRCM99 uses average transportation costs, on a regional basis, because of the lack of specific data on the location of processing plants for 1999. This limitation may lead to a model solution with unrealistically high interregional milk trade. We then compared the estimated impacts of the different compact scenarios with the impacts of the no-compact scenario using this revised trade assumption. We also conducted the same sensitivity analyses discussed above to determine how sensitive these new estimates were to changes in key values and assumptions.", "We also conducted an analysis of how sensitive our initial estimates were to the magnitude of the difference between USDA and compact prices. We derived our initial estimates and our sensitivity analyses using 1999 pricing data because 1999 was the most recent year for which complete data were available. During 1999, the national average blend price of milk, or the average weighted minimum farm-level price, was $14.09 per hundredweight, which was higher than the prices observed in some other years, including 2000. For example, the national average blend price of milk in 2000 was $12.11 per hundredweight. To determine how sensitive our 1999 estimates were, we used preliminary milk pricing data for 2000 to determine what impact this difference may have had. This required a new baseline for assessing the magnitude of change that compacts made, given the relative magnitude of change in compact and USDA prices. We did not, however, conduct a full range of sensitivity analyses regarding this change in assumptions because of the preliminary nature of the 2000 pricing data. Further, the 2000 pricing data reflected regulatory reform measures implemented by USDA in January 2000, which posed potential data reliability concerns.", "We calibrated the model using dairy sector data for 2000 to simulate the impact of compacts during that year.

More specifically, the retail price of milk is affected by wholesalers\u2019 costs of acquiring and processing raw milk and packaging and distributing processed fluid milk to retail outlets. The retail price can also be affected by state regulations that, for example, dictate how and where milk can be distributed. Another factor is consumers\u2019 shrinking demand for milk products, as opposed to other beverages. This shrinking demand has created a need to advertise and improve products, which has increased retail costs. Finally, retail milk prices are affected by retail pricing strategies involving such factors as retail costs, competitor pricing, if and how milk prices are used to attract customers, shopping convenience, the image a store may want to project regarding quality or low prices, and the extent to which retailers exercise market power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Studies Estimate That the NEDC Has Increased Retail Prices", "paragraphs": ["Four studies have estimated the Compact\u2019s impact on retail milk prices, and each has concluded that the NEDC has resulted in increased retail prices. Each study provides a different estimate of the amount that the NEDC has caused retail prices to increase, however, largely because of the different methodologies used and the time frames analyzed. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a study in 1998 that analyzed retail milk price data for the first 6 months that the NEDC was in effect. OMB estimated that the Compact could have had a small impact (an increase of 5 to 10 cents per gallon), a medium impact (an increase of 10 to 15 cents per gallon), or a large impact (an increase of 15 to 20 cents per gallon) on retail prices, depending on the extent to which costs were passed on from the farm to the retail level, and the extent to which wholesalers and retailers absorbed or passed on any increased costs. However, OMB cautioned that its study was completed too soon after the Compact began operating in July 1997 to determine its economic impacts and implications with confidence or precision. OMB further cautioned that U.S. dairy industry economics are complex, and that producer, wholesale, and retail prices are affected by numerous proprietary, regional, and national factors. OMB concluded that retail price patterns have fluctuated in recent years and provide no definitive indication of the retail price levels that would have occurred without the Compact.", "In 2000, economists (Lass et al.) at the University of Massachusetts issued a study that analyzed the NEDC\u2019s impact on retail milk prices during the first year of the Compact. For this study, which was conducted for the NEDC, Lass et al. used data from January 1982 through June 1996 to develop a model of farm-to-retail price behavior in two markets: Boston and Hartford. They then used data from an 18-month period\u2014July 1996 through December 1997\u2014to predict what the retail price for milk would have been without the Compact and to compare those predicted effects with the effects that actually occurred in New England. Lass et al. concluded that the NEDC caused an average retail milk price increase of about 7 cents per gallon in the Boston market and about 6 cents per gallon in the Hartford market. They also concluded that because this estimated retail price increase was less than the NEDC increase in costs to fluid milk processors (the over-order amount due to the NEDC), an amount less than the NEDC over-order amount was being passed on to consumers. The authors cautioned, however, that the model did not capture changes that may have occurred in the farm-to-retail price relationship from July through December 1997.", "A third study, issued in 2000 by an economist (Bailey) at Pennsylvania State University, analyzed the farm-to-retail markup for fluid milk over the period January 1996 through December 1999. Using a simple but direct markup model to evaluate the impact of the NEDC on retail fluid milk prices in Boston and Hartford, Bailey concluded that the retail price of milk increased after the Compact established its minimum price in July 1997. Specifically, Bailey concluded that the retail price of milk rose 24 cents per gallon from July 1997 to December 1999 over the average price in effect from January 1996 to June 1997. According to Bailey, the majority of this 24-cent per gallon increase\u201417 cents per gallon\u2014was attributable to the Compact, while the rest was attributable to other factors. Finally, studies issued in 2001 by economists (Cotterill and Franklin) at the University of Connecticut examined specific factors that may have increased retail milk prices in four New England marketing areas\u2014Boston, Providence, Hartford/Springfield, and Northern New England\u2014following the Compact\u2019s establishment in July 1997. Cotterill and Franklin compared retail price data from February 1996 through early July 1997 with retail price data from July 1997 through August 1998. The authors separated out retail price increases as caused by four factors: (1) the increased farm price of milk caused by the NEDC; (2) the increased farm price of milk caused by strong raw milk markets when the farm price spiked above the NEDC price; (3) nonmilk costs, such as increased processing costs other than costs for purchasing raw milk and increased distribution costs; and (4) changes in pricing at the wholesale and retail levels. Using this methodology, Cotterill and Franklin concluded that of the 29-cent increase in the retail price of a gallon of milk, on average, 2.7 cents per gallon were caused by the NEDC and 6.5 cents per gallon were caused by strong milk markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Data Are Available to Estimate the Potential Impacts of the Compact on Producer Income", "paragraphs": ["While it is likely that the NEDC has stabilized producer income, it is difficult to determine how large of an impact it has had on producer income because of uncertainty about what dairy farmers in the six NEDC states would have been paid for their milk in the absence of the Compact.

For example, in 1996, the over-order Class I premium in the New England order averaged 76 cents per hundredweight. Research conducted by economists at Cornell University indicates that after the compact began, producers receiving NEDC payments received no over-order premiums above the amount needed to compensate them for cooperative services. In one survey conducted in August 2000, dairy farmers in New York who received NEDC payments were receiving no market-driven over order premiums, while producers not shipping milk into the NEDC states received about 60 cents per hundredweight in market-driven over-order premiums. USDA officials concurred with this assessment.

At a minimum, the NEDC has had a stabilizing impact on the prices paid to farmers for milk, irrespective of the amount of additional income it may have generated, because the $16.94 NEDC price per hundredweight has protected dairy farmer income when the minimum federal marketing order price has fallen below the NEDC price.

For example, the NEDC commission estimated that in 1997, the Compact increased net farm earnings of those supplying the New England milk shed by about $6,800, from about $11,000 to about $17,800. The NEDC commission estimated that in 2000, the Compact increased net earnings by about $15,200, from about $8,100 to about $23,300.

Although no one model specifically simulated the impact of the NEDC, Wackernagel concluded that using his compact scenarios, the impact of stabilizing prices could increase farmer cash reserves and net worth, but he estimated that such gains would be more limited than those that would be achieved by having a higher farm-level price that varied from month to month.

Farming has changed from an operation that was historically dependent on human and animal labor to one in which most operations are mechanized. As a result, at every level, economies of scale (the lower cost of large-scale versus small-scale operations) have led to fewer and larger farms. The number of farms in general, and dairy farms in particular, has been shrinking since the Depression. While dairy farms with 100 cows were considered large in 1950, today dairy farms as large as 1,500 to 3,000 are emerging in the western, northwestern, and midwestern regions of the country.

Increases in production per cow, and increased efficiency in all of the states, has more likely resulted from fundamental changes in the structure of dairy farming throughout the country, such as the increased cost of labor; new improved machinery; artificial breeding services; better feed and forage; adoption of different strains of livestock; and careful use of fertilizer, irrigation, and chemicals.

Given this increase in New England milk production and using USDA\u2019s dairy economic model, OMB estimated that the Compact commission\u2019s price of $16.94 per hundredweight for raw milk used for and sold as fluid milk would have caused milk marketings to increase from 5.38 billion pounds to 5.40 billion pounds, or by about 0.4 percent , between July and December 1998.

Given the retail price and consumption relationship found in other studies, and the NEDC\u2019s impact on retail milk prices, OMB concluded that the NEDC\u2019s price regulations reduced fluid milk consumption in the NEDC states by about 10 million pounds, or about 0.5 percent, between July and December 1997.", "Bailey\u2019s July 2000 study also analyzed the NEDC\u2019s impact on retail fluid milk consumption. Bailey examined Class I sales in the New England Marketing Milk Marketing Order from 1996 through 1999 and observed a retail milk price increase of 24 cents per gallon in the Hartford and Boston markets over that period. He attributed this increase to an average 10-cent- per-gallon Compact obligation and a general rise in the farm-to-retail markup.

The price support program, created in 1949, supports farm-level prices by providing a standing offer from the government to purchase butter, cheese, and nonfat dry milk at specified prices. The 1996 farm bill requires that the Compact commission compensate USDA when the estimated rate of increase in milk production in the six NEDC states is greater than the estimated rate of increase in national milk production. The NEDC commission is required to compensate USDA before the end of any fiscal year in which the NEDC states\u2019 estimated rate of increase in production is greater than the national rate of increase for the preceding fiscal year. Neither the NEDC nor USDA must determine whether the greater rate of increase, or what portion of the greater rate of increase, is attributable to the NEDC.", "According to USDA officials, milk production in the NEDC states did not increase at a greater rate than the national rate of increase between July and September 1997. However, in 1998, USDA estimated that milk production in the NEDC states increased 1.8 percent, based on its analysis of the average amount of milk produced in the six states during 1997 and 1998, as compared to a national average increase in production of 1.3 percent. On the basis of these two rates, USDA estimated that it purchased about $1.8 million of nonfat dry milk that was attributable to the NEDC\u2019s greater rate of increase in production. In 1999, USDA estimated that milk production in the NEDC states increased 3.6 percent, based on its analysis of the states\u2019 average milk production in 1998 and 1999, compared with a national average rate of increase of 3.2 percent. On the basis of these two rates, USDA estimated that it purchased about $1.4 million of nonfat dry milk that was attributable to the NEDC\u2019s greater rate of increase in production. The NEDC commission compensated the federal government these amounts for these 2 fiscal years. The Compact commission was not required to compensate USDA for fiscal year 2000 because USDA concluded that the average rate of increase in milk production in the NEDC states (0.1 percent) was less than the average national rate (5.1 percent)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Is Unclear Whether Federal Net Costs for Nutrition Assistance Programs Have Increased", "paragraphs": ["USDA analyzed the Compact\u2019s impact on federal nutrition assistance program costs and concluded that it is uncertain whether the federal costs of one of its major programs\u2014the Food Stamp Program\u2014have increased, while federal costs of its other programs most likely have not. Food Stamp Program costs may have increased to the extent that the NEDC caused retail milk prices to increase nationally and to the extent that the agencies or organizations that provide or receive program benefits are not reimbursed. USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service is responsible for nutrition assistance programs, which include the Food Stamp Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); school programs such as the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs and the Special Milk Program; the Child and Adult Care Food Program; and several small food distribution programs for Indian reservations, the elderly, pregnant women, and children. These programs are carried out at the state and local level by state and local agencies and organizations, such as day care centers or schools.", "Regarding the Food Stamp Program, USDA officials said that federal costs may have increased as a result of the NEDC, but they do not know because it is difficult to determine (1) how much of the increased retail milk price in the NEDC states was caused by the Compact, and (2) to what extent that portion of the increased retail milk price caused an increase in the national average cost of food items used to determine program benefits. The Food Stamp Program is operated by state and local welfare offices. Under the program, food stamp recipients spend their benefits (in the form of paper coupons or electronic benefits on debit cards), to buy eligible food in authorized retail food stores. Program benefits under this program are indexed to the cost of a selected group of foods, which is sensitive to the changes in the national average retail price of milk.Benefit levels have increased since July 1997, because of, among other things, increased national average retail milk prices. USDA officials said that the retail milk price increases in the six NEDC states caused by the Compact had the potential to increase the index used to set benefit levels and, thus, federal costs, but it is not certain whether they did so. Further, it is difficult to determine what portion of the retail milk price increases was attributable to the Compact. USDA estimates that if the NEDC caused a 16-cent per gallon increase in the national average retail milk price, there is a 50 percent chance that Food Stamp Program benefits increased by $1 per program participant per month and annual federal Food Stamp Program costs increased by about $60 million. USDA officials also noted that even if the increased price of milk attributable to the NEDC was enough to increase national food stamp benefit levels, some portion of the increased retail milk costs have been borne by participants located in the six NEDC states.", "Regarding WIC, USDA officials said that the Compact has not increased federal costs to the program because of the discretionary nature of its funding. Even so, because approximately 30 percent of the funds spent on WIC foods are used to buy fluid milk, any increase in retail milk prices can significantly affect the food package cost per participant and these higher costs, unless offset, would reduce the potential number of participants. WIC is administered by state agencies, most of whom provide WIC participants checks or food instruments to purchase specific foods each month at authorized retailers. While the 1996 farm bill does not require the Compact commission to reimburse the WIC program, NEDC regulations specify that the Compact commission is to compensate New England state agencies that administer WIC for any increased costs due to the Compact. The amount of compensation equals the over-order producer price payment multiplied by the volume of milk used by program participants in a given month. For example, in January of 1998 when the Vermont WIC program purchased 52,403 gallons of milk, the difference between the NEDC Class I milk price and the minimum USDA Class I price was 74 cents per hundredweight. Given that a hundredweight is equivalent to about 11.6 gallons of milk, the Compact commission compensated Vermont about $3,343 for that month. In total, the Compact commission compensated the six states\u2019 WIC programs $3.8 million from 1997 through 2000 for increased milk costs due to the NEDC.", "According to state WIC officials, the programs used to administer WIC are being held harmless by the NEDC. These officials said that the NEDC has not resulted in increased WIC program costs or reduced program participation. One state WIC official said that the NEDC has done everything it can to ensure that the WIC programs in the six states remain unharmed by reimbursing the states the full difference between the NEDC\u2019s minimum Class I producer price and the milk marketing order minimum Class I price on all WIC milk purchases.", "Regarding school programs, according to USDA officials, it is likely that federal costs to these programs have not increased as a result of the NEDC because program benefits are based on a broad index of food prices that is relatively insensitive to changes in the price of milk in the six NEDC states. Thus, any increases in milk prices caused by the Compact would either have to be absorbed by the schools or passed on to paying students. Programs such as the School Lunch Program are usually administered by state education agencies, which operate the program through agreements with local school districts. NEDC regulations specify that the Compact will reimburse schools for any Compact-related increased costs of fluid milk sold in 8-ounce containers by schools in the six NEDC states. This commitment applies to all milk served in 8-ounce containers by schools, including milk provided under such child nutrition programs as the school lunch and breakfast programs and the Special Milk Program. The NEDC commission requires that school food authorities submit claim forms at the end of each school year that identify the number of 8-oz. cartons of milk purchased during the school year on these forms. School authorities document whether part of the price for the 8-ounce milk containers is attributable to the NEDC over-order premium and, if so, how much on the basis of milk vendor submissions. Our review of school food authority claim data indicates that the portion of the contract price that milk vendors have attributed to the NEDC varies. For example, Connecticut school food authorities attributed from .2 cents to 1.37 cents per 8-ounce container to the NEDC over-order premium during the 1999-2000 school year.", "The NEDC commission then verifies that amounts claimed do not exceed the NEDC\u2019s average over-order premium for the school year and compensates school food authorities either the average over-order premium or the amount vendors attributed to the NEDC over-order premium, whichever is less. Thus, the amounts paid to school food authorities vary depending on the amount that they attributed to the NEDC and the amount of milk purchased. For example, one school food authority in Massachusetts was compensated $308.35 for 146,835 cartons of milk purchased during the 1999-2000 school year, while another school food authority in that state was compensated $316.33 for 31,633 cartons of milk purchased for the same year. In total, the NEDC commission reimbursed the states $662,606 for the 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 school years.", "Although the amounts paid varied from school to school, officials in the six states\u2019 departments of education generally said that schools claiming and receiving compensation were not, in the end, spending additional funds for milk or having to charge higher prices for milk sold to students. However, these officials also said that many school food authorities have chosen not to seek compensation because some school food authorities view the claim process as burdensome and not worth the effort given the relatively small amounts of money that they would receive.", "As is the case with the school programs, according to USDA officials it is likely that federal costs of the Child and Adult Care Food Program also have not increased as a result of the NEDC because program benefits are based on a broad index of retail food prices that is relatively insensitive to changes in the price of milk. State education or health departments administer the program, with independent centers and sponsoring organizations entering into agreements with these departments to operate the program. Under the program, USDA provides eligible centers and sponsoring organizations, such as family day care homes and child-care centers, reimbursements for meals served. According to USDA, it has no data on the amount of milk purchased under the program, and it would be prohibitively labor-intensive for the NEDC to establish a method for compensating thousands of individual homes and centers for any increased retail milk prices.", "Regarding USDA\u2019s food distribution programs, according to USDA officials, USDA has not estimated the potential NEDC-related increased costs to these programs. USDA officials said, however, that any increased costs would be relatively small, given the small size of these programs compared with programs such as WIC. Furthermore, because most of these programs are not entitlement programs and thus federal funding is not mandatory, any increased costs due to the NEDC would have to be borne by program providers and could result in fewer participants being served."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "If Compacts Are Expanded, Federal Food Stamp Program Costs Could Increase, as Could Nonfederal Costs for Other Nutrition Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA, if the NEDC is expanded to include additional states or if a southern compact is also created, it is more likely that federal costs for the Food Stamp Program would increase than with the existing NEDC: The likely increase in retail milk prices in more states would have a more direct impact on the index used to set program benefits.", "USDA estimated that if retail milk prices in the states of an expanded NEDC and a southern compact increased by about 20 cents per gallon\u2014an amount that USDA noted is possible given the NEDC experience\u2014food stamp participants in compact states would spend about $93 million a year more to purchase milk. If this price increase did not cause the national price increase to rise sufficiently to increase program benefits, Food Stamp Program participants would have to absorb this cost. However, if the 20-cent-per-gallon price increase resulted in a sufficiently large national average retail milk price increase to cause a $1- to $2-per- participant increase in Food Stamp Program benefits, USDA estimated that federal Food Stamp Program costs could increase by as much as $60 to $120 million per year\u2014an amount that would have to be federally funded. Moreover, if the NEDC is expanded and a southern compact is established, and if the NEDC does not provide reimbursements, increased retail milk costs could result in fewer participants being served by state WIC programs. Given these assumptions, it is also likely that costs to school programs would have to be absorbed by school food authorities and program participants because of the index used to establish benefits under these programs. Table 23 summarizes the additional costs that USDA estimated could be incurred under the above assumptions in fiscal year 2000 by food stamp, WIC, and school program providers or participants in compact states if the NEDC is expanded and a southern compact is established, and if retail milk prices increase in the compact states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Two Studies of the NEDC\u2019s Impact on Nutrition Assistance Programs Provide Inconclusive Results", "paragraphs": ["Two studies\u2014one prepared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the other by University of Vermont researchers\u2014offer inconclusive results on the NEDC\u2019s potential impacts on USDA\u2019s nutrition assistance programs. Both studies were conducted early in the Compact\u2019s existence and relied on limited retail milk price data. For example, OMB\u2019s 1998 study began before the NEDC commission and the states entered into agreements for compensating states\u2019 WIC and school programs and relied on only 6 months of retail price data\u2014from July through December 1997.Because of this, the study projected either a low (5- to 10-cent), medium (10- to 15-cent), or high (15- to 20-cent) impact on retail milk prices, as reflected in an increased price for a gallon of milk. Assuming no NEDC reimbursements and a medium impact on retail milk prices, OMB estimated that a 15-cent increase in the retail price of milk in the first 6 months of the NEDC would increase state WIC program costs by about $721,300, which would require a reduction in program participation of about 3,000 people if the states did not spend the additional money. OMB also estimated that school lunch and breakfast program costs would increase by $1.2 million during the first 6 months of the NEDC\u2014an increase that would have to be absorbed by schools or passed on to families who pay for meals and snacks. For the same period, OMB also estimated that participants in USDA\u2019s Food Stamp Program who reside in the NEDC states would pay an additional estimated $2.4 million because of increased retail milk prices\u2014an amount that the federal government would not be required to pay because it is likely that national average milk prices would not have increased sufficiently to warrant an increase in benefits. Even if the price increase were large enough to trigger an increase in the index used to establish program benefits, only a small portion of the additional program benefits would go to food stamp recipients in the NEDC states, because all recipients nationwide would receive the increase.", "Researchers at the University of Vermont, who were asked by the NEDC commission to conduct the study, also relied on limited data. Wang et al. focused on the NEDC\u2019s potential impact on the WIC program and analyzed retail milk price and program participation data for the period between June 1997 and February 1998. They accounted for NEDC reimbursements to the states\u2019 WIC programs and examined retail milk prices in Boston and Hartford. Their analysis concluded that WIC program participation had not been significantly affected by the NEDC during the time frame analyzed. The study also concluded that retail milk prices in Hartford increased significantly more than in Boston, an increase that might be explained by differences in market concentration and competition. However, the authors concluded that their study results had two principal limitations: (1) their analysis was limited to Boston and Hartford and (2) the NEDC had been in effect only since July 1997, thus providing a small amount of data for the analysis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Interregional Impacts of Three Compact Alternatives in 1999", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides our 1999 estimates of the interregional farm- and wholesale-level impacts of the NEDC, an expanded NEDC, and an expanded NEDC combined with a southern compact on various dairy sector indicators.

We recognize that the National Agricultural Statistics Service revised its estimates of New England's milk production for 2000. However, our estimates of the impacts of the NEDC are based primarily on 1999 data. While we also used preliminary data for 2000 to estimate the impacts for that year, we note that these data are preliminary and as a result, we did not conduct sensitivity analyses for that year. Further, a 2-percent adjustment in New England's milk production would be unlikely to affect our estimates of the NEDC's impact on noncompact regions in the country. 2.  We recognize that before USDA's milk marketing order regulatory reforms took effect in January 2000, New York was in a different milk marketing order than were the New England states.  However, we do not model New York as being in a different milk marketing order. Rather, the dairy model that we used to estimate the impact of compacts aggregates states on a regional basis.  As discussed in appendix II, the states included in the model's Northeast region include the six NEDC states, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Because the model is a regional model, the NEDC is represented as being part of the Northeast region. As a result, the model is unable to estimate the impact of compact states on noncompact states within the same region. 3.  We disagree that the report misrepresents the regulation's design and function. We state that all raw milk used for and sold as fluid milk in the six NEDC states is subject to the NEDC's regulations, not just milk produced by dairy farmers in the six NEDC states. We have revised the report to explicitly state that farmers in New York may receive NEDC payments.  However, the impact of the NEDC on dairy farmers in New York was beyond the scope of work that we agreed to perform for Senator Kohl. 4.  We concur that New York dairy farmers have received NEDC payments, based on data developed by the NEDC commission. The report, however, does not state that $50 million has been provided to New York dairy farmers. We have revised the report to include data published by the NEDC that indicates that about 1,300 New York dairy farmers have received NEDC payments that have averaged, on an annual basis, $9,812 since the NEDC began in July 1997.5.  We disagree that the model omits from consideration the regulatory treatment of plants located outside New England that sell packaged milk in New England\u2014partially regulated plants. The model provides for shipments of packaged milk between compact and noncompact regions. A discussion of how this is modeled is included in appendix II. 6.  USDA officials and other dairy economists who have analyzed the NEDC's impact on the premium structure in New England told us that the NEDC has had the effect of eroding much of the market-driven over-order premium that processors had been paying prior to the NEDC's establishment, as opposed to premiums that cover services provided by cooperatives or handlers. This effect would vary, however, depending upon market forces. Such market forces could fluctuate from month to month and year to year. Much of the data needed to determine the specific impact that the NEDC has had on the premium structure in New England are proprietary in nature, and thus we do not have access to this data. 7.  The report states that the trends regarding farm attrition rates and production in the NEDC states and the rest of the country were similar, both before and after the compact. This is not to say that the percentage change in the NEDC states was identical to the percentage change in the rest of the country. Regarding attrition, the number of farms has been steadily declining both within the NEDC states and in the rest of the country, but at a slightly different rate. 8.  We disagree that the report concludes that the NEDC had no impact on farm attrition. We note that the percentage reduction declined slightly following the NEDC's establishment but conclude that it is difficult to determine the extent to which the NEDC, relative to other factors, may have changed farm attrition. 9.  We disagree that the herd size discussion is less helpful. We believe that providing a longer-term perspective that includes national trends provides a useful context for discussing dairy policy options. 10. We agree that the NEDC's impact on retail milk prices is a complex question. Our report states that many factors affect retail prices, in addition to the farm-level price of milk. We revised the report to recognize that retail milk prices, after increasing by about 20 cents per gallon in July 1997, subsequently fell by as much as 5 to 7 cents per gallon for several months. 11. We relied on USDA's Food and Nutrition Service's analysis of the NEDC's impact on the Food Stamp Program. On the basis of its analysis, USDA was unable to determine if the NEDC increased program benefit levels. According to USDA, if the NEDC's impact on retail milk prices in the NEDC states had caused a $1 increase in national benefit levels, this would have resulted in an additional $60 million in federal funding per year. Aside from the issue of whether the NEDC has increased federal costs, USDA indicated that the NEDC has increased Food Stamp Program participant costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, M.
