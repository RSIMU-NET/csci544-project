The majority filed their applications since 2007. Also, a sizable minority of approved claimants filed long enough after injury that they lost some retroactive benefits; SSA is considering a legislative proposal to change the retroactive period for wounded warriors. Among wounded warriors receiving DOD or VA disability benefits, 4 percent were receiving SSA benefits. In addition, more than 6 percent had applied but were not receiving SSA benefits; some still had claims pending. Those with higher disability ratings from DOD or VA were more likely to receive SSA benefits. To varying degrees, SSA, DOD, and VA have increased outreach to help wounded warriors learn about and apply for SSA disability benefits. Since 2007, SSA has increased its outreach to DOD and VA medical facilities and has tailored benefit information for wounded warriors. DOD--and to some extent VA--have incorporated SSA information into their case management practices as well. Locally, DOD and SSA staff have worked together to reach servicemembers, but collaboration has been less common at VA hospitals. Meanwhile, there are challenges to reaching and working with this population. Many of the wounded warriors may not be ready or able to hear about SSA benefits early in their recovery. Also, brain injuries and mental health disorders can impede many wounded warriors' ability to absorb outreach information and complete the benefit application. With help from DOD and VA, SSA has been able to expedite processing of wounded warrior claims. SSA has established a nationwide policy requiring its offices to give priority to wounded warrior claims. For their part, DOD helps SSA identify claimants who are wounded warriors, and VA has expedited the transfer of its medical records and histories to SSA. However, DOD's paper-based transfer of medical records to SSA is slow, which can prolong the process by weeks or months, according to claims processing staff."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since October 2001, more than 1.6 million military personnel have been  deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation  Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Estimates of the number wounded in these conflicts  vary widely depending, for example, on the medical conditions counted.  Due to advances in battlefield medicine, a larger proportion of military  personnel are surviving their wounds than in previous years, though often  with serious medical conditions including amputations, traumatic brain  injury (TBI), and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For those  servicemembers and veterans who were wounded, injured, or became ill  while on active duty since 2001\u2014also called wounded warriors\u2014a range  of financial benefits are available. The Department of Defense (DOD) and  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provide disability benefits that  are linked to military service. In addition, the Social Security  Administration (SSA) administers disability benefit programs that are not  tied to military service, but may still be an important part of a wounded  warrior\u2019s total package of financial assistance\u2014if they are aware of and  apply for these benefits. Wounded warriors may receive certain benefits  from SSA while receiving DOD or VA disability benefits.", "Some reports issued in 2007 raised questions concerning whether the  federal government had been sufficiently focused on helping wounded  warriors access SSA disability benefits. For example, the Veterans\u2019  Disability Benefits Commission report suggested that many veterans who  may be eligible for SSA disability benefits are not receiving such benefits,  and that outreach to disabled veterans regarding SSA benefits may be  inadequate. Partly as a result of the controversy surrounding conditions at  the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Congress has focused increased  attention on the care that recovering servicemembers and veterans  receive, including efforts to ensure they receive their entitled benefits. The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 requires DOD and  VA to develop, in consultation with other relevant federal agencies, a  comprehensive policy for the improvement of case management for  recovering servicemembers and veterans. This plan is to include  connecting wounded warriors with SSA benefits, although the statute does  not formally specify a role for SSA in the case management process. In  accordance with increased congressional attention and statutory  requirements, DOD and VA have developed several new programs  designed to help wounded warriors heal and transition back to their  military duties or to civilian life. These and other programs may potentially  help wounded warriors learn about and apply for SSA benefits. However,  while a number of studies have looked at DOD and VA efforts to help  recovering servicemembers and veterans, these studies have not focused  on how SSA benefits have been provided to wounded warriors and the  challenges in doing so.", "Given this context, you asked us to determine (1) the number of wounded  warriors who have applied and been approved for SSA disability benefits,  and the extent to which wounded warriors who receive DOD or VA  disability benefits also receive SSA benefits; (2) the extent to which SSA,  DOD, and VA have worked to inform wounded warriors about and help  them apply for SSA disability benefits, and the challenges confronting this  outreach effort; and (3) whether the agencies have taken any steps to  facilitate the processing of wounded warriors\u2019 SSA disability benefit  claims.", "In addressing these questions, we have focused our research on wounded  warriors who were wounded, injured, or ill while on active duty since  2001. More specifically, to answer the questions, we reviewed policy and  other documents from SSA, DOD, and VA, and interviewed officials  responsible for outreach and case management policies at each agency.  We selected seven DOD and five VA medical treatment facilities in order to  examine local-level activities and collaboration. We selected several of  these sites because they serve a majority of the severely wounded  servicemembers. The remaining sites were selected based on factors  including the number of pending SSA claims submitted by wounded  warriors in the region in which the facility is located and the number of  recovering servicemembers assigned to each facility. For each selected  location, we generally interviewed staff from the DOD or VA facility, an  SSA district office, and the state office responsible for medical evaluation  of SSA claims; at some sites we also interviewed servicemembers. In  addition, we obtained and analyzed administrative data from SSA, DOD,  and VA on wounded warriors\u2019 utilization of financial benefits from all  three agencies. We found the administrative data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our report. Finally, to gain a broader understanding of  the experiences and opinions of wounded warriors, we conducted a mail  survey of a sample of wounded warriors who had applied for SSA  disability benefits during fiscal year 2008. The survey attained a 53 percent  response rate. While a nonresponse bias analysis revealed that older and  more educated individuals were more likely to respond to our survey than  younger and less educated individuals, it did not reveal large or systematic  bias in our overall survey results. Unless otherwise noted, percentage  estimates from the survey have 95 percent confidence intervals within plus  or minus 8 percentage points or less of the estimate, and are generalizable  to the entire population of fiscal year 2008 applicants.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 through  September 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Once the SSA field office staff verify that nonmedical eligibility  requirements are met, the claim is sent to the state\u2019s Disability  Determination Services (DDS) office for determination of medical  disability. If the claim is approved, a claimant will be notified and will  receive benefits, including limited retroactive benefits for some DI  claimants. If the claim is rejected, a claimant has 60 days to request that  the DDS reconsider its decision.

Disability ratings range from 0  (least severe) to 100 percent (most severe) in increments of 10 percent.  For example, an amputation of a thumb could result in a 40 percent rating,  while an amputation of a ring finger could result in a 20 percent rating.

Servicemembers who receive a disability rating of 30 percent or higher\u2014 regardless of their years of service\u2014generally will be retired and may be  eligible for lifelong benefits, including retirement pay and health insurance  for the servicemember and their family.

SSA has for some time been  considering a legislative proposal to change or waive the statutory  retroactive benefit period specifically for wounded warriors to help those  who may not apply soon enough after disability onset.

Also, those with TBI may be  classified as having chronic brain syndrome, or as having any of a number  of neurological conditions depending on their symptoms. Aside from  mental disorders, most of the remaining wounded warriors with allowed  claims had a musculoskeletal condition as their primary impairment.

Conducted from 2006 to 2007, the pilot was designed  to help reduce the time it was taking for information to be disseminated  and decisions to be made on SSA benefits for servicemembers. Following  this project, SSA headquarters directed its field offices to increase their  efforts to work with DOD and VA medical facilities to conduct outreach.  SSA officials reported that their field offices have subsequently been in  contact with wounded warriors or staff at almost 30 DOD facilities and  more than 50 VA facilities across the country. In addition, the agency has  developed publications and established a Web site with SSA disability  benefits information that has been customized for wounded military  personnel and veterans. These resources explain, for example, how  military pay affects eligibility for SSA\u2019s programs and how to apply. (See  fig. 7.) SSA officials told us although SSA does not have any formal  practices in place to determine whether or not outreach has been  effective, there is an internal workgroup\u2014consisting of staff from  headquarters, regional, district, and DDS offices\u2014that meets quarterly to  discuss and share successful local efforts in serving wounded warriors, as  well as best practices for reaching wounded warriors.", "DOD has taken a number of steps to help wounded warriors learn about  and apply for SSA disability benefits, particularly since 2007. The  department has incorporated information about SSA benefits into the  many case management programs run by the service branches\u2014programs  already providing a range of advice and assistance to wounded warriors  and their families. We found that these programs\u2014the Army Wounded  Warrior Program, the Warrior Transition Brigade, the Marine Wounded  Warrior Regiment, and the Navy Safe Harbor Program\u2014covered SSA  benefits in their case management review materials or list SSA as a  resource on their Web sites. (See fig. 8 for an example of one of the  assessment tools used in the case management programs to help ensure  SSA disability benefits are discussed.) Additionally, DOD case managers  for these programs received briefings from SSA as part of their training  regimen, according to DOD officials. A DOD official told us the agency has  also included SSA disability programs in the portfolio of information to be  disseminated through its Recovery Coordination Program, which was  included in the comprehensive recovery plan for wounded warriors  developed in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2008. This recovery plan does not formally spell out how  DOD case managers should conduct outreach on SSA benefits or work  with SSA.", "DOD has also added SSA benefit information to a variety of resources  available to wounded warriors\u2014for example, DOD\u2019s Compensation and  Benefits Handbook dedicates a section to the subject. DOD also has Web  sites that contain some information about SSA and it has added links to  SSA\u2019s own wounded warrior Web site. Meanwhile, information about SSA  disability benefits has also been included in joint briefings that DOD, VA,  and other agencies conduct at all DOD bases and military treatment  facilities for servicemembers who are being discharged from the military.", "VA has also taken some steps to inform and help wounded warriors apply  for SSA disability benefits. In 2007, the agency, working with DOD,  established the Federal Recovery Coordination Program, which is a  counterpart to DOD\u2019s Recovery Coordination Program, to provide a case  management framework for ensuring that the most severely wounded  warriors are engaged by SSA\u2019s benefit programs, as well as by other  support services. Additionally, VA case managers for the Federal  Recovery Coordination Program have received information from SSA  specialists regarding SSA disability benefits. Meanwhile, staff from other  VA programs in existence prior to 2007, such as the Office of Seamless  Transition, told us they sometimes include the topic of SSA benefits when  case managers interview veterans about their clinical and nonclinical  needs. VA has also included SSA disability information in other resources  that are available to wounded warriors, such as VA\u2019s Federal Benefits for  Veterans and Dependents and VA\u2019s Web site. This Web site also has links  to SSA\u2019s Web site. In addition, the agency\u2019s Veterans Benefits  Administration (VBA), which administers VA disability compensation  benefits, includes on its application forms some limited information about  SSA benefits and SSA contact information. VBA officials told us, however,  that their disability compensation claims representatives do not have any  particular guidance or training for how or whether to refer wounded  warriors to SSA when they apply for VA benefits. According to a VA  official, while VA began a phone outreach campaign in 2006 to OEF/OIF  veterans to remind them about VA\u2019s health and benefit services, this  campaign has not included information about SSA\u2019s programs and  benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Local Agency Outreach Efforts at Treatment Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Turning to the sites we contacted, we often found that DOD medical  treatment facilities were working with local SSA offices to better inform  wounded warriors about SSA disability benefits and help them apply. This  level of interaction was less common at VA sites. At all of the DOD military  treatment facilities we visited, including the four major facilities that treat  the most severely wounded warriors, SSA representatives were coming  onto the base to conduct briefings and field questions about SSA disability  benefits from wounded warriors and staff. At many of these locations, SSA  representatives had also taken benefit applications. For example, at Walter  Reed Army Medical Center, SSA representatives were holding office hours  twice a week to take applications, and provide regular briefings to  wounded warriors and case managers. At Brooke Army Medical Center,  SSA claims representatives were conducting presentations at weekly  briefings for recovering servicemembers and also taking benefit  applications. Moreover, according to our survey of wounded warriors who  had applied for SSA disability benefits they faced few obstacles to finding  SSA representatives, if and when they did seek help. Based on the survey,  we estimate that almost three quarters\u201473 percent\u2014of wounded warrior  applicants found it was easy to make initial contact with an SSA  representative. Most of the local SSA staff we spoke with told us that in  recent years they have reached out to local DOD personnel to obtain  access to DOD\u2019s facilities where potentially eligible wounded warriors can  be found. Some of the local SSA offices we spoke with noted that it had  taken some time to establish working relationships at some of the DOD  bases they contacted. For example, they said certain DOD personnel at the  Brooke Army Medical Center had not been routinely cooperative until the  base commander issued an order. In addition, several local SSA officials  told us that staff turnover at DOD facilities creates a challenge. For  example, officials from the Colorado Springs SSA office told us that  because of frequent staff turnover at Evans U.S. Army Hospital (Fort  Carson), new DOD staff are often unaware of SSA benefits and as a result  do not refer servicemembers to SSA who might be eligible for SSA  disability benefits.", "In the course of our site visits, we also learned that in serving DOD  facilities and the wounded warrior population, most of the SSA offices we  conducted interviews at had representatives who had developed some  expertise in working with military personnel. Some local SSA officials told  us these representatives know what questions to ask and what documents  to collect to support wounded warriors\u2019 claims. Wounded warriors also  reported that they found SSA officials helpful. Based on our survey, we  estimate that about 63 percent found the information they received from  SSA representatives to be helpful. In one location where SSA did not  employ specialized claims representatives, DOD case managers had  become more familiar with SSA disability benefits and had developed a  customized walk-through presentation to help wounded warriors better  navigate SSA\u2019s application process. See figure 9 for an excerpt from this  presentation.", "On the other hand, at the medical centers operated by VA through its  Veterans Health Administration, we found less contact underway between  local SSA and VA staff. According to VA officials at the medical centers we  contacted, none of them had an SSA representative onsite to answer  questions or take applications, though some of the VA officials we spoke  with thought it would be a good idea. Case managers at three of the five  sites we contacted said they refer veterans to a specific point of contact ata local SSA office who may specialize in wounded warrior claims. Officials  at the other two sites did not always have a point of contact at all of the  local SSA offices in the area. Case managers at one of these sites said tha when they refer veterans to SSA without a specific point of contact, the  veterans have challenges navigating SSA\u2019s automated phone system or  reaching a live representative. In addition, case managers at two sites to us that they had received some training from SSA on SSA\u2019s disability  benefits. However, case managers at the other sites told us they had n received training from SSA on SSA disability benefits and believed having such training would be beneficial. Table 1 summarizes the outreach  activities at DOD and VA medical facilities we contacted.", "As for the regional VBA offices, officials at the offices we contacted said  their claims staff sometimes refer wounded warriors to SSA when they  apply for VA benefits. For example, officials at one regional office we  contacted said veterans applying for certain types of benefits are also  referred to SSA. However, according to officials at two of the sites we  contacted, they generally do not provide any SSA literature or work with  SSA personnel in local outreach efforts such as VA\u2019s Stand Down event  and its Welcome Home event.

According  to local officials from all three agencies we spoke with, wounded warriors  may not be ready or able to learn about SSA disability benefits early in  their recovery. Some may not have yet accepted the severity of their  injuries, while others have physical or psychological conditions that have  not stabilized. Case managers told us the timing of when they inform  wounded warriors about SSA disability benefits is therefore determined on a case-by-case basis. Based on our survey, we estimate that the timing of  when wounded warriors first learned about SSA disability benefits varied  widely, with 44 percent reporting they first heard about the benefit 12  months or longer after injury (see fig. 10).", "It was also suggested by case managers and some recovering  servicemembers that wounded warriors may be hesitant to apply for SSA  benefits because of misinformation about SSA disability benefits given by  their colleagues. Wounded warriors were just as likely to first hear about  SSA disability benefits from their peers as from their anagers, according to our survey estimates (see fig. 11). Moreover, both  m wounded warriors and agency officials told us that the information about  SSA benefits that gets passed among military personnel is not always  accurate. For example, some recovering servicemembers said their peers   DOD or VA case  had told them they would not qualify for SSA disability benefits and others said they had heard that in order to avoid paying retroactive benefits, S SA  initially denies benefits to servicemembers who have been hospitalized for long periods of time.", "Another challenge with regard to wounded warriors applying for SSA  disability benefits is reported to be the benefit application itself, which  reflects civilian more than military careers. At some of the sites we  contacted, case managers and wounded warriors themselves said it was  difficult for wounded warriors to complete the employment section of the  application because it does not take into account, for example, the  difference between a civilian 8-hour day and military duty, which requires  a 24-hour obligation. Of all the aspects of the application process we ask about in our survey, wounded warriors most often reported underst the SSA application to be difficult (see fig. 12).  ed  anding  an have  ds.", "Finally, outreach efforts face an elusive target at times, given that TBI a PTSD are conditions that are not necessarily diagnosed early and that can develop months or years later. According to some agency officials,  servicemembers who have yet to be diagnosed with TBI and PTSD are not  nd  likely to receive information on all of the services, programs, or benefits to  which they could be entitled. Several agency officials reported they have  challenges in diagnosing TBI and PTSD, because these conditions are  often not as clearly apparent as some other physical disabilities. Wounded  warriors also may not realize they have these conditions and as such, may  not have sought out medical attention.

SSA attempts to identify wounded, injured, or taken ill during military service since October 1,  2 001, regardless of whether the disabling event occurred domestically or  overseas. In order to give priority to these cases, SSA identifies wounded  warriors in two ways. First, starting in 2005, applicants can self identify  as  a wounded warrior when submitting the disability application. SSA add ed  questions on its disability claims application to enable servicemembers orveterans to identify themselves as having served in the military and to  indicate their dates of service. Secondly, in a 2008 memorandum of  understanding, DOD agreed to send weekly electronic updates to SSA with the key identification information of servicemembers who were wounded,  injured or became ill in the OEF/OIF theaters, to further assure that  military applicants are identified. Any applicant is automatically iden as a wounded warrior if their name appears on the DOD list.", "The agency requires that its district offices, DDS offices, and hearing offices give priority to wounded warrior claims. SSA uses a process  originally developed to expedite terminally ill (critical) case a for all wounded warrior disability claims. For such cases, SSA staff who  receive a disability claim request via SSA\u2019s toll free phone number are hin 3   required to schedule an applicant interview at an SSA field office wit working days, if possible, to take the full application. Then the SSA field  office refers the application to a state DDS office for review, and follows  up within 7 days to ensure receipt by the DDS system. DDS staff, in tur n,  are required to prioritize wounded warrior cases, by considering them as  early as possible. Moreover, DDS staff are instructed to comprehensively  consider these cases by exploring all potential physical and mental  impairments, including those that may be suggested by any of the medicalevidence, such as signs of PTSD. Lastly, as with critical cases, SSA staff atthe hearing stage are required to schedule wounded warrior cases in the  first available open hearing slots.", "Additionally, SSA and DDS offices track and monitor wounded warrior  cases to ensure that they receive expedited handling. SSA\u2019s regional  offices track these claims through  the different stages of the disability  determination process, including appeals. One SSA regional office, for  example, generates reports listing all wounded warrior cases, including  the level of adjudication for each claim and its status. Also, officials i some DDS offices told us that they generate reports on processing time specifically for wounded warrior cases, such as reports that list the  pending wounded warrior cases, which may include other details of the  claim. Officials in one DDS office stated that they monitor all wounded  warrior cases at specific intervals after they have been received from  SSA\u201430 days, 45 days, and 90 days\u2014to ensure cases are not unnece delayed.", "To support agency processing of wounded warrior cases, SSA officials reported that they have created specific training and briefing materials for  SSA and D DS staff, including information about TBI and PTSD. According  to an SSA official, the agency provided on-site training at local offices a through videoconferences, and instructed staff to be alert to reported  symptoms that may be related to TBI and PTSD. The SSA official told us  that within DDS offices, all disability examiners received some training on  TBI and PTSD. In addition to training, SSA reported that it provides  training materials and guidance for staff to use when handling wounded  warrior cases. For example, SSA issued guidance in August 2007 that cites  indicators of possible TBI conditions, such as exposure to an improv ised  explosive device blast, a motor vehicle accident, or a fall. This policy also specifies clinical markers, such as the loss of consciousness for more than 6 hours following traumatic brain injury. At several DDS offices, DDS staff reported that they received training material from SSA on TBI and PTSD.  Finally, SSA issued guidance and reminders to staff on the proper  treatment of wages for active duty soldiers.", "In spite of their wounded warrior training, all of the nine DDS offic contacted reported difficulties, for several reasons, in making  determinations on TBI and PTSD cases. First, though officials at almost all  the DDS offices we spoke with reported that DOD and VA records  generally provide enough information regarding physical disabilities, this  is not necessarily the case regarding psychological problems. The DDS  officials told us that, consequently, they generally need to order more  consultative exams to assess potential cases of TBI or PTSD. Secondly,  some DDS officials also reported that servicemembers sometimes ask  them not to include a diagnosis of TBI or PTSD in their records. According  to officials in two of these DDS offices, servicemembers have either been  reluctant to discuss symptoms of PTSD with DDS staff, or asked DDS staff  not to pursue a mental health disability claim. Finally, because PTSD and  in some cases, TBI, may take several months to manifest, and because  these conditions may improve over time, officials in some DDS offices said  it can be difficult to determine whether they meet the 12-month duration  requirement. To address this challenge, SSA has a specific TBI policy: If a  TBI disability determination is not possible within 3 months of injury, SSA  and DDS staff are required to defer adjudication until at least 3 months  es we  after injury, and may defer again until at least 6 months after injury, in  order to observe and evaluate the claimant\u2019s condition.", "Given these challenges, eight of the nine DDS offices we visited had  assigned specific, experienced examiners to process wounded warrior  n  claims. An SSA official stated that those DDS examiners who focus o wounded warrior cases\u2014ranging between three and five specialists at  each of several DDS offices we visited\u2014received more extensive training.", "These officials reported employing special techniques for working with wounded warriors. For example, some officials told us they can draw  t  conclusions from pieces of evidence in DOD and VA medical records tha  to  indicate possible PTSD or TBI, and then collect additional information make a determination regarding the presence of those conditions, even if such conditions have not been officially diagnosed. Also, an official in one ,  DDS office reported that she looks at the VA disability evaluation decision when available, for useful information about an applicant\u2019s medical  condition; though officials in that office and several others said VA\u2019s actual  disability decisions do not affect their own determinations. Further,  officials told us they work aggressively to obtain medical records from the VA, DOD, or private medical facilities. Officials in one DDS office said they conduct a special review of any wounded warrior claim that is going to be  denied to ensure that all the evidence was considered appropriately.  Lastly, because wounded warrior claimants may take more time to  respond to information requests, one DDS official typically gives them more time, and will do more to track down their needed information records.", "To furthe worked with VA to improve the quality of and speed with which VA  forwards veterans\u2019 medical records to the DDS offices. According to an SSA official, due to DDS concerns about the timeliness and condition VA medical records, SSA and VA began to work together in 1999 to  improve data sharing. A period of pilot testing resulted in the creation of  the Standard Summary, which is an electronic extraction of a standa set of pertinent medical records from a patient\u2019s overall records that is  transmitted electronically to DDS offices upon request. In 2006, VA issued  a directive to formalize use of the Standard Summary by VA medical  facilities. Generally, the Standard Summary includes 2 years of patient  health information and 4 years of major exams and patient discharge  summaries. Specifically, the Standard Summary includes information su e  as the onset dates of all known health problems for a patient, the futur clinic appointments scheduled for a patient with VA providers, and all  outpatient medical visits. (See app. IV for a list of elements included in th r expedite claims processing for wounded warriors, SSA has  e  Standard Summary.) In order to establish usage of the Standard Summa ry,  the appropriate local VA staff are encouraged to work with local DDS staff  to enter an agreement and ensure that their computer systems are  compatible. Individual DDS offices may also work with VA hospitals to  tailor the data extracted by the Standard Summary for their needs.  official told us that, as of June 2009, roughly 75 percent of VA hospitals  nationwide were using the Standard Summary to send information to DDS  offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Obtaining DOD Records Can Slow SSA\u2019s Eligibility Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Wounded warrior claim decisions are prolonged in some instances  because of difficulties in obtaining DOD medical records, most DDS  officials reported.

Many of the DDS offices we  visited reported lengthy wait times\u2014ranging from a few weeks to a few  months\u2014to receive paper records from MTFs. Corroborating this point,  DOD case managers at several MTFs also reported delays in obtaining  wounded warrior medical records. Several DDS officials we spoke with  said such delays can slow down the disability determination process. DDS  staff in some locations reported that local MTFs had made efforts to  reduce these delays. For example, an official in the Texas DDS office  noted that the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center and Brooke Army  Medical Center (the local MTFs) agreed to allow a DDS staffer onsite full  time in the records office to respond to DDS medical record requests. At  several other DDS offices, staff reported that local MTFs responded to  their requests for faster records response by designating a point of contact  to handle all DDS requests, which has improved response time.", "Decision making can also be affected by the cumbersome nature of DOD  records. Many DDS staff said DOD records are lengthy, and can number  hundreds, if not thousands, of pages. They also noted that some medical  documents that are referenced in the records are missing when received  by DDS offices, or can sometimes be redundant.", "DOD has, in recent years, begun to computerize military medical records  and make them transferable to VA, in part due to a recent statutory  requirement. According to DOD officials, DOD currently stores certain  types of information\u2014such as patient consultations and evaluation  notes\u2014in electronic medical records at 21 MTFs, representing more than  half of DOD\u2019s inpatients. The agency is working toward storing more  records electronically. Furthermore, after a 10 year joint effort, DOD is  transferring some medical records electronically to VA. For example, since  January 2009, DOD and VA have been electronically exchanging drug  allergy information on more than 27,000 shared patients. Ultimately, better  exchange of electronic medical records could allow servicemembers to  transition seamlessly between the two departments with a single,  comprehensive medical record. In part, DOD and VA\u2019s electronic records  exchange is spurred by recent legislation. Congress has mandated that  DOD and VA jointly develop and implement, by September 30, 2009,  electronic health record systems or capabilities that are fully  interoperable and comply with applicable federal interoperability  standards.", "By comparison, DOD and SSA\u2019s electronic exchange efforts are far less  developed.

SSA and DOD  have told us that one approach for sharing records electronically could be  through the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), an emerging  new federal technology.

Disability benefits available through SSA can be a critical part  of the financial assistance they receive. Congress has required that DOD  and VA help wounded warriors gain access to the benefits and services  they need, including SSA disability benefits, and to consult with other  relevant federal agencies in doing so. Outreach to wounded warriors about  SSA benefits has, in fact, been stepped up since 2007, particularly by SSA  and DOD in several key sites where there has been a well-coordinated  message reinforced by each agency. These efforts may well have  contributed to the substantial increase in wounded warrior applications  for SSA disability benefits since 2007. Certainly, significant challenges  remain to reaching those warriors who are currently being discharged, as  evidenced by the numbers who have reported to us difficulties with the  SSA benefit application, or the fact that nearly one in four of those with  approved claims has foregone retroactive benefits because they did not  apply soon enough after their injury. The sooner that SSA completes its  analysis of whether a legislative fix to the retroactive benefits formula is  warranted, the sooner this information can be brought to the Congress for  consideration.", "While VA has also taken steps to help wounded warriors who have  become veterans, collaboration between VA and SSA at VA medical  centers has not been consistent. Furthermore, VA does not provide its  claims processing staff with any guidance on referring veterans to SSA  when they apply for veterans\u2019 benefits. Yet the risk of not reaching  wounded warriors is greater once they are discharged and re-enter civilian  life. Absent a commensurate level of outreach on the part of VA and SSA,  it seems likely that some veterans who are, in fact, severely disabled, will  not receive all the financial support to which they are entitled. Of  particular concern are veterans discharged prior to 2007\u2014when the focus  on outreach increased\u2014and those with impairments such as PTSD and  TBI, which may emerge after discharge from the military. While not all  veterans rated as 100 percent disabled by DOD or VA will necessarily be  eligible for SSA benefits, the fact that more than one-third of these  severely disabled veterans have not even applied for SSA disability  benefits suggests there is more to be done in this area.", "Finally, SSA policies for accelerating the processing of wounded warrior  applications appear to have had a positive effect. Yet some wounded  warriors will still experience a long wait for an eligibility determination if  their DOD medical records are slow to be transferred. The inability of  DOD and SSA to share records electronically undermines SSA\u2019s ability to  fully expedite the process.

We selected these  locations based on several factors. First, we selected the four military  treatment facilities that serve most of the severely wounded  servicemembers: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval  Medical Center (Bethesda), Naval Medical Center San Diego, and Brooke  Army Medical Center. We also selected two of the four VA polytrauma  centers that serve severely wounded servicemembers and veterans: VA  Palo Alto Health Care System and Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical  Center. We then selected additional sites (1) that are in regions of the  country where varying numbers of wounded warriors had SSA disability  benefit claims pending between July 2007 and March 2008, (2) that have  varying numbers of recovering servicemembers in affiliated Army warrior  transition brigades, and (3) that according to SSA have varying levels of  collaboration with local SSA offices.", "At the selected locations, we conducted on-site or telephone interviews  with a range of local staff from different agencies. We spoke with DOD and  VA case managers, hospital management staff, VA liaisons, and medical  records personnel about their practices for informing wounded warriors  about SSA benefits, helping them apply, or both. At almost every site we  also contacted the SSA district offices and DDS offices that serve the  medical facility. At the SSA and DDS offices, we spoke with office  managers and other staff, including public affairs staff, claims examiners,  and claims representatives about their practices for informing wounded  warriors about SSA benefits, helping them apply, and processing wounded  warrior claims.", "At five of the MTFs we also held discussion groups with recovering  servicemembers to learn about their experiences in hearing about and  applying for SSA disability benefits. We interviewed a total of 45  servicemembers and 1 veteran at these five sites. At each of these sites, we  asked MTF personnel to identify servicemembers who were wounded, ill,  or injured since October 2001 and had applied, or were in the process of  applying, for SSA benefits. See table 2 for the list of offices we contacted.", "We also contacted three Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) regional  offices that administer VA disability compensation benefits\u2014Atlanta,  Georgia; Waco, Texas; and San Diego, California.

We  analyzed data from the electronic folder\u2019s Structured Data Repository  (SDR) on wounded warriors\u2019 claims at the initial, reconsideration, and  hearing stages of adjudication, including claimant demographic  information, date of disability onset, date of application, primary  diagnosis, and the decision on the claim. We analyzed data from the  Master Beneficiary Record (MBR) on Disability Insurance (DI) claims that  were denied for technical\u2014nonmedical\u2014reasons, including the  application date and the reason for denial. We analyzed data from the  Supplemental Security Record (SSR) on Supplemental Security Income  (SSI) claims that were denied for technical reasons, again including  application date and reason for denial. Finally, we used data from SSA\u2019s  831 file to analyze the elapsed time from application date to DDS decision  date, both for wounded warriors and for SSA\u2019s overall DI and SSI  caseloads. SSA provided us with data on all applicants who have been  flagged in its systems as wounded warriors. Applicants have been flagged  as wounded warriors when they self-identify (since 2005) or when they  appear on a list of wounded warriors provided weekly by DOD (since  2008). In addition, SSA identified wounded warriors who appear on the  DOD list\u2014which is cumulative and includes those wounded in Operation  Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)\u2014but who  applied prior to 2008, when SSA started using this list to flag applicants. To  assess the reliability of these SSA data, we reviewed agency documents,  interviewed agency officials, and performed electronic testing of certain  data. We found several limitations with the data, including the lack of  complete data on claims at the Appeals Council and federal court stages of  adjudication, and unreliable application date data for claims beyond the  initial stage. However, we found the data we used to be sufficiently  reliable for our reporting objectives.", "In addition, to determine the extent to which wounded warriors receiving  DOD or VA disability benefits also receive SSA disability benefits, we  obtained data from DOD and VA and asked SSA to match these data  against its databases. DOD provided us with monthly data from the Retired  Pay File for the period January 2000 to September 2008, on individuals  who were first on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL) or  Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL) in January 2000 or later. These  data included the individuals\u2019 social security numbers, DOD disability  rating, and monthly benefit amount received. We created a customized file  of DOD data by extracting the data only for those individuals who were on  the TDRL or PDRL in July 2008 and first appeared on the TDRL or PDRL in  November 2001 or later, i.e. who were in active duty in October 2001 or  later. (The Retired Pay File does not include an indicator of whether an  individual is disabled as a result of service in the OEF/OIF campaigns.) VA  provided us with data from its VETSNET system on veterans receiving VA  disability compensation benefits as of July 2008, who were identified in  VETSNET as being OEF/OIF veterans. OEF/OIF veterans are identified by  VA in two ways: (1) through a regular match of VA data with a Defense  Manpower Data Center (DMDC) file containing the social security  numbers of OEF/OIF veterans, and (2) by VA staff when they take  disability benefit applications from veterans. The data file provided by VA  included veterans\u2019 social security number, disability ratings, and benefit  amounts received in July 2008. We then asked SSA to match the social  security numbers contained in the DOD and VA files against its MBR and  SSR databases, to determine whether these individuals had ever applied  for SSA disability benefits and if they were receiving SSA benefits in July  2008. To assess the reliability of the VA and DOD data, we interviewed  agency officials, reviewed agency documents, and performed electronic  testing of certain data. We found several limitations with the data,  including the fact that those identified as OEF/OIF veterans in VA\u2019s data  may not include all veterans who served since 2001 and are receiving VA  disability compensation benefits.

To assess the  potential for bias in our estimates, we used SSA administrative data to  examine differences between the respondents and nonrespondents to our  survey. Our analysis showed that respondents to our survey were typically  older and more educated than individuals in our sample who did not  respond to the survey; these differences were significant at the 95 percent  confidence level. In light of these results, we conducted three separate  sets of tests to compare individuals in different age and education  categories. The first set of tests examined demographic and usage  variables from the survey\u2014that is, whether or not wounded warrior had  received information or application assistance, or had taken certain steps  in the course of completing the SSA disability application. The second set  of tests examined wounded warriors\u2019 opinions about sources of  information or assistance and steps taken in the course of applying for  benefits. The third set of tests examined item nonresponse for each item in  the survey. Only two of the initial differences we observed persisted after  adjusting for multiple comparisons. First, we found that older  respondents were more likely to have served in the Reserves or National  Guard than their younger counterparts. However, we did not find any  significant differences in demographics, usage of specific resources,  opinions, or item nonresponse between respondents that served in the  Reserves or National Guard and those that did not. Second, we found that  college-educated individuals were more likely than those without a college  degree to have found information from VA personnel helpful\u2014of  individuals with an opinion, 100 percent of college educated individuals  found VA personnel to be very or somewhat helpful, compared to 76  percent of those without a college degree.", "Our failure to detect systematic differences does not guarantee that our  results are free from potential nonresponse bias; as with any survey, to the  extent respondents differ from nonrespondents in undetected ways, our  results should be interpreted with caution.
