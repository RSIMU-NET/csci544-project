The goals of the modernization are to achieve more uniform weather services across the nation, improve forecasts, provide better detection and prediction of severe weather and flooding, permit more cost-effective operations through staff and office reductions, and achieve higher productivity. Four major programs are included in this modernization: NEXRAD, the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), the Next Generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-Next), and the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). NEXRAD, ASOS, and GOES-Next\u2014commonly referred to as the observing systems\u2014are operational, while AWIPS is scheduled to be deployed nationwide in June 1999.", "Ongoing problems\u2014both developmental and operational\u2014have surrounded the modernization. For example, we have reported that the NEXRADs have not always been operating when severe weather threatened, and ASOS has fallen short of performance and user expectations. We have made specific recommendations and testified numerous times over the past several years on these performance problems, developmental problems, and problems relating to cost and schedule. As a result of its continuing problems, the NWS modernization has been included\u2014both in 1995 and 1997\u2014on our list of high-risk government programs. Although NWS acknowledges that key problems confront the new systems, it has found that the new radars and satellites have improved forecasts and warnings.", "As part of its modernization program, NWS plans to reorganize its field office structure from 256 offices (52 Weather Service Forecast Offices and 204 Weather Service Offices), to 121 Weather Forecast Offices (WFO). NWS field offices provide basic weather services such as forecasts, severe weather warnings (e.g., tornadoes, flash floods), warning preparedness, and, where applicable, aviation and marine forecasts. Warning preparedness includes coordinating with local emergency management, law enforcement agencies, and the media on notification of and response to severe weather events. It also relies on human observers to collect and report data on severe weather events."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NEXRAD: A Brief Overview", "paragraphs": ["NEXRAD is a Doppler radar system that measures wind velocity in severe weather, tracks storm movement and intensity, and generates data and imagery for forecasters and other users, such as air traffic controllers. There are 141 operational NEXRADs in the conterminous United States: 120 are operated by NWS and 21 are operated by the Department of Defense.The system allows forecasters at each weather office to access radar information via dedicated and dial-up connections to neighboring radars. This information is very important for observing and tracking significant weather. The reported cost of the NEXRAD program was nearly $1.5 billion. NWS reports that the new radars have helped to increase the accuracy and timeliness of warnings for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and other hazardous weather events.", "In 1995, we reported that NWS did not know if its radars were meeting the availability requirement because it was not monitoring availability effectively. We recommended that NWS analyze and monitor NEXRAD system availability on a site-specific basis and correct any shortfalls in system availability that this analysis shows. NWS concurred with these recommendations and began monitoring system availability on a site-specific basis. However, as we reported in our February 1997 high-risk report, not all NEXRADs were meeting the availability requirement.", "Each NEXRAD consists of three major subsystems\u2014the radar data acquisition (RDA) subsystem, the radar product generator (RPG) subsystem, and the principal user processor (PUP) subsystem\u2014and associated communications among these subsystems. Each NEXRAD includes about 400,000 lines of code for operating the radar, processing radar signals, generating and transmitting data, and displaying data products.", "The RDA consists of a 10 centimeter wavelength Doppler weather radar that collects the raw data to, among other things, (1) measure wind velocity in severe weather, (2) provide improved estimates of precipitation amounts, and (3) track storm movement and intensity. The technology needed to perform this function includes an antenna, pedestal, radome (a dome-shaped covering to protect the antenna), transmitter, and receiver. Included in the RDA unit is hardware and software necessary for a variety of control functions, including signal processing, monitoring, and error detection, as well as archiving the radar data. A computer processes the radar signals to create digital data that can be further processed by the RPG.", "The RPG includes all hardware and software necessary for turning the data into displayable data products. Specifically, the RPG provides real-time generation, storage, and distribution of products for users. It includes hardware and software required for system control; status monitoring; and error detection, archiving, and data processing.", "The PUP is a workstation that consists of the hardware and software required for the request, display, local storage and annotation, and distribution of products by forecasters. It also includes the hardware and software required for local control, status monitoring, archiving, and communicating with other users. The PUP maintains a dedicated communication link to the RPG located on-site, and it routinely receives NEXRAD products. The PUP also has the capability to access data from RPGs at other NEXRAD sites.

From January 1992 through December 1994, 18 flash flood events were reported in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. There was no advanced warning for any of the 18 events. However, from January 1995 through February 1998, advanced warnings were issued for 17 of the 22 reported events; and the average warning lead time for these was just over 2 hours.

NWS officials told us that well before the NEXRAD imagery is used to issue a flash flood warning, forecasters use other sources of information to track storms as they approach the west coast, primarily high resolution satellite imagery from the GOES-Next satellites and detailed numerical models. However, as storms approach the counties covered by the Los Angeles/Oxnard WFO, the detailed imagery from the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD is used to issue flash flood warnings, along with the neighboring NEXRADs (i.e., Vandenberg Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and Santa Ana).", "NEXRAD estimates of precipitation rate and amount are extremely important for flash flood forecasting; however, NWS officials at the Los Angeles/Oxnard WFO told us that these estimates are not always exact and are supplemented with rainfall sensors and human observers. For example, radar reflectivity is affected by many factors, including precipitation growth, evaporation, and type; thus, the precipitation observed by the NEXRAD beam is not absolute and may not be exactly representative of that reaching the ground.

NWS officials provided us with detailed case studies of three February 1998 El Nino-related flash flood events that show how the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD imagery was used to issue flash flood warnings. For example, on February 6, 1998, NWS issued a flash flood warning for southern Ventura and western Los Angeles counties at 8:35 a.m. based on the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD information. At 8:40 a.m., the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD showed heavy thunderstorms moving on shore near Ventura Harbor. By 10 a.m., rafts were needed to evacuate a mobile home park in Camarillo. As the storm moved eastward, a 20-foot sinkhole opened near Moorpark road in Thousand Oaks and mudslides closed the Pacific Coast highway in Malibu.", "Eight of the nine other users of Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD data we interviewed told us that they are pleased with the information it provides, and that it was an important tool for performing their jobs accurately and timely. For example, officials from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, who are responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the flood control and water conservation facilities in Los Angeles County, told us that the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD has significantly improved the quality and quantity of radar information they receive and that it is substantially more detailed, accurate, and timely than previous radars. An official from the Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center, who provides day-to-day forecasts during flight briefings to ensure the safety of aircraft, described the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD data as \u201ccritical.\u201d The Director of Emergency Services for Ventura County considers the radar \u201cto be an effective tool for identifying the appropriate level of response for county emergency services during inclement weather.\u201d The Los Angeles District Corps of Engineers, which manages water control projects in Southern California, including 10 Corps of Engineers reservoirs in the Los Angeles area that provide flood protection to downstream areas, said that data from the radar \u201chas proven to be a very valuable water management tool.\u201d One user, the director of Fox Weather, a private meteorological service, said that the radar was less useful for Ventura County than for the Los Angeles area because it had not significantly improved his ability to provide precipitation estimates for his clients. NWS officials acknowledge that precipitation estimates are not always exact and therefore are supplemented with surface observation networks and human observers.", "Several of the users also described specific incidents where data from the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD was especially useful in informing the public and protecting lives and property. For example, the TV weathercaster for KCBS-TV used the radar during an intense storm on December 6, 1997, to track the storm and give people in Ventura County up-to-the-minute reports. With the data from the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD, he was able to provide warnings to specific locations before the storm occurred. In addition, the program administrator of the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Office of Emergency Services told us that 48 hours after the La Conchita landslide in March 1995, data from the Sulphur Mountain radar was used to provide a warning of another severe storm moving into the La Conchita area.

If the NEXRAD is down for more than 28 hours in a 30-day month, the 96 percent availability requirement will not be met. The Los Angeles/Oxnard WFO technicians who troubleshoot outages and are responsible for making repairs told us that most of the outages associated with the months when the availability requirement was not met required ordering a part that was not on hand. They added that it usually takes at least 24 hours for the parts to arrive after they are ordered. The technicians told us that they strive to meet the 96 percent requirement, but that it is very difficult, considering that it takes 1 hour to get to the site from the Los Angeles/Oxnard WFO, time to analyze the problem, usually 24 hours to receive the needed part, 1 hour to get back to the site, and time to repair the NEXRAD.", "The technicians told us that they have tried using other shipping companies to hasten delivery of replacement parts, but these efforts have not resulted in improved delivery times. The technicians also told us that deliveries of parts are sometimes delayed because some ordered parts are not in stock and some replacement parts have been defective. For example, in May 1996, when the NEXRAD\u2019s availability was only 90.3 percent, there was a 48-hour logistics delay because the required part was out of stock. In addition, the low availability reported in February 1997 occurred because the ordered part was defective.", "Until the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD consistently meets the 96 percent availability requirements, NWS risks not having the data it needs to accurately and quickly predict flash floods and other severe weather. NWS headquarters officials acknowledged the availability shortfalls and stated that they are monitoring the failure rates of parts and are attempting to reduce the failure rates or to more quickly replace the parts that fail most often. For instance, they told us that they are installing fans to keep the transmitter, a component that has been unreliable since the inception of the NEXRAD program, from overheating. They added that the NEXRAD program has a 6-year modification plan which, among other things, identifies deficiencies in hardware performance and reliability and prioritizes NWS\u2019 improvement activities. They are also attempting to stock those spare parts that fail frequently at each location; however, they added that their budget does not allow for a full set of spares at each location.
