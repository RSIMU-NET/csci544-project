At the request of the Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Senator Grassley, and Representative Schakowsky, GAO performed work to identify problems in DOD's controls over premium class travel. This testimony focuses on (1) the extent of DOD premium class travel, (2) the effectiveness of key internal control activities and examples of improper premium class travel resulting from internal control breakdowns, and (3) DOD's control environment over premium class travel. In a companion report being issued today, GAO made numerous recommendations--that DOD concurred with--to strengthen key internal control activities and improve the overall control environment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Breakdowns in internal controls and a weak control environment resulted in a significant level of improper premium class travel and millions of dollars of unnecessary costs being incurred annually. Based on extensive analysis of records obtained from DOD's credit card issuer--Bank of America, GAO found that for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD spent almost $124 million on about 68,000 premium class tickets that included at least one leg of premium class service, primarily business class. To put the $124 million into perspective it exceeded the total travel expenses--including airfare, lodging, and meals--spent by each of 12 major CFO agencies. The price difference between a premium class ticket and a coach class ticket ranged from a few dollars to thousands of dollars. Based on statistical sample testing, GAO estimated that 72 percent of DOD's fiscal year 2001 and 2002 premium class travel was not properly authorized, and that 73 percent was not properly justified. GAO estimated that senior civilian and military employees accounted for almost 50 percent of premium class travel. Further, our data mining showed that 27 of the 28 most frequent premium class travelers were senior DOD officials. Lack of oversight and a weak overall control environment characterized DOD's management of premium class travel. DOD and the military services (1) did not have accurate and complete data on the extent of premium class travel, (2) issued inadequate policies on premium class travel that were inconsistent with government travel regulations and with each other, (3) did not issue guidance on how to document the authorization and justification of premium class travel, and (4) performed little or no monitoring of this travel. During the course of our audit, DOD began updating its travel regulations to more clearly articulate and to make more stringent the circumstances under which premium class travel can be authorized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) management of premium class travel acquired using centrally billed  accounts.  Our related report, released today and developed at the request  of this Subcommittee, Senator Grassley, and Representative Schakowsky,  describes the problems we identified in DOD\u2019s controls over premium class  travel.  These problems are illustrative of DOD\u2019s long-standing financial  management problems, which are pervasive, complex, and deeply rooted in  virtually all business operations throughout the department.  Such  problems led us in 1995 to put DOD financial management on our list of  high-risk areas\u2014those that are highly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and  abuse\u2014a designation that continues today. Due to these vulnerabilities,  and our identification of fraud, waste, and abuse in a series of testimoniesand reportswe issued in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 on DOD\u2019s individually  billed travel cards, you asked us to audit controls over the other major form  of payment used by DOD for travel expenses\u2014centrally billed accounts.", "The centrally billed accounts are used by most DOD services and units to  purchase transportation services such as airline and train tickets, facilitate  group travel, and procure other travel-related expenses, while the  individually billed accounts are used by individual travelers for lodging,  rental cars, and other travel expenses.  For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD  travelers incurred $7.1 billion in expenses on the centrally billed and  individually billed travel card accounts, with about $2.8 billion related to  the use of centrally billed accounts.", "Today, I will summarize our work on DOD\u2019s use of premium class travel  charged to its centrally billed accounts.  Federal travel regulations define  premium class travel as any class of accommodation above coach class,  that is, first or business class.  General Services Administration (GSA) and  DOD regulations state that travelers must use coach class accommodations  for official business air travel\u2014both domestic and international\u2014except  when a traveler is specifically authorized to use premium class.  These  regulations restrict premium class travel to limited circumstances.  The  regulations state that travelers on official government business must  exercise the same standard of care in incurring expenses that a prudent  person would exercise if traveling on personal business.  Premium class  flights are not something travelers are entitled to simply because certain  conditions exist.  Rather, when possible, travelers are to plan their travel in  advance to avoid the necessity for premium class travel.", "My testimony will focus on (1) the extent of premium class travel during  fiscal years 2001 and 2002\u2014the most recently available data at the time of  our work, (2) the effectiveness of key internal control activities and  examples of improper premium class travel resulting from internal control  breakdowns, and (3) DOD\u2019s control environment over premium class  travel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extent of Premium Class Travel Is Significant", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 1, DOD spent nearly $124 million on airline tickets that  included at least one leg of premium class service during fiscal years 2001  and 2002.  However, because DOD did not maintain centralized data on  premium class travel, we had to extract these data from Bank of America\u2019s  databases of DOD centrally billed account travel, which included over 5.3  million transactions for airline tickets valued at over $2.4 billion.  Due to  limitations in the information collected on individual transactions, we were  unable to determine the amount of premium class travel by military service  or the amount of premium class travel used for domestic versus overseas  flights.", "DOD\u2019s premium class air travel accounted for a very small percentage of  DOD travel overall\u2014about 1 percent of total DOD airline transactions and  5 percent of total DOD dollars spent on airline travel.  However, to put the  $124 million that DOD spent on premium class travel in perspective, the  amount DOD spent on premium class-related travel during these 2 fiscal  years exceeded the total travel and transportation expenses\u2014including  airfare, lodging, and meals\u2014spent by each of 12 major agencies covered by  the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, including the Social Security  Administration; the Departments of Energy, Education, Housing and Urban  Development, and Labor; and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration.", "The difference between the price of a premium class ticket and a  comparable coach class ticket can range from negligible\u2014particularly if  the traveler traveled within Europe\u2014to thousands of dollars.  In one  instance, a traveler\u2019s first class flight between Washington, D.C., and Los  Angeles was 14 times, or about $3,000 more than, the price of a comparable  coach class flight at the government fare.", "Higher-ranking civilian personnel and military officials accounted for a  large part of premium class travel.  Based on our statistical sample, we  estimated that DOD civilian employees under the General Schedule (GS)  grade GS-13 to GS-15 (supervisors and managers), Senior Executive  Service (SES) (career senior executives), presidential appointees with  Senate confirmation, and DOD senior military officers O-4 and above  accounted for almost 50 percent of premium class travel.  GAO\u2019s Guide for  Evaluating and Testing Controls Over Sensitive Payments considers  travel by high-ranking officials, in particular senior-level executives, to be a  sensitive payment area because of its susceptibility to abuse or  noncompliance with laws and regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Control Activities Not Effectively Implemented", "paragraphs": ["Control activities occur at all levels and functions of an agency.  They  include a wide range of diverse activities such as authorizations, reviews,  approvals, and the production of records and documentation.  For first and  business class travel, we tested control activities designed to provide  assurance that premium class travel transactions are (1) authorized and  (2) justified in accordance to the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), issued  by GSA to implement travel policies for federal civilian employees and  others authorized to travel at government expense, and DOD\u2019s travel  regulations, including the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), which  applies to uniformed service members, and the Joint Travel Regulations  (JTR), which applies to DOD civilian personnel who are subject to GSA\u2019s  travel regulation.  These regulations generally require that premium class  travel be specifically authorized in advance of travel and only under  specific circumstances.  (See app. I for further details of GSA and DOD  premium class travel regulations.)  For example, although FTR and DOD  travel regulations allow premium class travel when the scheduled flight  time is in excess of 14 hours, these regulations prohibit use of premium  class accommodation if the traveler has scheduled rest stops.", "In addition to the FTR and DOD regulations, we also applied the criteria set  forth in our internal control standards and sensitive payments guidelinesin evaluating the proper authorization of premium class travel.  For  example, while DOD travel regulations and policies do not address the  issue of subordinates authorizing their supervisors\u2019 premium class travel,  our internal control standards consider such a policy to be flawed from an  independence viewpoint.  Therefore, a premium class transaction that was  approved by a subordinate would fail the controls over authorization test.  Using these guidelines, we estimated, based on our statistical sample, that  an estimated 72 percent of the DOD centrally billed travel transactions  containing premium class travel for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 were not  properly authorized and that an estimated 73 percent were not properly  justified.", "As shown in table 2, an estimated 64 percent of premium class transactions  did not contain travel orders that specifically authorized the traveler to fly  premium class, and thus the commercial travel office\u2014a travel agency\u2014  should not have issued the premium class ticket.  Another 6 percent of  premium class transactions were related to instances where the travel  order authorizing business class was not signed (left blank) or the travel  order authorizing first class was not signed by the service secretary or his  or her designee, as required by DOD regulations.  If the travel order is not  signed, or not signed by the individual designated to do so, DOD has no  assurance that the substantially higher cost of the premium class tickets  was properly reviewed and represented an efficient use of government  resources.  We also estimated that 2 percent of the premium class  transactions involved situations where a subordinate approved a superior\u2019s  travel.  Although these limited instances do not necessarily indicate the  existence of a significant systemic problem, allowing subordinates to  approve their supervisors\u2019 premium class travel is synonymous with self- approval and reduces scrutiny of premium class requests.", "Another internal control weakness identified in the statistical sample was  that the justification used for premium class travel was not always  provided, not accurate, and/or not complete enough to warrant the  additional cost to the government.  As previously stated, premium class  travel is not an entitlement and recent changes to DOD regulations state  that in the context of lengthy flights premium class travel should only be  used when exceptional circumstances warrant and alternatives should be  explored to avoid the additional cost of premium class travel.  As shown in  table 2, an estimated 72 percent of premium class transactions were not  authorized and therefore because they were not properly authorized they  could not have been justified.  An additional two transactions in our sample  which were authorized but not justified in accordance with DOD\u2019s criteria  increased our estimate of premium class transactions that were not  justified to 73 percent.", "Considering the significant breakdown in key internal controls, it was not  surprising that our audit identified numerous examples of improper  premium class travel that cost DOD significantly more than what would  have been spent on a coach class ticket.  Table 3 illustrates a few of the  types of unauthorized and/or unjustified transactions from both our  statistical samples and data mining work, along with a comparison  between amounts actually paid and the comparable coach fares at that  time.  Without authorization or adequate justification, these cases illustrate  the improper use of premium class travel and the resulting increase in  travel costs.  For further details on the cases shown in table 3, as well as  additional examples of unauthorized and/or unjustified transactions, please  refer to the report that we released today on this subject.", "Our work also included data mining to identify the individuals who traveled  premium class most frequently.  We identified 28 of the most frequent  premium class travelers from the 68,090 premium class transactions during  fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  All but 1 of the 28 frequent travelers were at  least GS-13 civilians or O-4 military, that is, senior DOD personnel.  We  found that the most frequent travelers were, in most instances, authorized  to obtain premium class travel by people at the same or higher levels, with  3 of the 28 failing the authorization test because they or their subordinates  authorized their travel orders.  However, we determined that many of the  transactions were improper because their justification was not supported  by the documentation provided or did not adhere to FTR and DOD travel  regulations.", "Some cases involving frequent travelers were questionable because the  justification documentation was not adequate to determine whether the  transaction met DOD\u2019s criteria.  We found that 12 of the 28 frequent  premium class travelers justified their more expensive flights with a  medical condition.  However, we identified several anomalies in the  application of medical condition justification, as evidenced by travelers  who used both coach and premium class accommodations during flights of  similar duration and during the same time period.  For example, frequent  traveler 1 in table 4 took 14 premium and 31 coach class trips during fiscal  years 2001 and 2002.  Many of the coach class trips, for example, from  Washington, D.C., to Honolulu or cities in California were similar in  duration to premium class trips from Washington, D.C., to Frankfurt or  Amsterdam.  This may indicate that additional steps should be taken to  verify the validity of the medical certification.  During testing, an Army  official at the Traffic Management Office informed us that his office  forwards all medical certifications to the Surgeon General for an opinion  before recommending to the Secretary of the Army that approval be  granted for first class travel.
