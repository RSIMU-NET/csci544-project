Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. Pipeline system disruptions could result in commodity price increases or widespread energy shortages. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the federal oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity.", "This statement summarizes previous GAO findings related to TSA's management of its pipeline security program. It is based on a prior GAO product issued in December 2018, along with updates as of April 2019 on actions TSA has taken to address GAO's recommendations from the report. To conduct the prior work, GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators\u2014a non-generalizable sample selected based on volume, geography, and material transported\u2014and representatives from five pipeline industry associations. GAO also reviewed information on TSA's actions to implement its prior recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has developed and provided pipeline operators with voluntary security guidelines, and also evaluates the vulnerability of pipeline systems through security assessments. However, GAO's prior work, reported in December 2018, identified some weaknesses and made recommendations to strengthen TSA's management of key aspects of its pipeline security program.", "Pipeline security guidelines . GAO reported that TSA revised its voluntary pipeline security guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current NIST framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. GAO recommended that TSA implement a documented process for reviewing and revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals. TSA has since outlined procedures for reviewing its guidelines, which GAO is reviewing to determine if they sufficiently address the recommendation.", "Workforce planning . GAO reported that the number of TSA security reviews of pipeline systems has varied considerably over time. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations within its Pipeline Security Branch have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for the branch have varied significantly, ranging from 1 full-time equivalent in 2014 to 6 from fiscal years 2015 through 2018. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies\u2014such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise\u2014necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. GAO recommended that TSA develop a strategic workforce plan, which TSA plans to complete by July 2019.", "Pipeline risk assessments . GAO identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline security reviews. For example, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. GAO recommended that TSA update its risk ranking tool to include up-to-date data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and fully document the data sources, assumptions and judgments that form the basis of the tool. As of April 2019, TSA reported taking steps to address these recommendations. GAO is reviewing documentation of these steps to determine if they sufficiently address the recommendations.", "Monitoring performance . GAO reported that conducting security reviews was the primary means for TSA to assess the effectiveness of its efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of key security review recommendations for the past 5 years. GAO recommended that TSA take steps to update information on security review recommendations and monitor and record their status, which TSA plans to address by November 2019"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made 10 recommendations in its December 2018 report to strengthen TSA's management of its pipeline security program.

The security of the nation\u2019s pipeline systems is vital to public  confidence and the nation\u2019s safety, prosperity, and well-being. More than  2.7 million miles of pipelines transport and distribute the natural gas, oil,  and other hazardous liquids that U.S. citizens and businesses depend on  to operate vehicles and machinery, heat homes, generate electricity, and  manufacture products. A minor pipeline system disruption could result in  commodity price increases, while prolonged pipeline disruptions could  lead to widespread energy shortages. A disruption of any magnitude  may affect other domestic critical infrastructure and industries that are  dependent on pipeline system commodities.", "The interstate pipeline system runs through both remote and highly  populated urban areas, and it is vulnerable to accidents, operating errors,  and malicious attacks. In addition, pipelines increasingly rely on  sophisticated networked computerized systems and electronic data,  which are vulnerable to cyber-attack or intrusion. Given that many  pipelines transport volatile, flammable, or toxic oil and liquids, and given  the potential consequences of a successful physical or cyber-attack,  pipeline systems are attractive targets for terrorists, hackers, foreign  nations, criminal groups, and others with malicious intent.", "New threats to the nation\u2019s pipeline systems have evolved to include  sabotage by environmental activists and cyber-attack or intrusion by  nations. For example, in October 2016 environmental activists forced the  shutdown of five crude oil pipelines in four states. In March 2018, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Cybersecurity and  Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) reported that a nation-state  had targeted organizations within multiple U.S. critical infrastructure  sectors, including the energy sector, and collected information pertaining  to Industrial Control Systems.", "TSA, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has primary  oversight responsibility for the physical security and cybersecurity of  transmission and distribution pipeline systems. TSA\u2019s Security Policy  and Industry Engagement\u2019s Pipeline Security Branch is charged with  managing its pipeline security program. The Pipeline Security Branch first  issued its voluntary Pipeline Security Guidelines in 2011 and released  revised guidelines in March 2018. The Pipeline Security Branch is  responsible for conducting voluntary security reviews\u2014Corporate  Security Reviews (CSR) and Critical Facility Security Reviews (CFSR)\u2014 which assess the extent to which the 100 most critical pipeline systems  are following the intent of TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines. CSRs are  voluntary on-site reviews of a pipeline owner\u2019s corporate policies and  procedures.

In  addition, this statement contains updates from TSA as of April 2019 about  actions it has taken to address the recommendations made in our  December 2018 report. For this report, we reviewed and analyzed  relevant documents from TSA and other federal entities, evaluated TSA  pipeline risk assessment efforts, and interviewed TSA officials, including  officials within TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Branch. We also interviewed  representatives from five major industry associations and security  personnel from 10 pipeline operators to collect a range of perspectives on  topics relevant to pipeline security. While the information gathered during  the operator interviews cannot be generalized to all pipeline operators, it  provides a range of perspectives on a variety of topics relevant to pipeline  security. Additional details on the scope and methodology are available in  our published report.", "The work upon which this statement is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, all 10 of the  pipeline operators we interviewed stated they had implemented the  voluntary 2011 TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines that the operators  determined to be applicable to their operations. Five of the 10 pipeline  operators characterized the guidelines as generally or somewhat effective  in helping to secure their operations, 1 was neutral on their effectiveness,  and 4 did not provide an assessment of the guidelines\u2019 effectiveness.  Pipeline operators and industry association representatives reported that  their members also use the Interstate Natural Gas Association of  America\u2019s Control Systems Cyber Security Guidelines for the Natural Gas  Pipeline Industry, the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Pipeline SCADA  Security standard, and the National Institute of Standards and  Technology\u2019s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework as sources of  cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices that may be scaled  and applied to address a pipeline operator\u2019s cybersecurity risks.", "We found that TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Branch had issued revised  Pipeline Security Guidelines in March 2018, but TSA had not established  a documented process to ensure that revisions occur and fully capture  updates to supporting standards and guidance. The guidelines were  revised to, among other things, reflect the dynamic threat environment  and to incorporate cybersecurity principles and practices from the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework, which was initially issued in February 2014.  However, because NIST released version 1.1 of the Cybersecurity  Framework in April 2018, the guidelines that TSA released in March 2018  did not incorporate cybersecurity elements that NIST added to the latest  Cybersecurity Framework, such as the Supply Chain Risk Management  category. Without a documented process defining how frequently TSA is  to review and, if deemed necessary, revise its guidelines, TSA cannot  ensure that the guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best  practices of physical security and cybersecurity.", "We recommended that TSA implement a documented process for  reviewing, and if deemed necessary, revising TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security  Guidelines at regular defined intervals. DHS agreed and estimated that  this effort would be completed by April 30, 2019. In April 2019, TSA  provided us with documentation outlining procedures for reviewing these  guidelines. We are currently assessing this information to determine if it  sufficiently addresses this recommendation.", "We also found that TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines lacked clarity in  the definition of key terms used to determine critical facilities. TSA initially  identifies the 100 highest risk pipeline systems based on the amount of  material transported through the system. Subsequently, pipeline  operators are to use criteria in the Guidelines to self-identify the critical  facilities within those higher risk systems and report them to TSA. TSA\u2019s  Pipeline Security Branch then conducts CFSRs at the critical facilities  identified by pipeline operators. However, our analysis of TSA\u2019s data  found that at least 34 of the top 100 critical pipeline systems TSA deemed  highest risk indicated that they had no critical facilities. Three of the 10  operators we interviewed stated that some companies that reported to  TSA that they had no critical facilities may possibly be taking advantage  of the guidelines\u2019 lack of clarity. For example, one of TSA\u2019s criteria for  determining pipeline facility criticality states that if a facility or combination  of facilities were damaged or destroyed, it would have the potential to  \u201ccause mass casualties or significant health effects.\u201d Two operators told  us that individual operators may interpret TSA\u2019s criterion, \u201ccause mass  casualties or significant health effect,\u201d differently. For example, one of the  operators that we interviewed stated that this criterion could be  interpreted either as a specific number of people affected or a sufficient  volume to overwhelm a local health department, which could vary  depending on the locality.", "Without clearly defined criteria for determining pipeline facilities\u2019 criticality,  TSA cannot ensure that pipeline operators are applying guidance  uniformly, that all of the critical facilities across the pipeline sector have  been identified, or that their vulnerabilities have been identified and  addressed. We recommended that TSA\u2019s Security Policy and Industry  Engagement\u2019s Surface Division clarify TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines  by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities.
