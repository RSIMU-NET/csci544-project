In our report, Child Support Enforcement: Families Could Benefit From Stronger Enforcement Program (GAO/HEHS-95-24, Dec. 27, 1994), we found that the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) lacked essential management tools, such as programwide planning and goal-setting, to assess and improve program performance. On the basis of these findings, we made several recommendations to strengthen OCSE\u2019s leadership and management of the program.

Created in 1975 under title IV-D of the Social Security Act, the program\u2019s purpose is to strengthen existing state and local efforts to find noncustodial parents, establish paternity, obtain support orders, and collect support payments. The national program incorporated the already existing state programs.", "Increasingly, the child support enforcement program has faced the growing demands of millions of children and families seeking support payments. In 1995, the program reported an estimated 20.1 million cases, an increase of about 50 percent over the previous 5 years. In that year, states collected about $10.8 billion in child support payments for 3.8 million cases, or 19 percent of the program\u2019s caseload. Expenditures to administer the child support enforcement program totaled about $3.0 billion, of which $2.1 billion was paid by the federal government. In response to the growing caseloads and as a way to improve performance, some states have privatized child support enforcement services to supplement their own state-administered programs.", "The program serves two populations: families receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and those who do not. The Congress believed that government welfare expenditures could be reduced and to some extent prevented by recouping AFDC benefits from noncustodial parents\u2019 child support payments. In addition, the Congress believed that earlier enforcement of child support obligations for families not receiving AFDC could help prevent these families from needing support in the form of welfare benefits.", "Families entering the child support enforcement program require different combinations of services at different times. In some cases, the child\u2019s paternity has not been established and the location of the alleged father is unknown. In these cases, the custodial parent needs help with every step: locating the alleged father, establishing paternity and a child support order, enforcing the order, and collecting the support payment. In other cases, the custodial parent may have a child support order, and child support enforcement agencies must periodically review and, possibly, modify the order as a result of changes in the employment status or other circumstances pertaining to the noncustodial parent. For AFDC recipients, the family receives the first $50 of any current child support payment each month without a decrease in its AFDC payment. Any remainder of the child support payment is retained by the federal and state governments in proportion to their respective AFDC payments. Payments that are collected on behalf of non-AFDC families are sent to the families.", "The child support enforcement program is an intergovernmental program involving the federal, state, and local governments. Federal responsibility for the program lies within the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF). Within ACF, OCSE central office and regional office staff develop policy and oversee the state-administered programs. Figure 1.1 illustrates the partnership arrangements among key players involved in overseeing and administering the child support enforcement program.", "The child support enforcement program envisions an aggressive federal role in ensuring that states provide effective child support services. Federal law requires OCSE to establish standards for state program effectiveness and to monitor the operation of state programs through periodic audits. To help ensure program effectiveness, OCSE has the authority to assess financial penalties if an audit reveals that a state has failed to meet certain program standards. Among other functions, regional office staff review state child support enforcement plans to ensure consistent adherence with federal requirements. OCSE also is authorized to work with the states to help them plan, develop, design, and establish effective programs. In addition, OCSE is responsible for maintaining effective working relationships with federal, state, and local government officials; national interest groups; and other key stakeholders in the child support field.", "State child support enforcement agencies are responsible for all activities leading to securing from noncustodial parents financial support and medical insurance coverage for children. The agencies provide four principal services: (1) locating absent parents, (2) establishing paternity, (3) obtaining and enforcing child support orders, and (4) collecting support payments. To meet federal requirements and receive federal funds, state child support enforcement programs must have HHS-approved plans indicating compliance with federal law and regulations and must operate in accordance with those plans. HHS can levy financial penalties against states found substantially out of compliance with their plan.", "There are significant differences in the ways state child support enforcement programs are organized, which state organization they report to, what relationships exist between the child support enforcement program and other state agencies, and the policies and procedures that are followed. These characteristics usually vary by the type of service delivery structure, levels of court involvement required by state family law, population distribution, and other variables. For example, some state child support agencies operate their programs with state funds through a network of regional offices, while others share the federal funding with and supervise county and other local jurisdictions\u2019 operations.", "The child support enforcement funding structure was designed to share program costs between the federal and state governments. The federal government matches 66 percent of states\u2019 administrative and certain management information systems development costs and 90 percent of laboratory costs related to paternity establishment. The federal government also pays incentives to states for collection efficiency. These incentives are calculated separately for AFDC and non-AFDC collections by dividing the amount collected for each category by total program administrative costs. On the basis of these calculations, states with higher ratios of collections to program costs receive more incentive funds than states with lower ratios. Incentive payments for AFDC collections range from amounts equal to 6 to 10 percent of the collections. Incentive payments for non-AFDC collections also range from 6 to 10 percent of non-AFDC collections but cannot be greater than 115 percent of the AFDC incentive payments. These incentive payments are funded from the federal portion of recovered AFDC collections. States must share incentives with local governments that bear some of the program\u2019s administrative costs. However, states may use the incentive payments and AFDC recoveries to fund programs other than child support enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO-Reported Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["We reported earlier that clear federal management strategies coupled with state management efforts could better position the child support enforcement program to serve the families that depend on it. The increase in children needing support has focused attention on federal and state efforts to enforce parental responsibilities to support their children. However, these efforts have been hampered by management weaknesses, such as the lack of programwide planning and accurate data, that have kept OCSE from developing specific strategies for contributing to improved program performance and judging how well the program is working. We also reported that OCSE had reduced the level of technical assistance it provided to state programs following reductions in federal program resources. Various organization and staffing changes reduced the number of federal staff assigned to the child support enforcement program, thereby creating communication problems between federal and state program officials. OCSE audits and data collection efforts, while satisfying legal requirements for monitoring and tracking the states\u2019 programs, did not provide either OCSE or the states with adequate information on program results. Moreover, we reported that federal incentive funding was not sufficiently aligned with desired program outcomes.", "On the basis of these and other findings, we made several recommendations to the Secretary of HHS to focus management of the child support enforcement program on results. These recommendations address four key program areas for which OCSE has responsibility: (1) strengthening its partnership with state child support programs, (2) developing its own management strategies for how it will contribute to improved program results, (3) reorienting its audit processes to assess state results, and (4) realigning federal incentive funding with state performance.

Traditionally, federal agencies have used factors such as the amount of program funds, the level of staff deployed, or the number of tasks completed as measures of performance. By only using these kinds of measures, an agency has not considered whether its programs have produced real results. Today\u2019s environment is more results-oriented. The Congress, executive branch, and the public are beginning to hold agencies accountable less for inputs and outputs than for outcomes, such as how programs affect participants\u2019 lives.", "Under GPRA, federal agencies are faced with reorienting their policies, planning efforts, and operations toward measuring and improving program results. To reorient federal planning and management, GPRA requires federal agencies to (1) define their mission and desired outcomes, (2) measure performance, and (3) report performance information as a basis for making management decisions. The first step\u2014defining mission and desired outcomes\u2014requires agencies to develop strategic plans containing mission statements and outcome-related strategic goals. The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, launched the National Environmental Goals Project, a long-range planning initiative under which it involved stakeholders in developing measurable goals, such as managing and cleaning up radioactive waste, for the agency to pursue in improving the quality of the nation\u2019s environment. The second step\u2014measuring performance\u2014requires agencies to develop annual performance plans with annual performance goals and indicators to measure performance. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for example, set up a method to measure its performance by measuring changes in the lead time it gives the public before severe weather events. The third step\u2014reporting performance information\u2014requires agencies to prepare annual performance reports with information on the extent to which they have met their annual performance goals. To implement this step, the Department of Veterans Affairs initiated efforts to provide caregivers improved medical outcomes data to use in improving services to veterans.", "To begin implementing GPRA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated 68 pilot tests for performance planning and reporting in 26 federal entities. OCSE was one of the federal agencies selected by OMB in 1994 to undertake a pilot test. OMB based its selection of OCSE, in part, on OCSE\u2019s previous efforts to develop a 5-year strategic plan; its ability to quantify program goals, such as child support collections; and the involvement of state and local governments as key program administrators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To review OCSE\u2019s progress made toward implementing our previous recommendations, we examined OCSE program management and conducted case studies in seven states (see fig. 1.2).

In addition, an HHS-wide reorganization left OCSE with no organizational control over those HHS regional staff serving as contact points for the states on some program matters.

Also, program results audits could be conducted at the discretion of OCSE\u2019s Director, Division of Audit, considering the history of each state\u2019s program, staff workloads, and other factors. In addition, recent welfare reform legislation\u2014the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996\u2014requires that states review and report annually on their compliance with federal program requirements. Instead of conducting compliance audits, OCSE is required under the legislation to review the states\u2019 compliance reports and provide them with comments, recommendations for corrective actions, and technical assistance.

To date, OCSE has received responses from six states on actions they have taken to address its findings and recommendations. OCSE suspects that it is possible that other states are taking action to correct problems identified but have not yet provided documentation of these actions. Of those states that have notified OCSE, typical corrective actions include the following: establishing procedures requiring periodic reconciliations of collections and expenditure data to ensure accuracy, revising states\u2019 automated system programming to generate collections data without the need for manual data entry, and revising states\u2019 reporting format to document the cumulative fees collected from absent parents for the cost of blood testing to determine paternity.", "The greater emphasis that OCSE has placed on assessing the accuracy of state-reported data corresponds to its audit role contained in the recent welfare reform legislation.

In OCSE\u2019s move toward results-oriented management under GPRA, quality data that are accurate and comparable will be needed to make performance-based incentive payments to states and management decisions on the future direction of child support enforcement. In addition to the reporting systems reviews, the efforts of OCSE\u2019s Performance Measures Work Group to develop a set of GPRA performance measures may also prove useful in improving data quality by bringing about greater comparability in state reporting.", "Given the numerous entities that can be involved in state child support enforcement programs, such as courts, hospitals, and other state and county agencies, we earlier reported that OCSE needed universally understood definitions and procedures by which states can collect and report data. As early as 1992, OCSE undertook efforts through its Measuring Excellence Through Statistics (METS) initiative to improve the comparability of state-reported data by developing standard data definitions for key child support enforcement terms, including a definition for what constitutes a child support enforcement case. In the process of developing measures to assess state performance, the Performance Measures Work Group has built upon the work of the METS initiative by incorporating the use of standardized definitions for measuring state performance. For example, measures that have been developed to assess state performance in obtaining support orders require that states use the METS definition of a child support enforcement case to report these data.", "In 1996, OCSE requested that states test the data requirements for performance measures currently under development. It asked that states identify differences in how they currently compile and report data and how they would be compiled and reported using performance measures. While at the time of our review no state had yet provided OCSE any substantive feedback on the pilot, OCSE officials said that data requirements for several of the proposed performance measures would require states to obtain data from sources other than those that currently provide information on program factors such as out-of-wedlock births and the location of noncustodial parents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Incentive Funding Structure Remains Weakly Linked to State Performance", "paragraphs": ["In our previous report, we found that the incentive funding structure has yet to achieve its potential. In practice, all states\u2014regardless of performance\u2014received some incentive payments. Moreover, the amount of incentive payments depends on a state\u2019s collections and program costs and does not reflect success in achieving each of the three program goals, such as establishing paternities and obtaining support orders. Therefore, we previously recommended that OCSE reexamine the incentive funding structure because of its poor linkage to state program outcomes. Today, the incentive funding structure remains weakly linked with state program performance. A new arrangement that considers progress toward achieving the national program goals will be needed in order to foster improved program results.", "State child support enforcement programs receive 66 percent of their program costs through federal financial participation and additional funds as a result of the incentive funding policy prescribed by law. In 1995, incentive payments to states were estimated at $400 million. However, the current incentive funding structure has two major limitations. First, while funding is awarded to states on the basis of a collections-to-cost ratio, the current structure does not consider other program results, such as increased paternities established and support orders obtained. Second, states receive incentive funding equal to at least 6 percent of their collections, regardless of how well or poorly they perform. Therefore, as currently constructed, federal funding does not provide a real incentive for states to improve their performance.", "OCSE officials told us that the current incentive funding structure does not provide them an effective means to foster improved program results at the state level. They said, for example, that the performance agreements OCSE currently has with the states to improve program results are unenforceable. Under the existing incentive funding structure, if a state fails to meet or exceed stated goals, OCSE does not have the statutory authority to alter the existing incentive funding scheme to adjust the state\u2019s award consistent with its performance.", "The state program officials we interviewed also agree that the current incentive funding structure needs improvement. In designing a new structure, state officials believe that the existing pool of incentive funds should not be reduced and that incentive payments should be based on one or more of several standards, such as improving state performance, surpassing an aggregate level of performance, or completing appropriate corrective actions. State officials also believe that OCSE must help states meet the standards under a new system and should be held accountable for states\u2019 successes or failures. In response to these state views, OCSE officials have continued to work closely with the states to include their priorities in development and approval of the measures used to assess performance of the program. In addition, state officials cited the continued need for uniform data definitions, such as those included in METS, and compliance with program requirements to help ensure that the new system is fair to all states.", "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, when fully implemented, will establish a new incentive funding structure. It requires the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the states, to develop a new incentive funding structure that provides payments to states based on performance. The Secretary must report details of the new system to the Congress by March 1, 1997. The system developed will become effective for fiscal year 2000; the current structure will remain effective until then.

We believe that OCSE should develop its own long-term management strategies, as we had previously recommended, to help meet the national goals and objectives. In accordance with GPRA requirements, OCSE\u2019s activities, core processes, and resources should be aligned to support its mission and help it achieve these goals. Through long-term management strategies, OCSE can prioritize its expanding program responsibilities, conduct operations in direct support of the national goals, specify the results anticipated from implementing its strategies, and develop measures for assessing its own performance. By strengthening the linkage between its management strategies and the national goals, we believe that OCSE will be in a better position to foster improved program results.", "While OCSE has initiated certain management improvements to establish program goals and strengthen its partnership with states, limitations in its audit processes and the federal incentive funding structure continue to constrain improvements in program results. While we recognize that performance measures have yet to be approved, we continue to believe that OCSE should assess state program performance to identify problems states encounter that inhibit their effectiveness and, when appropriate, recommend actions to help states improve their performance. Once approved, performance measures would help define audit criteria for assessing state performance. Moreover, program results audits could help OCSE respond to state requests for additional information on how to improve program performance.", "The incentive funding structure remains weakly linked with state performance. New welfare reform legislation\u2014the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996\u2014requires HHS and the states to develop a new incentive funding structure. The act does not specify the factors to be used in assessing state performance. We believe that the structure should be realigned so that incentive payments are earned for progress toward the agreed upon national goals of increasing the number of paternities established, support orders obtained, and collections received.

We are encouraged by the Department\u2019s commitment to OCSE developing its own long-term management strategy and by these initial efforts.
