JVs are accounting entries manually entered or system generated to record corrections or adjustments in an accounting system. From October 2016 to March 2017, the Working Group identified more than 121,000 unsupported JVs totaling $455 billion in one of its reporting systems, Defense Departmental Reporting System-Budgetary (DDRS-B).", "In the May 2017 Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan Status Report, the Army stated that it had completed its root cause analyses for all JVs. However, GAO found that the Working Group had conducted the analyses on only a small percentage of the total number of unsupported JVs that existed as of March 2017. Specifically, as of March 2017, the Working Group had been focusing on manual JVs processed in DDRS-B, which only represent 10 percent of the dollar value and 3 percent in the total number of unsupported JVs in that system alone. Therefore, the analyses cannot be considered complete because the Working Group had not yet analyzed the remainder of the population, including those in other systems. Members of the Working Group indicated that in March 2017, the Working Group began including system-generated JVs in its analyses, which made up 90 percent in dollar value and 97 percent in total number of unsupported JVs processed in DDRS-B as of March 2017, but had not yet begun identifying any root causes. Members of the Working Group stated that these efforts will be an ongoing, iterative process because of anticipated new challenges that continually arise from new business processes or programs.", "As of March 2017, the Working Group reported that it had developed 38 corrective action plans to address all of the identified root causes of unsupported manual JVs in DDRS-B for the Army's general fund. According to members of the Working Group, 18 of the 38 have been implemented. However, the Working Group is unable to determine how many more corrective action plans will need to be developed to resolve the unsupported JV issue until the root cause analyses are complete. Further, GAO found that the Working Group's monitoring of corrective action plan implementation does not include a method that sufficiently identifies the progress toward fully addressing the issue of unsupported JVs or to what extent each implemented corrective action plan has reduced unsupported JVs. Members of the Working Group stated that the Working Group uses monthly JV metrics reports to monitor its implemented corrective actions, but the reports are not designed to provide the level of detail necessary to sufficiently monitor whether root causes identified are resolved through corrective action plans. Therefore, the metrics cannot demonstrate to what extent the Working Group has reduced unsupported JVs and how much more effort is required to fully address the issue and help ensure that the Army's financial statements are auditable for fiscal year 2018."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Army (1) ensure that the entire population of unsupported JVs is identified and analyzed and (2) develop metrics that sufficiently monitor the extent to which the Working Group has identified root causes and determine the extent to which unsupported JVs are being reduced based on the implemented corrective actions.

These deficiencies prevent DOD from having  auditable financial statements, which is one of the three major  impediments preventing us from expressing an opinion on the  consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government. According to  DOD, one of the contributing factors to its inability to produce auditable  financial statements is the billions of dollars of unsupported journal  vouchers (JV) within its accounting systems, with the largest portion  attributed to the Department of the Army\u2019s (Army) general fund. JVs are  accounting entries to record corrections or adjustments to a business  transaction in an accounting system. While the use of JVs is a common  accounting practice, they should be fully supported with detailed  information to appropriately justify the accounting entries. Without such  support, management and auditors are unable to assess the validity of  the accounting entries, and to the extent that the unsupported JVs are  material to the financial statements, the auditors would be unable to  complete their audit. When financial statements are not prepared with  supported accounting entries, there is a risk that DOD and Army management cannot rely on the Army\u2019s accounting system data when  making management and resource decisions.", "The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014  required that the Secretary of Defense ensure that a full audit is  performed on DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial statements and that the  results be submitted to Congress no later than March 31, 2019.  Therefore, with oversight from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Financial Management and Comptroller (ASA(FM&C)),  personnel from the Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service (DFAS), the Army\u2019s service provider, formed a Journal Voucher  Working Group (Working Group) in February 2015 to address the  inadequate support of JVs affecting the Army\u2019s financial statements. The  Working Group has been tasked to actively work toward reducing the  number of unsupported JVs for the Army\u2019s general fund. Specifically,  one of the main focuses of the Working Group is to determine the root  causes of unsupported JVs and to develop corrective action plans for the  identified root causes. The Working Group conducts biweekly meetings  to discuss current initiatives, any outstanding issues, and progress toward  its goals. Additionally, ad hoc meetings are scheduled as needed.", "This audit was initiated as part of the mandate that requires GAO to audit  the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which cover all  accounts and associated activities of the executive branch agencies,  including DOD, because of the significance of the military services\u2019  financial statements to the audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the U.S. government. Our objectives were to report the extent to which  the Working Group, as of March 2017, (1) performed analyses to  determine the root causes of unsupported JVs for the Army\u2019s general  fund and (2) developed and monitored the implementation of corrective  action plans to address identified root causes of unsupported JVs.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed various Army, DFAS, and  DOD financial reporting guidance; performed walk-throughs of the JV  process; and interviewed agency officials to gain an understanding of the  processes for recording JVs and analyzing causes of unsupported JVs.  We also reviewed documentation provided and interviewed the Working  Group members to determine the extent to which root cause analyses  have been performed and completed as of March 2017 and whether the  population of accounting entries used for analyses included all  unsupported JVs. To address our second objective, we obtained  documentation of and inquired about the development and monitoring of  the implementation of the Working Group\u2019s corrective action plans to  address the root causes identified as of March 2017. We also obtained  and analyzed monthly JV metrics reports (metrics) produced by DFAS.  Members of the Working Group use the metrics as their primary source  for monitoring progress.

Pursuant to  the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, DOD developed and has updated a  Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan. The FIAR Plan  includes the specific actions to be taken and costs associated with   (1) correcting the financial management deficiencies that impair DOD\u2019s  ability to prepare complete, reliable, and timely financial management  information and (2) ensuring that DOD\u2019s financial statements are  validated as ready for audit by September 30, 2017. Further, the NDAA  for Fiscal Year 2014 mandated that the Secretary of Defense ensure that  an audit is performed on DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial statements and  that the results are submitted to Congress no later than March 31, 2019.", "DOD has undertaken several financial management improvement  initiatives over the years to address deficiencies in business systems,  processes, and controls through its FIAR Plan and financial management  reform methodology contained in its FIAR Guidance. In its April 2016  FIAR Guidance, DOD identified seven critical capabilities that are  necessary to achieve auditability. One of the seven critical capabilities  identified is the ability to support or eliminate certain material JVs and  other adjustments made to financial transactions, trial balances, and  financial statements. As of September 2015, DOD determined that the  largest portion attributable to the billions of dollars of unsupported JVs  relates to the Army\u2019s general fund. In 2015, DOD created the Working  Group, made up of both Army and DFAS personnel, to develop solutions  to reduce the number of required JVs and reduce or eliminate the number  of unsupported JVs that affect the Army\u2019s general fund.", "In July 2016, DOD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released a  report indicating that about 90 percent of the dollar value and number of  the Army general fund JVs the OIG tested, which were defined by the  Army as \u201csupported,\u201d were in fact unsupported because the JVs either   (1) forced account balances to agree with other data sources without  reconciling the differences or determining which data sources were  correct, (2) corrected errors or reclassified amounts to other accounts  without adequately documenting why the JVs were needed, or   (3) changed ending balances of accounts without adequate  documentation to support the JVs.", "DOD acknowledged in its November 2016 FIAR Plan Status Report that it  still faces a significant challenge in reducing the number and amount of  unsupported JVs. The November 2016 FIAR Plan Status Report also  set a December 2016 completion date for the Army to (1) perform JV root  cause analyses for all financial statements for all JVs and (2) implement  corrective action plans and verify successful implementation of DFAS\u2019s  corrective actions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army\u2019s Financial Systems", "paragraphs": ["As shown in figure 1, the Army uses multiple systems to document,  record, and report activities at the transaction level, which are then  consolidated and uploaded into DOD\u2019s reporting system known as the  Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS).

JVs can also be manually entered or system  generated in the accounting systems. Manual JVs are those prepared by  DFAS personnel to adjust errors identified during financial statement  compilation, to record necessary accounting entries caused by system  limitations or timing differences, and to prepare required month- and year- end closing accounting entries. System-generated JVs are those  automatically generated based on system change requests and without  manual involvement by DFAS personnel.", "The General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) is the Army\u2019s  primary accounting system used to record the majority of the Army\u2019s  activities, including budget execution, procurement, civilian pay,  collections, and disbursements. The Army also has a separate accounting  system for supply-related transactions called the Global Combat Support  System (GCSS). Accounting entries for transactions recorded in GCSS  are sent to GFEBS to consolidate all of the Army\u2019s transaction data into a  single accounting system. Then, at month\u2019s end, all the information in  GFEBS is uploaded into the budgetary module of DDRS known as the  Defense Departmental Reporting System-Budgetary (DDRS-B).", "The Army also has several legacy systems that continue to process  transactions but were not designed to interface with GFEBS as the  accounting formats are not compatible. Therefore, at each month\u2019s end,  the balances for the legacy systems are configured into a format that can  be read by DDRS-B and crosswalks to the accounts within the DDRS-B  accounting system before they are sent to DDRS-B. Once the balances  have been uploaded, DDRS-B performs edit checks to identify any errors  that may exist. DFAS personnel then pull the data into the Electronic  Error Correction and Transaction Analysis (ELECTRA) application to  review any errors identified during the edit checks and use ELECTRA to  create a JV to be uploaded into DDRS-B that makes necessary  corrections or adjustments.", "After the Army has consolidated all information into DDRS-B from both  GFEBS and legacy systems each month, DFAS personnel will review the  information to determine whether any additional JVs are necessary to  correct errors identified during the reconciliation process or to record any  JVs that could not be processed prior to the upload into DDRS-B.", "On a quarterly basis after all necessary corrections are made, all  information in DDRS-B is consolidated and uploaded into a second  module within DDRS known as the Defense Departmental Reporting  System-Audited Financial Statements (DDRS-AFS), which is used to  prepare the financial statements.

In the May 2017 FIAR Plan Status  Report, DOD stated that the Army had completed its root cause analyses  for all JVs. However, we found that the analyses have been performed on  only a small percentage of the total number of unsupported JVs that  existed as of March 2017 and cannot be considered completed for all  unsupported JVs. In addition, members of the Working Group confirmed  as of June 2017 that the Working Group has not yet performed all  analyses necessary and stated that the Working Group\u2019s efforts will be an  ongoing, iterative process because of anticipated new challenges that  continually arise from new business processes or programs.", "A critical capability to achieve auditability, described in the April 2016  FIAR Guidance, is that all material JVs be supported and the population  of accounting entries reconcile with each financial statement line item as  well as the originating system of the accounting entry. As highlighted in  figure 2, the Working Group focused its efforts on manual JVs processed  at the consolidated level within DDRS-B as these JVs were consistent  with its prioritization method in conducting the analyses and getting the  financial statements audit ready.", "In December 2015, DFAS began requiring a form to be attached to all  manual DDRS-B JVs that serves as a checklist of all documents  necessary to be included for a JV to be considered supported. However,  as indicated on the metrics provided through March 2017, manual  unsupported JVs were still being recorded in DDRS-B. Further, as of  March 2017, the Working Group had not included in its root cause  analyses (1) any unsupported JVs at the transaction level, such as within  GFEBS, which are mostly attributed to year-end closing accounting  entries; (2) any unsupported JVs within DDRS-AFS, which are used to  prepare the financial statements; or (3) system-generated JVs. As a  result, a significant number of JVs still require analyses.", "Our review of the population of unsupported JVs from October 2016 to  March 2017 found that system-generated JVs made up 90 percent in  dollar value and 97 percent in number of total unsupported JVs. In July  2016, the DOD OIG similarly found that the Working Group had not been  analyzing its system-generated JVs and recommended that the Working  Group periodically review system-generated JVs to understand the  reasons for the JVs and to verify the support for the JVs. Acting on the  DOD OIG\u2019s recommendation, members of the Working Group indicated  that in March 2017, the Working Group began including system- generated JVs in its population of JVs to analyze but had not yet begun  its analyses or identified any root causes. In addition, members of the  Working Group stated that in February 2017, the Working Group began  planning a new initiative called the Business Mission Area Champions  (BMAC) Initiative. This initiative is to expand the Working Group\u2019s  analyses of root causes for JVs beyond those recorded at the  consolidated level within DDRS-B and begin analyzing transaction-level  JVs recorded in its systems that feed into DDRS-B before consolidation,  such as GFEBS. However, as of May 2017, no details have been  developed, such as planned actions or timelines. Therefore, because of  the recent inclusion of the large population of system-generated JVs in  the total population and because the BMAC Initiative is not yet under way,  a significant amount of analyses remains to fully identify root causes and  ultimately correct the Army\u2019s overall unsupported JV issue. Figure 3  summarizes the progress of the Working Group\u2019s root cause analyses of  unsupported JVs as of March 2017.", "According to OMB Circular A-123, agencies should perform a root  cause analysis of the deficiencies to ensure that subsequent strategies  and plans address the root cause of the problem and not just the  symptoms. Identifying and developing an understanding of the root cause  is management\u2019s responsibility. In addition, Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government states that management should complete and  document corrective actions to remediate control deficiencies on a timely  basis. Because it has not yet performed root cause analyses on the  majority of unsupported JVs, the Working Group has not been able to  identify appropriate corrective actions to eliminate such unsupported JVs  and ultimately help produce auditable financial statements for the Army\u2019s  general fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Working Group Has Developed Corrective Action Plans for All Identified Root Causes but Is Not Sufficiently Monitoring Implementation", "paragraphs": ["As of March 2017, members of the Working Group reported that the  Working Group had developed 38 corrective action plans to address all of  the identified root causes of unsupported manual JVs at the consolidated  level in DDRS-B for the Army\u2019s general fund. According to these  members, of the 38 corrective action plans developed, 18 have been  implemented. In addition, because the root cause analyses have been  limited, the Working Group has not yet been able to determine how many  more corrective action plans will need to be developed to resolve the  unsupported JV issue.", "Further, we found that the Working Group\u2019s monitoring of corrective  action plan implementation does not include a method that sufficiently  identifies the progress that has been made toward fully addressing the  issue of unsupported JVs or to what extent each implemented corrective  action plan has reduced unsupported JVs. The April 2016 FIAR Guidance  provides specific tasks for DOD reporting entities, including the Army, to  complete so that DOD can achieve its audit readiness objective. One of  these tasks specific to JVs is to describe plans for implementing  corrective actions to address the root causes of unsupported JVs. In  addition, the Implementation Guide for OMB Circular A-123 recommends  that management identify measurable indicators to better assess  progress and more rapidly make course corrections to ensure timely and  effective resolution of identified issues. In order to monitor whether a  corrective action plan was implemented effectively, members of the  Working Group stated that the Working Group uses metrics to monitor  implementation of corrective actions for unsupported manual JVs at the  consolidated level in DDRS-B. DFAS creates monthly metrics reports of  DDRS-B accounting entries that include all unsupported and supported  JVs for the month.", "The JVs used to create these metrics are the same JVs that the Working  Group uses to conduct its JV root cause analyses. However, the metrics  organize the JVs into broad categories that do not provide enough details  to link to the categories that the Working Group uses. For example, the  metrics use broad categories, such as data calls or correcting entries to  classify the JVs, whereas the root cause analyses are conducted at a  more detailed level, such as for a specific transaction. The Working  Group was unable to demonstrate to us which metric category was  affected by the corrective action plan implemented for each root cause  identified. In addition, the Working Group\u2019s reported progress was based  on an increase in the percentage of supported JVs in relation to the total  population of JVs from October 2016 to March 2017 as reported in the  metrics. However, during this period, the metrics also show an increase in  the actual number and dollar amount of manual unsupported JVs.  Specifically, based on the Working Group\u2019s reporting method, the  percentage of unsupported manual JVs decreased in relation to the total  population of manual JVs from October 2016 to March 2017 by 8 percent  in the number of JVs and 14 percent in the dollar value of JVs. However,  the actual number and dollar value of the unsupported manual JVs  reported on the October 2016 and March 2017 metrics increased from  329 to 462 and from a total of $3.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively.  Because the metrics used to monitor corrective action plans do not clearly  indicate which JVs are affected by a specific root cause identified,  resolved JVs cannot be tied to an implemented corrective action plan.  Therefore, the Working Group is unable to demonstrate to what extent it  has moved closer to eliminating and reducing unsupported JVs and to  what extent the Army\u2019s financial statements are becoming auditable for  fiscal year 2018.", "In addition, according to members of the Working Group as of March  2017, 16 of the 20 remaining corrective action plans developed are  pending implementation because they require system changes, which  need to be negotiated with the contractor selected to make the system  changes. Therefore, the Working Group has developed temporary  mitigating procedures to support those JVs required to be recorded until  system changes are implemented. For example, one of the root causes  that the Working Group identified was a JV recorded in DDRS-B related  to the accounting entry to record a customer refund from a prior year  purchase. When DFAS personnel record an accounting entry for a  customer refund from a prior year purchase into GFEBS, the system  erroneously records the transaction as a current year refund, through the  reimbursements and other income earned\u2014collected account, rather than  as a current year obligation and outlay as required by OMB Circular A-11,  Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget. Until this system  change is made to GFEBS so that it can differentiate between the return  of a prior year purchase or a current year purchase, DFAS has to reverse  each entry and record the current year obligation and outlay with an additional JV into DDRS-B to correct the error made and include with the  JV an explanation of the situation as well as detail level transactions to  support the JV. DFAS considers this type of support to be a temporary  solution; however, until system changes are made, the Working Group  will be unable to implement the corrective action plans developed and  resolve the root causes identified or determine whether the corrective  action plan developed for this issue will be effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2015, the Working Group has been analyzing manual unsupported  JVs in DDRS-B to determine their root causes and to concentrate its  efforts on getting the Army\u2019s financial statements audit ready.
