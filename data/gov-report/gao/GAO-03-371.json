For example, INPUT, an IT market  research firm, forecasts that defense IT outsourcing will increase about 143  percent between fiscal years 2002 and 2007.", "IT outsourcing involves the activities associated with acquiring services  from one or more external providers. During outsourcing, a client  organization transfers responsibilities for performing one or more IT  services to one or more external providers.

Each of the  phases has specific practices associated with it. Implementing these  practices does not guarantee the success of an outsourcing project.  However, our November 2001 study reflected a consensus view that these  practices were the most critical to success when IT services are being  acquired. Restated, application of these practices increases the  probability of a successful outsourcing project.", "The organizations that we studied also identified certain capabilities  (identified as critical success factors) that were essential for implementing  the practices identified in our framework. First, executive leadership  strengthens the interaction between executive management and the  employees of the client organization. Second, partner alignment  strengthens the interaction between the client and provider organization at  the executive level, which ensures that the goals and objectives of these  organizations support each other. Third, relationship management  strengthens the interaction between the client and provider organization at  the operational level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Influences on Government Sourcing Decisions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is one of the world\u2019s largest users of services.  Because of the large dollar value and the number of private- and public- sector jobs involved, deciding whether the public or private sector would  be the most appropriate provider of the services the government needs (IT  or otherwise) is an important, and often highly charged, question. Among  the factors that agencies must consider as they determine how best to meet  their missions is whether the public or private sector would be the most  appropriate provider of the services the government needs. Phase I of our  framework, determine the sourcing strategy, addresses the client\u2019s  assessment of whether expertise from within or outside of the organization  can more effectively meet the client\u2019s needs.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 required the  Comptroller General of the United States to convene a panel of experts to  study the current process used by the government to make sourcing  decisions. The resulting Commercial Activities Panel conducted a year-long  study and heard repeatedly about the importance of competition and its  central role in fostering economy, efficiency, and continuous performance  improvement. In particular, the panel reviewed the government\u2019s  implementation of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular  A-76, which sets forth federal policy for determining whether federal  employees or private contractors will perform commercial activities for the  government. Circular A-76 (1) outlines conditions under which agencies  are permitted to perform a commercial activity with government  employees or by contract and (2) provides guidance for whether, and if so,  how, agencies should conduct a cost comparison when they are  considering transferring the performance of commercial activities from the  public to the private sector (or vice versa). The panel reported that there  were positive elements to Circular A-76 but that both federal employees  and private firms complained that it does not meet the standard of a clear,  transparent, and consistently applied process. For example, both federal  employees and private firms criticized the Circular A-76 process as unequal  and therefore unfair.", "The Commercial Activities Panel strongly supported continued emphasis  on competition and concluded that whenever the government is  considering converting work from one sector to another, public/private  competitions should be the norm. In addition, the panel made four  recommendations, including that all sourcing decisions be consistent with  the principles adopted unanimously by the panel, such as the principle that  federal policy provide for accountability in connection with all sourcing  decisions.", "As part of the administration\u2019s efforts to implement the recommendations  of the Commercial Activities Panel, OMB has published proposed changes  to Circular A-76. Key highlights of the proposed changes include presuming  that all functions are commercial in nature unless they are justified as  inherently governmental; limiting the length of time for competitions; and  emphasizing awarding contracts on the basis of best value, not just lowest  cost. Best value allows the contracting official to consider technical  superiority, quality, innovation, and past performance as well as price.", "However, we reported that there are several areas in which the proposed  revisions to the circular are not consistent with the principles or  recommendations of the Commercial Activities Panel. Specifically, the  proposed revision does not include a link between sourcing policy and  agency missions, has unnecessarily complicated source selection  procedures, contains certain unrealistic time frames, and includes  insufficient guidance on calculating savings.", "Beyond the Commercial Activities Panel, other bodies have identified  challenges that the federal government faces in reaching and executing  effective sourcing decisions. For example, members of the Coalition for  Government Procurement, the Professional Services Council, and the  Information Technology Association of America told us that organizational  culture is one of the biggest differences between the commercial sector  and the federal government and one of the greatest barriers to the  government\u2019s use of commercial practices. Also, as we have previously  reported, moving to outsourcing solutions can involve a cultural change for  government organizations because it may require a change to an agency\u2019s  operating model, such as using a contractor to provide IT services  previously performed by government staff or using a performance-based  contract. This view was echoed by a 2001 study of DOD competitive sourcing that found cultural, process, execution, and training barriers.  The study stated that these barriers need to be understood and mitigated  before the benefits of outsourcing can be fully realized. Barriers such as  these can be overcome by strong executive leadership, which is a critical  success factor in our framework.", "Another challenge is creating a productive agency/provider relationship\u2014 another critical success factor in our framework. According to a report  sponsored by the PricewaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the Business of  Government, such public/private partnerships are based on trust,  commitment to problem or conflict resolution, and the recognition that  flexibility is necessary and that the relationship will evolve and change over  time. If deadlines are not met, or public agency goals change with  differing political climates, the partners need to discuss the basis of the  partnership and construct a different relationship. Our prior report on  desktop outsourcing found that developing a productive agency/contractor  relationship is not always easy. Both sides must recognize and understand  each other\u2019s underlying motives and strive to achieve established  expectations.", "Finally, human capital issues are another challenge facing federal agencies  that affect their ability to implement outsourcing. Our framework  recognizes the importance of having the right skills in place to support the  outsourcing relationship. However, as we have previously reported,  procurement reforms and technological changes have placed  unprecedented demands on the acquisition workforce. Contracting  personnel are now expected to have a much greater knowledge of market  conditions, industry trends, and the technical details of the commodities  and services they procure. The Commercial Activities Panel report stated  that developing and maintaining a skilled acquisition workforce is the  critical first step in managing this more complex procurement  environment. The panel also reported that DOD bore the brunt of a 22  percent downsizing of the federal acquisition workforce in the last decade,  going from 96,000 staff in 1991 to about 68,000 in fiscal year 2001.", "Addressing human capital issues is not just a matter of the size of the  workforce; it is also a knowledge and skills issue. According to the  Commercial Activities Panel, it is critically important that federal agencies  adequately address human capital needs in meeting the current and  emerging needs of government and its citizens in the most effective,  efficient, and economical manner possible. This will require increased  emphasis on training and development, particularly in the area of  technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Description of Five Projects Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["The five projects in our study varied in how they approached outsourcing  IT services, such as in using various solicitation methods, including holding  a public/private competition under the policies outlined in OMB Circular A- 76 or carrying out a negotiated competitive procurement. In addition, the  types of services being outsourced differed: services ranged from the  narrowly focused (e.g., help-desk services) to the very broad (e.g.,  enterprisewide end-to-end information services); contract terms ranged  from 5 to 15 years (assuming all option years are exercised); and estimated  contract values ranged from $23 million to $8.8 billion. Table 2 provides  information on the variety of IT services and outsourcing approaches taken  by the projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Projects Substantially Used Leading Commercial Practices", "paragraphs": ["As illustrated in figure 4, the five IT services projects substantially used  leading commercial practices. Specifically, each project used at least 76  percent of the practices. Reasons for projects implementing different  percentages of the practices include differences in their individual  circumstances and objectives. For example, the Army\u2019s Total Army  Communications\u2014Southwest Asia (TAC-SWA) project, which used the  fewest number of practices and had the largest number of practices that  were not applicable, was largely a continuation of an existing approach  that already relied on the private sector but with fewer providers. In  contrast, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency\u2019s (NIMA) Information  Technology/ Information Services (IT/IS) project, which fully or partially  implemented all of the applicable practices, involved a significant  operational shift (e.g., functions previously performed by NIMA staff are  now performed by a contractor) and was intended to result in substantial  process improvements. In addition, the three projects that implemented the  largest percentage of practices also used third-party assistance\u2014including  employing a contractor with sourcing expertise\u2014to help formulate their  sourcing strategy, which could account for the extent of their compliance.", "In addition, figure 5 illustrates that project compliance extended to each of  the phases of our framework. Collectively, the projects fully implemented  from 70 to 97 percent of the practices in each phase. Phase I, determine  sourcing strategy, had the lowest percentage of practices implemented by  the projects (70 percent). This result is not inconsistent with a recent Giga  Information Group, Inc., survey, which found that only half of the respondent organizations had documented an IT sourcing strategy. This  approach carries risk since phase I sets the tone for the outsourcing  initiative within the client organization.", "In addition, collectively the projects fully implemented 88 percent of the  practices (see table 3).", "The following provides additional information on the projects\u2019  implementation of each phase of our framework.", "Phase I: Determine sourcing strategy. In the first phase of our  outsourcing framework, the client organization determines whether  internal capability or external expertise can more effectively meet its IT  needs. The purpose of a sourcing strategy is to achieve the optimal  balance between internal and external capabilities, activities, processes,  and services to ensure the achievement of strategic business objectives  at the lowest risk. The five projects\u2019 implementation of this phase was  uneven. In particular, two of the six practices in this phase were fully  implemented by all five projects, but the other four practices were not.  Among the practices that were implemented by all of the projects was  determining the business reasons for outsourcing. In addition, the three  projects that implemented the largest percentage of practices in our  framework\u2014the Military Health System/Information Technology  Organization (MHS/ITO) Help Desk, the Department of the Navy\u2019s Navy  and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), and NIMA IT/IS projects\u2014used the  third-party assistance practice in this phase to help formulate their  sourcing strategy, which could account for the extent of their  compliance. For example, the MHS/ITO Help Desk project, which  implemented the largest percentage of practices, worked with the  Department of the Interior\u2019s GovWorks Program, the Defense  Acquisition University staff, and a private-sector contractor to obtain  expertise on sourcing strategies.", "The practice in this phase that was the most unevenly implemented was  the benchmarking and baselining of existing internal services. Of the  five projects in our review, (1) one fully benchmarked and baselined the  productivity of the activity being outsourced before making the final  sourcing decision, (2) two partially baselined their existing activities,  and (3) two did not perform benchmark and baseline analyses at all.  The agencies\u2019 reasons for not fully implementing this practice included  that an executive decision had been made to conduct a public/private  competition following the OMB Circular A-76 policy, so such an  analysis would not have affected the sourcing decision, or that  available documentation to perform such an analysis was limited.  Leading research firms suggest benchmarking and baselining the  entity\u2019s current processes before outsourcing because only then would  it be able to determine whether the arrangement has been successful.  In addition, the risk of not fully baselining the existing environment is  illustrated by the NMCI project. Specifically, the NMCI project\u2019s  baseline of its existing environment was limited because it did not  include an assessment of its legacy applications since project officials  decided to rely on a preexisting inventory developed to address the  Year 2000 challenge. The Navy subsequently found that it had  substantially underestimated its number of legacy applications, that,  according to program officials, later contributed to the transition  period slipping from 2-\u00bd years to 3-\u00bd years. Appendix II provides  additional information on projects\u2019 implementation of the practices  comprising this phase.", "Phase II: Define operational model. The operational model is an  important mechanism for an organization to compare its plans with the  expectations that were set when the decision to outsource was made  and to ascertain whether these plans will enable the organization to  meet expectations. The five projects had largely implemented the 13  practices contained in this phase. Specifically, about 90 percent of the  practices were implemented. For example, all projects implemented the  practice that executive leadership be established to facilitate the  outsourcing effort. NIMA, for instance, formed a strategic sourcing  office to oversee the IT/IS project. Another practice\u2014training the  provider on the organization\u2019s business environment and goals\u2014was  fully implemented by one project (in two cases, the practice was not  applicable). One project that did not fully implement this practice was  the Air Force\u2019s Kirtland Air Force Base\u2019s Command, Control,  Communications, and Computer (C4) Services project. Although some  training was provided (e.g., Kirtland held an orientation session for  potential bidders), provider officials stated that they did not receive  adequate training, which made the transition period more difficult.  Appendix III provides additional information on projects\u2019  implementation of the practices comprising this phase.", "Phase III: Develop the contract. A well-written contract is necessary for  the outsourcing organization to meet its requirements while allowing  the service provider to make a fair profit. It sets the expectations for  service levels, delivery of essential services, and continuous  improvement and should protect the interests of all parties. The five  projects largely implemented the practices in this phase. Specifically,  about 89 percent of the practices were implemented in this phase, and  two projects (the MHS/ITO Help Desk and NIMA IT/IS projects)  implemented all of the practices. Several practices in this phase address  performance requirements. For example, all five projects implemented  the practices that called for basing performance requirements on  business requirements and reviewing and updating them periodically.  One practice that was not fully implemented by two projects was  including performance measures that address both technical and end- user satisfaction aspects of performance. For example, the Army TAC- SWA project included technical performance measures in its contract  but not measures related to end-user satisfaction, even though the  contract included help-desk services. According to the project official  that developed the performance work statement in the contract, the  command did not include customer satisfaction measures because it did  not think that it was necessary to have a performance standard for the  help-desk service. However, without such measures, the agency does  not have a contractual standard with which to judge the provider\u2019s  performance. Appendix IV provides additional information on projects\u2019  implementation of the practices comprising this phase.", "Phase IV: Select the provider(s). Critical to the success of any  outsourcing project for IT services is identifying potential providers and  ultimately selecting a provider(s) that will best meet the needs of the  agency. The five projects had largely implemented the seven practices  contained in this phase. About 89 percent of the practices were  implemented in this phase and two projects (the MHS/ITO Help Desk  and Navy NMCI projects) used each applicable practice. For example,  the five projects implemented the practice related to conducting due  diligence activities to verify provider capabilities before signing the  contract. In the case of the Army TAC-SWA project, the Network  Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) evaluated the provider\u2019s  financial and past performance information. The Department of the  Navy\u2019s NMCI project also evaluated bidders\u2019 past performance and  performed reference checks. Moreover, as part of its due diligence  activities, the Navy required all bidders to demonstrate that they had  experience in implementing large seat management contracts. A  practice that was not implemented by two projects was using third-party  assistance when selecting the provider. Projects that did not implement  this practice believed that they had adequate in-house expertise with  outsourcing, making third-party assistance unnecessary. However,  because third-party assistance provides an independent resource that  can suggest options or processes that the client organization may not be  aware of, these projects may have missed an opportunity to implement  their outsourcing projects more effectively. Appendix V provides  additional information on projects\u2019 implementation of the practices  comprising this phase.", "Phase V: Transition to provider(s). This phase focuses on the client  organization\u2019s transfer of the IT function to one or more providers. As  part of this transition, the clear definition of responsibilities and the  careful consideration of employees\u2019 needs matched against the client  organization\u2019s needs enable both the client and provider to focus on  execution and give staff confidence in their future employment. The five  projects largely implemented the 11 practices associated with this  phase. Specifically, about 90 percent of the practices were  implemented in this phase, and two projects implemented all of the  practices (the MHS/ITO Help Desk and NIMA IT/IS projects). Several  practices in this phase address dealing with employees affected by the  outsourcing projects. For example, in the four projects in which federal  employees were affected, the projects provided assistance to those who  did not want to transfer to the provider, including helping to place them  in other positions and helping with r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing. A related practice is  to clearly communicate to all employees what is going to happen and  when it is going to happen. Two projects did not fully implement this  practice. For example, the Navy used its normal chain of command to  communicate transition information, but found that implementation of  this practice was uneven. As a result, some staff did not know current  information about how NMCI would affect them until the provider was  ready to contact them regarding their possible transition to the  contractor. However, according to the NMCI\u2019s Director\u2019s office, this  problem was somewhat mitigated by the provider\u2019s Web site that  provides transition information to all NMCI customers/users. Appendix  VI provides additional information on projects\u2019 implementation of the  practices comprising this phase.", "Phase VI: Manage provider(s) performance. The effectiveness with  which the provider(s) performance is managed is critical to the  successful implementation of an outsourcing project. Indeed, according  to Gartner, Inc., a leading research firm, an outsourcing project can be  thwarted by poorly designed, funded, and delivered processes for  managing the delivery of services. The five projects generally  implemented the 11 practices contained in this phase, with about 84  percent of the practices being implemented in this phase. For example,  the practices related to obtaining feedback on provider performance  were largely implemented. This is important because different levels of  an agency can have different perceptions about the value of the  outsourcing project. For example, an outsourcing project may be  considered successful by the agency\u2019s executive management if it is  focused on controlling costs, but be considered inadequate by business  managers and users who may be expecting higher levels of service. Each  of these viewpoints is valid and should be taken into account when the  provider\u2019s performance is evaluated. Two other practices\u2014including  incentives and penalties in contracts\u2014were fully implemented by two  projects. Incentives and penalties are important because they can help  motivate the provider to exceed or meet performance requirements.  Nonetheless, two projects did not include monetary incentives and two  projects did not include monetary penalties in their contracts. For  example, the Army TAC-SWA project did not include monetary  incentives, although the contracting officer stated that incentives might  have been useful to motivate the provider to exceed performance  requirements. Incentives can also help control risks. According to a  guide on performance-based services acquisition, if the incentives in the  contract are right and if the provider and agency share the same goals,  risk is largely controlled and effective performance is \u201calmost the  inevitable outcome.\u201d Appendix VII provides additional information on  projects\u2019 implementation of the practices comprising this phase.", "Phase VII: Ensure services are provided. Although outsourcing  transfers responsibility for performing the service to the provider(s), the  client organization is ultimately responsible for ensuring that services  are provided and that end-user needs are met. Accordingly, it is critical  that the agency ensure that services are provided. The projects had  implemented 97 percent of these practices, and four projects  implemented all of them. For example, every project monitored the  providers\u2019 work. In the case of the Air Force\u2019s C4 Services project,  quality assurance evaluators monitored the provider\u2019s work to identify  problems or trends in accordance with the project\u2019s quality assurance  surveillance plan. The results were reported to the contracting officer  and to the functional area chief for resolution. Another practice, using  customer satisfaction surveys, was fully implemented by four of the five  projects. However, the Air Force project did not conduct, or require its  contractor to conduct, customer satisfaction surveys. Although the  provider surveys staff annually, the Air Force is nevertheless relying on  the provider to voluntarily implement an important practice for  determining how customers view the services being delivered and  whether changes need to be made. Appendix VIII provides additional  information on projects\u2019 implementation of the practices comprising  this phase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leveraging Lessons Learned DOD-wide Could Assist Other DOD Projects", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on the importance of collecting and  disseminating lessons learned. For example, a critical activity in IT  investment management is establishing a process for developing and  capturing lessons learned in a written product or knowledge base and  disseminating them to decision-makers. In addition, one of the practices  in our framework for outsourcing IT services addresses incorporating  lessons learned from peers who have engaged in similar sourcing  decisions. Use of lessons learned is a principal component of an  organizational culture committed to continuous improvement. Sharing  such information serves to communicate acquired knowledge more  effectively and to ensure that beneficial information is factored into  planning, work processes, and activities. Lessons learned can be based on  positive experiences or on negative experiences that result in undesirable  outcomes.", "Although DOD has taken action to gather and disseminate lessons learned  and best practices on general acquisition issues, these efforts generally do  not focus on outsourcing or include sharing the lessons learned from IT  outsourcing projects across the department. Specifically, a number of DOD  Web sites provide guidance, lessons learned, and best practices related to  general acquisition issues. However, using these sites to locate specific  information on IT outsourcing best practices and lessons learned can be  time-consuming and difficult because so many topics and information  sources are provided. Specifically, MHS/ITO Help Desk project officials  said that searching numerous Web sites to get relevant information to  address questions and concerns about outsourcing IT services can  consume hours. For example, when we entered the keywords \u201cIT  outsourcing\u201d and \u201cbest practices\u201d into the search feature on the Office of  the Undersecretary for Defense of Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  site, ACQWeb (www.acq.osd.mil) in early March, it provided us with links  to 1,251 documents. Likewise, lessons learned covers so many topics that it  is difficult to search for an applicable IT lesson. For example, when we  used the phrase \u201clessons learned in IT outsourcing\u201d no documents were  identified on the ACQWeb, but when we inserted \u201clessons learned\u201d and \u201cIT  outsourcing\u201d links to more than 1,700 documents were produced.", "One DOD Web site, Share A-76!, was established to address one of our  previous recommendations, that is, to establish a framework for  identifying and analyzing best practices and lessons learned from  competitive sourcing studies and disseminating them DOD-wide. Share A- 76! promotes the sharing of best practices and lessons learned related to  one form of outsourcing that was conducted under the OMB Circular A-76  competitive sourcing process. Among other things, the site contains  guidance, links to other relevant sites, sample documents, and a best  practices library that communicates field staff experiences and advice  about the Circular A-76 process. A NIMA project official said that NIMA\u2019s  staff routinely accesses the Web site because it contains a wealth of  information on policies, procedures, lessons learned, and links to other  outsourcing sites. The DOD analyst responsible for Share A-76! estimated  that the site receives about 12,000 visits per month and said that on the  basis of E-mails and anecdotes, user satisfaction is favorable. However, this  Web site is specific to the OMB Circular A-76 process, which may not apply  to other types of outsourcing. For example, Circular A-76\u2019s policy pertains  to public/private competitions and requires that the final evaluation  between the government and the private sector be based exclusively on  cost.", "DOD acquisition and IT officials acknowledged that there is no mechanism  in DOD to easily share and leverage lessons learned relating to outsourcing  IT services. However, these officials agreed that a departmentwide effort to  identify, capture, and disseminate lessons learned and leading practices of  projects with experience in carrying out IT outsourcing could offer  valuable insights and new ideas that would benefit others. Moreover,  officials from three of the projects in our review told us that there is value  in collecting and disseminating the knowledge acquired from IT  outsourcing projects in a systematic manner across the department.", "Each of the projects in our review identified knowledge and experience  gained from their approaches to outsourcing IT services that could offer  insights and practices for other ongoing and future projects to consider.  For example:  MHS developed specific guidance and lessons learned for implementing  a performance-based incentive contract for help-desk operations.", "The Department of the Navy\u2019s NMCI project has developed a series of  lessons learned related to transitioning to the provider that is being  shared within the NMCI community; one example was that all personnel  should be available during scheduled testing and deployment.", "NIMA has experience in contracting techniques emphasizing a  partnering approach with providers to refine requirements and establish  a common understanding of costs.", "In addition, a departmental IT outsourcing knowledge-sharing approach  could include links to information about other government agencies\u2019 IT  outsourcing projects. For example, our 2002 report on desktop outsourcing  includes an extensive discussion of lessons learned by agencies that have  implemented this type of IT services outsourcing.", "Developing an effective lessons learned activity is not easy. For example,  NMCI officials said that for a lessons learned initiative to be effective, a  process must exist that is clearly understood by everyone and allows  capturing and sharing of knowledge to occur with minimum effort. Other  challenges in developing an effective lessons learned process were outlined  by the Share A-76! analyst. The analyst stated that only a small number of  site users have contributed lessons learned to the Share A-76! Web site,  which she attributed, in part, to the amount of time and effort needed to  document and obtain agreement by all levels of the organization on the  lessons learned. In addition, the analyst stated that there is reluctance to  share negative lessons, and often the review and approval process sanitizes  best practice information so that it becomes too general to be most helpful  to users. Such challenges can be overcome by executive-level support.  Indeed, DOD acquisition and IT officials stated that for lessons learning  activities to be effective, senior management must devote support and  resources to the effort. This is consistent with our prior work, which  showed that knowledge can be effectively shared only when employees are  given adequate time as well as established places where they can actually  transfer knowledge.", "Last year, we outlined a generic lessons learned process that could be used  to guide the development of such a process for outsourcing IT services.  Although the mechanism or processes used to collect, share, and  disseminate lessons learned may vary, in general such a process comprises  four main elements: collection, verification, storage, and dissemination.  The collection process involves the capture of information through  structured and unstructured processes. Verification serves to verify the  correctness and applicability of lessons submitted. The storage aspect of  lessons learned usually involves incorporating the lessons into an  electronic database for the dissemination and sharing of information,  including the ability to conduct information searches. The final element,  and the most important, is the dissemination of lessons learned, since  lessons are of little benefit unless they are distributed and used by people  who will benefit from them. Lessons can be \u201cpushed,\u201d or automatically  delivered to a user, or \u201cpulled\u201d in situations where a user must manually  search for them. Lessons can also be disseminated with an assigned  priority descriptor, which denotes the risk, immediacy, and urgency of the  lessons learned content."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The projects in our review substantially implemented leading commercial  practices for outsourcing IT services, which has increased each project\u2019s  probability of success. Capturing how these projects operationalized  leading commercial practices could help other IT services outsourcing  projects succeed. Although currently there is no such DOD-wide  mechanism, such as an electronic tool, to easily share and leverage lessons  learned, DOD IT and acquisition officials agreed that a departmentwide  effort to identify, capture, and disseminate lessons learned could offer  valuable insights and new ideas that would benefit others. Lessons learned  that are pragmatic and easily accessible could give DOD managers a more  informed understanding of the important issues to be addressed when  making outsourcing decisions, as well as the factors to be considered to  help ensure the success of these endeavors. DOD managers can also  benefit from lessons learned on the basis of negative experiences. The  projects in our review were well into implementation, and therefore, at this  late stage, we see little advantage for them to revisit practices that were not  implemented. Nevertheless, an electronic tool for capturing and  disseminating lessons learned would allow the rest of DOD to benefit from  the negative consequences and increased risks associated with those  practices that the projects did not implement.", "Developing a lessons learned mechanism is not easy; thus, senior  management support and resources are keys to success.
