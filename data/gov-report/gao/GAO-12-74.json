Once these used electronics reach the end of their original useful lives, federal agencies have several options for disposing of them. Agencies generally can donate their reusable electronics to schools; give them to a recycler; exchange them with other federal, state, or local agencies; or sell them through selected public auctions, including auctions sponsored by the General Services Administration (GSA). As the world\u0092s largest purchaser of information technology, the U.S. government, through its disposition practices, has substantial leverage to influence domestic recycling and disposal practices. GAO was asked to examine (1) key initiatives aimed at improving the management of used federal electronics and (2) improvements resulting from these initiatives and challenges that impede progress, if any. To do this, GAO evaluated federal guidance and policy, as well as guidance and initiatives at five selected agencies. GAO selected agencies based on, among other things, the amount of electronics purchased."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the executive branch has taken steps to improve the management of used federal electronics. Notably, in 2003, EPA helped to pilot the Federal Electronics Challenge (FEC)\u0097a voluntary partnership program that encourages federal facilities and agencies to purchase environmentally friendly electronic products, reduce the impacts of these products during their use, and manage used electronics in an environmentally safe way. EPA also led an effort and provided initial funding to develop third-party certification so that electronics recyclers could show that they are voluntarily adhering to an adopted set of best practices for environmental protection, worker health and safety, and security practices. In 2006, GSA issued its Personal Property Disposal Guide to assist agencies in understanding the hierarchy for disposing of excess personal property, including used electronic products: reutilization, donation, sale, and abandonment or destruction. In 2007 and 2009, executive orders were issued that, among other things, established improvement goals and directed agencies to develop and implement improvement plans for the management of used electronics. The Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive each play important roles in providing leadership, oversight, and guidance to assist federal agencies with implementing the requirements of these executive orders. To lay the groundwork for enhancing the federal government\u0092s management of used electronic products, an interagency task force issued the July 2011 National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship. The strategy, which describes goals, action items, and projects, assigns primary responsibility for overseeing or carrying out most of the projects to either EPA or GSA.", "Federal agencies have made some progress to improve their management of used electronic products, as measured by greater participation in the FEC and an increase in certified electronics recyclers, but opportunities exist to expand their efforts. For instance, agency participation in the FEC represents only about one-third of the federal workforce. GAO identified challenges with the tracking and reporting on the disposition of federal electronic equipment. For the five agencies GAO reviewed (Departments of Defense, Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban Development and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration), data provided on the disposition of electronic products were inconsistent, which hampered GAO\u0092s efforts to accurately assess the extent to which electronic products procured by federal agencies are disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Challenges associated with clarifying agencies\u0092 responsibility for used electronics sold through auctions also remain. Currently, neither the agency nor the auction entities are required to determine whether purchasers follow environmentally sound end-of-life practices. Not having controls over the ultimate disposition of electronics sold through these auctions creates opportunities for buyers to purchase federal electronics and export them to countries with less stringent environmental and health standards. Other challenges that may impede progress toward improving federal agencies\u0092 management of used electronics include defining key terms such as \u0093electronic product\u0094 and \u0093environmentally sound practices,\u0094 as each agency uses its own definition of electronic products to report progress in implementing policies for electronics stewardship."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, and GSA take actions to require consistent tracking and reporting of used electronics and ensure appropriate management of electronics sold at auction. Each agency concurred with GAO\u0092s recommendations but, in some instances, proposed alternatives for executing the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Rapid advances in technology have led to increasing sales of new  electronic products, such as computers, computer monitors, televisions,  and cell phones. These electronic products have created new business  opportunities, new ways to communicate, and a new way of conducting  business in both the private and public sectors. These advances,  however, have also created new environmental challenges. As we have  previously reported, electronic products may contain toxic substances\u2014 such as cadmium, lead, and mercury\u2014that can leach into soil or  groundwater if improperly managed. As the world\u2019s largest purchaser of  information technology\u2014spending about $80 billion in fiscal year 2010\u2014 the U.S. government, through its disposition practices, has substantial  leverage to influence domestic recycling, reuse, and disposal practices.  However, if the federal government\u2019s used electronics are not  appropriately managed, they could be disposed of in landfills domestically  or exported to countries that have less strict environmental and safety  protections. Studies have shown that used electronic products exported  from the United States to some countries are often dismantled under  unsafe health conditions, using methods like acid baths to extract  precious metals or open-air incineration. For example, we reported in  2008 that, while some exports of used electronic products can be handled  responsibly in countries with effective regulatory regimes and by  companies with advanced technologies, some used electronic products  owned by federal agencies have been sent to developing countries where  disposal practices are unsafe to workers and dangerous to the  environment.", "Over the past decade, the executive branch has taken steps to improve  the management of used federal electronics.

We selected DOD, DOE, and NASA because they each  participated to some extent in EPA\u2019s Federal Electronics Challenge (FEC)  program and purchased large amounts of electronic products\u2014ranking  first, eighth, and tenth, respectively, in terms of overall federal agency  information technology spending in fiscal year 2010. We selected  Education because, according to the FEC program manager, the agency  actively participates in the FEC and centrally manages its electronics  procurement and disposal functions. We selected HUD because the  agency was not participating in the FEC. Because we based the selection  of agencies on a nonprobability sample, the information we obtained is  not generalizable to all federal agencies. However, since the  nonprobability sample consists of a cross-section of agencies of different  sizes and levels of participation in the FEC, the evaluation of these five  agencies provides examples of different procurement and disposition  methods for electronics. We also obtained data on GSA\u2019s federal excess  personal property utilization, donation, and sales programs for fiscal year  2010 to determine, for agencies using these programs, the extent to  which they utilized each disposition method for their used electronics. We  also designed and implemented a data collection instrument to collect  data from the five selected agencies on how they disposed of electronic  products for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. We attempted to resolve  inconsistencies in the data provided through these efforts, but we  determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  reporting on amounts of electronics disposed of by the five agencies or  the extent to which agencies reutilize, donate, and sell used electronics  through GSA\u2019s federal excess personal property programs. We discuss  these data problems in our report. We also met with officials responsible  for procuring and disposing of electronic products for the five federal  agencies, and we conducted site visits to the Kennedy Space Center in  Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation in  Richmond, Virginia, to discuss the procurement and disposition of  electronic products. We also visited three recycling facilities that have a  role in electronics recycling at federal agencies and interviewed facility  officials about recycling procedures. We examined key provisions of the  July 2011 National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship and compared  them with existing policies for electronics stewardship. We also obtained  information from the FEC program\u2019s manager, officials within each of the  five agencies, and seven champions for the FEC program regarding  challenges that may affect agency participation in electronics stewardship  initiatives.

Instead,  agency officials generally consider this to be the recipient organization\u2019s  responsibility. Consequently, federal agencies often have little assurance  that their used electronics are ultimately disposed of in an  environmentally responsible manner. In our prior work, we found that little  information exists, for example, on whether obsolete electronic products  are reused, stored, or disposed of in landfills. If discarded domestically  with common trash, a number of adverse environmental impacts may  result, including the potential for harmful substances such as cadmium,  lead, and mercury to enter the environment. If donated or recycled, these  products may eventually be irresponsibly exported to countries without  modern landfills and with waste management systems that are less  protective of human health and the environment than those in the United  States. For example, in our prior work we found that some U.S.  electronics recyclers\u2014including ones that publicly tout their exemplary  environmental practices\u2014were apparently willing to circumvent U.S.  hazardous waste export laws and export certain regulated used electronic  products to developing countries.", "The federal government\u2019s approach to ensuring environmentally  responsible management of used electronics has relied heavily on EPA\u2019s  FEC initiative, which, among other things, encourages federal facilities  and agencies to manage used electronics in an environmentally safe way.

The survey is to include, among other things, a description of  (1) what the entity does with electronic products that are no longer used;  (2) which electronics recycling services it uses; and (3) what, if any,  measures the entity has taken to ensure that the electronic products were  recycled in an environmentally sound manner. Facility partners are also  expected to report progress annually, and apply for recognition through  FEC awards.", "FEC guidance directs participants to provide recipients of donated  electronics with instructions on how to have the electronics recycled  responsibly and how to verify that responsible recycling occurs\u2014 procedures known as \u201cdownstream auditing.\u201d When donating used  electronics, FEC instructs agencies and facilities to ensure that recipients  contact local or state environmental or solid waste agencies to obtain a  database of vendors who recycle used electronics once the equipment is  no longer useful to the recipient organization. FEC also recommends that  participating agencies and facilities instruct recipients to avoid  arrangements with recyclers that are unable or unwilling to share  references and cannot explain the final destination of the used electronics  they collect. When recycling electronics, participants are to determine  how much electronic equipment the recyclers actually recycle compared  with the amount they sell to other parties. In addition, FEC instructs  participants to physically inspect a potential recycler\u2019s facilities. Used  electronics in trash containers, for example, may indicate that the facility  is not recycling it, and the presence of shipping containers may indicate  that the facility exports it.", "To assist FEC partners, \u201cFEC champions\u201d are available to help regional  federal facilities with their electronics management programs.

EPA has worked with the recycling  industry and other entities to promote partnership programs that address  the environmentally sound management of used electronic products. As  we reported in July 2010, EPA convened electronics manufacturers,  recyclers, and other stakeholders and provided funding to develop  Responsible Recycling (R2) practices, so that electronics recyclers could  obtain certification to show that they are voluntarily adhering to the  adopted set of best practices for environmental protection, worker health  and safety, and security practices. Certification for R2 practices became  available in late 2009. The R2 practices identify \u201cfocus materials\u201d in used  electronic products, such as cathode-ray tubes or items containing  mercury, that warrant greater care owing to their toxicity and associated  risk if managed without the appropriate safeguards. Specifically, the  practices require that recyclers and each vendor in the recycling chain (1)  export products and components containing certain materials only to  countries that can legally accept them, (2) document the legality of such  exports, and (3) ensure that the material is being safely handled  throughout the recycling chain. R2 practices also establish a \u201creuse,  recover, dispose\u201d hierarchy along the chain of custody for material  handling. These practices require recyclers to test electronics diverted for  reuse, and confirm that key functions of the unit are working before it may  be exported. Without such testing and confirmation, these used  electronics must be treated as though they are going to recycling and  may not be exported unless the R2 exporting provisions for recycling are  satisfied. Recognizing that some clients would not want their used  electronics remarketed or reused, R2 practices also require recyclers to  have systems in place to ensure that all such electronics processed can  be recycled, rather than recovered for reuse.", "EPA encourages electronics recyclers to obtain certification to either R2  practices, or to e-Stewards, a separate voluntary certification program. e- Stewards was initiated by the Basel Action Network in 2008, and the first  e-Stewards-certified facilities were announced in early 2010.

The National  Strategy for Electronics Stewardship acknowledges the challenges  associated with tracking and reporting the disposition of used federal  electronics and proposes some solutions for improving the data that  agencies report to GSA. Under the national strategy, GSA is to streamline  and standardize reporting through the annual Report of Non-Federal  Recipientselectronic products leaving federal ownership, and the recipients of these  products. It is unclear, however, what electronics the new reporting  requirements will cover. The national strategy suggests that the annual  Report of Non-Federal Recipients will be expanded to include the  reporting of the disposition of electronic products to all recipients.

Agencies  typically record the acquisition of electronics as individual units, such as  desktop or laptop computers, and continue to track these electronics as  individual units while in use at the agency. However, when agencies  dispose of these same electronics, they may use a different method for  tracking them. For example, rather than tracking the disposition of used  electronic products as individual units, agencies may aggregate a number  of similar items into a single line item or they may report them by weight.  In addition, a single agency may use different metrics for different types of  disposition. For example, DLA, a DOD acquisition and disposition agency,  tracks electronic products sent to recyclers in pounds and electronic  products disposed of through other means\u2014such as donated to schools  or transferred to other agencies\u2014by individual unit. Because some  electronics are tracked and reported as line items and some are recorded  in pounds, it is not possible to compare the extent to which the agency  relies on one disposition method over another.

Specifically, under the GSA auction process,  registered participants can bid electronically on items within specific time  frames. To participate, potential buyers register with GSA by providing  information about themselves, such as name, address, and payment  information, before they can bid on items, according to GSA officials.  However, GSA officials told us that they do not evaluate the information  obtained from buyers to determine whether they are brokers or resellers  who might potentially export these used products to other countries where  they may not be handled in an environmentally sound or safe manner.  Moreover, GSA officials stated that the agency does not have enforcement  authority after these items are sold to the general public. They told us that if  GSA is made aware of any inappropriate activity or violations of the terms  of the sale, it will refer the information to the GSA Inspector General for  further investigation. According to agency documentation, GSA\u2019s online  auction procedures include standard sales terms and conditions, special  security notifications, and export control clauses.

According to  DOD officials, DOD\u2019s responsibility for tracking its used electronics ends  once it passes to the contractor\u2014Government Liquidation. DOD officials  said that Government Liquidation has its own terms and conditions that  bidders must adhere to once they purchase the used electronics. As with  GSA auctions, the terms and conditions included in the Government  Liquidation auctions are not aimed at ensuring that used federal  electronics are exported only to countries that that can legally accept  them. In our review of these auction websites, we found that the  overwhelming majority of used electronic products are sold in bulk, which  would indicate that they are being sold to brokers or resellers, not  individual consumers.", "The National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship seeks to address the  problems associated with used federal electronics sold through auction.  According to the strategy, the electronics stewardship policy that GSA is to  establish will prohibit the sale of nonfunctional electronics through public  auction except to third-party certified recyclers and refurbishers. Functional  electronics are to be directed through the existing hierarchy of transfer,  donation, and sale. It is unclear, however, how this policy will work in  practice. Currently, agencies sell electronics in mixed lots of potentially  functional and nonfunctional equipment. For example, officials at one  agency said that it was not cost effective to test items to ensure that they  are functional; therefore, items are sold through GSA \u201cas is\u201d with no implied  warranty. These agency officials said that they combine items in sales lots  that will bring the most return to the federal government.

Moreover, if federal agencies sell used functional  electronic products through auctions, neither the agency nor the auction  entities are required to impose conditions or to perform due diligence by  conducting auditing to determine whether all downstream reusers of such  products follow environmentally sound end-of-life practices.", "In contrast, the European Union has detailed guidance for determining  the functionality of electrical and electronic equipment, as part of  distinguishing whether the equipment is considered waste in the context  of import-export rules. The guidance states that the tests required to  determine functionality depend on the type of electronics, but generally,  completion of a visual inspection without testing functionality is unlikely to  be sufficient for most types of electronics; it also states that a functionality  test of the key functions is sufficient. The guidance also identifies defects  that materially affect functionality and would therefore cause an item to be  considered \u201cwaste\u201d if, for example, the equipment did not turn on, perform  internal set-up routines, or conduct self-checks. As discussed  previously, R2 practices establish a similar \u201creuse, recover, dispose\u201d  hierarchy along the chain of custody for material handling and require  recyclers to test electronics diverted for reuse, and confirm that key  functions of the unit are working before it may be exported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Remain in Defining Key Terms and in Clarifying Differences between the Executive Orders", "paragraphs": ["We found that key terms concerning electronics have not been defined  and that differences between the executive orders have not been  clarified.

Consequently, each of the agencies we reviewed used  its own definition of electronic products to report progress in  implementing policies for electronics stewardship. For example, DOE  defines electronic products as printers, desktop computers, notebook  computers, and monitors; DOD, Education, HUD, and NASA use  broader definitions that include servers, routers, and switches; cell  phones and musical instruments; and refrigerators. Moreover, without  a clear definition of what constitutes an environmentally sound  practice, agencies are free to dispose of their used electronics  through online auctions or other means that provide little assurance  that (1) these electronics are exported only to countries that can  legally accept them, (2) recyclers document the legality of such  exports, and (3) the material is being safely handled throughout the  recycling chain.", "Differences between the executive orders have not been clarified.", "CEQ has not issued implementing instructions regarding electronics  stewardship for Executive Order 13514, which was signed in 2009,  and CEQ, OMB, and OFEE have not harmonized the electronics  stewardship requirements contained in executive orders 13423 and  13514.

However, opportunities exist to increase the breadth and depth of  agencies\u2019 participation in the FEC and to expand the use of certified  electronics recyclers.", "Federal agencies also face challenges that may impede their progress  toward improving their management of used federal electronics.  Specifically, 2 years have elapsed since Executive Order 13514 required  CEQ to issue implementing instructions. In the absence of such  instructions, agencies do not have definitions for key terms such as  \u201celectronic products\u201d and \u201cenvironmentally sound practices,\u201d and the  guidance for implementing the executive orders provides inconsistent  information on what procedures an agency should follow when  implementing environmentally sound practices. In addition,  inconsistencies between Executive Orders 13514 and 13423 have yet to  be addressed; without doing so, CEQ lacks assurance that agencies are  meeting electronics stewardship requirements of both orders, given that  CEQ and OMB permit agencies to comply using either an electronics  stewardship plan under Executive Order 13423 or a strategic  sustainability performance plan under Executive Order 13514.  Furthermore, without consistent tracking and reporting of the disposition  of used federal electronics, there is no mechanism to measure the  effectiveness of federal policies aimed at ensuring the proper disposal of  electronics that have reached the end of their useful life.", "The recently issued National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship seeks  to advance federal agencies\u2019 efforts to manage used electronics.  However, it is unclear whether it will fully address challenges that impede  environmentally sound management of used federal electronics.  Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the strategy will be effective without a  mechanism for routinely keeping agencies and the public apprised of its  progress toward establishing a governmentwide policy on used federal  electronics\u2014particularly with respect to use of third-party national  certification for electronics recyclers\u2014so that agencies have a clear  understanding of their responsibilities and other interested parties are  apprised of agencies\u2019 progress toward completing actions identified in the  strategy. Currently, the strategy does not state how agencies will be kept  informed of implementation efforts. In addition, the strategy lays out an  approach for ensuring that federal agencies dispose of nonfunctional  electronics in a sound manner, but it does not provide clear and detailed  criteria to assist federal agencies in bundling functional and nonfunctional  equipment for sale exclusively to certified recyclers and refurbishers and  distinguishing between functional and nonfunctional electronics by  conducting specific tests and labeling electronic products.

Specifically, CEQ  stated that GSA\u2019s policy would address the issues we identified with  regard to unclear definitions and inconsistent tracking and reporting of  electronics but was silent on how it would provide clear direction on  required agency actions under the national strategy. GAO believes it is  imperative for CEQ to issue implementing instructions along with GSA\u2019s  issuance of its policy.

We also  reviewed the July 2011 National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship.", "To identify improvements resulting from federal initiatives to improve  management of used federal electronics and challenges that impede  progress, we selected a nonprobability sample of five federal agencies\u2014 the departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Education  (Education), and Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014to examine how  the federal policy framework is carried out in those agencies. We selected  DOD, DOE, and NASA because they each participated to some extent in  the FEC program and purchased large amounts of electronic products\u2014 ranking first, eighth, and tenth, respectively, in terms of overall federal  agency information technology spending in fiscal year 2010. We selected  Education because, according to the FEC program manager, the agency  actively participates in the FEC and centrally manages its electronics  procurement and disposal functions. We selected HUD because the  agency was not participating in the FEC. We used FEC participation as a  selection criterion because we hoped to include agencies with a range of  experience with managing used electronics in an environmentally safe  way. Because the selection of agencies was based on a nonprobability  sample, the information we obtained is not generalizable to all federal  agencies. However, because the nonprobability sample consists of a  cross-section of agencies of different sizes and levels of participation in  the FEC, the evaluation of these agencies provides relevant examples of  different procurement and disposition methods for electronics. For these  five agencies we also collected and reviewed fiscal year 2010 strategic  sustainability performance plans. We also conducted semistructured  interviews with officials from the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the  Office of the Federal Environmental Executive (OFEE), and EPA to  discuss their respective roles in assessing agency performance and  managing the FEC and other federal initiatives for electronics  stewardship.

We encountered a number of limitations in  obtaining reliable data. For example, GSA officials acknowledged that  GSA does not verify the data that it collects from other agencies. The five  selected agencies that we collected data from also did not have  consistent definitions of electronics and sometimes reported inconsistent  information or used inconsistent methods of tracking the disposition of  used electronics. For example, DOD tracks some items by weight and  other items by line item. We attempted to resolve inconsistencies in the  data provided through this effort through follow-up efforts with the five  agencies in which we discussed how they attempted to collect the data  we requested and related challenges and limitations. Based on these  conversations, we determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of reporting on amounts of electronics disposed of by the  five agencies and we did not use information collected in the data  collection instrument on the extent to which agencies used various  disposition methods.", "We also visited the Kennedy Space Center, in Cape Canaveral, Florida,  and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation in Richmond, Virginia, to  discuss the procurement and disposition of electronic products.
