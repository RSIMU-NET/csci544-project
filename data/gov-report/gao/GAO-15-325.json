This baseline established the cost and quantity of aircraft necessary to achieve its goal of 52,400 flight hours per year.

According to initial Coast Guard estimates, while the aircraft come at no cost, the Coast Guard needs about $600 million to fully operationalize them. This process is complex and significant work and risk remain. For example, the Coast Guard must establish its needs and purchase a set of spare parts for each aircraft, but faces hurdles due to potential pricing issues and delivery delays from the manufacturer. Also, the Coast Guard does not have access to the manufacturer's technical data that are required for modifications to the aircraft's structure to, for example, incorporate radar. These and other risks may inhibit the Coast Guard's ability to operate the aircraft as planned. However, the Coast Guard is working to mitigate these risks.", "The C-27J will improve the affordability of the Coast Guard's fixed-wing fleet, but the fleet as currently planned may not be optimal in terms of cost and flight hour capability. The Coast Guard submitted a business case to Congress in 2013 that determined the C-27J would save $837 million over 30 years, compared to the program of record, without reducing fleet performance. GAO estimates that the fleet the Coast Guard is currently pursuing achieves nearly all of these savings. However, the source of these savings has shifted. A significant portion of the savings now results from an 18 percent drop in flight hours due to a change in the mix of aircraft the Coast Guard intends to pursue. GAO used updated information in conducting its analysis, such as the expected service life of each aircraft type. Consistent with congressional direction, the Coast Guard is conducting a multi-phased analysis of its mission needs\u2014including its flight hour goals and fleet of fixed-wing assets\u2014but will not present the full results prior to its 2019 budget request. In the meantime, the Coast Guard has prudently paused its existing HC-144 acquisition program. However, since 2000, the Coast Guard has received 12 HC-130Js without budgeting for them and it may continue to receive these aircraft while it studies its fixed-wing fleet needs. If the Coast Guard continues to receive these aircraft in the near term, the capability and cost of the Coast Guard's fixed-wing fleet runs the risk of being dictated by the assets the Coast Guard already owns rather than what it determines it needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Coast Guard should advise Congress of the time frames for the Coast Guard's fleet analysis and to modify the provision of additional HC-130Js, as appropriate, in the interim.

L-3 Communications, the lead partner, installed  U.S. military-specific equipment on the aircraft manufactured by Alenia  Aermacchi.  In addition, a separate division of L-3 Communications  provided full logistics support to the Army and Air Force under the Global  Military Aircraft Systems contract. The Air Force and Army began  purchasing these aircraft without fully developing a logistics plan that  established how to fully support the aircraft. Five years later, in 2012, the  Air Force canceled the program, citing budget constraints and its  determination that Air Force C-130s could provide nearly all of the Army\u2019s  desired capability. The Air Force had not finished its logistics plan at the  time.", "When the program was canceled in 2012, the Department of Defense  (DOD) had purchased 21 C-27Js\u201413 by the Army and 8 by the Air  Force. By mid-2013, the 13 aircraft that the Air Force fielded were sent to  AMARG (colloquially referred to as the \u201cboneyard\u201d) for preservation and 8  aircraft were still in production. The Air Force announced that these 21  aircraft would be made available to U.S. government agencies. In May  2012, the Coast Guard conducted a business case, which estimated that  receiving the 21 C-27J aircraft would save it $826 million, in fiscal year  2012 dollars, without changing planned performance targets. In August  2013, after USASOC also expressed interest in the aircraft, the Coast  Guard wrote a letter to Congress using its prior analysis to estimate that  receiving 14 C-27Js, instead of all 21 aircraft, would still save $799 million  ($837 million in fiscal year 2015 dollars) over 30 years. Figure 1 illustrates  the major events in the history of the C-27J.", "In fall 2013, DOD transferred 7 C-27J aircraft to USASOC; 3 that had  since completed production and 4 aircraft still in production.

When completing these  steps, complications can arise. For example, program officials stated that  the C-27J uses a liquid oxygen based aircrew breathing system similar to  the HC-130J.

Alenia Aermacchi has increased the price  of parts on two USASOC purchases; for example, USASOC purchased a  refueling valve that previously cost $10,998, but it now must pay $15,121  for the part\u2014a 37 percent increase. In addition, USASOC officials have  been frustrated by the length of time Alenia Aermacchi has taken to  provide parts. For example, as of November 2014, USASOC had  received 70 percent of the parts ordered from non-Alenia Aermacchi  suppliers but only 3 percent of the parts ordered from Alenia Aermacchi.  While Alenia Aermacchi officials recognize that there have been issues  with spare parts in the past, they told us that the company has recently  changed its logistics model and has the capability to fully support the  Coast Guard\u2019s C-27Js. Further, according to USASOC contracting  officials, difficulties with Italian export controls have slowed the spare  parts and parts repair processes.  Alenia Aermacchi is in the process of  applying for Italian export control licenses for USASOC and the Coast  Guard. Once approved, these licenses will reduce delays attributable  solely to export issues\u2014usually around 30 to 90 days\u2014according to  Alenia Aermacchi officials.", "The Coast Guard has already encountered some challenges with  purchasing spare parts. For example, when removing aircraft from  AMARG it is standard procedure to replace the aircraft\u2019s filters. In doing  so, the Coast Guard was able to purchase only half of the filters through  U.S. government approved suppliers. The remaining filters had to be  purchased directly from Alenia Aermacchi because they were unavailable  from other sources. To mitigate export control delays, Coast Guard  officials said they used Alenia Aermacchi filters from USASOC\u2019s  warehouse and paid for replacements to USASOC\u2019s inventory.", "Developing an initial set of spares for the C-27J, estimated to cost $8  million per aircraft, is another significant area of risk. The Coast Guard  received data from other countries\u2019 air forces that fly the C-27J and, using  these data, have developed its own initial list of spares. The Coast Guard  must now find suppliers for these parts and then determine what portion  of these parts are economical to keep on-hand in the Coast Guard\u2019s  supply chain. Further, according to Coast Guard project officials,  significant learning will occur as the Coast Guard inducts the C-27J and  generates its own data, as it starts flying the aircraft, on the failure rate of  the aircraft\u2019s parts. These data will allow the Coast Guard to fine tune the  list of spare parts before the aircraft are fielded.", "Lastly, the Coast Guard plans to fly its aircraft at a more aggressive  operating pace\u2014up to 1,000 hours per year compared to about 500 hours  per year for the Air Force and USASOC\u2014and in a maritime environment,  which is generally more demanding on assets due to increased corrosion  from the saltwater environment. Thus, its spare parts needs are likely to  be much higher than USASOC and the Air Force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accessing Technical Data", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard does not yet have sufficient access to technical data to  fully support, maintain, and operate the C-27J. Alenia Aermacchi is the  sole owner of the full technical data associated with the C-27J aircraft.  Coast Guard project officials said they have approached the company  about acquiring a technical data licensing agreement. The Coast Guard  plans to meet immediate technical data requirements by utilizing  resources under the Alenia Aermacchi field service representative  contract. The Coast Guard continues to explore various options for  accessing this key information. These options can vary depending upon  the three basic types of technical data for aircraft:   1.  Flight and maintenance manuals\u2013These manuals provide all of the  information required to safely and effectively fly and maintain the  aircraft\u2014including detailed guidance on maintenance and flight  procedures\u2014and function as the foundational documents necessary  for properly operating the aircraft. In 2014, the Air Force supplied the  Coast Guard with two sets of flight and maintenance manuals. The  first set, produced by L-3 Communications, translated the Alenia  Aermacchi manuals into Air Force-specific language and also covered  the modifications made to the plane by L-3 Communications. These  manuals were updated through March 2013 but never fully completed.  The second set, produced by Alenia Aermacchi, pertained only to the  aircraft in its originally manufactured condition prior to modifications.  This set continued to be updated by Alenia Aermacchi until the Air  Force transferred them to the Coast Guard in February 2014.  USASOC has since purchased flight and maintenance manuals from  Alenia Aermacchi, according to Coast Guard project officials, and  provided the Coast Guard access to them. The Coast Guard is in the  process of contracting for Coast Guard-specific instructions based on  these manuals for how to conduct basic aircraft maintenance.   2.  Depot level maintenance data\u2013During periodic depot level  maintenance, the Coast Guard conducts major airframe inspections  and completes required repairs, which allows the service to  accomplish its missions with fewer resources over the long run. These  depot maintenance periods typically include removing large portions  of the aircraft to address core corrosion and rebuild key parts,  including engine work. At the time the Air Force canceled its C-27J  program, it was in the process of pursuing the data required for depot  maintenance from L-3 Communications, the lead contractor. However,  since Alenia Aermacchi owned the data, this process would have  been complex and, according to Air Force officials, was  unsuccessfully resolved. The extent to which the Coast Guard can  develop depot level maintenance procedures and conduct its own  engineering activities on the C-27J with only the basic flight and  maintenance manuals is unknown at present. The Coast Guard has  significant experience conducting depot maintenance on aviation  assets, which, according to project office officials, increases its ability  to overcome knowledge gaps associated with the lack of technical  data.   3.  Design and manufacturing data\u2013These data contain information  such as the expected fatigue life\u2014how long components last\u2014of  pieces of the airframe and information required to manufacture key  parts. Access to design and manufacturing data is needed when  modifications are required to the aircraft, such as to add capability,  and manufacturing data are useful for competitively purchasing parts  or determining the cause of parts failures. Alenia Aermacchi has sole  ownership and access to these data. According to project officials, the  Coast Guard could purchase access to these data from Alenia  Aermacchi, either on an as-needed basis or in bulk. Alternatively,  Coast Guard officials added that they can learn about the aircraft  through testing, reverse engineering, and/or experimentation. Coast  Guard project officials stated that these options would require  significant resources, and that they will likely use a combination of  these approaches.", "Without access to technical data for the C-27J, the Coast Guard faces  risks related to controlling costs and maintenance issues and installing  surveillance capabilities. Technical data can enable the government to  complete maintenance work in-house, as well as to competitively award  acquisition and sustainment contracts. In July 2010, we reported that for  service contracts pertaining to DOD weapons programs, the lack of  access to proprietary technical data and a heavy reliance on specific  contractors for expertise limits or precludes the possibility of  competition. Further, in May 2011, we reported that access to technical  data is needed to help control costs and maintain flexibility in the  acquisition and sustainment of DOD weapon systems. In addition, the  lack of technical data could ground the aircraft for longer periods than  necessary. For example, Air Force program officials told us about a  severe 2012 mishap with one of its C-27Js that grounded its fleet for  several months while Alenia Aermacchi investigated the incident. As  Alenia Aermacchi had sole access to the technical data, the Air Force  was reliant on it to conduct the investigation. After several months, Alenia  Aermacchi determined that the issue was the result of improper  manufacturing of an aircraft component at one of its suppliers\u2019 facilities.  The Air Force then had to wait approximately 10 months while the parts  were re-made by the supplier and sent to the Air Force. Alenia Aermacchi  officials have expressed interest in serving as the sole maintenance  provider for the Coast Guard and USASOC\u2019s aircraft as it does for many  of its international customers. Alenia Aermacchi officials note that they  are also accustomed to supporting agencies doing their own maintenance  by providing field service representatives, engineering support, and  technical publications.", "The process of installing surveillance capabilities on the C-27J will be  shaped by the extent to which the Coast Guard can access design and  manufacturing data for the C-27J. The first step in this process is  purchasing the main sensor systems, a surface search radar and electro- optical infrared camera, and installing them on the aircraft. However, this  task is risky and could reduce capability if the Coast Guard does not gain  access to the C-27J\u2019s technical data. For example, on the HC-130J, the  Coast Guard mounts the surface-search radar on the aircraft\u2019s fuselage.  However, such modification to an aircraft requires technical data to  determine the impact on its structural integrity. Without access to the  necessary data, the Coast Guard would be reliant on Alenia Aermacchi to  perform the engineering required to mount the radar. However, the Coast  Guard is looking into alternatives that would require access to fewer data.  According to Coast Guard and USASOC officials, two possibilities for the  C-27J that would require a limited amount of technical data include (1)  mounting the electro-optical infrared camera on one of the aircraft\u2019s doors  and (2) modifying the surface-search radar to fit on the nose of the  aircraft\u2014replacing the existing weather radar, which may no longer be  necessary because the new radar would also perform weather-related  tasks. While possible, such an approach could require performance trade- offs\u2014such as limiting the coverage of the radar and the camera."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Understanding the Condition of the Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["An additional risk for the Coast Guard is addressing the physical condition  of the 14 aircraft.

The seams and joints  of three of USASOC\u2019s seven aircraft were poorly sealed upon delivery  of the aircraft, requiring significant repairs.", "The landing gear on one aircraft extended during landing without pilot  instruction due to a landing gear component deficiency, which is a  safety issue and grounded the aircraft.", "Wheel assemblies on multiple aircraft were improperly constructed.", "A cracked bracket required an aircraft to be grounded for 58 days.", "A crack was discovered in a structural piece surrounding the left  wheel on four aircraft.", "Problems were found with four different types of valves, including fuel  and de-icing valves on multiple aircraft.", "Oxygen system leaks due to manufacturing errors on multiple aircraft.", "Some of these issues are related to major manufacturing problems and  are consistent with findings of the Defense Contract Management  Agency, which oversaw the C-27J manufacturing process on behalf of the  Air Force. For example, in March 2013, the Defense Contract  Management Agency issued a request for L-3 Communications, as the  lead U.S. partner, to correct poor practices at Alenia Aermacchi that  would seriously compromise the reliability and safety of the C-27J if not  corrected. This corrective action request has been closed, but the extent  to which these problems extend through the Coast Guard\u2019s 14 C-27Js,  built prior to these changes, is unknown.", "While USASOC experienced the problems noted above on brand new  aircraft, the Coast Guard is receiving aircraft that the Air Force previously  used. When removing the first two planes from storage at AMARG, the  Coast Guard discovered numerous, though relatively minor, issues that  delayed delivery of the planes to the Coast Guard\u2019s Aviation Logistics  Center by a few weeks. For example, the Coast Guard discovered a dent  on the underside of one C-27J that was not properly documented and  also found some corrosion, particularly with bolts on the wings of the  aircraft, which it replaced on both aircraft. Coast Guard officials stated  that the manufacturer may have installed the wrong bolts on the aircraft.  Coast Guard and Air Force officials determined that the first two aircraft  that they removed from AMARG are likely in the best condition. Two of  the most heavily used aircraft destined for the Coast Guard supported the  contingency operation in Afghanistan for 11 months. The Coast Guard will  continue to assess the condition of the other 11 planes as they are  removed from storage, which officials have identified as an area of  concern.", "Apart from the 13 aircraft that have been stored at the AMARG, the 14th  plane destined for the Coast Guard is also missing parts and has been  stored outdoors since 2011 without being preserved by L-3  Communications (which still owns the aircraft). L-3 Communications  officials told us that they did not properly maintain the aircraft\u2019s engines  and propellers because parts required to run the engines, necessary for  proper maintenance, were used for other C-27Js and not replaced in a  timely manner. However, L-3 Communications, at its expense, recently  sent the engines and propellers to be serviced by the original  manufacturer and these items are now properly stored. In October 2014,  we observed the aircraft at L-3 Communications\u2019 facility in Waco, Texas.  The aircraft\u2019s engines and propellers were not installed but were stored in  a nearby hangar consistent with original equipment manufacturer  direction, according to L-3 officials. However, the cockpit was missing  several components related to communications and operations functions,  and the body of the aircraft showed some corrosion\u2014particularly under  each wing. L-3 Communications is now in the process of replacing 11 key  missing parts taken from the aircraft to support the Afghanistan  deployment and other C-27Js. At the time of our visit, L-3  Communications officials were optimistic that the aircraft would be  delivered to the Coast Guard in working condition by February 2015,  pending the delivery of the missing parts. However, as of March 2015,  Alenia Aermacchi had yet to deliver these parts to L-3 Communications.  L-3 Communications is now planning to deliver the aircraft to the U.S.  Government in June 2015, pending the delivery of parts expected by late  March 2015. Given that the airplane was not stored in accordance with  Air Force procedures and has been used for spare parts, there will likely  be some maintenance issues that L-3 Communications will have to  address before it can deliver the aircraft to the U.S. Government."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Current Fixed-Wing Fleet Plan Achieves Savings but Does Not Meet Flying Hour Needs, and Revised Analysis Is Years Away", "paragraphs": ["The C-27J will improve the affordability of the Coast Guard\u2019s fixed-wing  fleet, but the current fleet of aircraft that the Coast Guard is pursuing is  not optimal in terms of cost and flight hour capability. We estimate that  the Coast Guard\u2019s current plan should save $795 million over the next 30  years, compared to the 2013 estimate of $837 million. However, the  source of these savings has shifted. A significant portion of the savings  now results from a drop in the number of flight hours the fleet will achieve  due to reducing the planned quantity of aircraft. For example, the 2013  plan achieves the Coast Guard\u2019s stated goal of 52,400 flight hours per  year, while the current plan achieves 43,200 flight hours per year\u2014an 18  percent reduction. This reflects a shift from a fleet of 58 planes primarily  composed of less-expensive HC-144s, to a fleet of 54 planes composed  of a higher number of larger and more expensive HC-130Js. Operating  more HC-130Js results in more expensive flight hours per year. The  Coast Guard is in the process of examining, in several stages, its mission  needs, including whether the current flight hour goal is still sound. But the  results will not be used to inform budgets prior to fiscal year 2019.

However, in the current plan, the savings are  now largely due to operating expenses based on the Coast Guard\u2019s  planned reduction in flight hours.", "In its August 2013 letter to Congress, the Coast Guard stated that  receiving 14 C-27Js would save money without reducing planned flight  hours below its goal of 52,400 hours per year, set forth in the Coast  Guard\u2019s 2005 mission needs statement. To do this, the Coast Guard  planned to replace three HC-130Js with three C-27Js, gaining 600 flight  hours per year at a lower cost per flight hour, and to decommission its  HC-130Hs sooner than originally planned. However, the Coast Guard has  since changed its planned fleet composition, and is now on a path to  replace 14 HC-144s with 14 C-27Js and buy all 22 of the HC-130Js as  planned in the program of record. This change results in 9,200 fewer flight  hours per year (an 18 percent reduction) once the currently planned fleet  is fully operational. Also contributing to this reduction of flight hours is the  current plan to purchase 4 fewer medium range aircraft (HC-144s and C- 27Js) and reduce the HC-144 flight hours from 1,200 to 1,000 hours per  year\u2014due primarily to the high cost of maintaining the aircraft while flying  at the higher pace.", "Table 3 shows: (1) the aircraft that comprise each fleet plan, (2) the  planned annual flight hours once each fleet is built, and (3) the difference  in flight hours, if any, based on the planned flight hours per year.

The Coast Guard\u2019s  2005 mission needs statement directed the Coast Guard\u2019s fixed wing fleet  to be comprised of assets with improved surveillance capabilities, which  would allow the Coast Guard to become more proactive through  increased presence and surveillance rather than responding to events as  they occur.", "The Coast Guard has not been able to build up its flight hours as quickly  as planned in 2007.

The Howard Goble Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 directed the Commandant  of the Coast Guard to submit an integrated major acquisition mission  needs statement that, among other things, identifies current and projected  capability gaps using mission hour targets. This mission needs statement  is to be completed concurrent with the President\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget  submission to Congress. Specifically, the Coast Guard plans first to  rewrite its mission needs statement and concept of operations by 2016.  Then, it will use a complex model to develop the full fleet mix study, which  will include a re-assessment of the fixed-wing flying hour goals. Based on  this, the Coast Guard plans to recommend a set of assets that best meets  these needs in terms of capability and cost. The Coast Guard plans to  complete the full study in time to inform the fiscal year 2019 budget,  though specific dates for these events have not been set forth.", "The Coast Guard and DHS have undertaken several studies, starting in  2008, to reassess the mix of assets the Coast Guard needs. However, in  2011, we reported that it was unclear how DHS and the Coast Guard  would reconcile and use these multiple studies to make trade-off  decisions or changes to the program of record. To date, the Coast Guard  has made no changes to its program of record based on these analyses.", "The upcoming mission needs statement and subsequent fleet mix  analysis will be important to inform decisions about the mix of fixed wing  assets the Coast Guard needs and can afford. For example, our  calculations and the Coast Guard\u2019s 2012 business case demonstrate that  replacing HC-130Js with medium-range aircraft (such as the HC-144 and  C-27J) adds flight hours and reduces costs. Specifically, the savings the  Coast Guard presented to Congress in its 2013 letter were predicated on  replacing three HC-130Js with three C-27Js. According to the Coast  Guard, this action would add 600 flight hours per year and save $322  million over the next 30 years. Further, the Coast Guard\u2019s analysis  showed that replacing nine HC-130Js would add 1,800 flight hours per  year and save nearly $1 billion. According to Coast Guard officials, the  fleet mix analysis will examine these cost savings while also accounting  for the level of performance provided by the HC-130J compared to the  other fixed-wing assets. Because the results of the fleet mix study will not  be available for several years, decisions that are made in the interim will  not be informed by the Coast Guard\u2019s analysis. To illustrate, if this fleet  mix analysis were to establish needed flight hours at a lower number than  the current 52,400 goal, the Coast Guard could end up with excess  capacity. Further, if the analysis were to demonstrate that the optimal  fleet mix is comprised of more medium-range aircraft and fewer long- range aircraft, then the Coast Guard is currently on a path to end up with  a more expensive fleet than necessary and it would be too late to opt for  a fleet with a greater number of flight hours for the dollar.", "Coast Guard budget and programming officials recognize the aviation  fleet may change based on the flight hour goals in the new mission needs  statement and the overall fleet mix analysis.  They therefore have not  included any additional fixed-wing asset purchases in the Coast Guard\u2019s  five-year budget plan. For example, DHS and the Coast Guard have  formally paused the HC-144 acquisition program at 18 aircraft for the time  being. In addition, the Coast Guard already owns 20 aircraft, received  since fiscal year 2009, comprised of 14 C-27Js and 6 HC-130Js that are  not yet fully operational. These aircraft are planned to be outfitted with  surveillance capabilities in the coming years. In total, since 2000, the  Coast Guard has received 12 HC-130Js, currently valued at  approximately $100 million each, without including them in its budget  requests. The Coast Guard\u2019s Major Systems Acquisition Manual  provides that the Coast Guard must manage its portfolio of assets to  ensure that public resources are wisely invested and that capital  programming is an integrated process of a component\u2019s portfolio of  capital assets to achieve its strategic goals and objectives for the lowest  life cycle cost and least risk. Continuing to receive these aircraft in the  coming years, while the Coast Guard revisits its fixed-wing mission  needs, will diminish the Coast Guard\u2019s flexibility to optimize its fleet.

While the transfer of the C-27Js to the Coast Guard may save  acquisition funds, the Coast Guard is still a long way from being able to  operate these aircraft efficiently and effectively. Overcoming the issues  we have highlighted is feasible. But it will take time and resources to  ensure that the C-27J will be able to function as a Coast Guard medium- range surveillance asset, particularly in terms of adding surveillance  capabilities and achieving 1,000 flight hours per year.", "If the Coast Guard uses the C-27J to replace some HC-144s, as is the  current plan, the Coast Guard will fall short of its flight hour goals over the  next 30 years, but if the C-27J replaces some HC-130Js, the Coast  Guard can achieve more flight hours at a lower cost. The Coast Guard  has an opportunity to address these issues now, within the context of its  ongoing effort to assess its overall fleet of fixed wing assets. For example,  the fleet mix analysis will aid the Coast Guard in determining the right mix  of assets between the HC-130J\u2014which the Coast Guard views as a  highly capable aircraft\u2014or the greater number of lower cost flight hours  provided by the HC-144 or similar aircraft. However, the study results are  years away. In the meantime, although the Coast Guard has exercised  prudence in pausing the HC-144 program, it may continue to receive HC- 130Js before it knows that it needs these aircraft and before it has  determined the capabilities of its C-27J fleet. As a result, if the Coast  Guard continues to receive HC-130Js while it revisits its needs, the  capability and cost of the Coast Guard\u2019s fixed-wing fleet runs the risk of  being dictated by the assets the Coast Guard already owns rather than  what it needs. Until the fleet mix study is concluded, the Coast Guard  does not know the quantities of each aircraft that optimally balance the  capability and presence of its fixed-wing fleet.

In its comments, DHS concurred with our first recommendation but did  not concur with our second recommendation. DHS\u2019s written comments  are reprinted in appendix II. We also provided a full draft of this report to  DOD and draft sections of this report to Alenia Aermacchi and L-3  Communications, which provided us with technical comments that we  incorporated as appropriate.", "In its letter, DHS stated that it disagreed with our analysis of cost and  flight hours because it contains updated assumptions that are not carried  through the entire report. During our review, the Coast Guard agreed that  changing these assumptions would provide a more accurate  understanding of the Coast Guard\u2019s current fixed-wing fleet costs and  flight hours. DHS and Coast Guard officials stated that they are not  planning to conduct an analysis of the Coast Guard\u2019s current fixed-wing  aircraft plan. To assess this plan accurately, as discussed in the  objectives, scope, and methodology of this report, we changed two key  assumptions from the Coast Guard\u2019s 2013 letter to Congress. First, the  HC-144 is now planned to fly only 1,000 hours per year compared to the  original plan of 1,200 hours per year. Second, the original analysis  assumed all of the Coast Guard\u2019s aircraft have a 30-year service life. In  reality, each aircraft type is projected to have a different service life: 40  years for the HC-144; 30 years for the HC-130J; and 25 years for the C- 27J. We applied these assumptions to all of our calculations and then  compared our results with what the Coast Guard presented to Congress  to determine what, if any, differences exist. We believe this analysis is  necessary to understand changes the Coast Guard has made and how  they compare to the total savings presented to Congress.", "Regarding the first recommendation, on informing Congress of the time  frames and milestones for completing the fleet mix study, DHS concurred  with our recommendation but did not provide specific time lines for  meeting this recommendation. Based upon a project schedule we  received in fall 2014, DHS is currently working toward completing its full  fleet mix analysis effort, including providing a revised statement of annual  flight hour needs. The Coast Guard plans to complete its initial mission  needs statement and concept of operations by 2016, but these  documents will not identify the exact mix of assets the Coast Guard  needs to meet its missions. Once these documents are complete, the  Coast Guard will conduct further analysis to produce the fleet mix study.  Based on the study, the Coast Guard plans to recommend a fleet of  assets that best meets its needs and, according to officials, will take fiscal  constraints into account. The time line for this second effort is unclear but  officials told us that they plan for it to inform the fiscal year 2019 budget.  We believe it is crucial for Congress and other stakeholders to  understand when this information will be available so that key decisions  can be made with accurate and up-to-date data. Further, Congress needs  to know that the mix of the Coast Guard\u2019s fixed-wing fleet assets will likely  change based upon the results of this study.", "DHS did not agree with our second recommendation, that the  Commandant of the Coast Guard advise Congress to modify the  provision of any additional HC-130Js pending the results of the fleet mix  study. DHS stated that it would be inappropriate for the Coast Guard to  provide additional guidance, beyond the President\u2019s budget, to the United  States Congress on how to appropriate funds. The context for our  recommendation reflects the fact that Congress uses many information  sources to make decisions on how to appropriate funds that are not  included in the President\u2019s budget, such as information provided through  agency briefings and reports, input from congressional agencies, and  other sources. The Coast Guard has initiated an assessment that it states  will provide a definitive flight hour goal for its fixed-wing assets\u2014and  subsequently the number and type of aircraft to meet this need. Without  knowing the outcome of that assessment, Congress risks providing  aircraft that may be in excess of the Coast Guard\u2019s needs and that could  result in an additional $1 billion in costs to the Coast Guard. In the  meantime, as several C-130Js are already in the pipeline and 14 C-27Js  have recently been received, the Coast Guard has prudently decided to  pause the HC-144 program while it reassesses its needs. If receiving  more C-130Js could complicate or even obviate the fleet mix analysis,  now is the time to so advise Congress.", "DHS and the Coast Guard also provided technical comments that we  incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department  of Homeland Security, Commandant of the Coast Guard, and Secretary  of the Department of Defense.

To develop a list of major steps in the transfer process,  we analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s initial C-27J Implementation Plan and  compared the steps in this plan to the Coast Guard\u2019s Major Systems  Acquisition Manual as well as the most recent C-27J Acquisition Decision  Memorandum to identify what needed to be done and when. To gain a  better sense of the history of the aircraft and its past performance and  issues, we reviewed program documents on costs, and maintenance  history from both the Air Force and Army. We spoke to members of the  Air Force\u2019s C-27J program office to identify how much knowledge the Air  Force gained through its acquisition process and gain an understanding  of the successes and challenges that they were having. We also reviewed  interagency contracting agreements the Coast Guard has with the Army  and Navy as well as C-27J contract documents. We interviewed Coast  Guard officials from the requirements and acquisitions directorates to  identify challenges for the transfer and sustainment of the aircraft, as well  as officials from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers,  Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Project regarding the  acquisition and implementation of the mission system.", "We developed a list of risk areas based on Coast Guard documentation  and what is needed to develop sufficient knowledge about the program.  We interviewed U.S. Naval Air Systems Command officials on  airworthiness standards as well as the mission system in development by  the Navy. We visited the Air Force 309th Aerospace Maintenance and  Regeneration Group (AMARG), located on Davis-Monthan Air Force  Base, to view the 13 C-27Js in storage and interview Air Force officials in  charge of the C-27Js on site, as well as collect flight and maintenance  logs regarding past C-27J operation. We met with U.S. Army Special  Operations Command officials at Fort Bragg, interviewed contracted  logistics support for the C-27J, and toured the parts warehouse and  viewed some of the C-27Js on site. We also interviewed program office  officials and contractor representatives from the Coast Guard\u2019s C-27J  Asset Project Office to gain a better sense of operational challenges and  how they are being addressed and toured their respective facilities to  discuss issues related to the fielding of the aircraft. We visited L-3  Communications in Waco, Texas to discuss the progress of the 14th  plane, view the plane in its current condition, and interview Defense  Contract Management Agency officials.", "To assess the costs of operating and fully equipping the C-27J for Coast  Guard missions compared to the program of record, we used the Coast  Guard\u2019s May 2012 business case for information regarding all of the costs  associated with acquiring and operating this asset for the next 30 years\u2014 2013 through 2042. This estimate, derived in May 2012 by the  Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center at Wright Patterson  Air Force Base in Ohio, used the costs for the HC-144 and the HC-130J  to estimate the costs of the C-27J using the relative weights of each  aircraft. We also used the same perspective as this analysis, in that we  looked at the costs to the Coast Guard over the next 30 years given the  options for fleet composition. We assumed\u2014similar to the 2012 business  case\u2014that the Coast Guard has to purchase the remaining HC-130Js  with acquisition funds even though these aircraft have been added by  Congress to the Coast Guard\u2019s budget in prior years.", "We changed three assumptions underlying the analysis to better reflect  the Coast Guard\u2019s actual data:   1.  Flight Hours: The business case assumed that the C-27J and HC- 144 would fly 1,200 hours per year but the Coast Guard plans to fly  each aircraft for 1,000 hours per year. Our analysis used the 1,000  hour number because it is the actual planned amount.  2.  Designed Service Life: The Coast Guard\u2019s business case assumed  that all three of its fixed-wing assets have the same designed service  life. However, the HC-144 has a 40-year designed service life, the C- 27J has a 25-year designed service life, and the HC-130J is designed  for a 30-year life. While the Coast Guard maybe able to extend the  service life of the C-27J, it could also do so for the HC-144 and HC- 130J. We accounted for this by dividing each asset\u2019s full acquisition  cost by the designed service life and multiplying by the 30-year span  of the analysis.   3.  Spare Parts: The Coast Guard is not going to receive $42 million in  spare parts from the Air Force, which was factored into the original  business case but not our analysis.", "We also used the business case to generate purchase and employment  schedules for each fixed-wing aircraft for the next 30 years. To assess the  Coast Guard\u2019s current plan, we received the planned flight hours for the  next 10 years from the Coast Guard\u2019s planning directorate and, similar to  the business case, extrapolated these numbers over the next 30 years.", "To convert all information into fiscal year 2015 dollars, we used the  deflators for procurement, fuel, operations and maintenance, and military  pay as appropriate from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s  National Budget Estimates for FY 2015, known as the green book.", "The efficiency of each planned fleet was derived by taking the total  acquisition and operating costs of each planned fleet and dividing this  number by the total planned flight hours.", "Lastly, we met with Coast Guard officials who put together the Coast  Guard\u2019s estimate and assessed the estimate from the  Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center. In addition, we met  with Coast Guard officials who are working on the Coast Guard\u2019s Fleet  Mix Analysis who provided schedules and briefings to us describing this  ongoing assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Katherine Trimble, Assistant Director;  Laurier R.
