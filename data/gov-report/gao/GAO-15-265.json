Since 2010, some misuses of the program by participants and criminal organizations and abuses of participants\u2014for example, low wages and substandard living conditions\u2014have been reported.

Participants are meant to experience U.S. culture by interacting with Americans during work and through cultural activities in their free time. State administers the program in partnership with U.S. private sector sponsors that serve as participants' primary contacts. Program funding comes primarily from fees paid by participants and sponsors.", "State has taken several steps to strengthen SWT requirements since 2010. For example, in 2011, State began requiring sponsors to verify employers and job offers and prohibited jobs such as adult entertainment and domestic help. State also capped the number of participants at 109,000 until it could determine that it had addressed identified concerns; as of October 2014, State had no plans for lifting the cap. State made further changes in 2012, such as requiring\u2014in response to allegations of excessive participant costs\u2014that sponsors annually submit lists of fees that SWT participants pay them and their overseas agents. State also required sponsors to provide participants cultural opportunities outside the workplace.", "State oversees sponsors through both general and targeted reviews of their compliance with program requirements. State oversees participants' welfare by periodically interviewing a small number of participants and investigating complaints and reports from participants and others. However, State does not have mechanisms to ensure that sponsors submit complete and consistent lists of fees that participants pay them and their overseas agents and that this information is made publicly available. State thus has limited ability to protect participants from excessive and unexpected costs. Further, State officials told GAO that it cannot assess the sufficiency and appropriateness of participants' cultural opportunities outside the workplace because the 2012 requirement lacks detailed criteria.

We recommended that State  update its regulations, obtain and assess data on program abuses, and  implement a compliance unit to better monitor exchange program  activities and address deficiencies. State implemented all three of our  recommendations. However, since 2010, it has been reported that some  SWT program participants have abused the program\u2014for instance, by  committing visa fraud and other criminal activities\u2014and that some SWT  employers and other parties have abused participants\u2014for example, by  charging high rent for substandard housing conditions or making  fraudulent job offers. According to State officials, such abuses are more  the exception than the norm; however, the abuses have brought notoriety  and disrepute to the SWT program, State, and the U.S. government and  created a public diplomacy challenge. Additionally, Members of Congress  have raised questions about whether, counter to the Fulbright-Hays Act\u2019s  intent, the SWT program\u2019s cultural exchange aspect was receiving  sufficient emphasis. In response to the reported abuses, State undertook  a program review in 2010 that led to changes in SWT program  requirements. In 2012, State noted that the SWT program\u2019s work  component had often overshadowed the core cultural exchange  component necessary for the SWT program to be consistent with the  intent stated in the act.

The procedures note that in general, State is to refer  complaints to sponsors and resolve the complaints in coordination  with the complainant (for complaints) and the sponsor. The  procedures list 40 complaint categories for the SWT program, ranging  from \u201caccident\u201d to \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d to \u201cworkplace discrimination.\u201d  State\u2019s procedures lay out criteria and steps for referring serious  complaints to senior State officials. State may provide information  about sponsorship best practices to help the sponsor improve its  program. If a complaint about a sponsor identifies serious regulatory  concerns and potential violations, State may draft a letter of concern  as part of its process for closing out the complaint; State may also  sanction the sponsor, depending on the degree of misconduct. Figure  5 shows State\u2019s process for addressing complaints.", "Incident reports. Sponsors are required to promptly inform State of  any serious problem or controversy that could be expected to bring  State or the SWT program into notoriety or disrepute. Sponsors  submit this information in incident reports. According to State, most  incident reports involve matters such as deaths, accidents, crimes or  arrests, medical issues, sexual abuse, or missing persons. State\u2019s  process for handling incident reports is similar to its process for  handling complaints, and State uses the same procedures to escalate  incidents as it uses to escalate complaints. State logs and maintains  information about each incident report, using the same database that  it uses for registering complaints. According to State\u2019s procedures,  State maintains contact with the sponsor regarding the incident until it  is resolved. For example, if the incident report involved the death of  an SWT participant, State would follow up with the sponsor until the  participant\u2019s body was repatriated, or if a participant was hospitalized,  until the participant was released from the hospital. If a sponsor fails  to submit an incident report about a serious problem or controversy,  State notes the failure as a potential regulatory violation and may  sanction the sponsor.", "State provided data showing that in 2013, State received relatively few  complaints and incidents\u2014592 and 143, respectively\u2014given the  approximately 86,500 participants in the SWT program that year.  Examples of the 2013 complaints range from participant problems with  pay or living conditions to lack of response from sponsors. Examples of  incidents in 2013 include participants\u2019 arrests for theft, involvement in car  and bicycle accidents, and deaths. According to State, approximately 38  percent of 2013 complaints and incident reports resulted from field site  reviews, 22 percent were called in by sponsors, 20 percent came into  State\u2019s hotline, 14 percent were sent to State\u2019s e-mail in-box, and 7  percent came from unspecified sources.", "State\u2019s procedures do not specify response time frames but require that  all complaints and incident reports be handled quickly and efficiently.
