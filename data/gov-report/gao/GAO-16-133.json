While DOD reduced its request, however, Congress in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 directed funding at generally comparable amounts from prior years.

We also reviewed documentation on funding allocations and financial  management policy and interviewed DOD and interagency partner  officials regarding the changes in funding. To assess the extent to which  performance information is used to evaluate the counterdrug program\u2019s  activities, we reviewed documentation and interviewed counterdrug  officials about program activities, types of performance information  collected, and funding levels for individual state counterdrug programs.  Specifically, first, we evaluated the counterdrug program\u2019s 26 fiscal year  2015 performance measures against nine key attributes of successful  performance established by GAO.

The authority to provide funding for the first state  project\u2014state plans\u2014began in 1989 when DOD was authorized by  Congress under section 112 of Title 32 of the United States Code to fund  the National Guard\u2019s drug interdiction and counterdrug activities. Each  participating state counterdrug program must develop an annual plan of  activities, in coordination with the state\u2019s Governor and Attorney General.  In developing their plans, states use annual guidance issued by DOD  outlining the department\u2019s domestic counterdrug program priorities. Once  the state plans have been developed, they are reviewed by National  Guard counterdrug program officials, and are then sent to DOD for  approval. National Guard policy states that state counterdrug programs  can provide assistance to interagency partners in 5 mission areas:  reconnaissance, technical support, general support, civil operations, and  counterdrug training. In 2006, Congress provided authority to the Chief  of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) to operate up to five counterdrug  schools. These five schools, located in Florida, Iowa, Mississippi,  Pennsylvania, and Washington, provide training in drug interdiction and  counterdrug activities to personnel from federal agencies; state, local, and  tribal law enforcement agencies; community-based organizations; and  other non-federal governmental and private organizations. In 2011 the  program added a third state project\u2014counterthreat finance\u2014to assist  interagency partners with investigations of drug trafficking and  transnational criminal organizations\u2019 money laundering schemes.

It is from this  account that DOD funds the National Guard\u2019s participation in domestic  interdiction and counterdrug activities. In his fiscal year 2016 budget the  President requested approximately $850.6 million for this account to  support DOD-wide drug interdiction efforts.

Congress appropriates funds into DOD\u2019s Drug Interdiction  account but through its committee reports provides direction to DOD on  the specific amounts to allocate for the counterdrug program. Based on  DOD data, in every year since fiscal year 2004, Congress has directed  funding above DOD\u2019s requested amount, keeping program amounts  generally steady through 2014. In fiscal year 2013, when DOD began to  reduce the amount of funding within the budget request for this program  in order to prioritize funding for other DOD counterdrug programs,  Congress directed program amounts generally comparable to those of  prior years.

From fiscal years 2013 to 2016,  DOD reduced its budget request for counterdrug intelligence and  technology support, as well as domestic efforts such as those supported  by the National Guard more than international interdiction support  activities. DOD officials stated that by decreasing requested funding for  the counterdrug program they planned to address spending limits  required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and to fund counternarcotics  programs in locations deemed a priority, such as Central and South  America.

However, from fiscal years 2011 through 2014 the  program\u2019s obligations fluctuated between 83 percent and 96 percent of  DOD\u2019s allocations, partly due to the timing and amount of allocations  received by the program. Funds transferred or allocated from the Drug  Interdiction account to various other DOD drug interdiction accounts or  programs, including the National Guard program, can be transferred back  to the account upon a determination that all or part of the funds are not  necessary and remain unobligated.

Such information could include a measure of the quality of the support  provided by the National Guard to interagency partners, among other  things. Instead, NBG officials were making funding distribution decisions  for individual state programs based solely on assessments of threat.  According to NGB officials, in 2012 they began using a model to  determine the severity of the drug threat in each state and using the  assessments of threat to determine funding levels for state counterdrug  programs to implement their plans. NGB officials stated that to employ  the threat-based resourcing model, NGB uses statistics from national- level databases to develop a distribution percentage for each state that  reflects its relative drug threat. This percentage is then applied to the  funding provided to the National Guard\u2019s counterdrug program. In fiscal  year 2015 the amount distributed to the states was $146.1 million.

Specifically, the performance measures  employed by the NGB focused on the number of students trained and  the number of courses available, among other aspects. The officials  stated these measures were not useful in the evaluation of the  counterdrug school\u2019s training activities because they did not provide  information on the type of training being offered, such as whether it  had a counterdrug focus. In addition, DOD Counternarcotics Program  officials acknowledged that they did not have a full understanding of  the counterdrug schools\u2019 activities. To improve their oversight of the  schools, DOD Counternarcotics Program officials began a review in  December 2014 of the counterdrug schools\u2019 activities to assess their  training efforts. In May 2015, based on the preliminary findings of the  review, the DOD Counternarcotics Program included guidance in its  memorandum, Preparation of the Fiscal Year 2016 National Guard  State Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities Plan, that clarified  the mission of the counterdrug schools and the department\u2019s priorities  for their training, including that all training offered be explicitly linked to  counterdrug efforts. As a result, the counterdrug schools are required  to submit annual training plans that detail course offerings for review  by the NGB and DOD to ensure that the training is focused on DOD\u2019s  priorities.

If no defense appropriations act  has been passed and DOD is operating under a continuing resolution,  amounts transferred are based on a rate-per-day formula developed by  DOD. Once a defense appropriation act is enacted, the Comptroller is  required to submit to Congress the department\u2019s intended budget  execution based on the appropriation act and congressional directions as  expressed in House and Senate Appropriation committee reports. This  report, which DOD calls the base for reprogramming and transfer  authorities (DD1414), is to be submitted no later than 60 days from the  enactment of an appropriation. After this baseline is submitted,  Comptroller officials review and approve the DD1415-3 and forward it to  the Office of Management and Budget. Once approved by the Office of  Management and Budget, the Comptroller issues a funding authorization  document to transfer funds to the military services appropriation accounts  (such as military personnel or operation and maintenance).
