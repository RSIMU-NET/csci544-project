These  backlogs can include sexual assault kits (SAKs). There have been  concerns that these backlogs of unanalyzed evidence have enabled serial  offenders to reoffend or have delayed justice.

To assess the backlog of DNA evidence  among CEBR grantees, we collected yearly baseline performance data  from CEBR grantees from 2011 through 2016. We selected 2011 to  coincide with the year in which two grant programs were combined into  what is now known as the CEBR grant program, and 2016 was the latest  year for which grantee data were available. To assess the extent to which  DOJ-compiled CEBR baseline data are reliable, we completed a number  of data reliability steps, including discussing data entry issues with  grantees and running logic tests on the data. Despite some limitations  found with regards to validating and reporting requirements, after  completing these steps, we determined that CEBR data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of illustrating year-over-year aggregate trends  among CEBR grantees.", "Additionally, to identify factors that contribute to backlogs of unanalyzed  DNA evidence at laboratories, we reviewed relevant studies and  discussed factors with DNA evidence stakeholders, including DOJ  officials, CEBR grantees, forensic crime laboratory directors, and relevant  academics and practitioners. We summarized information from these  sources to identify common factors, and we included illustrative examples  of the types of factors we have identified to date in our statement. To  assess the extent to which DOJ has clearly defined goals for CEBR, we  are reviewing OJP CEBR documentation, including the most recent  CEBR grant solicitation and CEBR program performance reports. We  also discussed program goals with OJP officials. Finally, to assess the  extent to which OJP has controls associated with federal conflicts of  interest and lobbying requirements, we identified federal statutes and  regulations governing conflicts of interest and lobbying.

As a result, these factors  are believed to have helped contribute to increased backlogs:  Recent scientific advancements have increased the quality of  DNA analysis by allowing lab analysts to obtain DNA profiles from  smaller amounts of biological evidence. This has increased the  amount of evidence that is eligible to be analyzed and, as a result,  has increased the demand for DNA testing.", "One DNA evidence stakeholder was able to produce preliminary  data demonstrating that, as a general trend, labs that decreased  their turnaround time saw corresponding increases in requests  from law enforcement. Other DNA stakeholders, including NIJ,  made similar observations.", "Increased awareness among law enforcement and the public  Increased awareness among law enforcement officers of the value  of DNA analysis in solving current and older cases has led to law  enforcement agencies submitting more DNA evidence to labs for  analysis. Further, NIJ and other stakeholder officials we  interviewed stated that the volume of DNA profiles in CODIS has  increased significantly over recent years. This, in turn, increased  the usefulness of DNA evidence in testing suspect DNA profiles  against a well-populated database of existing offenders. This  usefulness has increased awareness among law enforcement  personnel of CODIS, which contributes to increased demand for  DNA analysis, thereby contributing to the backlog. Additionally,  when deciding whether to submit DNA evidence for analysis, law  enforcement and prosecutors may consider jurors\u2019 expectations  that DNA analysis is presented.", "Recent legislation requiring Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) analysis  State legislation requiring SAK analysis has caused an increase in  demand for DNA analysis. As of July 2018, we identified at least  25 states that have enacted laws requiring law enforcement to  submit for testing SAKs that come into law enforcement  possession. Eleven of these states also required the submission  for testing of previously untested SAKs. Twenty-one of these laws  were passed in 2014 or later.", "In addition to the factors that have contributed to increased demand,  resource challenges and constraints on lab capacity are reported to have  helped contribute to crime scene evidence backlogs. State and local labs  generally receive appropriations from state or local governments and are  subject to local funding priorities. Federal grants can help, but even  combined federal and jurisdictional funding may not increase lab capacity  enough to keep up with increases in demand.
