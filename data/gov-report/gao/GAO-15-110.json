Twenty-one of these programs, including Medicaid, are administered or overseen by HHS. The type of funding provided by these programs varies, but includes capital investments (such as bus purchases) and reimbursements of transportation costs (e.g., bus passes). Total federal spending on NEMT is unknown because federal departments do not separately track spending for these services. In some cases data were not available or NEMT was incidental to a program's mission. However, one of the six departments (HHS) was able to provide estimates indicating that its spending totaled at least $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2012\u2014most of this attributable to Medicaid.", "Coordination of NEMT programs at the federal level is limited, and there is fragmentation, overlap, and potential for duplication across NEMT programs.

The strategic plan identified the council's goal, priorities, and objectives for 2011 to 2013. However, the council has provided limited leadership and has not issued key guidance documents that could promote coordination. For example, the council has not met since 2008 and has not finalized a cost-sharing policy that would allow agencies to identify and allocate costs among programs. GAO has previously found that agencies providing similar transportation services to similar client groups may lead to duplication and overlap when coordination does not occur. This review found instances of fragmentation, overlap, and the potential for duplication, although the extent could not be quantified.", "State and local officials in the selected states GAO visited identified a variety of ways they facilitate coordination of NEMT. These include state coordinating bodies (two states GAO visited), regional coordinating bodies (two states GAO visited), local metropolitan planning organizations, and local transit agencies. Cost and ride sharing and one-call/one-click information centers were also used to coordinate NEMT services. However, GAO found two programs\u2014Medicaid and VA NEMT programs\u2014largely do not participate in coordination activities. Requirements to serve only eligible individuals and ensuring proper controls are in place to prevent improper payments and fraud are among the challenges to coordination for these programs.

CMS officials told us  they encourage state agencies administering the Medicaid program to  coordinate their transportation services with other non-Medicaid agencies.  However, none of the Medicaid agencies in the five states we visited  participated in the coordinated transportation planning process. Similarly,  in a March 2007 letter from VA, the agency\u2019s medical centers were  encouraged to participate in the coordinated transportation planning  process but we found that none of the five VA medical centers we visited  participate in this process or make assets, such as vehicles, available to  other federal agencies.", "Coordination may also be difficult due to internal problems and budget  constraints within federal agencies.

In addition, budget constraints often limit VA\u2019s  ability to reach the community of veterans whom it seeks to serve. These  challenges were illustrated at one VA medical center we visited where the  NEMT fleet manager told us he had spent most of the first year in his  position trying to coordinate NEMT service among the various internal VA  components.

We have previously found that  the multiple agencies providing transportation services to transportation- disadvantaged persons has resulted in fragmented services that can be  difficult for clients to navigate and that narrowly focused programs may   We have also found those agencies providing  result in service gaps.transportation services to transportation-disadvantaged persons often  provide similar services to similar client groups, leading to potential  duplication and overlap and service inefficiencies when coordination does  not occur. Fragmentation, overlap, and duplication can result in service  inefficiencies or increased costs when coordination does not occur.", "NEMT services are fragmented because there is more than one federal  agency involved in the same broad area. As discussed earlier in this  report, six federal agencies administer 42 different programs for which  NEMT is an eligible expense. Overlap exists because programs that  provide NEMT have similar goals and target potentially similar  beneficiaries. Both Medicaid and VA have similar goals of helping their  respective beneficiaries access medical services (some individuals could  be eligible for both Medicaid and VA), serve potentially similar  beneficiaries\u2014those individuals with disabilities, who are low income or  who are elderly\u2014and engage in similar activities, such as providing  NEMT transportation directly or indirectly. The potential for duplication in  NEMT programs exists because two or more programs provide the same  services to the same beneficiaries.", "The Coordinating Council has not directly addressed duplication, overlap,  or fragmentation issues. The strategic plan did not specifically address  these issues or establish a goal to help minimize or reduce them. In  addition, the Coordinating Council has no on-going activities regarding  these issues. Coordinating Council officials told us the council\u2019s purpose  is to promote coordination efforts at the federal level, and that in general,  there are no specific activities related to identifying and reducing  duplication, overlap, or fragmentation. We have also previously found that  the Coordinating Council could play a more active role in helping to  reduce duplication and overlap by developing the means for collecting  and sharing program information by establishing agency roles and  responsibilities and developing a strategy to reinforce cooperation. In  regard to NEMT, as discussed earlier, some agencies have disseminated  guidance and policies regarding coordination of programs but few  agencies have collected information on NEMT expenditures. In at least  one case, an agency did not think it was cost effective to collect  transportation expenditures. For example, in our 2012 report on  transportation programs for disadvantaged persons, HUD officials told us  that reporting transportation expenses would require a new reporting  effort and the resulting information may not be analyzed due to resource  constraints.", "State and local officials told us there is duplication, overlap, or  fragmentation among NEMT programs, particularly for the Medicaid  program. Officials in all five states we visited told us duplication and  overlap existed among NEMT programs. Officials we spoke with at a  private, not-for-profit agency in Florida that provides NEMT service in St.  Augustine and St. John\u2019s counties told us there is overlap and  fragmentation because Medicaid and non-Medicaid NEMT services are  not coordinated. They said many of the Medicaid rides are single  passenger trips instead of multi-passenger trips because providers  handling the Medicaid trips are not coordinating trips for passengers  going to the same place. Similarly, officials at the Texas Department of  Transportation told us there is duplication, overlap, and fragmentation and  NEMT can be a part of the service that public transit agencies can  provide. However, they said Medicaid is a challenge since it has little  leeway in coordinating its service with other programs. For example, the  Medicaid service provider is given a passenger manifest each day,  provides the transportation service, and then moves on to the next day.  The officials said there is no room to coordinate schedules or to trip plan  which could facilitate sharing of services and costs with public transit  agencies or others. CMS officials said the use of Medicaid funds are for  specific purposes, and this specification may limit how much states or  brokers can coordinate with non-Medicaid programs. However, they said  states are not prohibited from participating in the transportation planning  and coordination process.", "We were unable to quantify the extent of duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation of NEMT programs. In general, this is because there are no  data on the extent of duplication or overlap. In addition, other factors that  make it difficult to quantify duplication, overlap, or fragmentation include:", "Presence or lack of transportation options: Some programs may  provide services that are duplicative in some locations because, for  example, there is already public or other transportation present, but  not duplicative in other locations where there is no other available  service. For example, urban locations tend to have more  transportation options, whereas rural locations tend to have fewer  options.", "Nature of population served: A service may be duplicative for some  portion of the population using NEMT service but not for other  portions. For example, ambulatory individuals (those who can walk or  otherwise move themselves) may be able to avail themselves of a  number of transportation options. Those portions of the population  who are not ambulatory (e.g., in a wheelchair) may have fewer, if any,  options."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States and Localities Facilitate Coordination in Various Ways but Two Programs in Selected States Largely Do Not Participate in Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Use Variety of Ways to Facilitate Coordination of NEMT", "paragraphs": ["States and localities use a variety of ways to facilitate coordination of  transportation and human service programs, including programs that  provide NEMT. These include state and regional coordinating bodies,  cost and ride sharing, and one call/one-click centers. In March 2013, the  National Council on State Legislatures (NCSL) reported that at least 28  states had established state-level coordinating councils and 29 states had  established regional coordinating organizations. According to NCSL,  these organizations\u2014which can be established by state legislation,  executive order, or are voluntary associations of various groups that  come together to facilitate planning efforts\u2014facilitate cooperation among  government agencies and stakeholder groups. Two of the states we  visited, Florida and Maryland, had established state-level bodies to lead  coordination efforts for transportation and human service programs,  including NEMT. Two other states, Oregon and Texas, had regional  bodies that facilitated coordination, while the fifth state, Pennsylvania,  primarily relied on local metropolitan planning organizations to facilitate  coordination.", "In the states we visited, the activities of state and local coordinating  bodies vary. For example, Florida\u2019s Commission for the Transportation  Disadvantaged (CTD) coordinates transportation statewide in Florida for  persons with disabilities, older adults, low-income persons, and those  who do not have access to healthcare, education, or other life sustaining  activities. CTD coordinates transportation by contracting with Community  Transportation Coordinators in Florida counties. According to CTD  officials, Florida has a highly coordinated transportation system,  particularly since the local Community Transportation Coordinators are  responsible for knowing the transportation system in their area and  preparing the public transit-human service transportation coordinated  plan. One Community Transportation Coordinator we spoke with told us  the coordinated transportation planning process included NEMT. In  contrast, officials with the Maryland State Coordinating Committee for  Human Service Transportation (SCC) told us that although they are  responsible for coordinating transportation and human service programs  in the state, the committee had not been active in recent years and state  agencies mainly leave coordination of programs to local agencies and  transportation providers. This includes Medicaid; state Medicaid agency  officials told us they leave coordination of transportation services like  NEMT to local health departments. Officials at two local health  departments that we spoke to, one in Baltimore, Maryland, and one in a  rural Maryland county, told us they do not participate in the coordinated  transportation-planning process and do not coordinate their NEMT with  non-Medicaid NEMT programs.", "Cost and ride sharing and one-call/one-click information centers, among  other efforts, are also used in some states to coordinate NEMT programs.  For example, although the Coordinating Council has not finalized cost- sharing methodologies, we found that cost and ride sharing is occurring in  some locations and this has promoted coordination of NEMT service. Two  Oregon transit agencies we spoke with said they have coordinated  Medicaid NEMT and non-Medicaid NEMT using cost and ride sharing.  One agency developed software that it uses to schedule transportation,  record customer eligibility for transportation programs, including Medicaid  NEMT, and coordinate Medicaid and non-Medicaid NEMT by  implementing ridesharing, when feasible. We also found transit agencies  in Texas that were using cost and ride sharing to coordinate NEMT  service. On the other hand, one-call/one-click information centers do not  always promote coordination of NEMT. Projects were under way in all five  states we visited, in some instances funded by VTCLI grants, to establish  one-call/one-click information centers. Officials with the VA medical  center in Lake City, Florida, told us they were aware of the one-call/one- click center being established and were interested in participating in this  center and thought it might be a way to coordinate NEMT. However,  Medicaid and VA officials in Texas and Maryland told us they do not  participate in one-call/one-click centers but rather have established their  own call centers to handle eligible NEMT program beneficiaries. An  official with a Medicaid agency in Baltimore thought one-call/one-click  centers might be more efficient but wait times for NEMT could be longer  than if calls were handled directly by Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid and VA NEMT Programs in Selected States Largely Do Not Participate in the Coordination Process", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, one of the priorities identified in the Coordinating  Council\u2019s 2011-2013 strategic plan was expanding the coordinated  human service-transportation infrastructure. In part, this was to be  accomplished by developing and promoting strategies for improving  stakeholder participation in the coordinated planning process required by  law. In its 2013 progress report, the Coordinating Council stated that  more efforts were needed to ensure all federally-assisted programs  funding transportation participated in the process since participation  varied from community to community. The coordinated transportation  planning process is based on a locally developed coordinated public  transit-human service transportation plan and is intended to be an  inclusive process that involves participation by a wide variety of  stakeholders. This includes individuals with disabilities and  representatives of public, private, and non-profit transportation and  human services agencies. The coordinated public transit-human service  transportation plans produced by this process are required to assess  available transportation resources, including federal, state, and local  transportation programs (which would include NEMT programs), gaps in  service for individuals with disabilities, seniors, and others, and identify  strategies and projects to coordinate transportation resources and  programs to best address the service gaps.", "In the states we visited, we found that two programs \u2014Medicaid and  collectively VA\u2019s NEMT programs\u2014largely do not participate in the  coordinated transportation-planning process. Both Medicaid and the VA  NEMT programs are locally administered. States administer the Medicaid  program and local medical centers administer VA\u2019s NEMT program.  These programs are important to NEMT, as they provide services to  potentially over 90 million individuals. As of fiscal year 2013, about 72  million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid (which includes some  enrollees in the CHIP) and, as of fiscal year 2012, VA served a population  of over 20-million veterans\u2014about 9 million of whom were enrolled in VA  health care in fiscal year 2013. In general, these programs provide their  own NEMT service that is focused on serving eligible beneficiaries. In  part, this is driven by federal requirements. Specifically, for Medicaid,  states are required to assure that necessary transportation will be  provided to eligible beneficiaries to and from medical providers. Medicaid  regulations also require that transportation be furnished by a provider to  which state agencies can make a direct vendor payment and that  payment for transportation service be used only to benefit eligible  Medicaid beneficiaries. These requirements make clear that federal  Medicaid funding for NEMT services must be applied to the individuals  who qualify for the program and not to the broader public that would use  public transportation.", "While program requirements drive the structure of the Medicaid NEMT  program, they also present a challenge to coordinating Medicaid NEMT  with other programs. CMS officials told us that using strategies such as  cost or ride sharing could increase the risk of Medicaid funds being spent  for individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid benefits. The officials  added that, without proper controls, cost or ride sharing with other non- Medicaid programs could allow for improper payments for individuals who  do not qualify for Medicaid. Past GAO studies have identified concerns  about Medicaid\u2019s improper payments, citing concerns about the  appropriateness of states\u2019 claims for transportation and other services,  such as those provided in schools that merge Medicaid funds with other  programs. Federal and state Medicaid officials largely confirmed that  these program requirements and integrity issues limit their ability to  participate in the coordinated transportation-planning process or engage  in cost or ride sharing with other non-Medicaid programs. For example,  Medicaid officials in all five states we visited said program requirements  limit their ability to participate in the coordinated transportation-planning  process or share rides or costs with non-Medicaid programs.", "Another challenge to coordination of Medicaid NEMT with other NEMT  programs is state use of brokers to arrange NEMT service. By law, states  may, at their option, use brokers to arrange NEMT service. Brokers can  be either public or private entities. CMS officials told us they do not keep  track of which states use brokers; however, states are required to amend  their state Medicaid plan to show the use of brokers to provide  transportation service. Officials in all five states we visited said they  contracted with brokers to arrange NEMT services for Medicaid  beneficiaries. In four of the five states we visited, private entities were  being used as brokers. By contrast, in Oregon, public transit agencies  were the brokers in the two areas we visited. However, Oregon could use  private brokers in these areas in the future depending on decisions on  how NEMT would be provided by the Coordinated Care Organizations  being established to administer the Medicaid program. In general, brokers  may have less incentive to participate in the coordinated transportation- planning process than public transit agencies. First, private brokers are  not required to participate in the coordinated-planning process and may  choose not to do so. Second, Medicaid regulations require transportation  be provided to beneficiaries to access Medicaid providers, and this is the  service that brokers are contracted to provide, not coordinate rides with  non-Medicaid programs. Public transit agencies, on the other hand, are  required to participate in the coordinated planning process if they receive  funds from FTA\u2019s Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and  Individuals with Disabilities. We spoke with two private Medicaid NEMT  brokers operating in different states and neither participated in the  coordinated transportation-planning process. Both said the coordination  process deals with policy decisions that are left to the agency they  contract with. One of the companies was being paid on a fee-for-service  basis (e.g., paid for each trip provided), while the other was being paid on  a flat capitation basis based on the number of eligible Medicaid  beneficiaries in the area it served.", "Finally, recent Medicaid reform efforts in some states may also present a  challenge to coordination of NEMT with non-Medicaid programs. Three of  the five states we visited\u2014Florida, Texas, and Oregon\u2014are in the midst  of making significant changes to their Medicaid programs. In general,  these reforms are aimed at moving to managed-care organizations  making decisions about medical services. In some states, decision  making will include how NEMT is provided. For example, Oregon officials  told us that Coordinated Care Organizations were being created to better  coordinate and integrate medical benefits provided to Medicaid recipients.  According to officials with the state Medicaid agency in Oregon, these  organizations must provide access to all Medicaid state plan services  included in their contracts, and are accountable for administering benefits  to beneficiaries in whatever manner will achieve the best outcome with  cost effectiveness, including NEMT. Local transit authorities and private  brokerages may be used by the Coordinated Care Organizations, and the  activity related to coordinating the NEMT benefit with the delivery of other  Medicaid services may be performed by the Coordinated Care  Organization, or subcontracted to the brokerage, according to the terms  of their agreements. In Texas, regional transportation management areas  are being created and competitively selected transportation managers will  provide NEMT for each area. Transportation managers could be either  public or private entities.", "In each of the three states, the Medicaid reforms will likely affect the way  NEMT is provided, primarily by increasing the role of brokers in arranging  service. For example, prior to May 2014, the Florida CTD provided  Medicaid NEMT through contracts with Community Transportation  Coordinators and subcontracted transportation providers in each of  Florida\u2019s 67 counties. Community Transportation Coordinators also  provided much of the non-Medicaid NEMT services in their respective  counties and were able to coordinate Medicaid NEMT and non-Medicaid  transportation services using ride and cost sharing. After February 2015,  CTD will no longer provide Medicaid NEMT under Florida\u2019s new Medicaid  system. Instead, managed-care organizations will provide Medicaid  NEMT in each of Florida\u2019s 11 Medicaid regions, using private  transportation brokers. Similarly, transportation and local transit officials in  Texas anticipated that the state\u2019s transition to a brokerage system for  providing Medicaid NEMT will decrease coordination between Medicaid  and non-Medicaid NEMT services. The officials said that, unlike transit  agencies that also provide non-Medicaid NEMT services using their own  vehicles and participate in the coordinated transportation-planning  process, transportation brokers might not coordinate Medicaid and non- Medicaid NEMT through ride and cost sharing and may choose not to  participate in the coordinated-planning process because they are not  required to do so.", "VA\u2019s NEMT programs also largely operate outside of the coordinated  transportation-planning process. Similar to Medicaid, VA NEMT programs  are standalone and designed to serve only eligible VA clients. In addition,  like Medicaid, VA\u2019s NEMT programs are client based and provide NEMT  only for qualified persons who need NEMT services for VA medical  appointments. Federal statute authorizes the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to pay the transportation costs of eligible persons to or from VA  facilities or other places for the purpose of receiving medical services.  However, this transportation is limited to eligible participants. In general,  eligible veterans must have a service-related disability, receive a VA  pension, or not exceed specified annual income thresholds.", "VA officials in the states we visited told us these funding and mission  requirements pose a challenge to coordinating NEMT services with other  federal programs. For example, VA medical center officials in Maryland  and Oregon stated that they do not provide VA subsidized bus passes  because those passes could be used for non-medical purposes\u2014which  are non-authorized uses under program rules. Accordingly, they said VA  provides transportation to veterans for NEMT only, even if the VA\u2019s costs  for providing NEMT is higher than the cost for a public transit bus pass.  VA officials in Pennsylvania told us that even if they wanted to they  cannot use other transportation programs, such as community-based  programs, to transport veterans who are eligible for VA NEMT services to  medical appointments. This is because the cost of the services cannot be  determined and they cannot handle bills from agencies providing  community-based services. VA officials in Texas stated that the various  NEMT programs have different rules for eligibility and that the differing  rules make it difficult for them to institute ride-sharing arrangements with  other non-VA NEMT programs. At the five medical centers we visited,  none of the officials told us that they shared resources with non-VA  NEMT programs and officials at two of the centers stated that using  community-based resources to provide NEMT for veterans could raise  legal questions about how federal funds are being spent since VA  program rules limit NEMT to eligible veterans.", "At the VA medical centers we visited, VA coordination with non-VA NEMT  programs was mainly limited to consultation with local transit agencies  about using VTCLI grants to establish one-call/one-click information  centers to benefit transportation disadvantaged populations, including  veterans. For example, officials at the VA medical centers in Dallas,  Texas, and Portland, Oregon, have consulted with local transit agency  officials who are using VTCLI grant funds to establish one-call/one-click  centers that will serve their metropolitan areas. These centers will arrange  NEMT and other transportation services for veterans and other  transportation-disadvantaged populations. The officials told us that they  worked with the transit agencies to identify veterans\u2019 transportation  needs, as well as how to make veterans aware of the mobility  management centers and the transportation options they offer.", "It is clear there are a number of challenges in increasing Medicaid and VA  participation in the coordinated transportation-planning process. Important  factors include ensuring that program integrity is maintained and proper  controls are in place to prevent improper payments and fraud. However,  coordination of NEMT without the Medicaid and VA programs increases  the risk of potential program overlap and duplication. In addition, given  the significance of these programs to the provision of NEMT service,  coordination that does not include these programs makes it more difficult  for the Coordinating Council to achieve its goal of promoting interagency  cooperation to enhance the access of transportation-disadvantaged  persons to both more and cost effective transportation services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Localities Cited Additional Challenges to NEMT Coordination", "paragraphs": ["State and local officials in the five states we visited identified additional  challenges to NEMT coordination. These challenges include:", "Lack of leadership or guidance at the federal level. State and local  transportation officials in four of the five states we visited told us that  federal leadership on NEMT coordination issues and coordination  guidance are inadequate or lacking. For example, Maryland SCC  officials told us neither FTA nor the Coordinating Council had provided  clear policies or guidance to Maryland on how to coordinate programs  that fund NEMT service. In addition, Oregon Department of  Transportation officials told us that among the changes needed at the  federal level are making more transportation-coordination policy  information available, including policies regarding coordination with  human services programs.", "State and local officials\u2019 perceptions of agency rules and effects of  improved NEMT coordination. Transportation and human services  agency officials in three of the five states we visited told us that many  state and local officials for human-services agencies and  transportation are reluctant to coordinate NEMT services with other  agencies because they interpret their agencies\u2019 policies as prohibiting  coordination activities such as cost and resource sharing.

However, NEMT  services are not well coordinated, and little is being done at the federal  level to help ensure that those who provide NEMT services can achieve  the benefits of coordination, such as reduced trip costs and more efficient  use of vehicles. The Coordinating Council, the organization tasked with  promoting interagency coordination of federal-transportation and human- service programs, has exercised little leadership and provided little  guidance. The executive council, which provides top management  direction, has not met since 2007, the strategic plan that outlines the  goals and strategies for coordination did not specifically address NEMT  and expired in 2013, and the Coordinating Council\u2019s interagency working  group on transportation and healthcare, which develops guidance for  agencies, is just now starting to look at the challenges associated with  coordinating transportation and healthcare programs. The Coordinating  Council has also not provided the tools for coordinating NEMT programs.

As a result, the federal government is  missing opportunities to save costs, use funds more efficiently, and  provide more services to those who depend on federally funded programs  for NEMT.", "Efforts to coordinate NEMT will also need to address those programs not  currently fully participating in the coordinated transportation-human  services planning process, notably the Medicaid and VA programs.

The Coordinating Council is tasked with promoting interagency  cooperation and establishing appropriate ways to minimize duplication  and overlap of federal programs so transportation-disadvantaged persons  have access to more transportation services. Since both Medicaid and VA  are major players in providing NEMT, it is incumbent on the Coordinating  Council and its member agencies to both identify the challenges some  programs have in participating in the coordination process and developing  approaches to address these challenges so all programs can share in the  benefits of program coordination, yet do so in ways that maintain program  integrity and prevent fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To promote and enhance federal, state, and local NEMT coordination  activities, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation, as the  chair of the Coordinating Council, convene a meeting of the member  agencies of the Coordinating Council and take the following three actions:", "Complete and publish a new or updated strategic plan that, among  other things, clearly outlines a strategy for addressing NEMT and how  it can be coordinated across federal agencies that fund NEMT  service.", "Finalize and issue a cost-sharing policy and clearly identify how it can  be applied to programs under the purview of member agencies of the  Coordinating Council that provide funding for NEMT.", "Using the on-going work of the Health, Wellness, and Transportation  working group and other appropriate resources, (1) identify the  challenges associated with coordinating Medicaid and VA NEMT  programs with other federal programs that fund NEMT, (2) develop  recommendations for how these challenges can be addressed while  still maintaining program integrity and fraud prevention, and (3) report  these recommendations to appropriate committees of Congress.

We included only programs that provide nonemergency,  nonmilitary, surface transportation services of any kind for the purposes  of receiving medical care; this includes programs that fund infrastructure- related costs for NEMT as well as those that fund the actual transport in a  private vehicle, van, or public transportation, such as a bus, to medical  appointments or services. We limited our scope to federal agencies that  are members of the federal Interagency Transportation Coordinating  Council on Access and Mobility (Coordinating Council) because these  agencies were identified by executive order to participate in coordinationand administered programs that play a key role in funding nonemergency  medical transportation. Other federal agencies may also have programs  that provide funding for NEMT.

We chose fiscal year 2012  since it was the most recent year for which full year data were available  about the Medicaid program. Agency officials provided requested  spending data when available, but we did not independently verify the  data provided. We supplemented and modified the inventory based on  this information.
