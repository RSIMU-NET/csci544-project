Few dependents of mobilized reservists experience disruptions in their health coverage--primarily because most maintained civilian health coverage while reservists were mobilized. Ninety percent of the reservists with civilian health coverage maintained that coverage. The 5-year cost of the coverage options delineated in the 2002 National Defense Authorization Act range from $89 million, for expanding the transition benefit allowing mobilizations, to $19.7 billion, for continuous coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To expand the capabilities of our nation\u2019s active duty forces, the  Department of Defense (DOD) relies on the 1.2 million men and women of  the Reserve and National Guard. Currently, reserve components  constitute nearly half our total armed forces. Reservists mobilized under  federal authorities are covered by TRICARE, DOD's health care system.  Also, their dependents, which include spouses, children, and others who  qualify, are eligible for TRICARE benefits. While DOD requires reservists  to use TRICARE for their own health care, using TRICARE is an option for  their dependents. During mobilizations some reservists may choose to  save the cost of premiums by dropping civilian insurance for their  dependents and relying on TRICARE, which has no associated premium.  However, doing so means that dependents must learn the benefits and  requirements of a new health plan. It also means that they may be unable  to use the same civilian providers if these providers do not participate in  TRICARE networks or accept TRICARE patients. To minimize potential  disruptions resulting from dropping and resuming civilian coverage,  military advocates have recommended that DOD provide a health benefit  to reservists and their dependents when reservists are not on active duty.", "The National Defense Authorization Act (2002 NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2002  directed that we study the health care benefits of reserve component  members and dependents and the effect mobilization may have on these  benefits. We (1) identified the health care coverage reservists have when  not on active duty, (2) determined the extent to which mobilizations cause  disruptions in coverage for reservists and their dependents, and   (3) assessed the costs of various options specified in the 2002 NDAA,  including providing reservists and their dependents health care through  TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), or  civilian coverage.", "To determine the coverage reservists have when not on active duty and the  extent to which mobilizations cause disruptions in coverage, we obtained  preliminary analyses of responses to health care related questions from  DOD\u2019s 2000 Survey of Reserve Component Personnel.  We also used a  questionnaire to obtain information from 360 mobilized reservists on the  type of civilian health care coverage they and their dependents had and  the extent to which mobilizations caused disruptions in coverage.  Included in these contacts were 286 reservists from three judgmentally  selected reserve component units of at least 50 reservists\u2014representing  the Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2014that, at the time of our audit, were  currently mobilized or had recently completed a mobilization. We also  contacted by telephone 74 reservists (or knowledgeable dependents) from  a randomly selected sample of 100 reservists, from about 100,000 who had  been mobilized since July 2000. We interviewed officials and  representatives from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Reserve Affairs, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs, the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), reservist advocacy  groups, and others. We also reviewed our prior work on reservists and  military health care. For costs of the different 2002 NDAA options for  providing coverage to reservists and their dependents, we relied on  estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

From fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001, an  average of about 11,000, or 1 percent, of the roughly 900,000 reservists  were mobilized each year.  The length of mobilizations can be as long as   2 years with the mean length of mobilizations for the 6-year period we  reviewed being 117 days. As of April 2002, about 80,000, or 8 percent, of  reservists had been mobilized for 1 year for operations related to  September 11, 2001. At the same time, additional reserve personnel  continued to be deployed throughout the world on various peacekeeping  and humanitarian missions.", "The rights of mobilized personnel of the reserve components are protected  under the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA), as  amended, and by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment  Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), as amended. Included in these acts are  protections related to health care coverage. For example, SSCRA provides  protections for reservists who have individual health coverage.  Specifically, for individually covered reservists returning from active duty,  SSCRA requires private insurance companies to reinstate coverage at the  premium rate they would have been paying had they never left. Under  SSCRA, the insurance company cannot refuse to cover most preexisting  conditions. During military service, USERRA protects reservists\u2019  employer-provided health benefits. Specifically, for absences of 30 days or  less (training periods typically last 2 weeks or less), health benefits  continue as if the employee had not been absent. For absences of 31 days  or more, coverage stops unless (1) the employee elects to pay for the  coverage, including the employer contributions, or (2) the employer  voluntarily agrees to continue coverage. Under USERRA, employers must  reinstate reservists\u2019 health coverage the day they apply to be reinstated in  their civilian positions\u2014even if the employers cannot put the employees  back to work immediately.", "Reservists mobilized under federal authorities are covered by TRICARE,  DOD's health care system. If they are ordered to active duty for 31 days or  more, reservists are enrolled in Prime, TRICARE\u2019s managed care option,  and\u2014like other active duty personnel\u2014are required to receive care  through TRICARE, either through 1 of 580 MTFs worldwide, or through  TRICARE\u2019s network of civilian providers. When reservists\u2019 mobilization  orders are for 31 to 178 days, their dependents are eligible for the Standard  and Extra options\u2014TRICARE\u2019s fee-for-service and preferred provider  options, respectively. Once eligible for TRICARE, reservists and their  dependents also become eligible for prescription drug benefits. When  reservists\u2019 orders are for 179 days or more, dependents are eligible for  health care under Prime. Under TRICARE, active duty personnel,  including mobilized reservists, do not pay premiums for their health care  coverage; however, depending on the option chosen, they may be  responsible for copayments, deductibles, and enrollment requirements for  their dependents. (For an overview of these benefits, see table 1.)", "Mobilized reservists are eligible for dental care through the military health  care system. However, like active duty dependents, mobilized reservists\u2019  dependents are only eligible for dental care if they participate in DOD\u2019s  voluntary dental insurance program, which requires enrollment and has  monthly premiums.", "Because mobilized reservists\u2019 dependents could be liable for two health  coverage deductibles in 1 year\u2014their civilian insurers\u2019 deductible prior to  mobilization and the TRICARE Standard or Extra deductible once  mobilized\u2014DOD has used authorities included in the National Defense  Authorization Acts for 2000 and 2001 to provide financial assistance  through several demonstration programs. For example, the Reserves  Component Family Member Demonstration Project\u2014available for those  currently mobilized under DOD\u2019s Operation Noble Eagle and Operation  Enduring Freedom\u2014eliminates the TRICARE deductible and the  requirement that dependents obtain statements that inpatient care is not  available in an MTF before obtaining nonemergency treatment from a  civilian hospital. In addition, DOD may pay non-network physicians up to  15 percent more than the TRICARE rate for treating dependents of  mobilized reservists\u2014a cost that otherwise would be borne by dependents  if physicians required this additional payment.", "Until recently, DOD had administered a transitional benefit program that  provided demobilized reservists and their dependents 30 days of additional  TRICARE coverage as they returned to their civilian health care. The 2002  NDAA extended the transitional period during which reservists may  receive TRICARE coverage from 30 days to 60--120 days, depending on the  length of active duty service. This change more closely reflects the 90 days  that USERRA provides reservists to apply for civilian reemployment when  they are mobilized for more than 181 days, and the change will provide  health care coverage if they elect to delay return to their employment  subsequent to demobilization. However, the 2002 NDAA did not provide  any transitional benefit for dependents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Percentage of Reservists with Coverage Is Similar to That Found in the General Population", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the percentage of reservists with health care coverage when they  are not mobilized is similar to that found in the general population\u2014and,  like the general population, most reservists have coverage through their  employers.

Preserving provider relationships was especially important to  reservists whose dependents with special needs had specialists familiar  with their care or to dependents who had long-standing relationships with  civilian providers.", "Reservists we contacted reported varying financial arrangements for  covering the costs of their civilian premiums while they were mobilized.  USERRA does not require employers to continue paying their share of  health insurance premiums when mobilizations extend beyond 30 days.  However, employers continued to pay at least their portion of health  insurance premiums beyond this 30-day period for about 80 percent of the  reservists we contacted who maintained their employer-sponsored  coverage. Sometimes, these employers paid all costs, both their own and  the employee portion, while in other instances reservists continued to pay  the employee portion of the premium.

While similar  problems have been reported by other active duty personnel, reservists  and their dependents are more likely to experience such problems  because they often live in areas distant from MTFs, and their active duty  service is brief and episodic.", "Of the 360 reservists with recent mobilization experience that we  contacted, about 38 percent reported some kind of problem with  TRICARE. One problem, constituting about a quarter of the reported  problems, was finding a TRICARE provider. Mobilized reservists and their  dependents can have more difficulty finding TRICARE providers because  many do not live in areas where the network is robust. Compared to 5  percent of active duty personnel, about 70 percent of reservists live and  work more than 50 miles (or an hour\u2019s drive) from an MTF\u2014areas DOD  has designated as remote. Because DOD\u2019s civilian contractors are  generally not required to establish TRICARE civilian networks in these  areas, a network of providers may not exist. Where networks do exist,  provider choice may be limited.  TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) and TPR  for Active Duty Family Members were established to help improve access  to care in remote areas for active duty and mobilized reservists and their  dependents. However, dependent eligibility is statutorily based on residing  with a service member who both lives and works in a remote area. As a  result, because mobilized reservists are most often assigned to work in a  location near an MTF or deployed overseas, few dependents of reservists  who are mobilized for 179 days or more are eligible for these programs.", "About 17 percent of reported problems involved documenting and  establishing eligibility. For example, reservists had problems with DOD  not providing identification cards acknowledging that they and their  dependents were TRICARE beneficiaries. They also had difficulties with  the accuracy of information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility  Reporting System (DEERS), DOD\u2019s database that maintains benefit  eligibility status. In order to ensure TRICARE eligibility, any status  changes must be reported to DEERS, and according to a DOD civilian  contractor, the services do not always send these changes to DEERS  promptly.", "Reservists reported a variety of situations in which DEERS inaccuracies  created problems. DEERS did not reflect that some reservists were on  active duty; therefore, they and their dependents appeared to be ineligible  for services and were denied care or medications. Further, in instances in  which DEERS failed to reflect Prime enrollment for a dependent, claims  were paid under Extra, resulting in charges for copayments that should  not have been required. Also, mobilized reservists married to active duty  personnel reported problems ensuring that DEERS accurately reflected  their mobilized status so that they were eligible for active duty, rather than  dependent, benefits and access privileges. Active duty families also have  problems with DEERS, but, according to a TRICARE adviser at one site  we visited, DEERS problems are accentuated for reservists because they  move in and out of the system. However, determining the extent of such  DEERS problems was beyond the scope of our work.", "Finally, about 40 percent of the problems reservists reported related to  understanding TRICARE\u2019s benefits and obtaining assistance when  questions or problems arose. According to DOD officials, mobilized  reservists have greater difficulty understanding and navigating TRICARE  than other active duty personnel. First, reservists have less incentive to  become familiar with TRICARE because mobilizations are for a limited  period and because TRICARE only becomes important to them and their  dependents if they are mobilized. Further, when first mobilized, reservists  must accomplish many tasks in a compressed period. For example, they  must prepare for an extended absence from home, make arrangements to  be away from their civilian employment, obtain military physical  examinations, and ensure that their families are registered in DEERS. DOD  officials told us that learning about TRICARE may be a low priority for  reservists when they are mobilizing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Targeted Education and Assistance Have Helped Minimize Some Reservists\u2019 and Dependents\u2019 TRICARE Problems", "paragraphs": ["According to interviews with reservists and support personnel at sites we  visited, problems with TRICARE could be reduced if education and  administrative assistance were available and information was targeted to  the needs of reservists. In addition, when beneficiaries, especially  reservists\u2019 dependents, were provided assistance with using the TRICARE  system\u2014identifying contact points and understanding TRICARE benefits  and how to use them\u2014they generally were able to obtain appropriate,  timely health care through TRICARE.", "At one site we visited, assistance had been lacking or inadequate, and  reservists were experiencing numerous difficulties with TRICARE. Here,  1,100 personnel, who were mobilized beginning in late September 2001  under Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom, initially  had no on-base MTF or TRICARE assistance. As a result, when questions  arose, these mobilized reservists and their dependents sometimes  obtained and passed along inaccurate information. In other instances they  contacted TRICARE\u2019s civilian contractor directly, sometimes waiting for  over an hour on hold trying to obtain information. In November 2001, two  administrative personnel were assigned, including a health benefits expert,  and at the time of our visit in February 2002, progress was being made to  resolve reservists\u2019 and their dependents\u2019 health care questions. However,  because this assistance was initially delayed, two staff members were  insufficient to address the volume of misinformation and problems that  existed on site. Beneficiaries told us they were still confused about  TRICARE regulations at the time we visited. Some mobilized reservists  still did not understand that they had to select a TRICARE primary care  manager and were continuing to use their non-network providers, even  though regulations require active duty personnel to participate in Prime.  Likewise, their dependents were continuing to have problems, such as  determining whether they could continue to see their civilian providers  under TRICARE.", "At another site we visited, which had an MTF and better on-base  assistance, we observed that reservists and their dependents generally  were not experiencing problems with TRICARE. In this location DOD had  a mobilization team on site to help explain the benefits and had a staff on  base to offer assistance when needed. To help ensure that reservists and  dependents understood the various TRICARE options, the mobilization  team presented general information on TRICARE and tailored benefits  discussions to beneficiaries\u2019 specific circumstances. For example, the  mobilization team tailored TRICARE information depending on whether  reservists\u2019 dependents lived in areas with established networks or in areas  where TRICARE networks were minimal or nonexistent. For the latter, the  mobilization team discussed how TRICARE\u2019s Standard option could  permit dependents to continue relationships with civilian physicians by  paying copayments similar to those required by many civilian insurers. The  mobilization team members also referred reservists to TRICARE offices,  Internet Web links, and toll-free information lines, and provided backup  telephone numbers, including their own, to handle additional questions."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Alternative Coverage Options Presented in 2002 NDAA Vary Widely in Cost", "paragraphs": ["The 2002 NDAA directed us to evaluate several health coverage options  through TRICARE, FEHBP, or civilian insurance as possible mechanisms  for ensuring continuity in benefits for reservists and their dependents.  Some of the options would provide coverage on a continuous basis during  the entire enlistment period, regardless of reservists\u2019 mobilization status,  while others would provide additional or alternative coverage only during  or following periods of mobilization. Cost estimates for these options,  which were provided by CBO, range from a low of about $89 million to a  high of about $19.7 billion over a 5-year period. (See app. II for estimate  assumptions.)", "For 2003 through 2007, the estimated cost to DOD for providing reservists  and their dependents continuous health care coverage, regardless of  reservists\u2019 mobilization status, would range from about $4 billion to   $19.7 billion for the 5-year period, depending on how the benefit was  provided. CBO estimates that providing the benefit through TRICARE with  no premium for reservists would cost DOD about $10.4 billion. (See   table 2.) DOD\u2019s cost would be reduced to about $7 billion if reservists paid  a premium similar to that paid by active duty retirees under age 65 or to  about $4 billion if reservists paid a premium share similar to that paid by  federal employees for FEHBP.", "Providing insurance through FEHBP would be more expensive to DOD  because CBO estimated the premium would be based on the existing  FEHBP pool\u2014an older population using more health care services. (See  table 3.) While CBO estimates that the actual cost of providing health care  for reservists and their dependents under FEHBP would be about   $10.9 billion, similar to the cost of providing the TRICARE benefit, it  estimates the DOD health insurance premium costs for FEHBP to be about  $19.7 billion. If reservists paid the typical FEHBP employee portion of the  premium, CBO estimates that DOD premium costs would be reduced to  about $10.2 billion.", "The cost for options providing health care coverage only during  mobilizations or for expanding the benefit after mobilizations would be  from $89 million to $1.8 billion over the 5-year period, according to CBO  estimates. (See table 4.) For example, in lieu of a TRICARE benefit, DOD  might assume the costs of reservists\u2019 civilian coverage during mobilization.  The value of this benefit would vary from reservist to reservist depending  on (1) the cost of the reservist\u2019s portion of the premium, (2) the extent of  employer coverage, and (3) whether the employer continued to pay the  premium during the reservist\u2019s mobilization. CBO estimates that if each  year 80,000 reservists, the approximate number mobilized in April 2002,  were mobilized for a 1-year period, the cost to fully pay for civilian health  coverage for the 5-year period would be about $1.8 billion. The cost of  DOD allowing dependents with civilian insurance the choice of TRICARE  or a monetary voucher equivalent to the estimated value of the TRICARE  benefit would be about $1.1 billion over 5 years, according to CBO\u2019s  estimate. Although the amount of this voucher would be based on the  average cost of the TRICARE benefit for which the dependent is eligible,  this option would increase DOD\u2019s costs because historically many  dependents of mobilized reservists have relied on their civilian coverage  and have not used their TRICARE benefit. Revising the transitional period  that DOD has provided so that demobilized reservists retain their  TRICARE benefits for an additional 30 days and their dependents retain  benefits for a 90-day period would cost $89 million for the 5-year period,  according to CBO\u2019s estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Because most reservists have civilian insurance and maintain it while  mobilized, few of their dependents experience problems with disruptions  to their health care, such as being forced to change providers, learn new  health care plan requirements, and adjust to different benefit packages.
