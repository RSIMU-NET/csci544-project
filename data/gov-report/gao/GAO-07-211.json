GAO's prior work showed that sound management practices for developing capabilities include involving top leadership, dedicating an implementation team, and establishing a communications strategy. DOD is developing a joint seabasing concept and various DOD organizations are sponsoring seabasing initiatives. However, DOD has not provided sufficient leadership to guide joint seabasing development and service initiatives are outpacing DOD's analysis of joint requirements. DOD also has not established an implementation team to provide day-to-day management to ensure joint seabasing receives the focused attention needed so that efforts are effective and coordinated. Also, DOD has not fully developed a communications strategy that shares information among the organizations involved in seabasing. Without a comprehensive management approach containing these elements, DOD may be unable to coordinate activities and minimize redundancy among service initiatives. DOD has not developed a joint experimentation campaign plan, although many seabasing experimentation activities--including war games, modeling and simulation, and live demonstrations--have taken place across the services, combatant commands, and other defense entities. No overarching joint seabasing experimentation plan exists to guide these efforts because the U.S. Joint Forces Command has not taken the lead in coordinating joint seabasing experimentation, although it has been tasked with developing a biennial joint experimentation campaign plan for future joint concepts. While the U.S. Joint Forces Command is in the process of developing the plan, it is unclear the extent to which this plan will address joint seabasing or will be able to guide joint seabasing experimentation efforts. Without a plan to direct experimentation, DOD and the services' ability to evaluate solutions, coordinate efforts, and disseminate results could be compromised. While service development efforts tied to seabasing are approaching milestones for investment decisions, it is unclear when DOD will complete development of total ownership cost estimates for a range of joint seabasing options. Joint seabasing is going through a capabilities-based assessment process that is intended to produce preliminary cost estimates for seabasing options. However, DOD has not yet begun the specific study that will identify potential approaches, including changes to doctrine and training as well as material solutions, and produce preliminary cost estimates. DOD officials expect the study will not be complete for a year or more. Meanwhile, the services are actively pursuing a variety of seabasing initiatives, some of which are approaching milestones which will guide future program investments. Until total ownership cost estimates for joint seabasing options are developed and made transparent to DOD and Congress, decision makers will not be able to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of individual service initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Future security environments are expected to become increasingly  Future security environments are expected to become increasingly  complicated through unstable international political relationships,  complicated through unstable international political relationships,  increased acts of terrorism, the expanded influence of nonstate actors, and  increased acts of terrorism, the expanded influence of nonstate actors, and  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

To assess the extent to which a joint experimentation  campaign plan has been developed, implemented, and used to inform  decisions on joint seabasing options, we obtained briefings from and  interviewed DOD and service officials on their experimentation efforts,  and examined DOD and service guidance on conducting and leading  experimentation campaigns. To assess the development of cost estimates  for joint seabasing, we obtained and analyzed key briefings, reports, data,  and plans from DOD and the services that included information and  analysis regarding estimated costs related to joint seabasing and  conducted interviews with relevant DOD and service officials.

Figure 1 shows the  JCIDS process, including the major elements of a capabilities-based  assessment. The purpose of JCIDS is to identify, assess, and prioritize joint  military capability needs. Capabilities represent warfighting needs that are  studied as part of the system\u2019s capabilities-based assessment process. The  process identifies warfighter skills and attributes for a desired capability  (Functional Area Analysis), the gaps to achieving this capability  (Functional Needs Analysis), and possible solutions for filling these gaps  (Functional Solution Analysis). The results of this assessment are used as  the basis for identifying approaches for delivering the desired capability.  When identifying these approaches, cost is one factor that is considered.  One way costs are used to evaluate potential approaches is by developing  total ownership cost estimates. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council  has overall responsibility for JCIDS and is supported by eight Functional  Capabilities Boards (Command and Control, Battlespace Awareness,  Focused Logistics, Force Management, Force Protection, Force  application, Net-Centric, and Joint Training), which lead the capabilities- based assessment process.

According to service officials and documentation,  these solutions will play a critical role in enhancing current seabasing  capabilities. For example, the Navy and Marines plan to acquire the  Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) along with several supporting  connectors needed for it to be able to achieve its mission. As part of the  seabase, the Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) will be a squadron of  ships to transport and deliver the personnel, combat power, and logistic  support of the Marine Expeditionary Brigade. The connectors, which are  envisioned to provide both intertheater lift to the seabase and intratheater  lift within the seabase, include sealift, such as the Joint High Speed Vessel,  Joint High Speed Sealift, and Joint Maritime Assault Connector (this vessel  is intended to replace the Landing Craft Assault Connector), and airlift,  such as the V-22 Osprey and CH-53K heavy lift helicopter. Figure 2  illustrates and describes several sealift and airlift connectors. The Army is  also exploring new capability initiatives for establishing a seabasing  capability.

Within JCIDS, future capability  needs are intended to be developed from top-level strategic guidance such  as the National Military Strategy, a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach. Under the  former process, requirements grew out of the individual services\u2019 unique  strategic visions, a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach. In January 2006 we reported  that JCIDS is not yet functioning as envisioned to define gaps and  redundancies in existing and future military capabilities across the  department and to identify solutions to improve joint capabilities.

DOD has produced a Seabasing Joint Integrating Concept that outlines  the concept for joint seabasing and identifies essential capabilities. Under  JCIDS, the capabilities-based assessment follows a structured, four-step  process. The first step in this process, the Functional Area Analysis,  dated October 2005, identified the seabasing tasks, conditions, and  standards needed to meet military objectives. The Functional Area  Analysis identified such critical joint seabasing tasks as providing for  maintenance of equipment in the joint operations area, attacking  operational targets, and building and maintaining sustainment bases in the  joint operations area. The second step of the capabilities-based  assessment, the Functional Needs Analysis, dated November 2006,  provided a prioritized list of joint seabasing capabilities and capability  gaps, and identifies potential mitigation areas from which the identified  capability gaps may be addressed. The 17 seabasing capability gaps  include at-sea assembly, forcible entry, and conducting operational  movement and maneuver.

In our prior work, we identified several key sound  management practices at the center of successful mergers, acquisitions,  and transformations. These key sound management practices include   (1) ensuring top leadership drives the transformation, (2) dedicating an  implementation team to manage the transformation process, and   (3) establishing a communication strategy to create shared expectations  and report related progress. Without a management approach that  contains these elements, DOD may be unable to guide and assess joint  seabasing in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Moreover, without  central coordination, it is unclear whether DOD will be able to effectively  manage billions of dollars of potential service investments in  interdependent complex platforms, connectors, and logistics technologies  that will need to be coordinated using a common set of standards,  requirements, timeframes, and priorities.", "First, although joint seabasing capability development is underway, DOD  has not provided sufficient leadership to integrate service initiatives and  guide the development of joint seabasing. While the joint seabasing JCIDS  process is still in the early stages of assessing needed capabilities, the  services have developed their own concepts and approaches for  seabasing, and in some cases systems that will support joint seabasing are  further along than the concept in JCIDS development. For example, the  Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) and the Joint High Speed Vessel  are approaching their second major milestone, or decision point, within  DOD\u2019s acquisition system, which will initiate systems-level development,  whereas the joint seabasing concept is still being refined. Preliminary cost  estimates for both these systems range from nearly $12 billion to over $15  billion. The 2005 National Research Council Committee\u2019s report, Sea  Basing, concluded that developing a system of systems such as seabasing  that is comprised of complex platforms, connectors, and logistics  technologies will require a common set of standards, requirements,  timeframes, and priorities. Various ship, airlift, and sealift connector  components of the seabase will need to interface, and the capabilities of  some of these components will be interdependent. In addition, joint  operations from a seabase will require robust logistics technologies and  command and control. Prematurely developing such systems to meet  individual service requirements rather than joint requirements may result  in initiatives that duplicate each other and systems that are not  interoperable and compatible. Moreover, in addition to the billions of  dollars being spent to procure these systems, it may be costly to realign or  adjust the efforts of the services in the future if they do not meet the joint  requirements of seabasing.", "In addition, DOD leadership has not provided an official, unified vision for  joint seabasing to guide the transformation, ensure that focus is  maintained on providing a capability that is the best option for projecting  and sustaining forces in an antiaccess environment, and ensure that joint  seabasing is evaluated against competing options. Joint Staff officials told  us that the joint seabasing JCIDS process has been addressing how  seabasing can be used to counter the problem of projecting and sustaining  forces in an antiaccess environment, rather than examining specific  solutions. We reported in 2003 that key practices and implementation  steps for successful transformations include ensuring top leadership  drives the transformation. We found that leadership must set the  direction, pace, and tone for the transformation. Concerns have been  raised by other organizations about the lack of leadership to guide the  development of joint seabasing. For example, the National Research  Council Committee\u2019s report, Sea Basing, stated that \u201cgiven the complexity  of  and the long- term nature of the major capital investments by Services in new platforms,  development of advanced technologies, and the introduction of  appropriate joint doctrine, such a unifying vision will be essential in order  to best leverage existing currently programmed and future Service  capabilities.\u201d Also, in 2003 the Defense Science Board Task Force on Sea  Basing found that developing the seabase requires persistent, top-down  leadership to coordinate the numerous initiatives\u2014including concepts of  operations, ships, aircraft, weapons, and transportations systems\u2014that  support the seabase. Absent leadership, DOD can not be certain joint  seabasing has been evaluated against competing options for projecting and  sustaining forces in an antiaccess environment. Moreover, without  leadership that has the authority, responsibility, and accountability to  guide joint seabasing and integrate service initiatives, DOD cannot be sure  that ongoing or planned initiatives are cost-effective, fully leveraged,  properly focused, and complement each other.", "Second, DOD has not established a dedicated implementation team to  provide day-to-day management oversight. We reported in 2003 that a  dedicated implementation team should be responsible for the day-to-day  management of transformation to ensure various initiatives are  integrated. Such a team would ensure that joint seabasing receives the  focused, full-time attention necessary to be sustained and effective, by  establishing clearly defined roles and responsibilities, helping to reach  agreement on work priorities, and keeping efforts coordinated. There are  several groups and DOD organizations tasked with specific responsibilities  for developing joint seabasing within JCIDS; however, none of these  organizations have the overall authority, responsibility, and accountability  to coordinate initiatives and the acquisition of systems that may support  joint seabasing. For example, the Navy was designated the sponsor of the  Seabasing Joint Integrating Concept and is responsible for all common  documentation, periodic reporting, and funding actions required to  support the seabasing capabilities development and acquisition process.  The Force Management Functional Capabilities Board is responsible for  leading the seabasing capabilities-based assessment and oversees the  sponsor (the Navy) in developing documents. The Seabasing Working  Group was organized and tasked by the Joint Staff to assist the Force  Management Functional Capabilities Board in completing the joint  seabasing analyses. The Seabasing Working Group is comprised of  members from the Joint Staff, combatant commands, the services, and  other organizations, and serves as a source of expertise and as a joint  sounding board for collaboration and focusing the direction of the  analyses. According to Joint Staff officials, the working group can ask the  services and combatant commands to participate and provide input to the  analyses, but they have no authority to force their participation in the  development of the analyses nor do they have authority over service  initiatives that may support joint seabasing.", "Recommendations have been made for a joint office to manage and lead  joint seabasing by DOD officials, the Defense Science Board Task Force  on Sea Basing, and the Naval Studies Board, but a leadership body has  not been established. In November 2003, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed that a terms of  reference be developed for a Joint Expeditionary Force  Projection/Seabasing Capabilities Office. According to the Terms of  Reference, the office would organize all joint seabasing-related DOD  activities\u2014ranging from experimentation efforts to solutions development  to training\u2014into a coherent direction. In addition, the office would be  comprised of members from each of the four services and the U.S. Joint  Forces Command and would have limited contract authority. However,  DOD officials decided to forgo the joint office and pursue joint seabasing  within the JCIDS process. According to officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, one  reason a joint office was not set up for joint seabasing was because there  was no staff available at the time. According to Joint Staff officials, one  downfall to joint seabasing being developed under the JCIDS process is  that consensus is required on all decisions before moving forward, which  may result in compromising solutions. Although use of the JCIDS process  has encouraged the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps to participate with  the Navy in the development of the Joint Integrating Concept and JCIDS  analyses, the services continue to pursue their own initiatives. As  previously mentioned, some of these initiatives are still in the early stages  of concept development, whereas other initiatives are further along in the  acquisition process ahead of joint seabasing. A key official from the  Defense Science Board Task Force on Sea Basing told us that the need for  a joint office to coordinate efforts between the services still exists.  According to the official, the lack of action in setting up a joint seabasing  office makes achieving compatible systems to support joint seabasing  more difficult considering some supporting systems are ahead of joint  seabasing in the development process. The Naval Studies Board also  recommended a joint planning office be set up to \u201ccorrelate Service  requirements and advise Service procurements\u201d so common capabilities  among the services can be taken advantage of and incompatible  acquisitions will not be made. We and the DOD Office of the Inspector  General have found similar management challenges in DOD\u2019s efforts to  field other joint capabilities such as the Global Information Grid and  network-centric warfare. Without formally designating a dedicated  leadership body to provide day-to-day management oversight by providing  a coherent direction for related activities, establishing clearly defined  roles and responsibilities, helping to reach agreement on work priorities,  and keeping efforts coordinated, DOD\u2019s ability to develop a joint seabasing  capability in an efficient manner may be hindered. Furthermore, without a  dedicated implementation team, it may be difficult for DOD to sustain joint  seabasing development over a long period of time.", "Third, DOD has not fully developed a communications strategy that  encourages communication, shares knowledge, and provides information  to DOD organizations involved in joint seabasing initiatives. We previously  reported that creating an effective, ongoing communication strategy is  central to forming the partnerships that are needed to develop and  implement the organization\u2019s strategies. As previously mentioned, there  are numerous groups and DOD organizations involved in joint seabasing  and various initiatives that may affect joint seabasing. The seabasing  working group hosts meetings that provide a forum for discussion on joint  seabasing among members. In addition, it has established a Web site that  posts meeting minutes and various joint seabasing JCIDS analysis  documents. While this Web site provides some transparency into the  analysis process, it does not serve as a central repository for  communicating information on joint seabasing because it does not provide  information on joint seabasing efforts conducted by the services and  combatant commands outside of the JCIDS process. In addition, we found  no evidence of a formal mechanism that communicated joint seabasing  information. Officials from the Navy and Marine Corps told us they face  challenges in determining what organizations are involved in joint  seabasing and what they are doing. According to Marine Corps officials,  this impedes their ability to leverage activities and minimize redundancy.  Furthermore, Joint Staff officials have acknowledged that the lack of a  central, authoritative source of information significantly hindered timely  completion of analyses. For example, the data management tool used to  associate essential seabasing capabilities with the appropriate functional  area did not provide a systematic method for identifying relevant  information and some data was missing. Moreover, they also recognized  that a means for identifying DOD-wide initiatives that affect joint  seabasing needs to be established. In the absence of clear communication  of joint seabasing information throughout DOD via an overall  communications strategy, joint seabasing participants may not be able to  effectively leverage activities and minimize redundancy, and the overall  development of joint seabasing may be impeded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Developed a Joint Experimentation Campaign Plan to Inform Decisions About Joint Seabasing", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not developed, implemented, or used an overarching joint  experimentation campaign plan to inform decisions about joint seabasing.

All of the services,  combatant commands, and some defense entities have been involved with  seabasing experimentation through war games, studies, workshops,  modeling and simulation, and live demonstrations. For example, in 2004  the Joint Chiefs of Staff led a war game called Nimble Viking that brought  the services together and addressed gaps in their understanding of the  joint seabasing concept. The services conducted studies addressing gaps  in the joint seabasing concept, such as the Navy\u2019s 40 Knot Marine  Expeditionary Brigade study, which identified gaps in conducting forcible  entry operations with Marine Corps forces using seaborne lift capable of  speeds of 40 knots. Moreover, the Marine Corps modeled plans for landing  seabased forces from amphibious ships, the results of which, according to  the Marine Corps, shaved hours off the landing of forces from amphibious  ships. In addition, the U.S. Joint Forces Command and services worked  together in cosponsoring several war games involving joint seabasing,  including Unified Course 2004, Joint Urban Warrior 2004, Pinnacle Impact  2003, and Sea Viking 2004. While many of the reports from these war  games recognized joint seabasing as a potential concept for addressing  antiaccess and force projection issues, they stated that further  experimentation was needed before joint seabasing moved forward.", "Additionally, material solutions being developed to support joint seabasing  have undergone planned experimentation and testing activities. For  example, U.S. Transportation Command officials believe that DOD\u2019s Joint- Logistics-Over-the-Shore program could support joint seabasing logistical  operations, such as heavy cargo transfer at sea. To that end, in June 2006  they sponsored a Joint-Logistics-Over-the-Shore exercise to transfer  equipment and bulk materials from large ships to the beach using smaller  landing craft. Figure 3 shows forces using a barge to move construction  vehicles from ships to shore during a Joint-Logistics-Over-the-Shore  exercise at Naval Magazine, in Indian Island, Washington.", "The Navy\u2019s Program Executive Office for Ships, which manages the  Maritime Pre-positioning Force (Future) and the Joint High Speed Vessel  programs, reports that the Maritime Pre-positioning Force (Future)  program has planned and is executing a series of jointly coordinated tests  involving modeling and simulation and live demonstrations. According to  the Program Manager, demonstrations included at-sea evaluation of the  Mobile Landing Platform concept and its ability to interface with other  vessels supporting the joint seabase. Additionally, the Navy\u2019s Office of  Naval Research is developing a number of technologies, such as internal  ship cargo handling and ship-to-ship cargo transfers, to address capability  gaps in joint seabasing operations.", "Although joint seabasing experimental activities have taken place, an  overarching experimentation campaign plan to coordinate and guide these  activities does not exist because the U.S. Joint Forces Command has not  taken the lead in coordinating joint seabasing experimentation efforts.  Moreover, involvement in these activities by the services, combatant  commands, and defense entities has been inconsistent due to budget  restraints, other competing priorities, and the lack of timely coordination  and advance notice of events. In May 1998, the Secretary of Defense  designated the U.S. Joint Forces Command as the DOD executive agent for  joint warfighting experimentation. In this role the command is responsible  for conducting joint experimentation on new warfighting concepts and  disseminating the results of these activities to the joint concept  community, which includes the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint  Staff, combatant commands, services, and defense agencies. The U.S. Joint  Forces Command is also responsible for coordinating joint  experimentation efforts by developing a biennial joint concept  development and experimentation campaign plan. In January 2006, a  memo from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff further underscored  this responsibility by providing explicit direction to the U.S. Joint Forces  Command on developing a campaign plan that provided guidance to the  joint concept community on coordinating joint experimentation efforts,  and capturing and disseminating the results of these efforts. While the  U.S. Joint Forces Command said it is in the process of developing the plan,  it is unclear the extent to which this plan will address joint seabasing.  According to the U.S. Joint Forces Command, other more near-term  priorities, such as improvised explosive devices and urban warfare, have  prevented them from focusing on joint seabasing during the past few  years.", "Once the U.S. Joint Forces Command develops and implements the plan,  which it intends to do by fiscal year 2008, it is also unclear the extent to  which this plan will be able to guide and coordinate joint seabasing  experimentation efforts because the U.S. Joint Forces Command does not  have the authority to direct service and other DOD organizations\u2019  experimentation plans. The services and combatant commands are  responsible for working with the U.S. Joint Forces Command in executing  the joint concept development and experimentation campaign plan, and  for providing them with observations, insights, results, and  recommendations related to all joint experimentation efforts. However,  the services and combatant commands are not required to go through the  U.S. Joint Forces Command before executing their own experimentation  activities. Moreover, the U.S. Joint Forces Command says it does not have  authority to make the services and combatant commands take specific  joint actions. Additionally, there are many entities within the services  involved in joint seabasing experimentation and there are no formalized  leaders coordinating service efforts. As a result, these entities operate  independently and do not coordinate their efforts with the U.S. Joint  Forces Command. This lack of coordination poses risks of duplicating  experimentation efforts and conducting experimentation that does not  build upon previous activities.", "Furthermore, no overarching campaign plan to guide joint seabasing  experimentation exists within any other DOD entity. While the Navy and  Marine Corps have seabasing experimentation campaign plans, officials  told us these plans are not overarching within each of the services and it is  unclear the extent to which they are being implemented. For example, a  seabasing experimentation plan exists as part of the Navy\u2019s Sea Trial  Concept Development and Experimentation Campaign Plan; however,  Navy officials said there is not a lot of joint seabasing experimentation  being conducted within this plan and the plan does not encompass all of  the Navy\u2019s efforts. In addition, the Marine Corps has a plan that broadly  focuses on issues that need to be addressed for seabasing capabilities such  as the Maritime Pre-positioning Force (Future) and the Joint High Speed  Vessel. However, its plan does not identify designated leaders and specific  experimentation activities that should take place, nor does the plan  identify timelines, resources, or staff to conduct experimentation. It also  does not contain plans for data collection and analysis or any provisions  for disseminating results. In addition, according to Marine Corps officials,  the plan is not being fully executed due to lack of funding and staff.", "Many service officials expressed concern over the lack of coordination  and guidance on joint seabasing experimentation. They stated that the U.S.  Joint Forces Command has not shown much interest in experimentation  for future concepts such as joint seabasing, instead focusing  experimentation efforts on short-term concepts and immediate priorities  such as improvised explosive devices. One service official commented that  there is no single point of contact for joint seabasing at the U.S. Joint  Forces Command. Additionally, the Joint Chiefs of Staff states in the  Functional Needs Analysis that more joint experimentation is needed to  inform and further refine capability gaps in the joint seabasing concept."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks a Systematic Means to Analyze, Communicate, and Disseminate Information on Joint Seabasing Experimentation", "paragraphs": ["DOD also lacks a systematic means to analyze, communicate, and  disseminate information about joint seabasing experimentation across the  department.

Additionally,  data collection and analysis plans are important to experimentation  because they ensure valid and reliable data are captured and understood,  and that the analysis undertaken addresses the key issues in the  experiment. However, we found no overarching data collection and  analysis plan to guide the analysis of joint seabasing experimentation  results. Furthermore, officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  Program Analysis and Evaluation division described a lack of analysis in  joint seabasing to inform the capabilities-based assessment, which could  lead to inaccurately identifying gaps in implementing the concept. They  said that no comprehensive analytical framework was ever established to  guide development of the joint seabasing concept; consequently, the value  joint seabasing will bring to the warfighter is unknown. Without an  overarching campaign plan, experimental results for joint seabasing are  being obtained and interpreted using different data collection and analysis  methods, which may lead to inconsistent reporting methods. As a result,  experimentation data may be analyzed, interpreted, and shared  inconsistently and with little transparency across the community.", "Additionally, DOD and service officials commented on the lack of  sufficient modeling and simulation tools available to provide valid data on  joint seabasing. Modeling and simulation tools play an important role in  experiments. Unlike live demonstrations, modeling and simulation  techniques can inexpensively vary the values of variables to represent a  wide variety of conditions. They also provide a great deal of control over  the variables in the experiment, which allows for replication. The Joint  Chiefs of Staff noted the absence of high-level modeling tools capable of  end-to-end modeling of seabasing in the Functional Needs Analysis,  saying that the absence of this type of modeling precluded effective and  meaningful data to validate warfighter needs and thus limited the depth of  their analysis. Furthermore, officials in the Office of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s Program Analysis and Evaluation division also commented that  the lack of modeling could result in missing critical gaps in the joint  seabasing concept that have not yet been identified. The Joint Chiefs of  Staff identified the U.S. Joint Forces Command as a possible lead for end- to-end modeling and simulation of joint seabasing because of its role in  joint concept development and experimentation, and its expertise in  developing comprehensive modeling and simulation tools.", "While some communication takes place among the entities involved with  developing the seabasing concept, there is no established method for  communicating observations, insights, and upcoming events across the  entire community. DOD and service officials described the joint seabasing  community as an informal community of practice, where the services,  combatant commands, and defense entities invite each other to participate  in their experimentation activities. The U.S. Joint Forces Command and  the services track to some degree the experimental efforts of the joint  seabasing community. For example, the U.S. Joint Forces Command says  it tries to leverage off the services\u2019 efforts by partnering with them in  experimental activities. However, despite this informal community, DOD  and service officials describe a lack of coordination and awareness of  experimental activities. A Marine Corps official stated that some officials  are more aware than others are; but no one is completely aware of what is  going on across the entire community. In fact, many officials we spoke  with were either unaware or had very little advance notice of an upcoming  war game involving seabasing. Without an established communication  method, joint seabasing experimentation efforts are not transparent to the  entire community, which can contribute to a lack of consensus on the  types of activities that take place, conflicts in scheduling events, and  duplication of efforts.", "Additionally, there is no overarching system to disseminate observations  and results on joint seabasing experimentation. The U.S. Joint Forces  Command has a database containing documents and reports from  experimentation activities; however, the database contains different levels  of information based on what the services choose to publish. As a result,  the database is not a comprehensive resource of joint experimentation  information. The Navy\u2019s Warfare Development Command also maintains  a Web site of information pertaining to its Sea Trial campaign, which other  entities within the Navy contribute to, but it is not overarching within the  Navy. In response to a January 2006 memo from the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. Joint Forces Command is developing an online  knowledge management portal to disseminate information on  experimentation activities across the joint concept community. The  portal contains a repository of information on experimentation concepts,  projects, and documents; a bulletin board to post insights and  observations; hotlinks to other sites; and a calendar function for upcoming  experimentation activities. The portal also contains a section on activities  relating to joint logistics, and joint deployment and sustainment; however,  it does not yet contain information on joint seabasing.

One consequence of this lack of  effective management is the absence of a joint experimentation campaign  plan. Without a campaign plan to direct experimentation for joint  seabasing, DOD and the services\u2019 ability to evaluate and validate their  solutions, coordinate efforts, perform analysis, and disseminate results  could be compromised. As a result, the services risk duplicating  experimentation efforts and developing and fielding seabasing capabilities  that are not compatible or interoperable, and they will be unable to  leverage the results of individual experiments across the joint seabasing  experimentation community to maximize synergies. Furthermore,  establishing a joint seabasing capability could be the source of significant  investment by DOD. Given the challenging fiscal environment facing DOD  and the rest of the federal government, decision makers must make  investment decisions that maximize return on investment at the best value  for the taxpayer.

We compared DOD\u2019s approach with best  practices for managing and implementing major efforts. To identify these  best practices, we reviewed our prior work including GAO, Results- Oriented Cultures: Implementation Steps to Assist Mergers and  Organizational Transformations. In the absence of a comprehensive  planning document, we used relevant questions derived from the identified  best practices in interviews with officials and in analyzing pertinent  documents such as the August 2005 Seabasing Joint Integrating Concept,  and instructions and manuals on DOD\u2019s Joint Capability Integration and  Development System (JCIDS), including (1) the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01E, Joint Capabilities Integration and  Development System (May 11, 2005); (2) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff Manual 3170.01B, Operation of the Joint Capabilities Integration  and Development System (May 11, 2005); and (3) the Joint Chiefs of Staff  White Paper on Conducting a Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA)  Under the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System  (JCIDS) (January 2006). We also interviewed officials involved in the  development of the joint seabasing to obtain information on how involved  the services, combatant commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense,  and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were in developing joint seabasing, what their  respective roles and responsibilities were, the level of authority available  to direct the services and combatant commands to participate in the  JCIDS analyses, how information on joint seabasing development efforts  and initiatives was shared, how initiatives that may support joint seabasing  were coordinated, and other issues. In addition, we examined the  Seabasing Working Group Web site to identify what information was being  communicated through the Web site.", "To assess the extent to which a joint experimentation campaign plan has  been developed, implemented, and used to inform decisions on joint  seabasing options, we obtained briefings and interviewed officials from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S.  Joint Forces Command, the U.S. Transportation Command, and the Army,  Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. We also discussed the status of joint  seabasing experimentation efforts and the extent to which they  coordinated with each other in conducting joint seabasing  experimentation. We examined DOD guidance to identify and clarify roles  and responsibilities for leading joint warfighting experimentation. To  identify key aspects for conducting experimentation campaigns, we  reviewed books and publications on experimentation campaigns,  including Code of Best Practice: Campaigns of Experimentation; Code of  Best Practice: Experimentation; Guide for Understanding and  Implementing Defense Experimentation; and The Role of  Experimentation in Building Future Naval Forces. We obtained and  reviewed DOD and service reports and briefings containing the analyses  and findings of experimentation activities. We also attended an Army  Joint-Logistics-Over-the-Shore exercise demonstrating the unloading and  loading of equipment to the shore when port facilities are inadequate,  unavailable, or nonexistent.", "To assess the extent to which DOD and the services identified the cost of  joint seabasing options so that decision makers can make informed, cost- effective decisions, we reviewed official statements, obtained briefings  from, and interviewed officials from, the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,  Defense Science Board, and Center for Strategic and Budgetary  Assessments. We examined DOD documents and data including, but not  limited to, the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Budget, the  Department of the Navy Ships and Aircraft Supplemental Data Tables,  and the Report to Congress on Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction  of Naval Vessels for FY 2007. We assessed the reliability of the data used  through discussions with knowledgeable officials. We determined that the  data used were sufficiently reliable for our objectives. We reviewed  statements by the Congressional Budget Office and Center for Strategic  and Budgetary Assessments. We also reviewed reports on seabasing  including, but not limited to, Thinking About Seabasing: All Ahead, Slow  by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Sea Basing by the  Defense Science Board, Sea Basing by the Naval Research Advisory  Committee, and Seabasing: Ensuring Joint Force Access From the Sea by  the National Research Council. To identify guidance on cost estimating  and total ownership costs, we reviewed DOD documentation, including  DOD Directive 5000.1, The Defense Acquisition System (May 12, 2003),  DOD Instruction 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System  (April 5, 2002), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01E,  Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (May 11, 2005),  and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3170.01B, Operation of  the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (May 11,  2005). We also reviewed our prior work on cost estimating and total  ownership cost.", "We conducted our review from February 2006 to October 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards at the  following locations:    Offices of the Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C.", "Office of Force Transformation    Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation    Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and    The Joint Staff, Washington, D.C.", "Office of Force Structure Resources and Assessment\u2014Studies,  Analysis, and Gaming Division    U.S. Joint Forces Command, Suffolk, Virginia    Joint Experimentation Directorate    Joint Futures Lab    U.S. Transportation Command, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois    Offices of the Chief of Naval Operations, Washington, D.C.", "Office of Expeditionary Warfare    Office of Assessments, Seabasing Pillar    Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.
