However, DOD and the Coast Guard have not identified resources for all initiatives directed at the recruitment and accessions of female officers.", "In response to GAO's questionnaire, DOD and the Coast Guard reported 10 initiatives specifically designed to increase the recruitment and accessions of female officers. For example, Coast Guard officials reported that U.S. Coast Guard Academy admissions officers visit all-female high schools to promote the opportunities available for women at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. However, DOD and the Coast Guard do not have an oversight framework for recruitment initiatives, to include program goals, performance measures, and resource allocation linked to program goals. One of the five Armed Forces has a goal related to the recruitment of women into the officer corps; however, the others do not. DOD and the Coast Guard also have not conducted evaluations of all 10 initiatives.

Changes to laws and Department of Defense (DOD)  policies have either eliminated or clarified restrictions on women serving  in the military. For example, in 1975, Congress directed the secretaries of  the military departments to take action to ensure women\u2019s eligibility for  appointment and admission to the three military service academies.  Similarly, the Coast Guard also first admitted women in 1976 as part of its  graduating class of 1980. More recently, on January 24, 2013, the  Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  rescinded a 1994 rule that prevented women from serving in direct  ground-combat positions. The memorandum rescinding the rule directed  the military services to meet milestones for the full integration of women  into these positions by January 1, 2016. The Military Leadership  Diversity Commission reported in 2011 that although women comprise  more than 50 percent of the recruiting pool for the officer corps, women  are underrepresented across all of the services and accessions  sources\u2014that is, in the military service academies; Officer Candidate  Schools and Officer Training School; the Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps  (ROTC); and direct commissions for specialist officers in the medical,  chaplain, and legal corps.", "In 2013, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services  reported that outreach and recruitment of women for the officer corps is  critical to ensuring that the military has the strongest possible leaders.  DOD and Coast Guard officials stated that increasing the representation,  or the total number, of women is important and senior leadership in the  military services have expressed the intent to increase diversity in their  organizations, to include increasing the representation of women. For  example, in September 2014, the Secretary of the Navy stated that there  are not enough women in the Navy or the Marine Corps, and cited the  importance of a diverse force. In June 2014, the Secretary of the Air  Force released a memorandum establishing active duty officer applicant  pool goals, which are intended to reflect the nation\u2019s diverse and eligible  population. In addition, in March 2013, the Commandant of the Marine  Corps issued a letter to Marine Corps leadership stating that it is  imperative for the Marine Corps to take a fresh approach to diversity to  attract, develop, and retain women officers. According to military service  academy officials, the service academies want to ensure they have a  diverse student population, and all have indicated a desire to increase the  representation of women.", "Section 524(c) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for  us to review the Armed Forces\u2019 outreach and recruitment efforts directed  toward women\u2019s representation in the officer corps. This report evaluates  the extent to which (1) accessions of women into the officer corps have  increased, and DOD and the Coast Guard have determined resources  and funding to increase the accessions of women into the officer corps  and (2) DOD and the Coast Guard have initiatives and an oversight  framework to increase the recruitment and accessions of women into the  officer corps.", "For our first objective, we obtained and analyzed DOD and Coast Guard  officer corps accessions and representation data from the Defense  Manpower Data Center to identify trends in female officer accessions  from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014. We chose to review data  from the last 5 fiscal years to focus on current initiatives. We assessed  the reliability of the accessions and representation data by reviewing the  Defense Manpower Data Center\u2019s methodology for collecting data and  conducting a review of the completeness of the data. We found the data  to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To determine  whether DOD and the Coast Guard have identified resources and funding  dedicated to increase the accessions of women into the officer corps, we  obtained and reviewed budget justification material and identified  obligations for recruiting and advertising from fiscal year 2014,  appropriations from fiscal year 2015, and estimated budgets for fiscal  year 2016. In addition, we obtained recruiting and advertising  expenditures for women officers from DOD and the Coast Guard. We also  obtained information on resources and funding through a questionnaire  we developed and distributed to 19 offices in DOD and the Coast Guard  we identified in consultation with DOD and Coast Guard officials that  conduct recruiting and accessions of women into the officer corps. These  offices included military service academies, recruiting commands, and  service commands responsible for overseeing the ROTC, Officer  Candidate Schools/Officer Training School, and direct commissioning  programs. To identify these 19 offices, we reviewed DOD and Coast  Guard guidance and we discussed the services\u2019 roles and responsibilities  related to recruitment and accessions with officials from each military  service, including the Coast Guard. In the questionnaire, we asked these  19 offices to identify resource and funding information for the initiatives  they are currently using to increase the accessions of women into the  officer corps. We assessed the reliability of the marketing budget and  expenditures reported by the U.S. Military Academy by sending a  questionnaire and interviewing academy officials. We found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "For our second objective, we reviewed responses to our questionnaire  identifying initiatives the Armed Forces, including the Coast Guard, have  directed at increasing the recruitment and accessions of women into the  officer corps. We also assessed the extent to which DOD and the Coast  Guard have developed an oversight framework for these initiatives by  comparing their efforts against the key elements of an oversight  framework, which include establishing program goals and performance  measures and linking resource allocation to program goals. We also  interviewed DOD and Coast Guard officials to determine if there were  agency goals for recruitment and accessions of women into the officer  corps and if the reported initiatives were aligned with agency goals, if any.

Officer candidates enrolled in ROTC programs must meet all  graduation requirements of their academic institutions and complete  required education and military training to receive commissions as  officers, usually after 4 years. The Coast Guard does not have an  ROTC program.", "Officer Candidate Schools/Officer Training School: These officer  commissioning programs are designed to augment the services\u2019 other  commissioning programs. Because these programs focus only on  military training, they are short, ranging from 6 weeks (Marine Corps  candidates participate in the Naval Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps)  to 17 weeks (Coast Guard).", "Various offices within each military service, including the Coast Guard,  are responsible for recruiting for these commissioning programs. In  general, the military service academies recruit their own candidates and  the service recruiting commands recruit for the other accession sources.  Table 1 lists the office that primarily conducts recruiting for each major  accession source.", "According to the 2011 Military Leadership Diversity Commission report,  the military can recruit from a pool of individuals using specific eligibility  requirements that can potentially present a barrier to service. According  to the report, those who wish to serve in the military must first meet  standards related to age, citizenship, number of dependents, financial  status, education level, aptitude, substance abuse, language skills, moral  conduct, height and weight, physical fitness, and medical qualifications.  Furthermore, commissioned officers must have a bachelor\u2019s degree.  Together, these requirements define the eligible population from which  the services can recruit. According to the Military Leadership Diversity  Commission report and DOD officials, large portions of young people do  not meet these requirements and are not eligible to join the military. In  addition, according to a DOD Joint Advertising, Market Research and  Studies survey, fewer women than men have an interest in military  service and that may be due in part to women\u2019s greater interests in  education and professional careers, which women often see as  incompatible with military service.", "The general approach used by the services to meet their accession  needs has been to start with their service academies and ROTC  programs. When these programs are unable to meet a service\u2019s needs for  newly commissioned officers, the service uses the Officer Candidate  Schools/Officer Training School to bridge the gap. Conversely, during  periods of downsizing, all of the commissioning sources may reduce their  numbers of officer candidates, but the Officer Candidate Schools/Officer  Training School provide the immediate means for achieving the  downsizing. Unlike the military service academies and ROTC programs  that require up to 4 years to produce an officer, the Officer Candidate  Schools/Officer Training School can quickly expand or diminish the size  of their candidate pools.", "To various extents, these accession sources commission officers for both  the active and the reserve components, including the National Guard. For  example, the ROTC programs commission higher rates of officers for the  reserves and the National Guard than do the military service academies.  Additionally, the Air National Guard Academy of Military Science  commissions the majority of the Air National Guard\u2019s officers. The Air  National Guard Academy of Military Science is similar to the Air Force  Officer Training School program and is a 6-week military training course.  In contrast, state level officer candidate school programs, which are not  included in this review, recruit and produce a significant portion of Army  National Guard officers. Other accession sources for the federal  components of the National Guard include ROTC, federal Officer  Candidate School, and direct commissioning programs.", "Additionally, each service directly commissions officers with particular  professional skills\u2014such as physicians, dentists, nurses, lawyers, and  chaplains\u2014who do not in all cases attend the major commissioning  programs. The Coast Guard also has direct commissioning programs for  certain professions, such as aviators, engineers, lawyers, and physician  assistants.

For example, an Air Force  official stated that there were legal concerns with setting goals for actual  accessions, or hires, since they cannot consider ethnicity, race, or gender  when making decisions about hiring. However, Air Force officials stated  there were not any legal concerns with targeting certain demographic  groups in recruiting efforts in an attempt to shape the applicant pool.

The Air Force  has a quantifiable goal related to increasing the applicant pool of women  into the officer corps, which could in turn serve to increase female  officers\u2019 accessions. In a June 2014 memorandum, the Secretary of the  Air Force directed the Air Force to institute a wide range of diversity goals  for its active duty officer applicant pools, including a 30 percent applicant  pool goal for female officers. An Air Force official stated that the officer  applicant pool goal was developed to provide the Air Force\u2019s officer  accession sources with the incentive to identify and recruit from untapped  sources of officer applicants. An Air Force official also stated that  establishing this goal generated discussions among the officer accession  sources about how to achieve this common goal in light of these sources\u2019  respective operational differences and that the need to meet the broader  goal might potentially result in the accession sources developing their  own respective performance measures.", "Such applicant pool goals were also noted in the 2011 Military Leadership  Diversity Commission report, which recommended developing similar  goals for qualified minority applicants to precommissioning officer  programs. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission stated that one  way to ensure that there is a demographically diverse applicant pool is to  develop goals for qualified minority applicants. According to the Military  Leadership Diversity Commission, the goals would not be used during the  actual admissions decision but would help ensure that there is a  demographically diverse applicant pool from which to select each year. A  similar recommendation was made by the Defense Advisory Committee  on Women in the Services in its 2013 report. The Defense Advisory  Committee on Women in the Services recommended that all of the  services have targets to gauge progress in increasing the representation  of women in the officer corps (and therefore in the principal accession  sources for officers).", "Officials with the other recruitment and accession sources with whom we  met stated that they do not have clear goals with quantifiable metrics  linked with those goals related to the recruitment and accessions of  women into the officer corps. Army officials stated that they had not  received any documented guidance or goals directing them to increase  the number of female applicants for officer positions or female officer  accessions. Similarly, while the Secretary of the Navy publicly expressed  the importance of increasing the number of women in the Navy and  Marine Corps, with the exception of submarines, Navy and Marine Corps  officials stated that they currently do not have documented guidance or  goals directing them to increase the number of female officer applicants  or accessions. Coast Guard officials also stated that although there is an  overall intent to increase diversity, they had no specific goals associated  with increasing the number of female officer applicants or accessions.", "Moreover, DOD and the Coast Guard reported evaluating seven out of  ten of their initiatives focused exclusively on the accessions of women  into the officer corps. However, in the absence of program goals for  initiatives directed at increasing the applicant pool and ultimately the  accessions of women into the officer corps, they do not have performance  measures linked to program goals to evaluate the extent to which their  initiatives are achieving their intended purpose. In response to our  questionnaire, DOD and the Coast Guard reported they had conducted  evaluations of seven of the initiatives focused exclusively on the  accessions of women into the officer corps, although we could only verify  the evaluation of an initiative from Navy Recruiting Command. For  example, Navy Recruiting Command conducted targeted direct mail and  e-mail initiatives with female-specific content and tracked the leads  generated in response to the initiative and the percentage of leads that  resulted in a recruit joining the Navy. Additionally, Coast Guard Recruiting  Command reported implementing an online and print marketing campaign  directed toward women and using online user metrics to track the  effectiveness of its online advertising materials. According to military  service academy officials, they use data on applicants and accessions of  women from the military service academies to measure how well current  recruitment and accessions initiatives are working to increase the  recruitment and accessions of female officers.", "Military service officials provided a variety of reasons for not evaluating  the initiatives, including the subjectivity of the information, the lack of  funding for evaluations, and the newness of the program. For example,  the Marine Corps provides take-home recruiting materials that feature  stories of female Marine Corps officers. Officials reported that, although  they have collected some data, they have not developed a way to  evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative using those data. The Air Force  ROTC reported an initiative implementing additional height  measurements that could provide more waiver requests for women, since  the current restrictions for undergraduate pilot training eliminates  approximately 50 percent of female candidates. Although Air Force ROTC  reported it has collected initial data on this initiative, it reported that it is  too early in the process to evaluate this initiative.

In its comments, DOD noted  that the services have taken steps, through targeted outreach and  recruiting efforts, to increase minority and female representation in the  officer applicant pool for DOD\u2019s commissioning programs. DOD stated  that it had updated relevant service academy guidance that will address  the development of quantifiable performance goals and measures linked  with the program mission and goals of the service academies. DOD  stated that it plans to publish updated guidance by February 2016 for the  services\u2019 respective ROTC programs to measure the quality,  demography, and resources of each unit to monitor and assess the  performance, growth, and progress of programs in meeting the officer  accession needs of the services. While these steps are positive, we  continue to believe that fully addressing this recommendation by  developing an oversight framework that includes service-wide program  goals and performance measures and resource allocation linked to  program goals would allow the department to improve DOD\u2019s  management of initiatives directed at increasing the recruitment and  accessions of women into the officer corps.", "DOD did not state whether it concurred with the second recommendation  to conduct evaluations for key recruitment initiatives to help ensure these  initiatives are achieving their intended purpose. DOD stated that it is  studying the dynamics of female accession and retention and that the  RAND Corporation is preparing studies related to recruiting women and  explaining gender differences in officer career progression. DOD also  stated that the Joint Advertising, Marketing Research and Studies activity  conducts surveys and analysis on the dynamics of the recruitment  market, including the recruitment and accession of women. Lastly, DOD  stated that revised DOD guidance reestablishes an annual assessment  and report of the commissioning programs and would assist in evaluating  the progress made by the service academies and ROTC in achieving  program objectives. While these actions represent positive steps, we  continue to believe that evaluations of the services\u2019 initiatives could help  to ensure key initiatives are achieving their intended purpose. We found  that DOD had not evaluated all of their initiatives directed at increasing  female officers\u2019 recruitment and accessions, and while it may be  impossible and impractical to measure the effectiveness of all of the  initiatives, evaluations are critical to assessing the effectiveness and  quality of performance over time toward meeting program goals.", "In its written comments, DHS concurred with the recommendation to  develop an oversight framework that includes or incorporates (consistent  with applicable law), (1) service-wide program goals for initiatives directed  at female officers\u2019 recruitment, such as goals related to the composition of  the applicant pool; (2) performance measures linked to the program  goals; and (3) resource allocations linked to program goals.

DHS also concurred with the recommendation to conduct  evaluations for key recruitment initiatives to help ensure these initiatives  are achieving their intended purpose. DHS stated that the U.S. Coast  Guard Academy routinely evaluates recruiting initiatives to determine  measures of success and that this data collection resulting from these  evaluations will be tailored to specifically account for females. DHS also  stated that the Coast Guard will collect data to determine whether the  goals have been achieved, which will allow for processes and policies to  facilitate collecting gender-based recruiting metrics.

We did not receive feedback from the headquarters officials that  we should add any other offices to our questionnaire recipient list. In the  questionnaire, we asked these 19 offices to identify resource and funding  information for the initiatives they are currently using to increase the  accessions of women into the officer corps.

The methodologists concluded that the documentation  for one initiative indicated that the accession source had tracked  response rates to a specific e-mail initiative, which is a minimal yet  reasonable measurement of the immediate output of the initiative.
