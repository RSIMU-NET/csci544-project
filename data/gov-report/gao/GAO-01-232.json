Several of the state innovations include interactive systems that allow regulated entities to identify their regulatory responsibilities and complete related transactions. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has an electronic process that allows users to obtain oil or gas well permits on-line, complete the required forms, and pay any associated fees. Representatives from nongovernmental organizations suggest that federal agencies improve both the content and access to on-line information, more broadly and consistently use some existing applications, and adopt some new applications. Several key factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption and diffusion of innovative IT applications are (1) top-level leadership commitment/support, (2) adequate financial resources and human capital, (3) legislative and executive branch IT initiatives, (4) internal and external partnerships with critical stakeholders, (5) reengineering of existing business processes, and (6) development of a communication infrastructure."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the past several years, information technology (IT) has played an  increasingly important role in how federal agencies interact with the public  and accomplish their missions.

One area of public  policy that is beginning to feel the effects of IT is regulatory management,  which includes such interrelated processes as rulemaking, compliance  assistance, information collection and dissemination, and regulatory  enforcement. The use of IT in regulatory management can reduce  regulatory burden; improve the transparency of regulatory processes; and,  ultimately, facilitate the accomplishment of regulatory objectives.", "Last year, we reported on innovative uses of IT to facilitate public  participation in federal rulemaking.

GPEA\u2019s full  implementation will give individuals and organizations the option to submit  information or transact business with agencies electronically.", "Executive branch initiatives have also encouraged the use of IT in the  federal government. For example, in September 1993, the National  Performance Review (later the National Partnership for Reinventing  Government) announced a set of recommendations that were intended to  improve government by reengineering through the use of information  technology. Those recommendations included the development of  integrated electronic access to government information and service; the  creation of a national environmental data index; and the use of IT and other  techniques \u201cto increase opportunities for early, frequent, and interactive  public participation during the rulemaking process and to increase  program evaluation efforts.\u201d In July 1996, President Clinton issued  Executive Order 13011 on \u201cFederal Information Technology,\u201d which,  among other things, established a Chief Information Officers Council (CIO  Council) as the principle interagency forum to improve agency information  resource management and to \u201cshare experiences, ideas, and promising  practices.\u201d A December 17, 1999, presidential memorandum on electronic  government noted that \u201cas public awareness and Internet usage increase,  the demand for online Government interaction and simplified, standardized  ways to access Government information and services becomes increasingly  important\u201d and directed federal agencies to take steps to address that  growing demand. Additionally, this directive called for the establishment of  a \u201cone stop\u201d gateway to government information available on the Internet.", "The federal government has taken some steps to establish electronic  gateways that provide one-stop access to information from a variety of  agencies, including regulatory agencies. For example, the \u201cFirstGov\u201d Web  site (www.firstgov.gov), which was launched on September 22, 2000,  provides links to all on-line federal resources\u2014from applying for student  loans to tracking Social Security benefits. Also, the U.S. Business Advisor  site (www.business.gov) provides businesses with one-stop access to  federal information on such topics as taxes, international trade, financial  assistance, and laws and regulations. The laws and regulations link allows  users to connect with the Federal Register, the United States Code, and  compilations of laws and regulations affecting small businesses. The U.S.  Business Advisor site was created by the Small Business Administration  (SBA), the National Performance Review, and an interagency task force  and is maintained and funded by SBA.", "In our report issued last year, we identified a number of examples of how  federal agencies were using IT to facilitate public participation in  rulemaking. Although all of the departments and agencies we contacted  were developing some type of IT-based participation vehicles, officials and  staff in those agencies questioned the need for standardization of those  practices across agencies. They said that agencies need to be able to design  their procedures to fit their particular circumstances, and that  standardization would require scarce agency resources.

Again, we allowed these  organizations to define the word innovative. We also identified state IT  applications in the regulatory arena that other organizations (e.g., the  Council for Excellence in Government and the National Association of  State Information Resource Executives) or publications identified as  examples of best practices. For each of the identified state IT-based  applications, we talked to officials or staff in the state agencies involved in  the development and/or implementation of the application and reviewed  information on the agencies\u2019 Web sites.", "For the third objective, we interviewed representatives of business  associations, consumer advocacy groups, and academic centers that deal  with regulatory reform issues.

Officials in federal  regulatory agencies were sometimes unaware of the innovative uses of IT  to improve regulatory management in other agencies, and sometimes in  other parts of their own agencies. As a result, federal agencies may either  not adopt innovative approaches that could be useful to them or reinvent  the wheel as they develop their own approaches in those areas. Federal  regulatory agency officials told us that there is a need for better  communication and sharing of information about innovative IT  applications and indicated that existing organizations, such as the CIO  Council and the Regulatory Working Group, be used to facilitate  information sharing.", "Representatives of the nongovernmental organizations and officials and  staff in the regulatory agencies themselves also called for greater  consistency across agencies\u2019 IT-based regulatory management systems.  However, both parties cautioned against mandatory conformity. As agency  officials told us during our first review, agencies may need to have  somewhat different systems because of differences in their operating  environments. Also, common IT-based approaches may be more  appropriate for some aspects of regulatory management than others. For  example, federal rulemaking processes are somewhat similar across  federal agencies, so common approaches regarding that aspect of  regulatory management may be more appropriate than in other, more  idiosyncratic parts of the process (e.g., enforcement or licensing  requirements.) Specific options in the rulemaking area could include  common approaches for accepting electronic comments on proposed  rules, similarly structured electronic docketing systems, and tracking  systems that allow agencies to understand the causes of delays in their  rulemaking processes. Compliance assistance functions similar to DOL\u2019s  elaws and OSHA\u2019s expert advisor programs appear to have broad  applicability.", "OIRA is responsible for providing guidance and oversight for both IT and  regulatory issues. The OIRA Administrator sits on the CIO Council, which  Executive Order 13011 says should allow agencies to \u201cshare experiences,  ideas, and promising practices.\u201d The OIRA Administrator chairs the  Regulatory Working Group, which Executive Order 12866 says \u201cshall serve  as a forum to assist agencies in identifying and analyzing important  regulatory issues,\u201d including \u201cthe development of innovative regulatory  techniques.\u201d Although OIRA has taken some steps to encourage the use of  IT in regulatory agencies, we believe that it could do more to encourage  information sharing among the agencies on IT innovations. For example,  OIRA could encourage additional forums on the use of IT in regulatory  management, devote a portion of its Web site to innovative IT applications,  or work with the CIO Council to encourage dialogue between the  regulatory and IT elements of agencies\u2019 workforces. It could also make the  use of IT in regulatory management a specific focus in its implementation  of GPEA. We also believe that OIRA can work with the agencies to identify  specific types of innovative IT-based approaches that multiple agencies  could use to improve regulatory management. By implementing common  approaches regarding regulatory functions that are used in multiple  agencies, the regulatory management approaches can begin to have a more  consistent \u201clook and feel,\u201d which some nongovernmental and federal  representatives believed is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the OIRA Administrator develop a systematic process  by which federal agencies can share information regarding the use of  innovative IT-based applications in regulatory management.
