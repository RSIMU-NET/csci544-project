GAO's methodology included surveying federal agencies to obtain the status of their financial management systems as of September 30, 2009 (prior to OMB's March 2010 announcement of a new approach), and interviewing officials with selected agencies, external providers, and OMB. In oral comments on a draft of this report, OMB stated its position that it was too early for GAO to draw conclusions on its new approach because it is still a work in progress. For this reason, GAO is not making any new recommendations. However, GAO observes that the experience and challenges related to prior migration and modernization efforts offer important lessons learned as OMB continues to develop and implement its new approach."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to capitalize on new technologies to help address serious weaknesses in financial management and help meet their future financial management needs, federal agencies continued to modernize their core financial systems, which often has led to large-scale, multiyear financial system implementation efforts. For the last 6 years, OMB has promoted the use of shared services as a means to more efficiently and effectively meet agency core financial system needs. Overall, 14 of 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies are planning to complete their efforts to deploy 14 new core financial systems at various times through fiscal year 2018, and in connection with their modernization efforts, 10 of the 14 agencies are migrating, or planning to migrate, hosting and application management support services to external providers. GAO also found that the CFO Act agencies were not using a limited number of external providers, a critical element of OMB's original approach. Five of the 10 agencies planned to rely on five different commercial providers, while 2 of the 10 planned to rely on the same federal provider and 3 had not determined the provider. In contrast, smaller agencies were more frequently relying on the four federal shared service providers to provide core financial system support services to leverage the benefits of using external providers. The most common benefits of migrating cited by CFO Act agencies were external providers' expertise, the potential for cost savings, and the agencies' ability to focus more on mission-related responsibilities. However, CFO Act agencies and external providers cited various challenges affecting modernization and migration efforts, such as reengineering business processes and the ability of external providers to provide specific solutions that meet complex agency needs. In March 2010, OMB announced a new financial systems modernization approach that focuses on the use of common automated solutions for transaction processing, such as invoicing and intergovernmental transactions. OMB issued a memorandum in June 2010 that included guidance for key elements of its new approach, such as agencies splitting financial system modernization projects into smaller segments. This new guidance also requires CFO Act agencies to halt certain modernization projects, pending OMB review and approval of revised project plans. Important aspects of the new approach have not yet been developed or articulated and OMB has stated that it plans to develop additional guidance. In GAO's view, it is critical that OMB's new guidance elaborate on the new approach and address key issues such as goals and performance plans clearly linked to strategies for achieving them, a governance structure, and specific criteria for evaluating projects. GAO believes these issues need to be addressed to reduce risks and help ensure successful outcomes as OMB moves forward with its new approach. GAO will continue to work with OMB to monitor the implementation of its new approach."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, the federal government has spent billions of dollars  annually on developing or acquiring, implementing, and maintaining  financial management systems that often fail to meet cost, schedule, and  performance goals. Recognizing the seriousness of this problem, in March  2004, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the financial  management line of business (FMLOB) initiative, which, among other  things, provided an approach to increase agencies\u2019 use of shared service  solutions in connection with their modernization efforts. Specifically, this  approach required agencies to migrate certain common services  supporting their core financial systems, such as information technology  (IT) hosting and application management, to a limited number of external  providers. According to OMB, shared service solutions would enable  economies of scale by centrally locating, or consolidating, solution assets  and reusing federal and commercial subject matter expertise through  common acquisitions, interface development, and application  management. OMB also expected the reduction in the number of agencies  implementing their own systems to reduce the risks, and associated costs,  of systems implementations. As previously reported, we have supported  and called for such initiatives to standardize and streamline common  systems, which can reduce costs. The effectiveness of financial  management systems is critical in facilitating agencies\u2019 ability to institute  strong financial management and internal controls.", "In response to your request to study a range of FMLOB-related issues, in  May 2009, we reported that although OMB had made some progress  toward implementing the initiative, extensive work remained before its  goals would be achieved. Specifically, OMB had not fully addressed our  March 2006 recommendations to fully integrate four key building blocks  into FMLOB implementation efforts, specifically, the need to (1) develop a  concept of operations to help guide FMLOB-related activities, (2) define  standard business processes to promote consistency within and across  agencies, (3) develop a strategy and establish a timetable for ensuring that  agencies\u2019 financial management systems are migrated to a limited number  of service providers, and (4) define and effectively implement applicable  disciplined processes necessary to properly manage financial management  system implementation projects. This report addresses the remaining  aspects of your request dealing with migration efforts at agencies and  external providers, including (1) identifying the steps agencies have taken,  or plan to take, toward modernizing their core financial systems and  migrating to an external provider and (2) assessing the reported benefits  associated with migrations and significant challenges, including any  factors related to OMB\u2019s newly announced financial systems  modernization approach (new approach), that may affect modernization  and migration efforts at agencies and external providers. Specifically, in  June 2010, during the performance of our work, OMB announced key  elements of its new approach, which will focus, in part, on the  development of common automated solutions for transaction processing,  the requirement for agencies to split financial system modernization  projects into smaller segments not to exceed 24 months, and increasing  oversight and review of financial system projects. Further, under the new  approach, OMB is no longer requiring the use of external providers in all  cases for core financial systems, but supports such arrangements when  they are cost effective.", "To identify the steps agencies have taken or plan to take in their financial  systems migration and modernization efforts and assess related benefits  and challenges, we conducted a survey of the 24 Chief Financial Officers  (CFO) Act of 1990 agencies to obtain information regarding their current  and planned core financial systems and migration activities as of  September 30, 2009. To obtain additional information on modernization  and migration efforts among selected agencies, we performed four agency  case studies. To identify FMLOB efforts among smaller agencies, in  addition to the Federal Communications Commission case study, we  interviewed knowledgeable officials with the Small Agency Council and  the four OMB-designated federal shared service providers (SSP). We also  reviewed and analyzed policies and guidance related to migration and  modernization activities obtained from OMB and the Financial Systems  Integration Office (FSIO) and interviewed key officials of these  organizations to obtain their perspectives on FMLOB-related benefits and  challenges. In addition, we interviewed key officials of two commercial  vendors supporting two of the case study agencies and the four federal  SSPs concerning their FMLOB-related efforts at CFO Act and non-CFO Act  agencies. We also reviewed guidance issued by OMB regarding its new  approach for federal financial management systems.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through September  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In recognition of this need, and in an effort to  improve overall financial management, Congress passed a series of  financial and IT management reform legislation dating back to the early  1980s, including the CFO Act and the Federal Financial Management  Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). FFMIA, in particular, requires the 24  departments and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and  maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with   (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable  federal accounting standards, and (3) the U.S. Government Standard  General Ledger at the transaction level. FFMIA also requires auditors, as  part of the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 financial statement audits, to report  whether those agencies\u2019 financial management systems substantially  comply with these requirements. In addition, the Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996 requires OMB to improve the acquisition, use, and disposal of IT by  the federal government and continually assess the experiences of  executive agencies in managing IT, among other responsibilities.  Following enactment of this law, OMB revised Circular No. A-130,  Management of Federal Information Resources, which established policy  for the management of federal information resources and designated OMB  as responsible for overall leadership and coordination, as well as the  development and maintenance of a governmentwide strategic plan for  federal information resources management within the executive branch.  Despite these efforts, long-standing financial management systems  weaknesses continue to present a formidable management challenge in  providing accountability to the nation\u2019s taxpayers and agency financial  statement auditors continue to report that many agencies\u2019 systems do not  substantially comply with FFMIA requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FMLOB Migration and Other Financial Management System Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In March 2004, OMB launched the FMLOB initiative, in part, to reduce the  cost and improve the quality and performance of federal financial  management systems by leveraging shared service solutions and  implementing other reforms.

According to a December 2005 OMB  memorandum, to achieve the FMLOB vision\u2014and enable efforts to  achieve its goals\u2014federal agencies must have competitive options  available for financial systems. OMB described a shared service solution  framework consisting of a limited number of providers that deliver  competitive alternatives for agencies investing in financial system  modernizations and provide financial management services for multiple  organizations. OMB stated that the economies of scale and skill of a  provider will allow it to provide federal agencies with a lower-risk, lower- cost, and increased service quality alternative for financial system  modernization efforts. According to OMB, when the FMLOB is successful,  federal agencies will have the ability to migrate from one solution to a  more competitive or better performing alternative that is offered by a  limited number of stable and high-performing providers.", "In May 2006, OMB established a migration policy and issued its  Competition Framework for FMLOB Migrations to provide guidance to  agencies planning to migrate their financial management systems and  services.

However, agencies may also consider other shared services, such  as accounting or transaction processing.\u201d This policy was subsequently  incorporated into OMB Circular No. A-127 in January 2009; this circular  provides guidance on the use and selection of external providers to ensure  that agencies rely on such providers to help manage their systems and no  longer develop their own unique systems.", "As program manager for the FMLOB initiative, FSIO had a significant role  in achieving FMLOB goals, including the development of standard  business processes, core financial system requirements, and testing and  product certification.

Although the Army anticipates completing its 12-year multiphased  deployment in fiscal year 2011, this project reflects the substantial  challenges in large-scale deployments, such as a lack of a comprehensive  set of metrics with which to measure the success of implementation.  Similarly, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is involved in a multiyear  modernization effort to replace six core financial systems and multiple  procurement systems operating across the agency with a new integrated  core financial system (referred to as the Unified Financial Management  System, or UFMS).

For example, Treasury cited potential cost savings and benefits  associated with using an external provider such as resource sharing,  provider expertise in solving application problems, and using cloud  computing concepts. In May 2010, we also reported potential benefits  associated with cloud computing, such as economies of scale and the  faster deployment of patches to address security vulnerabilities.  According to external provider officials, smaller agencies rely more  frequently on external providers for transaction processing than CFO Act  agencies and benefit from providers\u2019 use of shared instances of software  applications and standard interfaces across multiple clients, and their  ability to more efficiently process complex transactions.", "To help realize these benefits, CFO Act agencies also identified a variety of  key factors that contribute to successful migrations. Many of the factors  cited involve the effective use of disciplined processes, such as clearly  defining requirements and performing gap analyses to ensure that agency  needs will be met, performing appropriate testing and data conversion  procedures, minimizing customizations of software, and reengineering  business processes to facilitate greater standardization. In addition,  agencies cited the need for (1) appropriate and adequate resources to lead,  plan, manage, execute, and oversee modernization and migration  activities; (2) clearly defined expected outcomes and responsibilities of  key stakeholders; and (3) effective service-level agreements and other  mechanisms that could help ensure that the intended benefits of migrating  are achieved.", "CFO Act agencies also cited various concerns about migrating to external  providers, such as the ability of external providers to provide solutions  that meet the complex and unique needs associated with large agency  migrations. As shown in table 4, CFO Act agencies expressed concerns  about the general loss of control, flexibility, and subject matter expertise  and various risks they will experience if IT hosting, application  management, and transaction processing are migrated and whether  providers had the capacity to meet the extensive needs associated with  large CFO Act agencies. External providers acknowledged these concerns,  but cited additional challenges affecting their migration-related efforts,  such as agencies\u2019 resistance to adopting common processes used by  providers and the lack of a clear mechanism for ensuring that agency  migrations occur as intended.", "We found similar migration challenges related to OMB\u2019s guidance on  competition affecting agency and external provider migration efforts, its  implementation, and effective oversight. For example, we found that  agencies were not always required to migrate to an external provider and  did not always conduct a competition for IT hosting and application  management because they had already decided to use existing in-house  resources to meet their needs (e.g., DOJ, which is discussed in more detail  in app. III). On the other hand, we found that those agencies migrating to  external providers were not using a limited number of external providers,  raising significant questions regarding the extent to which the services  they are to provide will be shared with other agencies and any related  potential cost savings will be realized. Specifically, as previously  discussed, based on survey responses, 14 CFO Act agencies were relying,  or planning to rely, on a total of 11 different external providers to support  17 expected systems and providers for 4 of the 17 systems were still to be  determined.", "Unlike similar efforts to implement other OMB electronic government (E- gov) initiatives, the FMLOB guidance does not provide a mechanism for  determining the appropriate number of providers needed or describe a  governance structure to help ensure that agencies migrate to one of the  specific providers identified. For example, prior policies for the human  resource line of business (HRLOB) and E-Payroll initiatives both involved  the migration of agency-performed functions common across federal  agencies to specifically designated shared service centers. Further, in  connection with the E-Payroll initiative, established in June 2002, four  providers were selected to furnish payroll services for the executive  branch.

Agency  participation in the new solutions being developed by FIT is voluntary and  OMB\u2019s previous policy regarding migrations to external providers is no  longer mandated. Therefore, the potential benefits that will actually be  realized through shared services are uncertain.", "According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, a  concept of operations is normally one of the first documents produced  during a disciplined development effort. OMB officials stated that they  are developing an overall concept of operations but did not provide us an  estimated timeframe for its completion. We previously reported on the  need for this critical tool to provide an overall road map for describing the  interrelationships among financial management systems and how  information is to flow from and through them and within and across  agencies, and ensuring the validity of each agency\u2019s implementation  approach. In addition, a concept of operations can be used to  communicate overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to  users, developers, and other organizational elements and would allow  stakeholders to understand the user organizations, missions, and  organizational objectives from an integrated systems point of view. We  recognize that OMB\u2019s new approach is in an early implementation stage  and guidance is still being developed. However, implementing this  approach without certain policy guidance carries risk. For instance,  without a concept of operations that provides an overall road map to guide  implementation efforts, it is unclear how the new governmentwide  solutions envisioned under the new approach will integrate with current  or planned core financial systems, as well as how they will impact  numerous smaller agencies that have already migrated to federal SSPs.", "In addition, the governance structure for implementing OMB\u2019s new  approach will involve efforts expected to be performed by FIT. OMB has  described certain activities FIT is expected to perform, but additional  information concerning its purpose, its authority, and the resources to be  devoted to its efforts remain unclear. For example, although OMB stated  that FIT will assist in ensuring consistency with a long-term financial  management systems strategy for the federal government, the specific role  that FIT will play in developing or implementing a strategy or overseeing  efforts to achieve its goals has not yet been defined.", "What actions will be taken to help ensure that agencies\u2019 efforts to reduce the scope  of modernization projects so that they can be completed within 24 months do not  inappropriately emphasize schedule-driven priorities at the expense of achieving  event-driven objectives?", "What guidance will be provided to ensure that agencies have developed an overall,  high-level system architecture that clearly defines specific development projects  that provide interim functionality?", "Although efforts to reduce the scope of agency modernization projects so  that they can be completed within 24 months may result in more  manageable projects, we have previously reported on the importance of  capturing metrics that identify events and trends to assess whether  systems will provide needed functionality rather than schedule-driven  approaches that may lead to rework instead of making real progress on a  project. The process for ensuring that future modernization projects  conducted under the new approach will align with governmentwide and  agency goals, achieve measurable results, and minimize future work- arounds and rework has not yet been clearly described.", "The Clinger-Cohen Act highlights the need for sound, integrated agency IT  architectures and lays out specific aspects of a process agency chief  information officers are to implement in order to maximize the value of  agencies\u2019 IT investments. For example, consistent with OMB\u2019s new  approach, the act also advocates the use of a modular acquisition strategy  for a major IT system. Under this type of strategy, an agency\u2019s need for a  system is satisfied in successive acquisitions of interoperable increments.  However, the act also states that each increment should comply with  common or commercially accepted standards applicable to IT so that the  increments are compatible with other increments of IT that make up the  system. Some agency financial system modernization projects involve the  implementation of large, integrated ERP systems\u2014which may be designed  to perform a variety of business-related tasks, such as accounts payable,  general ledger accounting, and supply chain management across multiple  organizational units\u2014to help achieve agency strategic goals. Given the  tightly integrated nature of these systems, the extent to which  implementation projects can be modified and segmented to achieve OMB\u2019s  objective for delivering interim functionality to help agencies address  critical needs has not yet been determined.", "What specific criteria will be used to evaluate agency modernization project plans  and task orders requiring OMB review and approval?", "What steps will be taken to ensure that appropriate procedures and resources are  in place at the agency level to avoid an improper impoundment of funds?", "How will the roles and responsibilities of OMB, the Financial Systems Advisory  Board, or others involved in conducting the reviews and their efforts be defined and  measured?", "Our prior work has linked financial management system failures, in part,  to agencies not effectively incorporating disciplined processes shown to  reduce software development and acquisition risks into their  implementation projects. We support the principle of increased oversight  and review of projects as called for in our prior recommendations.  However, the criteria for performing quarterly assessments of agency  modernization projects do not clearly define how such assessments will  evaluate the extent to which agencies are embracing disciplined  processes. Further, OMB\u2019s template for capturing information on agency  projects identifies numerous aspects to be reviewed; however, agencies  are not required to provide information needed to assess the effectiveness  of testing and data conversion efforts necessary to ensure that substantial  defects are detected prior to implementation and that modifications of  existing data enable them to operate in a different environment. These and  other disciplined processes are critical for successfully implementing a  new system. Effective oversight to ensure that they are incorporated into  agency and governmentwide system implementation projects will also  continue to be a critical factor in the success of future modernization  efforts envisioned under OMB\u2019s new approach.", "In addition, OMB\u2019s direction and CFO Act agencies\u2019 implementation of the  direction to immediately halt activities on financial system IT projects  pending the outcome of OMB\u2019s review present additional risks concerning  adherence to procedures to be followed for impoundments of budget  authority, as prescribed in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Not all  delays in obligating funds are impoundments, but where OMB has given  direction to agencies to halt the issuance of new task orders or new  procurements, we are concerned that agencies may misinterpret that as a  direction to withhold budget authority from obligation either during the  review process or upon the decision to terminate an investment. OMB  issues general guidance in OMB Circular No. A-11 on the applicable  procedures for compliance with the Impoundment Control Act. However,  in 2006, we reported to Congress and OMB that executive agencies had  improperly impounded budget authority following the President\u2019s  submission of proposals to Congress to rescind certain budget authority  because, in part, agencies were not fully aware of the nature of the  proposals and their intended effect on currently available budget  authority. OMB officials stated that none of the 24 CFO Act agencies  identified an impoundment resulting from OMB\u2019s direction, but OMB had  not evaluated the potential impact of the direction on the agencies\u2019 budget  authority nor had it issued any clarifying guidance to the agencies to alert  them to the potential for impoundments that might arise if agencies  withheld budget authority by not awarding contracts as directed.", "Moreover, OMB\u2019s reliance on the Financial Systems Advisory Board to  assist in the review of agency modernization projects will depend, in part,  on the availability of sufficient resources to perform effective reviews and  having clear criteria for selecting projects and performing the reviews.  Having clear, measurable criteria for determining which projects are to be  assessed and that provides for objective assessments would help ensure  that they are performed completely and consistently for all projects and  that oversight efforts help achieve intended results. The extent to which  CFOs and chief information officers from major agencies or other experts  will be available and used to perform such reviews, including whether  such officials may be involved in reviewing projects related to their own  agencies, has not been specified. While OMB officials told us that they plan  to take steps to exclude officials from reviewing systems at their own  agencies, the process for doing so has not been disclosed.", "How will system requirements and standard business processes be updated and  maintained?", "What criteria will be used to determine whether a performance-based approach for  compliance with financial system requirements reduces the cost, risk, and  complexity of financial system modernizations?", "What actions will be taken to help ensure that discontinuing FSIO\u2019s software testing  and certification program does not result in lack of interoperability across agency  systems?", "What steps will be taken to ensure that vendor self-certifications comply with  applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation?", "What guidance will be provided to agencies to clarify any changes in agency  responsibilities for testing and validating software functionality?", "FSIO played a significant role in helping to identify and document federal  financial management system requirements and the standard business  processes on which they should be based. Such efforts were aimed at  preventing duplicative research and compilation across government. Prior  to ceasing operations effective March 31, 2010, FSIO was working to  finalize an exposure draft and issue an updated version of core financial  system requirements intended, in part, to reflect changes necessary to  align them with current standard business processes. OMB\u2019s June 2010  memorandum states that it plans to issue a revision to OMB Circular No.  A-127 to update existing requirements and to provide guidance for  agencies and auditors on how to assess compliance. The extent to which  these changes will affect modernization efforts as well as improve the  ability of financial systems to help address long-standing weaknesses is  undetermined.", "While OMB\u2019s plan to require vendors to self-certify software functionality  is intended to shift accountability for software performance to vendors, it  does not change vendor accountability for delivering products that meet  specified standards. It also does not eliminate the need to develop and  update those standards as new requirements are established to facilitate  future improvements. Our work on financial management systems  modernizations and industry standards has identified the importance of  clearly defining systems requirements and managing those requirements  throughout system implementations, and failure to do so can have a  significant negative impact on their success. OMB plans to provide  additional guidance related to the change in the testing process in an  upcoming revision to OMB Circular No. A-127 and revisit the policy on an  annual basis. However, it is not clear if OMB will be defining system  standards and keeping those definitions up to date going forward or if  these tasks will be delegated to another entity.", "The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Results Act)  highlights the importance of strategic plans and performance plans as a  means for assisting agencies to achieve desired results. We previously  reported that strategies should be specific enough to enable an assessment  of whether they would help achieve the goals of the strategic plan. We  also reported on how collaborative efforts involving multiple agencies to  address crosscutting issues\u2014such as federal financial management  modernization efforts\u2014could benefit from a governmentwide strategic  plan that identifies long-term goals and the strategies needed to address  them, aligned performance goals, and improved performance information  that assists decision making to improve results. Recognizing OMB\u2019s  critical role in governmentwide efforts, such as those envisioned under  this new approach, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and OMB\u2019s implementing  guidance, OMB Circular No. A-130, specifically require OMB to develop a  strategic plan for managing information resources. Further, incorporating  performance plans, goals, and other key elements that facilitate  performance measurement and monitoring is essential for ensuring that  efforts are appropriately aligned to achieve desired results. It will be  essential that performance plans are expressed in an objective,  quantifiable, and measurable form that clearly links strategic goals with  the strategies to be used to achieve them."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s FMLOB initiative represented an important effort intended to  reduce costs and improve the quality and performance of federal financial  management systems that agencies depend on to generate reliable, useful,  and timely information needed for decision-making purposes. In  connection with their efforts to implement this initiative and modernize  their systems, many agencies took steps to migrate selected core financial  system support services to external providers. The use of external  providers by smaller agencies in particular highlights potential benefits to  be realized through these efforts, such as adopting common processes and  sharing software. Other agencies continue to rely on aging legacy  systems\u2014even though they may have migrated to an external provider.  Agencies continue to be challenged with reengineering business processes  and effectively incorporating disciplined processes into their  implementation efforts to help ensure their success.", "OMB announced a new strategy and plans for future financial management  system modernization efforts, and began issuing a series of guidance on its  new approach from March 2010 to June 2010. However, it is too early to  determine the extent to which this new approach will address the cost,  risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations. The experience  and challenges related to efforts to implement the FMLOB initiative  provide important lessons learned as OMB continues to develop and  implement its new approach. OMB has stated that it plans to develop  additional guidance, such as a governmentwide concept of operations, a  long-term financial management systems strategy, and a revised OMB  Circular No. A-127. Critical next steps will include OMB elaborating on its  new approach to address key issues. The following includes our  observations on these issues.", "As we have previously reported in connection with the FMLOB initiative, a  concept of operations is one of the first and foremost critical building  blocks and is needed to provide an overall road map to guide  implementation of OMB\u2019s new approach in accordance with best  practices. Until a well-defined concept of operations is developed,  questions remain on how the proposed governmentwide solutions can be  integrated with current and planned agency financial management  systems.", "Articulating key aspects of a strategic plan, such as goals and performance  plans clearly linked to strategies for achieving them and expressed in an  objective, quantifiable, and measurable form, is also critical for the  success of OMB\u2019s new approach. In addition, a governance structure that  provides clear roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, such as the  Financial Systems Advisory Board and FIT, is necessary to help ensure  that the stated goals are achieved. Further, detailed guidance and criteria  will be important for understanding how ongoing and future  modernization projects will be evaluated.  In developing its strategy, it is also important for OMB to clarify the need  to mitigate the risks involved with the new requirements for agencies to  revise project plans to shorter increments. These risks include agencies  adopting a schedule-driven approach rather than focusing on achieving  event-driven results consistent with agency needs. In addition, providing  guidance to agencies on incorporating relevant OMB Circular No. A-11  procedures would help to ensure that OMB efforts to review financial  system IT projects under its new approach do not result in improper  impoundments.", "As part of OMB\u2019s revisions to Circular No. A-127, several clarifications  would help provide agencies with direction to implement OMB\u2019s new  approach, including (1) the requirements for using an SSP, (2) the new  process for developing and updating federal financial management system  requirements and standard business processes, and (3) the performance- based approach for determining FFMIA compliance.", "We recognize that OMB is still in the process of fully implementing this  new approach and completing related guidance. However, addressing  these and other identified key issues and overcoming the historical  tendency for agencies to view their needs as unique and resist  standardization will depend on prompt and decisive action to develop an  effective governmentwide modernization strategy and related guidance.  We are not making any new recommendations in this report because of  the early implementation stage of OMB\u2019s new approach; however, we will  continue to work with OMB to help ensure that it provides agency  management and other stakeholders with the guidance needed to bring  about meaningful improvements in financial management systems.

To help  address OMB\u2019s concern, we included additional references to the early  implementation stage of OMB\u2019s new approach. The Controller also stated  that the questions raised in the report were good for framing the issues,  and that some of them were in the process of being addressed. For  example, he stated that the planned revisions to OMB Circular No. A-127  will address issues raised on systems requirements and the process for  certifying software. We have updated the report accordingly. The  Controller also stated that the members of the new Financial Systems  Advisory Board adopted a charter dated August 1, 2010, which provides  additional detail and specificity on the role and responsibilities of the  Board members.

We asked each agency to  identify the core financial systems that were fully deployed in the agency  as of September 30, 2009, and any that the agency planned to fully deploy  after that date. Through the use of e-mailed, self-administered  questionnaires, we collected descriptive information on modernization  and migration-related activities about each core financial system, as well  as overall agency activities and perspectives regarding financial  management line of business (FMLOB) migration efforts. We designed and  tested these questionnaires in consultation with subject matter experts at  GAO and the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO), GAO survey  research methodologists, and selected agency officials. Data collection  took place from November 2009 to April 2010. All 24 agencies responded  to the survey request and returned questionnaires on 46 currently  deployed systems and 20 planned systems that they had identified, as  shown in appendix II, tables 5 and 6, respectively.", "While all agencies returned questionnaires, and therefore our data are not  subject to sampling or overall questionnaire nonresponse error, the  practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other errors  into our findings. In addition to questionnaire design activities discussed  above, to minimize errors of measurement, question-specific  nonresponses, and data processing errors, GAO analysts (1) pretested  draft questionnaires with two agency officials prior to conducting the  survey, (2) contacted respondents to follow up on answers that were  missing or required clarification, and (3) answered respondent questions  to resolve difficulties they had answering our questions during the survey.  In addition, we tested the accuracy of selected responses provided by  three agencies by comparing them to data we obtained from case studies.", "To obtain more detailed information on steps taken to modernize core  financial systems and migrate related support services to external  providers, we performed case studies at the Department of Justice (DOJ),  Department of Agriculture (USDA), Federal Communications Commission  (FCC), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

Specifically, the  criteria used to select agencies for the case studies included (1) different  software solutions, (2) a mix of large and small agencies, and (3) differing  experiences concerning the use of external providers to support their core  financial systems. To identify the use of different software solutions and  differing experiences concerning the use of external providers, we  reviewed an inventory of CFO Act agency and non-CFO Act agency core  financial systems published by FSIO as of December 2008 that identified  agencies\u2019 software, versions, and providers, where applicable, that hosts  the systems, as well as selected 2008 agency performance and  accountability reports. To provide a mix of large and small agencies, we  selected at least one agency from each of three strata defined by gross  costs as reported in the 2008 Financial Report of the United States  Government. To help ensure an efficient use of audit resources, we did  not select agencies for which GAO had done work involving their financial  management systems for our case study work performed in this review.  We obtained and summarized information regarding these case study  agencies from documentation provided by the agencies, such as capital  asset plans and alternatives analyses.

All four SSPs offer IT hosting,  application management, transaction processing, and system  implementation services or have a structure for providing all four of these  services. Although the SSPs offer the four basic services mentioned above,  the specific services provided may vary based on the requirements, size,  and complexity of the client agency. SSPs typically offer a range of the  following four basic services:    IT hosting services may include systems management and monitoring,  disaster recovery, help desk, network security compliance and controls,  and continuity of operations plans and testing.", "Application management services may include system/software  administration, application configuration, application setup and security,  user access and maintenance, configuration management, and  coordination of application upgrades and fixes.", "Transaction processing services may include account maintenance and  reconciliation, financial reporting, regulatory and managerial reporting,  standard general ledger reconciliation, payment processing, billings and  collections, accounts payable, accounts receivable, travel payments,  relocation payments, budgetary transactions, and fixed asset accounting.", "System implementation services may include implementation and  integration support services, requirements analysis, system conversions,  project management, systems testing, change management, and training.", "To help monitor and measure the performance of selected external  providers in connection with the financial management line of business  (FMLOB) services they provide, SSPs and agencies rely on service-level  agreements, which are binding agreements that define the specific level  and quality of the operational and maintenance services that an external  provider will provide to a customer agency and outline penalties and  incentives that may arise from not performing or exceeding the expected  service levels. The inclusion of appropriate and clearly defined  performance measures and metrics in service-level agreements is  important for ensuring the usefulness of this tool. OMB\u2019s FMLOB  Migration Planning Guidance defines the four service categories and  related performance metrics. Although specific metrics included in  service-level agreements are negotiated and may vary, examples of  performance metrics related to the services described above include the  following:  (1) For IT hosting, system availability; average total response time for  system components; resolution time for critical, high, medium, and low  incidents; number of security incidents in the past year; and file recovery  time.  (2) For application management, average time to restore mission-critical  application functionality; unplanned downtime; percentage of on-time  upgrades; and average retrieval time for archived data.  (3) For transaction processing, invoice process cycle time; percentage of  financial transactions with errors; average business days to close the  books; and number of business days to report after closing books.  (4) For system implementation services, percentage of standard financial  management system requirements fulfilled; percentage of satisfactory  postimplementation survey responses; and reduction in help desk volume.", "SSPs are also required to operate and maintain a COTS software package  in compliance with FSIO core financial system requirements. As shown in  table 11, three of the four SSPs use the Oracle software package, while  two of the four use a Momentum software package. One SSP offers SAP  software. In addition to the software offered by each SSP, table 11 also  provides an overview of key characteristics of the four OMB-designated  federal SSPs including detailed information regarding the number of full- time equivalent staff dedicated to providing financial management services  and the clients they serve.

For example, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited cost reductions in equipment  purchase and maintenance costs, as well as the number of staff needed to  maintain the application and process transactions.", "Allowing agency to focus on mission. For example, OPM stated that  migrating its financial management system to an IT hosting provider  enables OPM to extricate itself from the business of managing financial  systems, transfers some of the risk associated with implementing and  maintaining the system, and allows the CFO organization to concentrate  on its goal of providing strategic direction based on financial data.", "Greater efficiency and reliability through experienced staff.

For example, according to one federal SSP, many of its  clients consist of small commissions, such as the Election Assistance  Commission, that rely on the \u201cend-to-end\u201d services the SSP provides.  Further, according to officials at the four federal SSPs, their efforts toward  acquiring additional clients are primarily focused on small to midsized  agencies that may lack sufficient resources or expertise to meet their core  financial system needs. The following summarizes the key reported  benefits for non-CFO Act agencies.", "Potential cost savings through shared resources. Based on  information provided by SSP officials, their clients share the same  instance of core financial software hosted and maintained by SSPs with  eight or more other clients, on average. Federal SSP officials stated that  the use of shared instances and other tools, such as standard interfaces  that facilitate the exchange of data between core financial systems and  other systems, enables agencies to realize significant cost savings by  spreading IT hosting, maintenance, and other related costs among multiple  clients.", "Greater efficiency and reliability. According to FCC officials, FCC is  currently modernizing its core financial system and is migrating to a  commercial provider to take advantage of the provider\u2019s expertise in  acquiring and maintaining the latest technology to meet FCC\u2019s needs.  Further, since federal SSPs process transactions for multiple agencies,  they are able to devote more resources toward processing complex  transactions than smaller agencies that may not individually be required to  handle such transactions on a regular basis. For example, according to one  SSP, although many agencies do not process a large number of  transactions involving employees\u2019 permanent changes in duty stations, the  SSP maintains the expertise and capability to efficiently process these  complex transactions on a regular basis because of the volume it is  required to handle on behalf of all its clients.", "Enhanced compliance with federal standards. External providers are  working to incorporate changes in software to facilitate agencies\u2019 efforts  to comply with new standards and requirements, such as the Common  Governmentwide Accounting Classification (CGAC) and other recently  issued standard business processes. According to a federal SSP official,  having a limited number of providers incorporate these changes into a  common solution shared by multiple agencies, rather than each agency  spending valuable resources to accomplish the same objective on its own,  represents a significant advantage for the agencies relying on the shared  solutions the SSP provides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Challenges Related to Agency Modernization and Migration Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CFO Act agencies highlighted system implementation disciplined  processes, along with reengineering their business processes, among the  greatest modernization challenges they face.

Further, recognizing that  unreconciled intragovernmental information continues to impede the  preparation of the federal government financial statements each year,  they stated that intragovernmental transaction processing should be  further clarified.", "Case study agency officials stated that their agencies each worked  individually with selected COTS vendors to produce enhanced solutions to  meet their needs. For example, the case study agencies noted that they  have had to develop interfaces to existing solutions such as payroll, travel,  reporting, and FedDebt that should already be part of a standard  configuration.

Further, according to one SSP official,  although OMB had a goal of migrating agencies to a limited number of  stable and high-performing providers, it lacked a clear mechanism for  enforcing agencies, especially large agencies, migrate to an external  provider in a manner consistent with the goals of the FMLOB initiative.  Specifically, based on survey responses, CFO Act agencies reported that  they were relying, or planning to rely, on a total of 6 different external  providers for IT hosting and application management services supporting  their planned systems and a total of 12 different providers to provide these  services for their current systems.", "We also noted other challenges related to OMB\u2019s Competition Framework  that affect agency and external provider migration efforts.

According to federal SSP officials,  they may not bid on agency solicitations that would involve significant  start-up costs to meet an agency\u2019s unique needs if doing so would not also  benefit other clients they serve that would also bear a portion of these  costs. These officials also stated that commercial vendors have more  flexibility to price their bids aggressively in early years to acquire  additional business and rely on efforts to recoup their costs in subsequent  years. External providers also reported seeing an increase in agencies\u2019  desire to use firm-fixed price contracts and include performance  incentives and disincentives in service-level agreements which, according  to SSP officials, are difficult for them to accommodate because of full cost  recovery requirements.", "According to DOJ officials, DOJ did not conduct a competition because  the department determined that federal SSPs could not accommodate its  capacity, security requirements, and unique accounting needs based on  limited information received about SSP capabilities and costs during  preliminary planning discussions related to its financial management  system modernization effort.
