As requested, GAO examined: (1) how Recovery Act JAG funds are awarded and how recipients in selected states and localities used their awards; (2) challenges, if any, selected recipients reported in complying with Recovery Act reporting requirements; (3) the extent to which states shared promising practices related to use and management of funds, and how, if at all, DOJ encouraged information sharing; and (4) the extent to which DOJ's JAG Recovery Act performance measures were consistent with promising practices. GAO analyzed recipient spending and performance data submitted as of June 30, 2010; interviewed officials in a nonprobability sample of 14 states and 62 localities selected based on the amount of their awards, planned activities, and their reported project status; assessed 19 JAG performance measures against a set of key attributes; and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Recipients of Recovery Act JAG funding in the 14 states GAO reviewed received more than $1 billion either through direct allocations from DOJ or through an indirect \"pass-through\" of funds that states originally received from the department. These recipients reported using their funds for a variety of purposes, though predominantly for law enforcement and corrections, which included equipment purchases or the hiring or retaining of personnel. More than half of the funding that state administering agencies (SAA) passed-through to localities was reported to be specifically for law enforcement and corrections activities, while localities receiving direct awards more often reported planning to use their funds for multiple types of criminal justice activities. Officials in all 14 states and 19 percent of localities in GAO's sample (12 of 62) said that without Recovery Act JAG funding, support for certain ongoing local law enforcement programs or activities would have been eliminated or cut. Overall, about $270 million or 26 percent of Recovery Act JAG funds had been reported as expended as of June 30, 2010, but the expenditure rates of funds awarded through SAAs showed considerable variation, ranging from 5 to 41 percent of SAA's total awards. State officials cited challenges in meeting quarterly Recovery Act reporting time frames. Officials from the majority of states in GAO's sample said that workload demands and personnel shortages made meeting Recovery Act deadlines within the prescribed reporting period difficult; however, all states reported that they were able to do so. States reported sharing information and promising practices related to JAG activities in a variety of ways and DOJ encouraged this sharing through a number of programs. More than half of state agencies in GAO's sample generally reported sharing promising practices or lessons learned on topics, such as grant management and administration, with other states and localities through participating in law enforcement and government association conferences, DOJ training, and Web postings, among other methods. DOJ established new performance measures to assess the Recovery Act JAG program and is working to refine them; however, these measures lack key attributes of successful performance assessment systems that GAO has previously identified, such as clarity, reliability, a linkage to strategic or programmatic goals, and objectivity and measurability of targets. Including such attributes could facilitate accountability and management's ability to meaningfully assess and monitor Recovery Act JAG's results. DOJ officials acknowledge that weaknesses exist and they plan to improve their performance measures. For example, the department already took initial steps to incorporate feedback from some states with regard to clarifying the definitions of some performance measures; however, its assessment tool lacks a process to verify the accuracy of the data that recipients self-report to gauge their progress. By including attributes consistent with promising practices in its performance measures, DOJ could be better positioned to determine whether Recovery Act JAG recipients' programs are meeting DOJ and Recovery Act goals. In addition, by establishing a mechanism to verify the accuracy of recipient reports, DOJ can better ensure the reliability of the information that recipients provide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOJ (1) continue to revise Recovery Act JAG performance measures and consider, as appropriate, including key attributes of successful performance measurement systems, and (2) develop a mechanism to validate the integrity of self-reported performance data.

Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act), the existing Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance  Grant (JAG) Program, which the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Bureau of  Justice Assistance (BJA) administers, provided an additional $2 billion to  state and local governments through 4-year, formula-based grants. JAG  Program funds support local efforts to prevent and control crime and  improve the criminal justice system through activities such as drug  reduction and domestic violence prevention. The Recovery Act JAG  Program also attempts to meet the overall purposes of the Recovery Act  which include promoting economic recovery, making investments to  provide long-term economic benefits, and stabilizing state and local  government budgets to minimize and avoid reductions in essential  services.", "The Recovery Act emphasizes the need for accountability and  transparency in the expenditure of Recovery Act funds and makes it a  central principle of the act\u2019s implementation. Importantly, the  transparency that is envisioned for tracking Recovery Act spending and  results is an extensive undertaking for the federal government and  tracking billions of dollars that are being disbursed to thousands of  recipients is an enormous effort. The administration expects that  achieving this degree of visibility will be iterative, whereby both the  reporting process and the information recipients provide improve over  time and, if successful, could be a model for transparency and oversight  beyond the Recovery Act. Thus, Recovery Act JAG funding recipients are  required to meet federal reporting requirements that are in addition to the  requirements DOJ established for non-Recovery Act JAG program  recipients. Specifically, Recovery Act JAG recipients are required to  provide quarterly status reports on the amount and use of such funds and  information concerning jobs created or retained by the use of these funds.  Other than the additional reporting requirements, however, the Recovery  Act JAG program did not alter the structure, purpose, or funding allocation  methods of the preexisting JAG program.", "Consistent with the preexisting program, states and localities can use their  Recovery Act JAG grant funds over a period of 4 years to support a range  of activities in seven broad statutorily established program areas: (1) law  enforcement; (2) prosecution and courts; (3) crime prevention and  education; (4) corrections; (5) drug treatment and enforcement; (6)  program planning, evaluation, and technology improvement; and (7) crime  victim and witness programs. Across the seven areas, recipients can use  JAG funds for state and local initiatives\u2014which are generally designed to  improve a program, service, or system, or support training, personnel, or  equipment.", "You requested that we examine the Recovery Act JAG Program. This  report addresses the following questions:    How are Recovery Act JAG funds awarded and how have recipients in  selected states and localities used their awards?", "What challenges, if any, have selected Recovery Act JAG recipients  reported in complying with Recovery Act reporting requirements?", "To what extent do states share promising practices related to the use  and management of Recovery Act JAG funds, and how, if at all, does  DOJ encourage information sharing?", "To what extent are DOJ\u2019s Recovery Act JAG performance measures  consistent with promising practices?", "This report expands upon our May 2010 Recovery Act report, which  described selected states\u2019 uses of JAG funding and accountability  provisions related to Recovery Act JAG, as well as our July 2009 Recovery  Act report, which discussed observations of Recovery Act JAG fund  obligations and planned uses of the funds. In July 2009, we reported that  the 16 states and the District of Columbia in our review had not obligated  their total Recovery Act JAG awards, in part because they were  determining how the funds would be used and passed through to local  entities. In our May 2010 report, we visited 7 of the states from our July  2009 sample and found that all 7 had obligated their Recovery Act JAG  awards and reported planned uses consistent with their states\u2019 priorities  and BJA\u2019s allowable uses of JAG funds.", "To conduct our work for this review, we evaluated Recovery Act JAG  awards in a nonprobability sample of 14 states. The states we selected for  our review of Recovery Act JAG spending are a subset of a 16-state (plus  the District of Columbia) sample that we used for our earlier Recovery Act  work, but we did not include Florida, New Jersey, or the District of  Columbia since the DOJ Office of the Inspector General was already  engaged in audit work on the JAG program in these states. The awards to  the 14 states in this review accounted for approximately 50 percent of all  of the Recovery Act JAG funds provided. Where statements are attributed  to state and local officials, we did not analyze state and locality data  sources but relied on state and local officials and other state sources for  relevant state data and materials. We also tabulated and analyzed some  recipient-reported data submitted to Recovery.gov for the quarterly  reports that had been due as of June 30, 2010. We used these data because  they are the official source of Recovery Act spending data and determined  that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  reviewed the relevant guidance DOJ provides to Recovery Act JAG  recipients on financial and program reporting as well as Recovery Act  guidance related to federal recipient reporting to understand federal  reporting requirements and associated time frames and interviewed DOJ  officials who administer the Recovery Act JAG program.", "We also conducted interviews with officials in the state agencies that  administer Recovery Act JAG funds\u2014known as State Administering  Agencies (SAA)\u2014in the 14 states we selected for review. In addition, we  selected a nonprobability sample of 62 local law enforcement agencies and  other recipients receiving Recovery Act JAG funds within these 14 states  and conducted interviews with cognizant officials from those jurisdictions  that received the awards. These jurisdictions were selected based on  award amount, degree of project completion, planned use of funds, and  how they received their funds (either as passed-through funding from their  SAA or localities who received awards directly from DOJ\u2014and in some  cases as part of disparate jurisdictions). Our interviews addressed the use  and perceived impact of Recovery Act JAG funds, program performance  measurement and reporting challenges, and the sharing of promising  practices. Findings from our nonprobability samples cannot be generalized  to all states and localities that were recipients of Recovery Act JAG funds;  however, our samples provided us with illustrative examples of uses of  funds, oversight processes, and reporting issues. Finally, we discussed  DOJ\u2019s performance measurement efforts with DOJ staff and conducted an  assessment of the performance measures applicable to the Recovery Act  JAG activities commonly undertaken by the grant recipients in our sample  to assess the extent to which they contained elements consistent with  promising practices. Specifically, from DOJ\u2019s 86 Recovery Act JAG  performance measures, we selected a nonprobability sample of 19 that  were (1) related to the largest share of reported Recovery Act JAG  expenditures across certain activity types and (2) most often reported by  the recipients in our sample. We then analyzed this sample against a set  of key characteristics that we have previously reported as being associated  with individual measures in successful performance measurement  systems. See appendix I for a more complete description of our  methodology and appendix II for a list and definition of the 19  performance measures we assessed.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 through October  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Like non-Recovery Act JAG  funds, Recovery Act JAG awards are to be used within the context of  seven statutorily established areas. The seven statutorily established  areas and examples of how JAG funds may be used within these areas are  outlined in table 1 below.", "Financial Requirements and Internal Controls  DOJ requires that all Recovery Act JAG award recipients establish and  maintain adequate accounting systems, financial records, and internal  controls to accurately account for funds awarded to them and their  subrecipients. Award recipients must also ensure that Recovery Act JAG  funds are accounted for separately and not commingled with funds from  other sources or federal agencies. If a recipient or subrecipient\u2019s  accounting system cannot comply with the requirement to account for the  funds separately, then the recipient/subrecipient is to establish a system to  provide adequate fund accountability for each project that has been  awarded.", "Recipient Reporting and Performance Measurement Requirements  All state and local Recovery Act JAG recipients are required to meet both  Recovery Act and BJA quarterly reporting requirements. The Recovery Act  requires that nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funds (including  recipients of grants, contracts, and loans) submit quarterly reports, which  include a description of each project or activity for which Recovery Act  funds were expended or obligated, and an estimate of the number of jobs  created and the number of jobs retained by these projects and activities.  In particular, the Recovery Act requires recipients to report on quarterly  activities within 10 days of the end of each quarter. For Recovery Act JAG  grants, BJA has added language in the grant awards that requires that  grantees meet the federal reporting requirements and provides sanctions if  they do not. Because the Recovery Act JAG program includes a pass- through element, SAAs must gather the required data elements for all pass- through recipients during the same 10-day time frame in order to meet  their own reporting requirements.", "Separately, BJA requires that states and those localities receiving their  funds directly through DOJ report on their progress in meeting established  performance measures related to funded activities. BJA also requires all  Recovery Act JAG recipients to submit an annual programmatic report  with narrative information on accomplishments, barriers, and planned  activities, as well as a quarterly financial status report as required by the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In early 2010, after a year-long  development and initial refinement period, BJA officially launched a new,  online Performance Measurement Tool (PMT) to improve upon its  previous grants management system and allow online performance  measurement data submission. BJA plans to use the PMT to help  evaluate performance outcomes in at least 13 grant programs, including  Recovery Act JAG. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, activities need to be established to monitor  performance measures and indicators. Such controls should be aimed at  validating the integrity of performance measures and indicators\u2014in other  words, ensuring they are reliably designed to collect consistent  information from respondents. BJA is also planning on using the PMT to  assess performance measurement data and direct improvement efforts in 5  additional programs by the end of 2010. However, given that grantees  were not required to submit their PMT reports until the second quarter of  fiscal year 2010, some grantees did not begin submitting their first  completed PMT reports until March 2010.", "BJA requires Recovery Act JAG recipients to use the PMT for quarterly  reporting on their status in meeting the Recovery Act JAG program\u2019s 86  individual performance measures, such as percent of staff who reported  an increase in skills and percent of Recovery Act JAG-funded programs  that have implemented recommendations based on program evaluation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recovery Act JAG Funds Are Awarded in Different Ways and Recipients Report Using Their Awards to Support Law Enforcement and Corrections Activities among Other Things", "paragraphs": ["Recipients of Recovery Act JAG funding receive their money in one of two  ways\u2014either as a direct payment from BJA or as a pass-through from an  SAA\u2014and they reported using their funds primarily for law enforcement  and corrections.

Under this statutory JAG formula, the total award allocated to a  state is derived from two sources, each given equal value: half of the  allocation is based on a state\u2019s respective share of the U.S. population, and  the other half is based on the state\u2019s respective share of violent crimes, as  reported in the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) Uniform Crime  Report (UCR) Part I for the 3 most recent years for which data are  available. Of such amounts awarded to states, 60 percent of a state\u2019s  allocation is awarded directly to a SAA in each of the states, and each SAA  must in turn allocate a formula-based share of these funds to local entities,  which is known as the \u201cpass-through portion.\u201d", "BJA awards the remaining 40 percent of the state\u2019s allocation directly to  eligible units of local government within the state. The eligible units of  local governments that receive direct awards from DOJ either get them  individually or as part of awards to \u201cdisparate\u201d jurisdictions which jointly  use correctional facilities or prosecutorial services. In the cases of the  disparate jurisdiction awards, to qualify for funds, the units of local  government involved must submit a joint application to DOJ and sign a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) outlining how they will share  funds. They also are to determine amongst themselves which local  government will serve as the fiscal agent, and thereby be responsible for  reporting to DOJ on behalf of the others and ensuring that all members of  the disparate jurisdiction follow applicable federal financial guidance and  meet reporting requirements. The following figure illustrates the  participation of localities in a disparate jurisdiction award. In the example,  High Point city is the fiscal agent and Greensboro city and Guilford County  are both subrecipients.", "The total awards that DOJ allocates directly to units of local government\u2014 the 40 percent share\u2014are to be based solely on the local jurisdiction\u2019s  proportion of the state\u2019s total violent crime 3-year average based on  reports from the FBI\u2019s UCR Part I. Units of local government that could  receive $10,000 or more after the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)  analyzes the UCR data are eligible for a direct award from DOJ. Funds that  could have been distributed to localities through awards of less than  $10,000 are grouped together and then provided to the SAA. Under the  JAG program, SAAs and direct grant recipient agencies may draw down  funds from the Treasury immediately rather than requiring up-front  expenditure and documentation for reimbursement. Such funds are  required to be deposited into an interest-bearing trust fund and, in general,  any interest income that states and localities earn from the funds drawn  down is to be accounted for and used for program purposes.", "Table 2 shows the total allocation of Recovery Act JAG funding across our  sample states, including the grant amounts BJA made directly to the SAAs  (the 60 percent share); the number of pass-through grants the SAAs made  in turn; and the grant amounts and number of grants BJA made directly to  localities (the 40 percent share). The 14 states in our sample received  $1,033,271,865 in JAG Recovery Act funds, which was more than half of  the funds awarded nationwide for the program.", "Of the total of 1,338 direct awards that DOJ made to localities in the 14  states in our sample, approximately one-third of these direct awards, or  436, went to disparate jurisdictions and are split by agreement among the  designated jurisdictions. Under these arrangements, one jurisdiction  functions as the prime recipient and fiscal agent who is supposed to be  responsible for submitting all programmatic or financial reports on behalf  of the disparate group as well as monitoring other neighboring localities\u2019  use of funds on activities covered by the grants. In our sample states,  while one-third of the total number of direct grant awards were made to  disparate jurisdictions, these arrangements accounted for 72 percent of  the funds DOJ awarded directly to local recipients. For example, in  Illinois, 100 percent of direct awards were provided to disparate  jurisdictions, and in 8 of the other 13 states DOJ awarded more than 70  percent of funds in this manner. Officials we met with in localities that  received funds under this type of arrangement reported that they provided  varying amounts of oversight in there role as fiscal agent. The DOJ  Inspector General has raised the oversight of subgrantee awards as an  issue for DOJ\u2019s attention and has recommended that DOJ develop further  training for recipients; DOJ concurred with the recommendation. Table 3  summarizes the distribution of direct award funds to disparate  jurisdictions in our sample states.", "The 14 SAAs in our sample received more than $630 million collectively as  their share of the Recovery Act JAG funds. JAG statutory provisions  require that each state pass-through no less than a specific designated  minimum percentage of the funds that they receive as subgrants to  localities, municipal governments, and nonprofit organizations. Among our  sample states, this mandatory pass-through percentage varied from a high  of 67.3 percent in California to a low of 35.5 percent in Massachusetts.  SAAs are also allowed to retain up to 10 percent of the funds that they  receive for administrative purposes. The completion of these pass-through  award processes occurred at different rates across the 14 states that we  sampled and resulted in some states expending their Recovery Act JAG  funds faster than others. As of June 30, 2010, the SAAs we reviewed had  made nearly all of their pass-through awards, with the exception of  Mississippi and Pennsylvania. In addition, many local pass-through  recipients reported that there was a time lag in being reimbursed by their  SAAs for funds that they had spent.

As of June 30, 2010, 100 percent of  California\u2019s subrecipients were finalized through grant award agreements,  but many projects have recently become fully operational resulting in the  slow expenditure of funds which are handled on a reimbursement basis.  In Pennsylvania, SAA officials said the state faced two challenges in  expending Recovery Act JAG funds quickly: (1) a state budget impasse,  which delayed the allocation of Recovery Act JAG awards; and (2)  Recovery Act JAG funding for state projects focused on technology costs,  which require lengthy procurement times. Further, they noted that state  pass-through funding to localities is recorded on a quarterly basis after  expenses are incurred, so the pace of expenditure could be somewhat  misleading.", "Other SAA officials we contacted cited additional reasons for more slowly  expending Recovery Act JAG funds. For example, all of the SAAs we  contacted have procedures in place that require subrecipients to make  their purchases up-front with local funds and request reimbursement from  the SAA after documentation is received. Two states we contacted have  policies that restricted Recovery Act JAG funding to shorter time limits  with an option for renewal rather than providing localities authority to use  grants during the 4-year grant period applicable to the initial recipient of  the grant.

Furthermore,  officials in Texas, New York, and Mississippi said they required additional  personnel to manage Recovery Act awards and meet reporting  requirements.

In addition, the number of direct award recipients that completed the  report has generally remained constant (around 800) over the three  reporting quarters from October 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010.", "DOJ awarded over 70 percent, or more than $289 million of direct award  funds, to 436 disparate jurisdictions. DOJ guidance states that the recipient  (i.e., fiscal agent) in each disparate jurisdiction is responsible for  monitoring \u201csubawards\u201d and for \u201coversight of subrecipient spending and  monitoring of specific outcomes and benefits attributable to the use of  Recovery Act funds by its subrecipients.\u201d DOJ guidance provides detailed  information on financial and accounting requirements for direct recipients  and subrecipients of DOJ grant programs. The guidance also states that  fiscal agents must implement and communicate a policy for reviewing  subrecipient data. DOJ guidance, however, does not provide instruction on  what a subrecipient monitoring or data policy should include; nor does it  state how outcomes and benefits tied to the Recovery Act should be  monitored. The DOJ Office of the Inspector General issued a report in  August 2010 which included the results of grant audits it performed across  12 state and local recipients of both Recovery Act and non-Recovery Act  JAG program funds. The Inspector General found that 7 of the 12 grant  recipients had deficiencies in the area of monitoring of subrecipients and  contractors. The Inspector General recommended that DOJ\u2019s Office of  Justice Programs provide additional training and oversight of JAG  recipients to ensure that they establish policies and procedures for  monitoring subrecipients\u2019 activities to provide reasonable assurance that  subrecipients administer JAG funds in accordance with program  guidelines. DOJ concurred with the recommendation that it provide  additional training and oversight over the monitoring of subrecipient  activities, and plans to review financial training course content to ensure  that proper internal control guidance on subrecipient monitoring is  included.

In addition, the SAA officials told us they find value in  sharing information by attending DOJ training sessions and conferences  and participating in programs and events sponsored by associations, such  as the National Governors Association (NGA), the National Criminal  Justice Association (NCJA), and the Council of State Governments (CSG).  For example:    Texas officials developed an electronic state government grant  management and tracking system that they stated is helpful and  efficient in managing Recovery Act JAG funds. Texas officials told us  they shared the design of this online system with several states. In  addition, during BJA conferences and other national training  conferences, Texas officials noted that they took the opportunity to  discuss with other states the promising practices and lessons learned  related to grant management and the administration of JAG funds using  their system.", "Colorado officials said that SAA staff made presentations at national  and regional conferences regarding the following: (1) grant  management and monitoring of state uses for effective grant  administration, (2) various programs the state has funded, and (3)  outcomes the state has achieved. SAA officials said that the state  encourages subgrantees that have demonstrated successful programs  to respond to requests for presenters at state and national conferences.  Officials told us that staff from three Colorado Recovery Act JAG  subgrantee projects made presentations at the NCJA Western Regional  Conference in April 2010. For example, Colorado officials told us that  one presentation involved the retraining of probation and parole  officers to reduce recidivism by working with other agencies in taking  an overall supportive approach to working with ex-offenders that  included assistance in such areas as housing, health, and finding work.", "Ohio officials told us they take the initiative to contact other SAAs to  discuss and share experiences, lessons learned, and promising  practices regarding problems encountered in administering Recovery  Act JAG grants. They also said that NCJA provides SAAs with a forum  to share information and challenges associated with administering  recovery funds, which Ohio has leveraged. For example, they stated  that at the 2010 NCJA Mid-Western Regional Conference that Ohio  officials attended, there were sessions where SAAs shared experiences  about the administration of Recovery Act funds, as well as were  workshops on model projects funded through the Recovery Act.  According to Ohio officials, the information was helpful both in terms  of planning their own initiatives and in reaffirming decisions they had  made regarding Recovery Act and Recovery Act JAG programs.", "Illinois officials told us that they hosted a 2-day criminal justice  planning summit in September 2010 for all state actors in the criminal  justice system including Recovery Act JAG practitioners, policymakers,  academics, and legislators. According to SAA officials, the focus of the  summit was on how to fight crime more effectively in a time of  diminishing resources by using the promising evidence-based practices.  State summit planners told us that both presentations by state and  national experts and workshops focused on implementing promising  practices, while the emphasis in follow-up work groups was on  producing a long-range criminal justice plan for the state of Illinois. In  addition, SAA officials told us that they share promising practices and  lessons learned by participating in regional training conferences, Web- based seminars, and/or informational conferences provided by OMB,  DOJ, as well as Illinois state agencies.", "DOJ encourages information sharing through regional training  conferences, Web-sites, and Web-based clearinghouses. For example,  training meetings and Webinars provide a forum which states find valuable  for sharing information and promising practices, according to a majority of  (9 of the 14) states we interviewed. In addition, BJA has developed a Web  site that illustrates examples of successful and/or innovative Recovery Act  JAG programs. The Web site highlights JAG subgrantees and/or statewide  projects that BJA believes show promise in meeting the objectives and  goals of Recovery Act JAG. In particular, the site describes the planned  Illinois criminal justice information strategic planning initiative and  summit discussed above. Further, DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs is in  the process of developing an informational Web-based clearinghouse of  promising practice information for the criminal justice community through  a public Web site where researchers, grant applicants, and others may find  a list of model programs proven to be effective. According to DOJ officials,  it will also be a site that SAAs can use to help find best practices and  model programs, thereby funding discretionary programs that show  promise based upon evidence. While the focus of the DOJ information- sharing programs is broader than Recovery Act JAG, they offer methods  and mechanisms to share information related to program priorities, such  as law enforcement, corrections, and technology improvement. SAA  officials, in a majority of the states we interviewed, indicated that they  were supportive of these efforts.", "In addition, national associations such as NGA, CSG, and NCJA encourage  states to share information and promising practices. The focus of these  programs is generally broader than Recovery Act JAG, but some  exclusively focus on Recovery Act JAG priorities such as law enforcement,  corrections, and technology improvement. For example, BJA has funded  NCJA to provide on-site training and technical assistance, Webinars, and  regional conferences, and creates and disseminates publications to assist  SAAs in developing their statewide criminal justice plans and ensure  effective use of Recovery Act JAG funds.

(2) What  challenges, if any, have Recovery Act JAG recipients reported in  complying with Recovery Act reporting requirements? (3) To what extent  do states share promising practices related to the use and management of  Recovery Act JAG funds, and how, if at all, does the Department of Justice  (DOJ) encourage information sharing? (4) To what extent are DOJ\u2019s  Recovery Act JAG performance measures consistent with promising  practices?", "As agreed with your office, we focused our review on Recovery Act JAG  grants in a nonprobability sample of 14 states. The grants made to these  states included both direct awards that DOJ made to State Administering  Agencies (SAAs) and localities, as well as pass-through awards SAAs made  to localities. A portion of this work was done in conjunction with our  other Recovery Act reviews that focused on those 16 states, as well as the  District of Columbia that represent the majority of Recovery Act  spending. The 16 states included Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida,  Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey,  New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We selected  these states and the District of Columbia on the basis of federal outlay  projections, percentage of the U.S. population represented, unemployment  rates and changes, and a mix of states\u2019 poverty levels, geographic  coverage, and representation of both urban and rural areas. Collectively,  these states contain about 65 percent of the U.S. population and are  estimated to receive about two-thirds of the intergovernmental assistance  available through the Recovery Act. However, for the purposes of this  report, we limited our scope to a subset of 14 of these states so as not to  duplicate ongoing work in the other 3 (Florida, New Jersey, and the  District of Columbia) that the DOJ Office of Inspector General was  conducting. The awards to these 14 states accounted for approximately 50  percent of all Recovery Act JAG funds provided.", "To identify how recipients of direct and pass-through funds received and  used their Recovery Act JAG awards in selected states and localities, we  conducted in-person and telephone interviews with officials from SAAs in  all 14 states as well as officials from a nonprobability sample of 62  localities in these states. Where statements are attributed to state and local  officials, we did not analyze state and locality data sources but relied on  state and local officials and other state sources for relevant state data and  materials. We selected these localities based on the amount of their grant  awards, the activities that they were undertaking with grant funds,  whether they reported that they had completed 50 percent or more of their  grant activities according to their responses provided in Recovery Act  reporting, and how they received their funds (either as passed-through  funding from their SAA or received awards directly from DOJ\u2014and in  some cases as part of disparate jurisdictions.) Our interviews addressed  the use and perceived impact of Recovery Act JAG funds, program  performance measurement and reporting challenges, and sharing of  promising practices. Also, we reviewed DOJ direct award data and SAA  pass-through awards in 14 SAAs. We also reviewed Recovery Act quarterly  reports from Recovery.gov (4th quarter 2009, 1st quarter 2010, and 2nd  quarter 2010) to identify additional information on the use of JAG funds.  Based on this information, we assigned the grants to one of the seven JAG  general purpose areas. For those where multiple purposes were indicated,  they were so identified. In cases where a purpose could not be identified  we placed it in the category of \u201cnot enough information.\u201d We collected and  used these funding data because they are the official source of Recovery  Act spending. Based on our limited examination of the data thus far we  consider them to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Findings from  our nonprobability samples cannot be generalized to all states and  localities that were recipients of Recovery Act JAG funds; however, our  samples provided us with illustrative examples of uses of funds, oversight  processes, and reporting issues.", "To determine the extent to which Recovery Act JAG recipients faced  challenges in complying with Recovery Act requirements, we interviewed  representatives from the 14 SAAs and 62 localities and asked them about  their experience with 1512(c) reporting requirements and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. In addition, we reviewed our  previous reports that discuss Recovery Act recipient reporting issues.", "To identify how states share promising practice information, and the  extent to which DOJ encourages information sharing, we conducted in- person and telephone interviews with representatives from all 14 of the  SAAs. We also reviewed DOJ information, interviewed DOJ officials, and  consulted reports from the National Criminal Justice Association, the  National Governors\u2019 Association, and others that describe their  information-sharing activities.", "To identify the extent to which DOJ\u2019s performance measurement approach  is consistent with promising practices to assess progress, we interviewed  representatives from the 14 SAAs and 62 localities and asked them about  their experience with the Performance Measurement Tool (PMT). We also  discussed the PMT\u2019s design and Recovery Act JAG performance measure  improvement efforts with DOJ staff. Further, we conducted a review of the  performance measures that were required for use under the Recovery Act  JAG activities commonly reported to have been undertaken by the grant  recipients in our sample. From the 86 Recovery Act JAG performance  measures under 10 activity types, we analyzed a nonprobability sample of  the 19 performance measures required under 4 of the activity areas  (Personnel, Equipment and Supplies, Information Systems for Criminal  Justice, and the category Outcomes for all Activity Types). We selected  these activity types and measures because they were the ones associated  with the largest share of reported Recovery Act JAG expenditures and  therefore most often encountered by the grant recipients. We then  assessed these measures against a set of key characteristics that we have  previously reported as being associated with promising practices and  successful performance measures we have identified in our previous  work. Some of the 9 key characteristics of successful performance  measures are attributes that may be most effectively used when reviewing  performance measures individually and some are best used when  reviewing a complete set of measures. Since we selected a nonprobability  sample of measures that was most closely associated with the majority of  expenditures, we focused our analysis most heavily on those attributes  that could be applied to individual measures\u2014clarity, reliability, linkage to  strategic goals, objectivity, and measurable targets. We did not assess the  subset of 19 performance measures for the attributes of governmentwide  priorities, core program activities, limited overlap, or balance that are  associated with an evaluation of a full set of measures. To evaluate the  sample, four analysts independently assessed each of the performance  measures against attributes of successful performance measures  previously identified by GAO. Those analysts then met to discuss and  resolve any differences in the results of their analysis. In conducting this  analysis, we analyzed program performance measure information  contained in DOJ\u2019s Performance Measurement Tool for American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act - ARRA) and fiscal year  2009 Justice Assistance Grant Programs. We did not do a detailed  assessment of DOJ\u2019s methodology for developing the measures, but looked  at the issues necessary to assess whether a particular measure met the  overall characteristics of a successful performance measure. We also  reviewed our previous reports that discuss the importance of performance  measurement system attributes and obtained information on the extent to  which such systems may impact agencies\u2019 planning. The activity types  and number of measures selected are listed in table 7.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 through October  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Recovery Act JAG Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["The following table contains the 19 Performance Measurement Tool  (PMT) performance measures that were required for use under the  Recovery Act JAG activity types commonly undertaken by the grant  recipients in our sample."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Assessment of Whether DOJ\u2019s Recovery Act JAG Performance Measures Possessed Certain Key Attributes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Recovery Act JAG Award Drawdowns and Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Department of Justice (DOJ) records indicate that all 14 of the states in  our sample have drawn down the vast majority of their Recovery Act  Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) awards as of May 2010.
