By 1996, it was evident that Farmer Mac was having difficulties fulfilling its statutory mission. To relieve structural impediments that had limited Farmer Mac\u2019s ability to function efficiently, Congress passed the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), which significantly revised Farmer Mac\u2019s statutory authorities.", "You asked us to review the progress that Farmer Mac has made in achieving its statutory mission and examine its future viability. Our objectives were to (1) examine actions taken by Farmer Mac to promote the development of a secondary market, including the introduction of new programs and products; the standardization of loan processes, including loan documents and underwriting standards; and the use of risk management techniques to facilitate safe and sound secondary market activities, and (2) analyze Farmer Mac\u2019s future viability and discuss the potential benefits and costs of a government-sponsored secondary market for agricultural mortgages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (the 1987 Act) authorized Farmer Mac to promote the development of a secondary market for agricultural real estate and rural housing loans. As a GSE, Farmer Mac is a federally chartered, privately owned and operated corporation that operates as a special purpose corporation. Farmer Mac is also an independent entity within FCS, which is another GSE. When Congress passed the 1987 Act, some observers stated that a Farmer Mac-sponsored nationwide secondary market would develop quickly and be widely used. Others stated that Farmer Mac would serve more as a safety valve for the agricultural sector if FCS encountered difficulties.", "A secondary market is a financial market for buying and selling loans, either individually or in the form of securities backed by cash flows from groups or \u201cpools\u201d of loans. By authorizing Farmer Mac to promote the development of an agricultural secondary market, Congress intended to (1) increase the availability of long-term financing to creditworthy farmers and ranchers at stable interest rates and (2) provide greater liquidity in agricultural financing. Ideally, such a market would provide agricultural lenders with access to national capital markets, which, by returning cash to such lenders in exchange for the mortgages, would generate additional funds for them to lend and enhance their ability to manage credit and interest-rate risks.", "Under Farmer Mac\u2019s originating statute, the 1987 Act, it was only to certify certain agricultural lenders and other financial institutions to act as third- party \u201cpoolers\u201d that is, financial institutions that would buy qualified loans from other lenders or \u201coriginators,\u201d assemble or \u201cpool\u201d the loans, and issue and sell securities that are backed by these pools to investors. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest to investors who purchase these mortgage-backed securities. The original statute did not permit Farmer Mac to buy and hold agricultural loans. The 1987 Act also required either originators/poolers to maintain a cash reserve to cover at least the first 10 percent of losses arising from defaults on the pools of loans backing Farmer Mac-guaranteed securities or holders of subordinated participation interests (SPI) to absorb these losses before Farmer Mac\u2019s guarantee could be exercised. The purpose of the reserve requirement was to minimize risks to Farmer Mac and the federal government by requiring originators, poolers, and investors to hold most of the loan\u2019s credit risk.", "Risk-based capital requirements for banks and FCS institutions required them to hold capital against the full amount of the sold loan, not just the 10 percent retained by the lender. Regulators of primary market lenders (e.g., banks and FCS institutions) viewed the retained SPI as the source of substantially all of the loan\u2019s credit risk and, therefore, obtaining Farmer Mac\u2019s guarantee did not reduce the amount of capital the lender was required to hold. As a result, the incentive for banks and FCS institutions major agricultural mortgage lenders Farmer Mac-guaranteed loan pools was reduced. Further, the 1987 Act required certain diversification standards to be met\u2014that is, each pool was to be made up of loans secured by properties from different geographic locations that produce different agricultural commodities.", "The necessity to operate through third-party poolers and establish the mandatory cash reserve or SPI increased the complexity and expense of secondary market transactions to both Farmer Mac and lenders. Under its original operating structure, Farmer Mac was unable to achieve a profit, and its prospects for survival were dim.", "Eight years after its creation, Farmer Mac faced possible financial failure and was ineffective in creating a successful agricultural secondary market.Farmer Mac requested and Congress granted new statutory authorities in the 1996 Act to improve Farmer Mac\u2019s ability to fulfill its statutory mission. Among other things, the revised charter allowed Farmer Mac to (1) purchase agricultural mortgage loans directly from lenders and serve as a pooler, (2) eliminate the mandatory 10-percent minimum cash reserve and SPI required with each loan pool and also eliminate the loan diversification standards, (3) have its securities accorded full \u201cagency status\u201d in the financial markets, and (4) relax and delay the implementation of regulatory capital standards for Farmer Mac. The first three revisions made Farmer Mac\u2019s operating structure essentially the same as Freddie Mac\u2019s and Fannie Mae\u2019s the GSE facilitators of the secondary markets for residential mortgage loans.", "Primary market lenders, secondary market entities, and investors in securities backed by cash flows from loan pools face credit, interest-rate, prepayment, management, and business risks. Farmer Mac faces credit that is, the possibility of financial loss resulting from default by borrowers on farming assets that have lost value and/or other parties\u2019 failing to meet their obligations. This risk occurs when Farmer Mac holds mortgages in portfolio and when it guarantees principal and interest payments to investors in AMBS it issues. Farmer Mac\u2019s interest-rate riskcan result from the possibility of an increase in interest rates in the national economy that is not matched by an increase in interest rates paid by borrowers to Farmer Mac for loans that are held in portfolio by Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac\u2019s prepayment risk can result from the possibility of a decline in interest rates, which can cause borrowers to prepay their mortgages. Farmer Mac faces management risk from the possibility of financial loss resulting from a management mistake that can threaten the company\u2019s viability. Finally, Farmer Mac faces business risk from the possibility of financial loss due to conditions within the agricultural sector that affect loan performance.", "The risk characteristics of agricultural mortgage loans are different from those of conventional single-family residential mortgage loans.Agricultural mortgages are commercial loans that fund a wide variety of agricultural activities (e.g., poultry farms or orange groves), while single- family mortgages fund a fairly homogeneous asset. As a result, in the event of loan foreclosure, farm properties can be harder to appraise and more difficult to liquidate than a single-family residence. In addition, the financial and business skills of farm operators can affect the value of their collateral since their income comes largely from the mortgaged property, rather than from independent employment or investment income. As a result, assessing the risks of cash flows from agricultural loan pools can be more difficult than such an assessment for single-family residential mortgages. To some extent, agricultural mortgage loans are more like multifamily loans than single-family loans because multifamily loans are commercial loans in which income is derived largely from rental of the mortgaged property.", "Farmer Mac strives to fulfill its statutory mission mainly by purchasing agricultural mortgages from lenders. Lenders who participate in the primary market for such agricultural mortgages include federally insured depository institutions, insurance companies, and FCS institutions. Once purchased by Farmer Mac, the mortgages can be held directly in portfolio or pooled to back newly issued AMBS. Farmer Mac, in turn, can hold some AMBS in portfolio and sell some AMBS to investors in national financial markets. About $1.1 billion in total AMBS were outstanding as of year-end 1998; slightly more than half of the value was held by investors other than Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac guarantees timely payment of principal and interest to investors in its AMBS.", "Farmer Mac conducts its operations through two broadly defined programs. The Farmer Mac I Program consists of agricultural and rural housing mortgage loans that do not contain federally provided primary mortgage insurance. The Farmer Mac II Program consists of agricultural mortgage loans containing primary mortgage insurance provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Farmer Mac was authorized in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (the 1990 Act) to facilitate the creation of a secondary market for USDA-guaranteed agricultural loans. Under Farmer Mac II, Farmer Mac can purchase or have others purchase the guaranteed portions of USDA loans, assemble them into pools, and hold them in portfolio or sell them as securities to investors. At year-end 1998, Farmer Mac held $306.8 million of Farmer Mac II AMBS in portfolio and other investors held $30.1 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We focused our attention on the secondary market in agricultural mortgages under the Farmer Mac I Program because it is the primary program through which Farmer Mac conducts its secondary market activity. However, we included Farmer Mac II Program activity in our analysis of Farmer Mac\u2019s future viability. To address our objectives overall, we reviewed relevant literature, congressional testimony, Securities and Exchange Commission public filings, and relevant Internet World Wide Web sites. We also held numerous discussions with Farmer Mac executives and interviewed representatives of the American Bankers Association, Independent Bankers Association of America, and the Farm Credit Council.", "To gain a better understanding of the agricultural mortgage market and its prospects for future growth, we met with financial and agricultural economists from USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service. Additionally, to obtain a regulatory perspective on Farmer Mac activities, we met with officials from the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the Director of FCA\u2019s Office of Secondary Market Oversight, and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Director of GSE Policy. In our analysis of the agricultural mortgage market, we did not undertake detailed analyses of competing FCS or FHLBank System products. We also did not analyze the USDA loan guarantee programs.", "To determine Farmer Mac\u2019s risk management practices and exposure to each type of risk, we (1) obtained Farmer Mac\u2019s written and oral responses to questions on interest-rate, prepayment, credit, business, and management risks; (2) reviewed corporate policies and standards, including Farmer Mac\u2019s Seller/Servicer Guide (Farmer Mac guide), which specifies lender requirements for participation in Farmer Mac programs; (3) obtained data on Farmer Mac\u2019s current financial condition and operating results, such as delinquency rates and profit margins; (4) reviewed methodologies for determining capital adequacy, pricing, sensitivity to interest-rate changes, sensitivity to economic stress, and management information systems; and (5) examined copies of external auditors\u2019 reports and management letters. We also reviewed FCA\u2019s March 1998 regulatory examination report and discussed the report with FCA officials.", "To help determine the potential market benefits from a government- sponsored secondary market for agricultural loans, we conducted a mail survey of approved Farmer Mac sellers and nonparticipants. Using two mail questionnaires, we conducted the survey in late 1998 and early 1999 and telephoned selected nonrespondents in 1999. We obtained information on the background of the financial institutions, questioned their knowledge of and participation in Farmer Mac programs, and sought their views on Farmer Mac and the secondary agricultural mortgage market. Survey participants were chosen from lists provided by Farmer Mac. The 263 institutions companies, and FCS institutions on Farmer Mac\u2019s approved sellers list commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage bankers, trust (as of Oct. 1998) and the 331 financial institutions of various sizes with over $100 million in assets on Farmer Mac\u2019s nonparticipants list (as of Oct. 1998) were sent the respective surveys. To the list of 331 nonparticipants, we added 3 large insurance companies that are agricultural mortgage lenders that were not on Farmer Mac\u2019s list. Our survey results are not generalizable to the universe of agricultural lenders, but the results are generalizable to the unique groups identified by Farmer Mac and us. We did not examine the impact of Farmer Mac on agricultural mortgage interest rates or the availability of agricultural mortgage credit. See appendixes I and II for a more detailed description of our survey methodology and survey results, respectively.", "We constructed financial scenarios using various assumptions to help illustrate Farmer Mac\u2019s ability to sustain mission viability as described in appendix III. We defined mission viability as the ability of Farmer Mac to generate a profit from its core business of operating a secondary market in agricultural mortgages and to provide a reasonable rate of return to its equity investors.

Farmer Mac also has used its new charter authorities to streamline the process for buying loans, including some standardization, and developed a program to market its products to agricultural lenders. The market\u2019s reception of Farmer Mac\u2019s products thus far has been limited, and Farmer Mac\u2019s loan purchase volumes have remained small in relation to the primary market. For example, the share of agricultural mortgages sold to Farmer Mac has shown some growth since the 1996 restructuring, but its market share represented about 1.2 percent of the agricultural mortgage debt outstanding as of the third-quarter of 1998.  In addition to its loan purchase programs, Farmer Mac, in 1998, initiated its AgVantage Program in which Farmer Mac in effect provides loans to agricultural lenders with the lenders\u2019 using agricultural mortgages as collateral. Activity under this program has been of relatively small volume to date.", "In an attempt to facilitate an efficient secondary market, Farmer Mac has streamlined the process for buying loans and standardized some aspects of a secondary market transaction, including underwriting guidelines, but it believes that standardized loan documents, such as those used in the secondary market for residential mortgages, would be cost prohibitive.", "To mitigate its exposure to risks, Farmer Mac uses risk management techniques to help it conduct secondary market activities in a safe and sound manner."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Programs and Products Have Been Introduced", "paragraphs": ["In its effort to stimulate greater secondary market activity, since 1996 Farmer Mac has developed several new programs and loan products that were designed to increase participation by traditional (e.g., rural banks) as well as nontraditional (e.g., mortgage banks) agricultural mortgage lenders. Through workshops and various marketing initiatives, Farmer Mac has increased the number and types of sellers approved to sell loans to Farmer Mac, established new programs, and expanded its product line. Farmer Mac expected these initiatives to enhance market reception to Farmer Mac, thereby increasing the volume of agricultural mortgages sold in the secondary market.", "Secondary market activity is likely to be greater when the secondary market creates products that help lenders and investors manage various risks at low cost. For example, interest-rate risk associated with long-term, fixed-rate loans can often be managed at lower cost by secondary market investors (e.g., AMBS investors, including Farmer Mac) with access to long-term bond financing relative to primary market financial institutions that rely on deposit bases. Secondary market entities, such as Farmer Mac, can also use their nationwide operations to obtain geographic diversification of their loan purchases to help manage credit risk. While standards for underwriting, appraisal, and loan servicing are used to help manage credit risk, secondary market entities have relatively less ability than lenders to rely on borrower relationships to assess credit risk.  Thus, from the pool of loans meeting their underwriting standards, secondary market entities increase their risk of purchasing loans with high credit risk from less creditworthy borrowers.", "By establishing a training program, Farmer Mac sought to educate and attract lenders by increasing their interest in and improving their understanding of Farmer Mac and the secondary market for agricultural mortgages. In 1997, over 800 lenders attended the more than 20 seller/servicer workshops that Farmer Mac conducted across the nation to inform lenders of Farmer Mac\u2019s new authorities and programs and of the benefits of participating in the agricultural secondary market. Marketing initiatives have resulted in Farmer Mac\u2019s approving several nationally known, large commercial banks and mortgage banks as approved sellers from which it could buy loans, which has increased the potential for lender diversity.  The initiatives also expanded the number of outlets through which Farmer Mac products can be marketed to customers. Lenders approved to submit loans for possible sale to the Farmer Mac I Program totaled 286 as of December 1998. At its peak under the old charter, Farmer Mac had nine approved sellers (at that time known as poolers).", "The mechanism that Farmer Mac established to purchase mortgages directly from lenders for cash and provide loans to agricultural lenders (i.e., the AgVantage Program) is called its Cash Window Program. This program grew out of the 1996 legislation that granted Farmer Mac greater flexibility in its business dealings with agricultural lenders. The 1996 Act authorized Farmer Mac to purchase loans directly from originating lenders. Before this act, lenders could only participate in the secondary market by selling agricultural real estate loans to qualified Farmer Mac poolers. Additionally, the Cash Window Program was designed to (1) provide lenders with new product terms and competitive interest rates for agricultural real estate loans and (2) provide a responsive process for better servicing the credit needs of lenders\u2019 borrowers.  The Cash Window Program began in July 1996 and by December 1998, $732 million in loans were sold to Farmer Mac.", "In late 1997, Farmer Mac introduced its Part-Time Farm Program, which covered farms with substantial off-farm income. This program offers a fixed-rate, 30-year home mortgage product for farms on at least five acres of land or farms generating at least $5,000 in gross farm sales from agricultural crops or livestock. The value of the home must represent at least 30 percent of the total appraised value of the property. Farmer Mac sought to facilitate the use of this program by making the origination and servicing requirements simple and using familiar documents and procedures. For example, standard conforming residential secondary market origination forms are used in this program.", "In February 1998, as an expansion of the Cash Window Program, Farmer Mac established the AgVantage Program, which allows Farmer Mac to fund eligible lenders by providing cash advances. The primary difference between the AgVantage Program and existing Farmer Mac programs is that, in this program, the lender does not sell its loans to Farmer Mac but instead issues a bond backed by eligible loans and other collateral. To facilitate access to this program, Farmer Mac has provided standard documentation, including a standard form for the bond. Farmer Mac guarantees the bond and purchases it. This transaction allows the lender to keep the loans and associated credit risk, while increasing its debt and liquidity positions. Farmer Mac is to receive low-risk income from the bond and guarantee fees. This program was designed to meet the demand for long-term loans by being attractive to lenders with excess collateral, but inadequate liquidity.", "Since the program\u2019s February 1998 inception through December 1998, 16 AgVantage bond transactions had been consummated with 10 AgVantage issuers, resulting in Farmer Mac guarantees for $143.6 million of AgVantage bonds. Due to the short-term nature of the obligations that had been issued, only $10.8 million of the $143.6 million remained outstanding at year-end 1998.", "In addition to the Cash Window, Part-Time Farm, and AgVantage Programs, Farmer Mac can purchase loans through a Swap Program (introduced in early 1997). A swap is a transaction in which lenders exchange one or more eligible loans for Farmer Mac-guaranteed securities, rather than cash. Unlike Cash Window transactions, which generally involve loans with Farmer Mac-specified terms, Farmer Mac is to negotiate these swap transactions with the lender and is to acquire loans with payment, maturity, and interest-rate characteristics that Farmer Mac would not purchase through its Cash Window Program. In January 1999, Farmer Mac reported that it had committed to enter into a $408 million long-term, standby purchase commitment that operates similarly to a swap in agricultural mortgages. As of January 1999, Farmer Mac had consummated four Farmer Mac I swap transactions totaling approximately $493 million (includes the previously mentioned $408 million transaction).", "In 1997 and early 1998, complementary to its existing product lines, Farmer Mac developed new loan products that included a refined 1-year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) and a new 3-year ARM with flexible borrower prepayment terms. These two loan products can be converted to a long-term, fixed-rate loan after a certain time period has elapsed. Farmer Mac also developed a 10-year, fixed-rate mortgage. See table 1 for a list of Farmer Mac\u2019s programs and their descriptions and features, in addition to the various loan products offered.", "Increased authority granted to Farmer Mac by the 1996 Act, which allowed its operating structure to parallel that of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has provided it with flexibility to develop programs. However, this expanded operational authority does not mean that program success will be guaranteed or that expected outcomes will be achieved. Although Farmer Mac has expanded its seller base and provided lenders with streamlined procedures, including some standardization, to access the secondary market, Farmer Mac acknowledges that it cannot be certain whether the new products it offers will generate a sufficient volume of loans that would allow Farmer Mac to continuously function as a profitable corporation.", "One key factor that could hinder lenders\u2019 use of Farmer Mac programs would be their lack of knowledge about these programs. Our survey results showed that familiarity with Farmer Mac programs varied widely, with the majority of the nonparticipating respondents being unfamiliar 52 percent and 62 percent were unfamiliar with Farmer Macs I and II Cash Window Programs, respectively. With other programs, familiarity was even lower 70 percent of the respondents were unfamiliar with the AgVantage Program, and over 87 percent were unfamiliar with the Swap Programs under Farmer Macs I and II. Even among approved sellers, familiarity with some Farmer Mac programs was low. For example, 31 percent of the respondents were unfamiliar with the AgVantage Program; 75 percent and 78 percent were unfamiliar with the Swap Programs under Farmer Macs I and II, respectively.", "The AgVantage Program\u2019s volume has been relatively small to date, but nevertheless, Farmer Mac officials consider the program to be beneficial because it encourages lenders to do business with Farmer Mac and it is considered to be competitive with advances offered by the FHLBank System. Furthermore, Farmer Mac officials believe that the AgVantage Program is more advantageous to lenders than FHLBank System advances considering that AgVantage loans can be sold to Farmer Mac at a later time without the need for any additional paperwork requirements.", "On the basis of our survey, 23 percent of the approved sellers surveyed said they are \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to participate in the AgVantage Program in the next 3 years; among nonparticipants, this proportion was 12 percent.

Thus, standardization has the potential to help lower transaction costs and increase the efficiency of the secondary market.

Farmer Mac officials told us that standardized loan documents have not been developed because of the prohibitive cost associated with standardization given that state laws governing agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural lending practices vary from state-to-state.

Standardization of loan origination documents is common in the secondary market for residential mortgages. In the secondary market for residential mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have increased efficiency through greater standardization of mortgage products and processes. Standardized documents can reduce the cost and effort necessary to evaluate the quality of asset pools because inspection or review of each lending arrangement can be replaced with verification that adherence to the predetermined industrywide standards for loan origination has been maintained.", "Farmer Mac officials stated that early in Farmer Mac\u2019s existence, it sought to standardize loan documents but was not able to achieve a level of standardization approaching that achieved by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These Farmer Mac officials attributed this inability to differences in agricultural real estate state laws that differ greatly from state-to-state. Residential real estate state laws are more uniform. These officials also stated that, with the diversity of agricultural lender practices and the heterogeneous characteristics of agricultural loans, developing nationwide documents would be difficult and costly.", "Farmer Mac generally allows agricultural lenders the option of using Farmer Mac forms, their own forms, or an off-the-shelf commercial loan package. According to Farmer Mac\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel, the vendor of the off-the-shelf package is to guarantee Farmer Mac that each loan package meets the legal requirements of all states where the loans were originated. These officials also stated that Farmer Mac forms do not meet the legal requirements of all states.  Farmer Mac provides loan origination forms on a disk for use by lenders, but it only requires that participants use the loan summary and environmental survey forms. As long as other forms used by the lenders present information in substantially the same format as Farmer Mac forms, the use of Farmer Mac\u2019s forms is not required. These Farmer Mac officials noted that small lenders, rather than large lenders, are more apt to use the off-the-shelf commercial product because small lenders often lack in-house legal departments.", "The Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel of Farmer Mac stated that regardless of whether the loan documents used are the lender\u2019s own or those of the commercial vendor, the documents must include legally enforceable standard Farmer Mac representations, warranties, and provisions to ensure that the loans conform to Farmer Mac\u2019s loan underwriting and appraisal standards. These officials also stated that since the initial use of representations and warranties in 1991, they have encountered no problems enforcing the terms of the loan agreements. The Farmer Mac guide states that Farmer Mac is to verify, via examination of loan files, that the documents submitted by lenders conform to Farmer Mac\u2019s underwriting standards and other loan origination requirements.

The Farmer Mac guide requires participating lenders to follow certain standardized practices.  For example, Farmer Mac requires inclusion of standardized representations and warranties (e.g., the seller is authorized to do business and loan information submitted to Farmer Mac is true and correct).  In addition, the Farmer Mac guide specifies requirements for underwriting, collection of mortgage payments, administration of escrow accounts, and initiation of foreclosure proceedings. The guide includes nine underwriting standards, including those pertaining to obtaining a credit report and financial statements, the borrowers\u2019 debt-to-asset ratio, and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for the financed agricultural property. The Farmer Mac guide provides some underwriting flexibility to recognize differences and variances in financial reporting of agricultural borrowers. It also provides flexibility for special loan-servicing practices associated with specific agricultural activities, such as livestock operations and properties with irrigation systems. The Farmer Mac guide includes sections on loan-making, -selling, and -servicing as well as seller requirements for participation in Farmer Mac programs. Individual chapters of the guide include credit and appraisal standards for various programs and guidelines for managing loan delinquencies.", "To provide perspective to the Farmer Mac guide, we compared it with the two previously mentioned Fannie Mae guides for servicing residential the single-family guide and the multifamily guide. The Fannie Mae guides differ from the Farmer Mac guide due to differences in the types of industry served and loan programs. For example, single-family residential mortgages generally are not commercial loans (i.e., most finance owner-occupied housing), while multifamily residential and agricultural mortgages are commercial mortgages. Fannie Mae\u2019s multifamily guide includes separate sections for its delegated underwriting program and negotiated transactions. Under its delegated underwriting program, Fannie Mae delegates its authority to underwrite and determine the creditworthiness of a loan to the originating lender and agrees to purchase the loan without prior review. In return for this autonomy, the lender is to assume a percentage of the risk of default on the loan. In contrast, Farmer Mac generally takes on the full credit risk of backing AMBS.  This practice conforms most closely to Fannie Mae\u2019s negotiated transactions program.  In this program, Fannie Mae, similar to Farmer Mac, provides some underwriting flexibility to recognize differences among multifamily properties in specifying lender obligations in transaction documents.", "The Fannie Mae and Farmer Mac guides share some similarities in the topics that they cover.

Farmer Mac employs several techniques to control interest-rate risk. Farmer Mac measures its exposure to interest-rate risk.  Farmer Mac\u2019s management and Board of Directors are to ensure compliance with its interest-rate risk policy limits.  Farmer Mac also purchases financial instruments to help manage part of its exposure to interest-rate risk.

The following two techniques are employed by Farmer Mac to measure interest-rate risk: duration gaps and market value of equity sensitivity.", "Duration gaps measure the average economic life of a whole portfolio, rather than the time to final payment for each asset or liability. The difference between a firm\u2019s asset and liability durations is called its duration gap.", "The duration gap measures the overall interest-rate risk exposure of Farmer Mac. The larger the gap in absolute value, the greater Farmer Mac\u2019s exposure to interest-rate risk. For example, if Farmer Mac\u2019s average economic life of its assets is 1.5 years greater than the average economic life of its liabilities, then it has a duration gap of 1.5 years. Should interest rates rise, Farmer Mac\u2019s net interest income would fall because interest expenses would rise sooner than interest income. Farmer Mac tries to manage interest-rate risk by managing its portfolio to keep the duration gap within a certain parameter.", "Another technique that Farmer Mac uses in measuring interest-rate risk is to estimate the sensitivity of its market value net worth to various changes in interest rates. Market value net worth provides a measure of Farmer Mac\u2019s ability to absorb losses. Financial firms report their income statements and balance sheets according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP relies primarily on the historical (book) value of the financial assets and liabilities, rather than on their current market value. The market value of such assets and liabilities is affected by current interest rates, but the market value also can change if the likelihood of prepayment or repayment changes. The market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities provides the market value of net worth.", "For example, Farmer Mac carries a 10-year, 8-percent loan at the amount of unpaid principal over the life of the loan. If interest rates decrease, the market value of the loan increases because the loan earns a higher yield than the yield on a new loan. Likewise, the market value declines if interest rates rise because the yield would be greater on a new loan. One method of monitoring a firm\u2019s exposure to interest-rate risk is to regularly determine the market value of the firm\u2019s assets and liabilities (marking-to-market) and project how market value would change for assumed changes in interest rates.", "Management of interest-rate risk. Once its interest-rate risk exposure is measured, Farmer Mac managers can change Farmer Mac\u2019s exposure by various actions that lengthen or shorten the expected maturity of assets and liabilities so that payment streams on assets and liabilities behave similarly. The managers may issue liabilities with variable maturity terms callable debt allows Farmer Mac to repay its bonds after a specified time frame, which is a useful option if interest rates were to decline or levy prepayment penalties on borrowers who prepay their mortgages when interest rates fall. This is known as prepayment risk. Prepayment penalties allow Farmer Mac to offer competitive interest rates to farmers and ranchers and entice investors to accept lower rates of return on their investment in Farmer Mac-guaranteed securities. However, as indicated by agricultural lenders\u2019 responses to our survey, prepayment penalties reduce the competitive attractiveness of Farmer Mac products as compared with agricultural loan products offered by FCS and other agricultural lenders without prepayment penalties.", "Management of interest-rate risk is important at Farmer Mac because of its investment portfolio and pipeline operations (loans submitted to Farmer Mac for approval and loans approved but not yet committed for purchase\u2014i.e., locked in interest rate). Farmer Mac controls interest-rate risk associated with portfolio lending by striving to closely match the interest-rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities and by requiring a yield maintenance provision for loans that are paid off earlier than their scheduled payoff date. In addition, interest-rate risk can be avoided by issuing and selling AMBS and shifting the interest-rate risk to investors. In its role as financial guarantor of AMBS, Farmer Mac does not directly undertake interest-rate risk.

Delinquency rates are an early indicator of credit problems. After a period of continuing delinquency, the loan servicer or Farmer Mac may act to recover the loan principal by foreclosing on the property and filing a claim with any party that insured or guaranteed the loan. At the time of foreclosure, the loan is said to have defaulted. Generally, only a small fraction of delinquent loans default.

Defaults and loss rates can be predicted by Farmer Mac when it has historical default and loss data for similar types of loans in various economic circumstances. With new types of products, defaults and losses are difficult to predict accurately, and product performance must be monitored carefully to control credit risk. Farmer Mac only has a limited history of loan performance data, so it uses the historical loan loss data of a FCS institution to construct hypothetical loan pools to estimate losses on loan pools. The result is to be used to determine the level of guarantee fees that Farmer Mac needs for a pool of loans to generate sufficient income to provide an adequate return and maintain a minimum level of capital.", "Methods to manage credit risk. Farmer Mac manages credit risk by trying to control the number of defaults and minimize the losses that result from defaults. Farmer Mac controls defaults through credit underwriting, appraisal standards, and geographic and commodity diversification standards that provide a quality control over the credit risks it takes and help it to prevent defaults. To minimize losses from any defaults that do occur, Farmer Mac uses techniques called credit enhancements (e.g., USDA guarantees or collateral requirement) that should allow Farmer Mac to recover portions of its potential losses from collateral or from third parties, such as lenders, loan insurers, or loan guarantors.", "Underwriting standards. Farmer Mac has underwriting standards to determine which mortgages it will buy, that it could then hold as investments or place into mortgage pools. Underwriting is the process of identifying the potential risks of loss associated with financial activities to determine loan eligibility, and underwriting also aids in the pricing of such risks. Underwriting is an integral part of business and financial transactions that occur daily throughout the private and public sectors of the economy and involve the transfer and pricing of risk. Underwriting standards provide guidelines that are used to (1) limit the type and amount of risk of loss permitted in a financial portfolio and (2) establish methods to control such risks. Farmer Mac\u2019s underwriting standards are discussed in appendix V.", "Before Farmer Mac purchases a loan or bond or guarantees a security, certain underwriting standards are to be met. Underwriting standards cover numerous borrower and property characteristics that help Farmer Mac evaluate the likelihood of defaults and the severity of related losses. For example, as stated in the Farmer Mac guide, Farmer Mac has underwriting standards that indicate (1) whether a borrower has sufficient income to make the scheduled payments and a credit history suggesting that the borrower has met past obligations in an acceptable manner and (2) the maximum LTV ratio, which measures the borrower\u2019s equity (down payment) in the property. Experience has shown that borrowers with low amounts of equity in the property, and thus high LTV ratios, are more likely to default than borrowers with high amounts of equity. Farmer Mac has also established appraisal standards to estimate the value of the property serving as collateral for the mortgage and geographic and commodity diversification standards to mitigate Farmer Mac\u2019s exposure to a particular agricultural region or commodity product.", "Because Farmer Mac does not make loans directly, standards are also to be used to qualify other parties to participate in its credit activities. For example, Farmer Mac has established standards for lenders, Central Servicers, and Contract Underwriters. Such standards include measures of financial strength, past performance indicators, and management quality. Lenders, Central Servicers, and Contract Underwriters expose Farmer Mac to risks of default to the extent that they fail to follow standards adequately when making the loan or fail to collect payments diligently. Farmer Mac has also established audit and quality control procedures to monitor the performance of lenders, Central Servicers, and Contract Underwriters. Farmer Mac also sets standards for firms with which they share financial risk. For example, when Farmer Mac enters a transaction to exchange cash flows as a means to limit its interest-rate risk, there is credit risk that the other party may fail to meet its obligation (i.e., counterparty risk). To mitigate such risk, Farmer Mac sets minimum standards of financial strength for such parties.", "Farmer Mac said it contracts out certain functions to take advantage of the experience and efficiency of outside resources.

In presenting these scenarios, we rely on publicly available data and make a number of simplifying assumptions.", "Our results were sensitive to alternative assumptions and to our reliance on annual 1998 Farmer Mac financial performance data. For example, the shares of Farmer Mac business were accounted for by pre-1996 Act guarantee activity; post-1996 Act guarantee and purchase activity; and Farmer Mac II activity was affected by choosing annual 1998, rather than the fourth-quarter of 1998, financial performance data. Specifically, the post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I activity involves relatively higher guarantee fees and greater credit risk than the other activities. Although the fourth- quarter 1998 statistics may provide a more accurate basis than annual statistics for estimating future trends in some variables, such as guarantee fees, the fourth-quarter statistics may reflect temporary rather than sustainable levels of some other variables, such as loan loss provisions.", "For future nonmortgage investment holdings, we distinguished between (1) investment securities and (2) cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 1998, Farmer Mac\u2019s nonmortgage investment holdings were about $1.2 billion dollars, with $644 million accounted for by investment securities. On the basis of Farmer Mac\u2019s view that the debt issuance strategy\u2019s contribution to mission achievement should develop over a reasonable period of time, we arbitrarily reduced holdings of investment securities by half, or $322 million. Even with this reduction in investment securities, Farmer Mac investment securities would account for larger shares of balance sheet assets and mortgage-servicing portfolios than such investments for the housing enterprises. Cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term investments that can help Farmer Mac facilitate liquidity in the agricultural mortgage market, were kept constant at current levels.", "To calculate revenues for each scenario, we assumed that the split between AMBS held in portfolio and sold to investors would equal the percentage splits as of December 31, 1998. We also used the year-end 1998 levels to specify average AMBS guarantee fees, average gain on AMBS issuance, and average interest-rate spread between retained portfolio holdings (i.e., mortgage and nonmortgage investments combined) and debt costs. To determine expenses and opportunity costs for each scenario, we calculated Farmer Mac capital requirements on the basis of the current statutory minimum capital standards. We specified required return on equity on the basis of the annual 1998 return of 11.25 percent on equity for FCS. We assumed the average provision for loan losses to equal the year- end 1998 average. Some expenses were treated as variable (depending on size); we calculated these expenses using average operating costs. Other expenses that we assumed to be subject to economics of scale were held constant. We recognize that by assuming fixed operating costs, we may have understated Farmer Mac\u2019s costs, particularly in scenario 2, which anticipates a substantial expansion in Farmer Mac\u2019s agricultural mortgage purchases. Our scenarios also did not incorporate Farmer Mac corporate income tax liabilities that would have the effect of reducing after-tax corporate income.", "Results from the first scenario showed that Farmer Mac would have estimated revenues of $16.6 million and expenses of $15.6 million, or an economic profit of about $1 million. In the second scenario, Farmer Mac would have estimated revenues of $26.7 million and expenses of $20.4 million, or an economic profit of about $6.3 million. If we had developed scenarios with larger specified increases in Farmer Mac AMBS, estimated economic profits would have been greater than $6.3 million. However, our assumption of fixed operating costs would become more unrealistic in such a specified scenario.", "Farmer Mac\u2019s nonmortgage investments affected the level of profitability in both scenarios. If we removed Farmer Mac\u2019s investment securities from our scenarios, annual revenues would be reduced by about $2 million and required return on equity would be reduced by about $1 million for both scenarios. With these reductions, economic profit would become about zero (i.e., a breakeven level) in our first scenario and about positive $5.3 million in our second scenario. In our 1998 report, we questioned the need for a mature GSE to hold long-term nonmortgage investments to fulfill its statutory mission.

Our survey suggests that continued growth is possible. Seventy-three percent of the approved sellers who participated in our survey said that they are likely to increase sales to Farmer Mac in the next 3 years. In addition, about one-fourth of the nonparticipants responding to our lender survey said that they expect to begin participating in Farmer Mac programs in the next 3 years.  To the extent these lenders\u2019 inclinations are carried out, they could enhance agricultural secondary market activity.", "Economic conditions in the national and agricultural economies can affect the size of the overall agricultural mortgage debt market.  Farmer Mac\u2019s rate of growth will be affected to some extent by the size of this overall market. While the residential mortgage market has grown, agricultural mortgage debt has declined. The 1997 constant dollar value of agricultural mortgage debt outstanding was slightly more than half of its 1980 value. If the decline in the constant dollar value of agricultural mortgage debt continues, it could directly affect Farmer Mac\u2019s growth potential.", "Economic conditions in the agricultural and aggregate national economy can affect participants in the primary and secondary mortgage markets in other ways. For example, over the last 5 years, the economic environment faced by financial institutions has generally been favorable and interest rates have generally declined to relatively low levels. The agricultural economy has also been fairly strong. However, recent adverse trends in agricultural economic conditions, such as low commodity prices, reduced export demand, and weather-related problems in certain areas of the United States, have provided stress to the agricultural economy that could lessen the credit quality of agricultural mortgages. Over the past 2 years, delinquency rates on Farmer Mac I AMBS have generally been under 1 percent (except for the first quarter of 1998 when it was 1.15 percent). During the fourth quarter of 1998, FCS experienced an increase in loan losses and its provision for loan losses expanded dramatically. Farmer Mac\u2019s ability to serve as a safety valve for the agricultural sector if FCS encountered difficulties has yet to be tested. However, one financial industry group we interviewed suggested that within the next few years, we may have a test for whether Farmer Mac could help in a situation similar to the one presented in the 1980s in which agricultural real estate prices plummeted, the credit quality of agricultural mortgages declined, and FCS essentially stopped making loans.", "Before Farmer Mac\u2019s recent, long-term, standby purchase commitment transaction, FCS institutions had not been active participants in Farmer Mac programs. An expansion of FCS\u2019 participation in Farmer Mac programs as a means to manage credit and interest-rate risks could help Farmer Mac\u2019s business expand.", "Farmer Mac\u2019s January 1999 transaction of $408 million with a FCS institution illustrates the use of a Farmer Mac program to manage credit risk, because Farmer Mac is providing a guarantee to the FCS institution in the event of borrower defaults. In providing this service, Farmer Mac has the ability to diversify its credit risk by purchasing agricultural mortgages throughout the nation. However, in terms of evaluating credit risk, Farmer Mac is currently at a disadvantage compared to primary market lenders who have personal relationships with borrowers and knowledge of their local economies to evaluate credit risk. In the future, credit scoring, which has recently been introduced to evaluate credit risk associated with commercial lending, could help Farmer Mac evaluate credit risk.", "Farmer Mac also has the ability to help lenders manage interest-rate risk. Increased demand by agricultural borrowers for long-term, fixed-rate agricultural mortgages could help facilitate growth in Farmer Mac\u2019s business as FCS lenders seek to manage the potentially higher level of interest-rate risk. Conditions for such expansion differ somewhat from those for participation by commercial banks. Specifically, FCS institutions have access to national capital markets. Therefore, they can be better able to manage interest-rate risk without secondary market sales than lenders who rely on their deposit bases.", "Increased AMBS issuance itself could facilitate the role of two other factors that could in turn promote greater expansion. First, increased AMBS issuance can create the possibility that investors may obtain expanded historical information on AMBS cash flow performance, improve investors\u2019 ability to evaluate risks from secondary market activity, lower yields they demand, and thus promote a further increase in secondary market sales. Second, increased AMBS issuance could help Farmer Mac realize economies of scale\u2014a condition where average costs decline as output (i.e., in this case, loan purchase and other secondary market activity) increases.  Farmer Mac is a relatively small corporation operating in a secondary market activity often characterized as exhibiting economies of scale.  Therefore, the direct impact of expansions in Farmer Mac purchases could indirectly cause further expansion in the presence of economies of scale.", "In the future, the relative importance of FCS institutions and commercial banks in making agricultural mortgage loans could have an effect on Farmer Mac\u2019s expansion. Commercial banks compete with FCS institutions in the primary mortgage market. However, because they are GSEs, FCS institutions (1) are less likely to rely on Farmer Mac to help them manage interest-rate risk than would commercial banks and (2) have been less likely to participate in Farmer Mac programs than commercial banks.  If commercial banks continue to be more likely to sell their agricultural mortgages to Farmer Mac than FCS institutions, Farmer Mac\u2019s expansion could be better served by an expansion in the share of agricultural mortgages originated by commercial banks. FCA has announced changes in its regulatory policies and practices that are intended to increase competition among FCS institutions. If this increased competition increases efficiency, improvements in the ability of FCS institutions to compete with commercial banks could result.  If this, in turn, would lead to an increase in FCS\u2019 share of the primary market for agricultural mortgages, Farmer Mac\u2019s growth potential could be constrained.", "The purpose of establishing a risk-based capital standard for Farmer Mac is to help ensure that its capital is aligned with the risks of its financial activities, including potential risks to taxpayers. Congress has recognized the role of risk-based capital standards in mitigating the risk to taxpayers from GSE financial activities. FCA has a congressional mandate to establish risk-based capital standards for Farmer Mac no sooner than February 1999. FCA must develop a stress test that exposes Farmer Mac to statutorily specified interest-rate and credit stresses. For example, the credit stress must be based on the worst credit conditions experienced by a region of the country accounting for at least 5 percent of the nation\u2019s population. FCA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in 1998 seeking comments on its possible use of loan credit performance data for the Farm Credit Bank of Texas in developing the capital standard. FCA plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in 1999 seeking comments on its proposed risk-based capital standards for Farmer Mac.", "As of December 31, 1998, Farmer Mac held regulatory capital of $80.7 million, $30.5 million in excess of its regulatory minimum capital requirement of $50.2 million. Farmer Mac has stated that it does not expect the risk-based capital standards will require it to raise additional capital. However, in the long-term, the risk-based requirements could become more difficult to meet and, under such circumstances, Farmer Mac may need to make adjustments to its book of business or raise more capital to meet the standard. In such a situation, shareholders would likely require compensation for any additional equity investments. In turn, Farmer Mac\u2019s funding costs could rise, and, therefore, its growth could be reduced. This possibility, in which Farmer Mac may be called upon to raise capital to mitigate risk to taxpayers from Farmer Mac\u2019s financial activities, illustrates that Farmer Mac\u2019s viability under current capital standards is not necessarily the proper basis for judging the benefits and costs of government sponsorship."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Value Created From Government Sponsorship of Farmer Mac Depends on Activities of Other GSEs", "paragraphs": ["Government sponsorship of a financial institution can generate a number of public benefits and costs, which are difficult to quantify.

The net benefits and costs also depend on how Farmer Mac\u2019s activities interact with those of the two other GSEs FCS and the FHLBank System.", "Government sponsorship of a financial institution can generate a number of benefits. To the degree that lower funding costs and other benefits are passed on to borrowers in the affected financial sector, public benefits are generated. The special purpose charters can also provide GSEs with motivation to make investments that enhance efficiency in the affected financial sector. For example, GSEs that create secondary markets have incentives to make investments that facilitate standardization. In a 1996 report, we found that government sponsorship of the housing enterprises was associated with lower interest rates on single-family residential mortgages, and that the enterprises increased efficiency through greater standardization of mortgage products and processes. Government sponsorship of Farmer Mac has the potential, if it remains viable and continues to grow, to generate benefits through loan programs and products that help agricultural lenders manage risks.", "Government sponsorship also generates potential public costs. One potential cost is that taxpayers could be called upon if a GSE is unable to meet its financial obligations. Such a situation occurred in the late 1980s when FCS encountered financial difficulties. Opportunity costs can also be generated when the implied backing of certain financial institutions diverts funding from other financial institutions that may be able to serve the sector more efficiently.  For example, the possibility is present that government sponsorship of Farmer Mac could reduce the incentives of other financial institutions to develop secondary market products of value to agricultural lenders.  In addition, opportunity costs can also be generated when implied backing of financial institutions serving a specific sector diverts funding from other sectors.", "As previously discussed, one limitation on Farmer Mac\u2019s growth could be its inability to reach a size sufficient to generate economies of scale. One approach to improving its growth potential could be to expand Farmer Mac\u2019s charter beyond agricultural mortgages, for example, to other rural and agricultural loans. While such an expansion could increase the scope of potential benefits generated by Farmer Mac, it could also increase potential costs and could affect both FCS and the FHLBank System.", "The financial performance and benefits provided by FCS and the FHLBank System affects Farmer Mac and are affected by Farmer Mac\u2019s charter authorities and activities. For example, Farmer Mac\u2019s current programs and products provide an alternative-funding source for agricultural mortgage lenders, such as commercial banks that compete with FCS institutions in the primary mortgage market. The AgVantage Program competes with FHLBank advances to rural lending institutions. In July 1998, the FHLBank System\u2019s regulator (the Federal Housing Finance Board) authorized mortgages on farm properties on which a residence is located and constitutes an integral part of the property, as collateral for advances received by FHLBank member institutions with total assets of $500 million or less.

Farmer Mac has also standardized some aspects of the secondary market transaction by requiring participating agricultural mortgage lenders to make representations and warranties that their loans meet Farmer Mac underwriting standards, but Farmer Mac has not standardized loan documents because state laws governing agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural lending practices vary. In addition, Farmer Mac employs risk management techniques to measure and manage its various risks and to help ensure that Farmer Mac conducts its secondary market operations in a safe and sound manner. We noted that elements of Farmer Mac\u2019s risk management techniques appeared to be generally consistent with industry risk management principles.

It appears that Farmer Mac can be viable if it continues to expand, it experiences returns that are comparable to current levels, and economic conditions in the overall and agricultural economies of the nation remain stable.

First, although our analysis shows that Farmer Mac is currently viable in its agricultural mortgage mission activities, its growth potential in the secondary market for agricultural mortgage and the prospects for realizing that potential are unclear.  Since its restructuring resulting from the 1996 Act, Farmer Mac has experienced a favorable interest-rate environment that has contributed to profitability for financial institutions in general.  Perhaps of greater importance, its agricultural mortgage-servicing portfolio has not been subject to major credit stress, such as a prolonged increase in default rates.  Therefore, its ability to manage interest-rate and credit risks under stressful conditions has not been tested since the 1996 Act.", "In addition, while Farmer Mac competes in various ways with FCS institutions and the FHLBank System, interaction between Farmer Mac and FCS institutions is subject to countervailing forces.  On the one hand, as we explain in this report, FCS institutions have access to GSE-issued debt, and, therefore, FCS institutions may not have the same incentives as banks to sell mortgages to Farmer Mac to manage interest-rate risk. If banks remain more likely than FCS institutions to use Farmer Mac\u2019s products, the possibility of an expanded presence in agricultural lending (i.e., directly or indirectly) by FCS or the FHLBank System, as explained in this report, could lessen potential benefits to be generated by Farmer Mac. On the other hand, Farmer Mac has completed transactions with FCS institutions, but its limited experience to date is not sufficient to establish the likelihood of any future trend for its business with FCS. In addition, a more expansive definition of eligible mortgages on farm properties as collateral for FHLBank advances has increased the potential for competition between Farmer Mac\u2019s AgVantage Program with FHLBank advances.  Since 64 percent of Farmer Mac approved sellers responding to our survey indicated that they were also members of the FHLBank System, the potential for overlap between GSE programs is significant.  Because there is overlap in the three GSEs\u2019 activities, it is not clear how much value is added by a given GSE\u2019s existence that would not be generated by the others in its absence.", "Most importantly, viability is not necessarily the only proper measure of the benefits and costs of government sponsorship.  At some places in its comments, Farmer Mac appears to imply that viability is sufficient to indicate that its public benefits are greater than its public costs, although the viability measure does suggest that broader benefits might result from increased lender competition and wider availability of credit.  There are a number of public costs and benefits that are not included in the viability measure.  For example, due to potential liabilities and opportunity costs associated with government sponsorship, it is possible that the public cost generated by Farmer Mac activities may exceed its private cost. One potential public cost is that taxpayers could be called upon if a GSE is unable to meet its financial obligations. Opportunity costs can also be generated when the implied backing of certain financial institutions diverts funding from other financial institutions that may be able to serve the sector more efficiently. These potential costs resulting from government sponsorship of Farmer Mac cannot be statistically estimated.", "Farmer Mac also stated that a broader standard than economic results, focusing on the secondary market\u2019s contribution to increased lender competition and wider availability of agricultural mortgage credit, would be a more appropriate measure of public benefits than viability.  To the extent that Farmer Mac develops unique programs and processes that improve the efficiency of agricultural mortgage markets, public benefits from such functions can exceed economic returns to Farmer Mac (i.e., spillover public benefits can be created). However, in activities where the GSEs provide similar or overlapping functions, market shifts among the GSEs are less likely to generate such spillover benefits. In the absence of statistical measures of lender competition and agricultural mortgage availability, these potential benefits also cannot be statistically estimated. In light of the measurement difficulties of the potential costs and potential benefits and the difficulty in predicting Farmer Mac\u2019s growth potential, we reached the conclusion that it is difficult to determine whether the net public benefits resulting from government sponsorship of Farmer Mac justify continued government sponsorship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Farmer Mac\u2019s Market Penetration to That of the Housing Enterprises", "paragraphs": ["Farmer Mac said that our draft report misleadingly compared Farmer Mac\u2019s market penetration to that of the housing enterprises during different time frames.

However, we believe that these market penetration comparisons, especially with multifamily residential mortgages, provide useful perspective in analyzing Farmer Mac\u2019s development.  In making these comparisons, we were not suggesting that Farmer Mac should mirror the market penetration levels achieved by the housing enterprises in their first decade of operations.  Nor were we suggesting that Farmer Mac should be expected to reach the market penetration levels reached by the housing enterprises in the long-term.  For example, the possibly greater heterogeneity of borrowing farm operators and of farm properties serving as collateral for agricultural mortgages, even in comparison to multifamily residential mortgages, could lead to a different long-term outcome. We have revised the report to clarify our purpose in making these market penetration comparisons.", "Farmer Mac was established as a GSE in 1988, and the 1996 Act made Farmer Mac\u2019s operating structure essentially the same as Freddie Mac\u2019s and Fannie Mae\u2019s.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became GSEs in 1968 and 1970, respectively.  Prior to 1968, Fannie Mae was a government corporation.  Freddie Mac was one of the first financial institutions in the nation to develop the ability to buy loans, form loan pools, and issue securities backed by loan pools.  Fannie Mae began to issue securities backed by loan pools in the 1980s. As stated in this report, the housing enterprises did not enter the conventional multifamily market until 1983.", "In relation to differences in operating charters, Farmer Mac\u2019s original charter was more limited than the housing enterprises\u2019 charters in that it created the necessity to operate through third-party poolers and establish a mandatory reserve or subordinated interest in its guarantee function. The housing enterprises did not have these constraints.  However, Farmer Mac also had advantages during its first decade of operations compared to the housing enterprises during their first decade of aspirations as GSEs. Farmer Mac had the benefit of learning from the experiences of the housing enterprises, because it began operations in 1988, after the housing enterprises had developed the securitization concept for residential mortgages.  In the 1990s, Farmer Mac also had the benefit of observing and learning from the dramatic expansion in securitization of residential mortgages and other financial assets.", "While, Fannie Mae had been a government corporation before it was established as a GSE, this advantage was limited, because it became a GSE and continued as one for over a decade before it securitized residential mortgages.  Regarding available resources to foster secondary market development, the housing enterprises initially focused their available resources on establishment of a secondary market in single-family rather than multifamily residential mortgage loans.

As discussed in the remaining text in this appendix, we took steps to minimize the extent of such errors.", "Surveys may be subject to coverage error. Coverage error occurs when the sampling frame does not fully represent the target population of interest. For our seller survey, Farmer Mac gave us a list of approved sellers as of October 1998, but we did not verify this list nor did we necessarily capture all sellers approved after that date but before our survey ended. Because the nonparticipant sample was uniquely defined as those institutions that Farmer Mac was targeting as possible candidates for membership, it would not be subject to coverage error as commonly defined.", "Measurement errors are defined as differences between the reported and true value of a characteristic under study. Such errors can arise from differences in how questions are interpreted by respondents, deficiencies in the sources of information available to respondents, the misreporting by respondents, or poorly designed questions. We received expert review of our survey questionnaire from a nationally recognized survey firm retained by Farmer Mac. We also conducted pretests with sampled respondents to minimize such measurement errors.", "Nonresponse error arises when surveys are unsuccessful in obtaining any information from eligible elements or fail to get valid answers to individual questions on returned questionnaires. To the extent that those not providing information would have provided significantly different information from those that did respond, bias from nonresponse can also result. Because the seriousness of this type of error is often proportional to the level of missing data, response rates are commonly used as indirect measures of nonresponse error. We took steps to maximize response rates, such as multiple mailings and telephone calls to convert nonrespondents. In addition, during telephone follow up with 17 nonrespondents, we asked them why they had not yet responded, and none of the answers indicated that they held beliefs that could be associated with extreme questionnaire answers that would differ substantially from those who did respond.", "Finally, surveys may be subject to processing error in data entry, processing, and analysis. We verified the accuracy of a small sample of keypunched records by comparing them to their corresponding questionnaires, and we corrected errors found.

We discussed Farmer Mac\u2019s accomplishments and growth throughout this report. 2.  Farmer Mac suggested that instead of total assets, we use earning assets, a slightly smaller number, in constructing our scenarios on its future viability.  Additionally, it was suggested that we use 63 basis points to calculate net interest income since it was the 1998 yield on the average balance of earning assets.  These suggested changes have been incorporated into the scenario calculations.  Farmer Mac also disagreed with the approach used in the economic scenarios in which we include return on equity as an opportunity cost.  Farmer Mac referred to our approach as a novel concept not supported by generally accepted accounting principles.  We measured long-term viability using an economic rather than an accounting definition of profit.  This approach requires equity investors to receive a rate of return to compensate them for the opportunity cost of equity investment.  The approach is based on accepted principles used in economics and finance. 3. In its comments, Farmer Mac stated that under both of our scenarios, Farmer Mac meets our viability test.  Further, Farmer Mac said its track record is that of a growing and innovative company, and it reiterated the positive findings of our survey results.  Among those who participated, 73 percent of the approved sellers said they are likely to increase sales to Farmer Mac in the next 3 years; and about one-fourth of nonparticipants expect to begin participating in Farmer Mac programs in the next 3 years. To put these findings in perspective, we have clarified our report to show that these findings represent inclinations of lenders\u2019 future actions, which could enhance agricultural secondary market activity, but only to the extent that they are carried out. 4.  Farmer Mac stated that a significant portion of the draft report is written with the use of the phrase \u201cis to\u201d as if to suggest that the matters under discussion are to be, but have not yet been, implemented. We use \u201cis to\u201d in cases where we have not verified the actions.  In cases where we reviewed documents verifying that action had been taken, the text of the report has been changed to reflect that the respective action was taken. 5.  Farmer Mac took issue with a statement that secondary market entities have relatively less ability than lenders to rely on borrower relationships to assess credit risk.  The comment cited standards Farmer Mac has in place for underwriting, appraisal, and field servicers.  We added qualifying language that is based on Farmer Mac\u2019s comment. 6.  Farmer Mac asked that we clarify its position concerning the standardization of loan documents.  The President and Chief Executive Officer of Farmer Mac stated that it is not Farmer Mac\u2019s position that further standardization lacks merit, but that the costs to Farmer Mac of achieving further standardization of loan documents exceed the benefits of doing so at this time.  We have incorporated this position into the report. 7. Farmer Mac stated that it monitors delinquency rates on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis.  The report now reflects this change. Additionally, in commenting on our report, Farmer Mac referred to our statement that \u201cFarmer Mac does not have a history of loan performance data, so it uses the historical loan loss data of a FCS  institution\u201d for loss estimation purposes, and  noted that it does maintain an extensive loan information database on all loans it purchases.  We added qualifying language to our report to address this comment. 8.  Farmer Mac took issue with our statement that it contracts out certain functions where it lacks in-house expertise.  In its response, Farmer Mac stated that it was a business decision to contract out certain functions to take advantage of the experience and efficiency of outside resources.  The report has been revised accordingly. 9.  In its comment letter, Farmer Mac noted that the draft report incorrectly stated that Farmer Mac does not incorporate credit scoring into its loan approval process.  We revised the text to note that Farmer Mac does use credit scoring in connection with the credit approval process, but not as a determinative factor for credit approval. 10. Farmer Mac took issue with our statement that if the decline in the constant dollar value of agricultural mortgage debt continues, it could directly affect Farmer Mac\u2019s growth potential.  Farmer Mac stated the opinion that it would have significant opportunity even if decline in agricultural debt occurred.  Farmer Mac\u2019s rate of growth could be affected to some extent by the size of the overall market.
