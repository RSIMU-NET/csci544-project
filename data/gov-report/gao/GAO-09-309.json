GAO was asked to determine (1) the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under Titles III and V and characteristics of students served; (2) any challenges grantees face, and how they spent Title III and V funds to address these challenges; and (3) the extent to which the Department of Education (Education) monitors the financial and programmatic performance of grantees, and uses this information to target its technical assistance. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from a representative sample of grant applications and annual performance reports for the entire population of fiscal year 2006 grantees. GAO also interviewed officials from Education and 27 grantee institutions, and conducted financial site visits at other 7 grantee institutions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-eight percent of all 2-year and 4-year public and private, not-for-profit institutions are eligible to receive Title III and V grants. Eligible institutions had fewer resources, including endowment holdings and revenue from tuition and fees, and lower per student spending on equipment than ineligible institutions. Eligible institutions also served more students who were minority, low-income, and attended part-time. In their grant applications, Title III and V grantees reported challenges in all four grant focus areas: academic quality, student support, institutional management, and fiscal stability. Grantees reported spending almost $385 million in fiscal year 2006 grant funds to address challenges in these areas, primarily to strengthen academic quality and student support services. Specifically, grantees reported using 43 percent of grant funds on efforts designed to improve academic quality, such as using the latest technology in the classroom and improving academic space. Efforts to improve student support services, including remedial courses, tutoring, and academic counseling represented about one-third of grantee expenditures. While nearly all grantees reported challenges related to strengthening institutional management and fiscal stability, expenditures in these areas represented less than one-quarter of all grant funds spent. Since GAO reported and made recommendations on the management of these programs in 2004 and 2007, Education has continued to take steps to improve monitoring, but many of its initiatives have not been completed. Education has made recent progress in developing an electronic monitoring system and risk-based criteria to improve monitoring, but it discontinued the use of annual plans to guide its efforts. Also, limited progress in addressing staff skill gaps and substantial declines in site visits to grantees has impeded Education's ability to adequately monitor grantees. Because Education lacks a comprehensive approach to target monitoring, it lacks assurance that grantees appropriately manage federal funds, increasing the potential for fraud, waste, or abuse. For example, GAO identified more than $100,000 in questionable expenditures at one grantee institution, including student trips to locations such as resorts and amusement parks, and an airplane global positioning system. Education provides limited technical assistance to grantees, but it has not developed a systematic approach that targets the needs of grantees. For example, some grantees told GAO that Education could strengthen grantee performance by sharing more information regarding common implementation challenges and successful projects. Additionally, GAO found that Education's ability to target technical assistance is limited because its current approach for obtaining feedback does not encourage candor, and it does not use the feedback it currently receives from grantees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With more than two-thirds of 2008 high school graduates estimated to  enroll in college soon after graduating, higher education has become more  accessible than ever before. Yet students from some demographic groups  still face challenges in attending college. For example, in 2006 only half of  low-income students enrolled in college soon after completing high  school, compared to 80 percent of students from high-income families.  Similarly, African American and Hispanic high school graduates enrolled  at lower rates than white students, and those who do enroll are at greater  risk of dropping out before earning a degree or certificate than other  students. Given current population projections showing the proportion of  college-age minorities may increase by as much as 54 percent for some  minority groups over the next decade, the federal government has a  continuing interest in ensuring the needs of these students are met.", "Beginning in 1965, Congress enacted several grant programs under the  Higher Education Act (HEA) to strengthen and support developing  postsecondary institutions. In subsequent reauthorizations, Congress  expanded the HEA to include programs that support institutions that  provide low-income and minority students with access to higher  education. These programs have been authorized under Title III and Title  V of the HEA, as amended. Institutions eligible to receive these grants  include Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving  institutions, Tribal colleges and universities, Alaska Native-serving  institutions, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and other  undergraduate postsecondary institutions that serve low-income students.  In fiscal year 2008, $667 million in grants were awarded to over 500  institutions. Under the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) program  guidance, participating institutions are allowed to spend these grants on  challenges in four focus areas: academic quality, student support services,  institutional management, and fiscal stability. Within these areas, activities  might include renovating existing buildings to upgrade technological  capacity, providing remedial classes or tutoring, developing faculty, or  building endowments, among others.", "In 2004 and 2007, we reported on Education\u2019s administration of Title III  and V programs and found that it had made limited progress in  implementing initiatives to enhance monitoring of and technical assistance  for grantees. In this requested report, we address the following  questions:(1) what are the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive  grants under Titles III and V, including the characteristics of students  served; (2) what challenges do grantees face, and how have they spent  Title III and V funds to address these challenges; and (3) to what extent  does the Department of Education monitor the financial and  programmatic performance of Title III and V grantees, and use this  information to target its technical assistance?", "To describe the characteristics of postsecondary institutions eligible to  receive grants under Titles III and V and the characteristics of their  students, we analyzed the most recent data available from Education data  systems. Specifically, we analyzed 2006 data from Education\u2019s Integrated  Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to identify institutions  eligible to receive Title III and V grants and to describe both institutional  and student characteristics.", "We also analyzed data from Education\u2019s 2004 National Postsecondary  Student Aid Study (NPSAS) to provide additional insight into student  characteristics. Because NPSAS data are based on a representative  sample of students enrolled in postsecondary education, it does not  include the universe of institutions as reported in IPEDS. As a result, it is  not possible to discuss the NPSAS data in terms of eligible and ineligible  institutions, as can be done with IPEDS data. Instead, when discussing  NPSAS data, we refer to minority serving and non-minority serving  institutions. While only Historically Black Colleges and Universities,  Hispanic-serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges are classified as minority  serving institutions for NPSAS, these data are the most complete source of  information on the characteristics of students attending minority serving  institutions. We determined that IPEDS and NPSAS data are sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report by testing it for accuracy and  completeness, reviewing documentation about systems used to produce  the data, and interviewing agency officials. We also conducted a review of  the literature to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of  minority serving institutions and the students they serve. To describe the  challenges that grantees face and how they used grant funds to address  these challenges, we reviewed grant applications and annual performance  reports. Specifically, we conducted a content analysis of grant applications  using a representative sample of 78 of the 511 fiscal year 2006 grantees,  allowing us to generalize our findings to the entire population of grantees  with a 95 percent degree of confidence. Additionally, we analyzed data  from annual performance reports detailing expenditures of fiscal year 2006  grant funds\u2014the most recent data available\u2014for 503 of 511 fiscal year  2006 grantees that submitted these data electronically. We also  interviewed officials from 27 grantee institutions\u2014including 11 conducted  on-site\u2014about the challenges they face and their experiences with the  grant programs. We selected this nonprobability sample based on program  participation, size of grant, and geographic location. To determine how  Education monitors and provides technical assistance, we conducted  interviews with officials at Education and reviewed grant program  requirements, policies, procedure manuals, and monitoring plans. Finally,  we conducted additional site visits at seven grantee institutions to evaluate  their fiscal policies and internal control practices, and determine whether  program funds were properly used. These institutions were selected using  a nonprobability sample based on factors such as program participation,  size of grant, and geographic location. A more detailed explanation of our  methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 through June  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In 1965,  Congress authorized grant programs to strengthen and support  developing postsecondary institutions, leading to today\u2019s Strengthening  Institutions Program. This program provides discretionary grants to help  institutions that serve large numbers of low-income students improve their  academic quality, institutional management, and fiscal stability. In  subsequent reauthorizations, Congress established several programs to  target grant funding to certain institutions that serve large numbers of  minority students. Specifically, in 1986, a program was created to  designate formula grant funding for historically black colleges and  universities. In 1998, further amendments to the HEA created new grant  programs specifically for tribally controlled colleges and universities,  Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and Hispanic- serving institutions. Prior to these amendments, these institutions  competed for funding under the Strengthening Institutions program.  Collectively, these institutions are referred to as minority serving  institutions.", "Institutions that participate in the Historically Black Colleges and  Universities and Tribal programs receive mandatory grants based on two  distinct formulas. Institutions that participate in all other programs  receive grants based on a ranking of applications by a competitive peer- review evaluation. Such institutions may apply individually or as part of a  cooperative partnership for development grants to develop capacity in  specified areas on selected campuses. Institutions that receive cooperative  grants partner and share resources with another postsecondary  institution\u2014which may or may not be eligible for Title III or V funding\u2014to  achieve common goals without costly duplication of effort. In addition to  5-year individual development and cooperative grants, Title III, Part A and  Title V institutions may apply for a 1-year grant for the purposes of  planning an application for a 5-year grant, 1-year construction grant, or 1- year renovation grant. Table 1 briefly describes the characteristics and  eligibility criteria of Title III and V programs.", "From fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2008, total appropriations for these  programs increased from $230 million to $667 million. In fiscal year 2008,  the range of new annual institutional awards was $172,560 for a 1-year  planning grant to $3 million for an individual development grant (see table  2).", "The HEA outlines broad goals for Title III and V programs to strengthen  participating institutions but provides institutions flexibility in deciding  what approaches will best meet their needs. An institution can use the  grants to focus on one or more activities to address the challenges  articulated in its comprehensive development plan, which is required as  part of the grant application and must include the institution\u2019s strategy for  achieving growth and self-sufficiency. Under Education\u2019s program  guidance, institutions are allowed to address challenges in four broad  focus areas: academic quality, student support services, institutional  management, and fiscal stability. More specifically, funds can be used for  activities such as supporting faculty development; purchasing library  books, periodicals, and other educational materials; hiring tutors or  counselors for students; improving educational facilities; or building  endowments. Although each Title III and V program allows funds to be  used in the same broad areas, there are variations in the rules for  allowable activities across each of the Title III and V programs (see   table 3).", "Title III and V programs are administered by the Institutional Development  and Undergraduate Education Service (IDUES) within Education\u2019s Office  of Postsecondary Education (OPE). In addition to the Title III and V  programs we examine in this report, IDUES administers the Strengthening  Historically Black Graduate Institutions, Minority Science and Engineering  Improvement, and the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships programs.  Additionally, in 2007, IDUES assumed responsibility for several new grant  programs for other categories of minority serving institutions, including  Native American-serving Nontribal Institutions and Asian American and  Native American Pacific Islander-serving Institutions.

About one-half of all eligible institutions are 2-year colleges, such  as community colleges, compared to 31 percent of 2-year institutions that  are ineligible to participate in the programs (see table 5). The substantial  representation of 2-year public institutions that are eligible to participate  in the programs appears to amplify some of the overall differences in both  institutional and student characteristics between eligible and ineligible  populations discussed throughout this section.", "Overall, eligible institutions had access to fewer revenue sources,  including endowment holdings and tuition and fees, to serve their  students. Endowments provide additional funds for activities, such as  providing scholarships and constructing facilities, which would be  unaffordable if institutions relied solely on tuition, private philanthropic  gifts, or government funding. The median per-student endowment holdings  at eligible institutions were lower than the holdings of their ineligible  peers. For example, the median per-student endowment for eligible 4-year  private, not-for-profit institutions was nearly three times less per student  ($7,297) than the median for ineligible 4-year private, not-for-profit  institutions ($20,391). Another major source of revenue for institutions is  the tuition and fees charged to students. For all eligible institutions, the  median tuition and fees reported were lower than what was reported at  ineligible institutions. Median tuition and fees at eligible institutions were  12 percent less than at ineligible institutions for 2-year private, not-for- profit institutions, and 38 percent less at 4-year private, not-for-profit  institutions.", "Lower revenues may limit an institution\u2019s ability to undertake activities  that build institutional capacity, such as improving campus facilities and  enhancing academic offerings. In 2006, per-student spending on  instructional equipment at eligible institutions was almost 47 percent less  than spending at ineligible institutions. Eligible institutions also spent  almost 60 percent less per student on expenses related to day-to-day  operations, such as financial aid and registration, and about two times less  per student on certain services, such as providing technology in  classrooms and activities related to student life and development.", "While eligible institutions had lower revenues and per-student spending,  they more often had admissions policies associated with the enrollment of  students who need greater academic support. Research has shown that  students attending institutions that accept any student who applies for  admission\u2014known as open-enrollment institutions\u2014are less likely to be  prepared to successfully undertake college-level coursework. About 60  percent of eligible institutions had open enrollment, compared to 35  percent of ineligible institutions. Almost all 2-year public institutions\u2014 both eligible and ineligible\u2014reported open enrollment policies, which is  consistent with the mission most community colleges have to work with  students of all ability levels. Open-enrollment policies were much less  common at eligible 4-year institutions. Less than 30 percent of these  schools had open enrollment, but it was still more prevalent than at  ineligible 4-year institutions, of which 10 percent or less had such policies.", "Limited revenues may also impact the ability of eligible institutions to  meet the demand of future students based on population projections.  Specifically, about two-thirds of eligible institutions are located in  southern and western states, many of which are projected to experience  an increase in the number of college-age students in coming years (see fig.  1). Studies also project long-term growth in the number of minority and  low-income high school graduates in these two regions beginning in 2015  and extending through 2022, driven in part by accelerated growth in the  Hispanic population. Given the importance many students enrolled at  minority-serving institutions place on geographic proximity to home when  choosing a college, eligible institutions in high-growth states could  experience proportionately more growth in numbers of students and  changes in the demographics of the college-age population may result in  an expansion in the number of eligible institutions. For example, a 2008  Education study found that in some states including Texas, Arkansas, and  North Carolina, over 80 percent of entering freshmen are state residents.  Additionally, Education\u2019s 2004 NPSAS survey found that 80 percent of  students enrolled at Hispanic-serving institutions and almost 73 percent of  students enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities stated  that geographic location was a key reason for selecting their  postsecondary institution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligible Institutions Enrolled More Minority and Low-Income Students Than Ineligible Institutions", "paragraphs": ["On average, eligible institutions enrolled more minority students than  ineligible institutions. In 2006, about one-half of all students enrolled at  eligible institutions were minority, compared to about one-quarter at  ineligible institutions (see fig. 2). While eligible institutions represent 28  percent of all postsecondary institutions, they enrolled over 43 percent of  all minority students. Eligible institutions were largely comprised of the  minority group associated with their program eligibility. For example, at  Historically Black Colleges and Universities the predominant student  population was African American, and at Hispanic-serving institutions, it  was Hispanic. Almost 60 percent of all students enrolled at eligible and  ineligible institutions were women.", "Eligible institutions also served more low-income students, a central  requirement for participation in Title III and V programs. Specifically, 44  percent of students enrolled at eligible institutions received Pell grants  compared to 26 percent at ineligible institutions. In addition, eligible  institutions reported that half of all first-time, full-time students enrolled  received some form of federal student aid, compared to 25 percent of  students enrolled at ineligible institutions.", "Students at eligible institutions also may have characteristics that put  them at academic risk, including attending part-time and delaying their  enrollment following high school. In 2006, 47 percent of students at  eligible institutions attended part-time compared with 34 percent of  students at ineligible institutions. This difference is largely driven by the  substantial proportion of 2-year public institutions in the eligible  population. At both eligible and ineligible 2-year public institutions, more  than 60 percent of students attended part-time. In particular, about two- thirds of students attending both eligible and ineligible 2-year public,  Hispanic-serving institutions attended part-time. At 4-year institutions,  rates of part-time attendance were much lower. However, eligible  institutions enrolled more part-time students than ineligible institutions: 29  percent of students at eligible 4-year public institutions attended part-time,  compared to 19 percent at ineligible 4-year public institutions. One  possible explanation for the difference in part-time enrollment may be  related to the extent to which a student works while enrolled. According  to Education\u2019s 2004 NPSAS survey, almost 40 percent of students  attending minority serving institutions worked 35 hours or more per week  and considered themselves as employees enrolled in college instead of  students who work, when compared to students attending non-minority  serving institutions.", "A greater percentage of students at eligible institutions delayed enrollment  in college than students at ineligible institutions. Research has shown,  however, that students who delay enrollment are at greater risk of not  completing a postsecondary credential, as compared to their peers who  enroll soon after completing high school. At 4-year private, not-for profit  institutions, for example, 34 percent of students at eligible institutions  compared to 21 percent at ineligible institutions enrolled in college for the  first time when 25 or older. Rates at 2-year public colleges were similar  with more than 40 percent of students at eligible and ineligible institutions  enrolling for the first time at age 25 or older. One exception to this trend  among eligible institutions was students at Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, where almost three-quarters of the students enroll right after  high school.", "Eligible institutions had lower retention rates, on average, than ineligible  institutions. For example, in 2006, eligible institutions retained 60 percent  of their full-time students compared to 69 percent at other institutions.  Research has shown that a number of factors, including attending part- time, working full-time, and delaying enrollment in college for more than a  year after high-school, put students at a greater risk of leaving  postsecondary education without a credential. The retention rate for 2- year public institutions was lower, but similar, at eligible and ineligible  institutions. Graduation rates were lower as well. Specifically, 39 percent  of students at eligible 4-year institutions received a bachelor\u2019s degree  within 6 years of enrolling, compared to 60 percent of students at ineligible  4-year institutions. According to a recent Education study, graduation  rates may decline as the percentage of an institution\u2019s low-income student  population increases. This may be for a variety of reasons, including a  student\u2019s academic preparation, working full-time while enrolled, parents\u2019  educational attainment, as well as an institution\u2019s selectivity in admissions.  However, the report also found that several highly selective minority  serving institutions enrolled a significant number of low-income students  and were high performers with respect to graduation. Another possible  explanation for the difference in graduation rates may also be tied to  institutional expenditures. One study reported that those institutions with  lower expenditures on student support services had lower graduation  rates. Graduation rates for both eligible and ineligible 2-year public  institutions were similar; however, the relevance of graduation rates at 2- year institutions has been widely debated since students may enroll in  these institutions for a variety of reasons other than completing a degree  or certificate program.

Such an approach would include implementing  formal monitoring and technical assistance plans based on risk models  and developing written procedures for providing technical assistance.  When we previously reported on Education\u2019s management of the programs  in 2004, the department had begun several initiatives to improve  monitoring, including the development of annual monitoring plans to  identify potential risk with grants and guide the work of program staff.  However, we found that the lack of progress it made in implementing  these initiatives had resulted in uneven monitoring of Title III and V  grantees. Accordingly, we recommended that Education take steps to  ensure its monitoring plans were carried out and targeted toward at-risk  grantees by completing its electronic monitoring system and training  programs.

The  redesigned system brings together information about an institution\u2019s  performance in managing its entire portfolio of higher education grants,  increasing Education\u2019s ability to assess the risk of grantee noncompliance  with program rules. Program officers can also enter updates about a  grantee\u2019s performance in the system, based on routine interactions with  the grantee. According to Education officials, this information can be used  to reflect real-time information about institutional behavior. Because the  system integrates financial and programmatic data, such as institutional  drawdown of grant funds and annual performance reports, staff will have  ready access to information needed to perform monitoring tasks. Given  that each program officer is responsible for managing around 50 grants,  electronic monitoring, if fully integrated into the oversight activities of  program staff, has the potential to improve the quality and consistency of  monitoring.", "Another feature of the system is a monitoring index, implemented in 2008,  that determines an institution\u2019s need for heightened monitoring or  technical assistance based on nine weighted criteria designed to assess  risk related to an institution\u2019s ability to manage its grants (see fig. 5). For  example, an institution that has lost accreditation (30 percent of the  index) or has grants totaling more than $30 million (5 percent of the index)  is automatically prioritized for heightened monitoring, which may involve  site visits or other contacts with the school. Education has identified over  130 institutions across all higher education grant programs for heightened  monitoring, of which 43 percent participate in the Title III and V programs.  Education officials said they will review the criteria and make revisions, as  necessary, to better assess risk.", "While Education has made recent progress in automating its monitoring  tools and developing risk-based criteria, it lacks a coordinated approach to  guide its monitoring efforts. Specifically, Education officials told us they  discontinued the development of annual monitoring and technical  assistance plans for Title III and V programs, one of the initiatives that we  reported on in 2004. In 2002, Education directed each program within the  agency to develop a monitoring plan to place greater emphasis on  performance monitoring for all grantees. In addition to asking whether  grantees were achieving results, program officials were also to consider  what assistance Education could provide to help grantees accomplish  program objectives and incorporate an increased departmental emphasis  on compliance with the law into their planning. Education developed a  plan for Title III and V programs that called for staff to (1) conduct risk  assessments, (2) perform a minimum number of site visits each year, and  (3) follow up with grantees regarding their performance reports. However,  in 2006, Education rescinded the requirement for each program office to  submit annual monitoring plans because the practice did not achieve its  intended purpose of better targeting its monitoring resources.

We were unable to fully  determine the nature or quality of these site visits because Education  could not account for most of the reports required to document site visit  findings. Additionally, since the issuance of our 2004 report, which found  that about three-quarters of the program staff were not meeting the  requirement to complete at least two site visits per year, Education has  discontinued the two site visit requirement. Instead Education officials  said they have changed the focus to improve the quality of monitoring by  relying on the risk criteria to target grantees most in need of site visits to  make the best use of the department\u2019s limited resources.", "One former senior Education official told us that site visits had declined  because the program office has limited staff and few have the requisite  skills to conduct financial site visits. According to Education, the OPE  office responsible for administering Title III and V grant programs  currently has 32 staff to monitor more than 1,000 grants across its assigned  programs, compared to 2003 when it had 38 staff responsible for  approximately 750 grants. To address concerns that program officers do  not have the right skill mix to conduct comprehensive site visits, OPE\u2019s  program oversight staff assumed responsibility for conducting site visits  for Title III and V programs in 2008. However, because the office is  responsible for conducting site visits across more than 40 higher  education grant programs, the number of Title III and V grantees it can  visit will be limited. In fiscal year 2008, for example, five site visits that  program oversight staff conducted were to Title III grant recipients.", "With the implementation of an electronic monitoring system and risk- based monitoring index, Education now has tools to enhance its ability to  select grantees for site visits. However, officials said that aside from  referrals from the Inspector General, the criteria they used in selecting  schools for fiscal year 2008 and 2009 site visits was the total amount of  higher education grants awarded (i.e., grantees receiving $30 million or  more), which represents only 5 percent of the monitoring index criteria. In  fiscal year 2008, this limited criteria resulted in a narrow subset of schools  being visited, with four of the five site visits being made to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities. Ideally, Education\u2019s risk-based approach  would consider not only grant amounts, but also the full list of weighted  criteria on its monitoring index, along with other factors such as grant  program participation and institution type to ensure that risk is considered  across each of the grant programs and a mix of schools are visited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Training", "paragraphs": ["Education has made progress in developing grant monitoring courses to  enhance the skills of Title III and V program staff, but skill gaps remain  and limit the ability of program staff to fully carry out their monitoring and  technical assistance responsibilities.

Senior officials at Education we spoke to also identified critical areas  where additional training is needed.

Specifically, a review of grant  disbursement records for Grantee D revealed spending with no clear  linkage to the grant and instances in which accounting procedures were  bypassed by grant staff at the institution. Of the questionable expenditures  we identified, $88,195 was attributed to an activity designed to promote  character and leadership development. Of that amount, we found that the  institution used more than $79,975 to pay for numerous student trips to  locations such as resorts and amusement parks. According to the grant  agreement, the funds were to be used for student service learning projects.  Additionally, $4,578 in grant funds was used to purchase an airplane global  positioning system even though the school did not own an airplane. Over  $6,000 of grant funds was used to purchase a desk and chair (see fig. 6). In  purchasing the global positioning system and office furniture, a school  official split the payments on an institutionally issued purchase card to  circumvent limits established by the institution. Officials at the institution  ignored multiple warnings about mismanagement of this activity from  external evaluators hired to review the grant. Education visited the school  in 2006 but found no problems, and recommended we visit the institution  as an example of a model grantee. We referred the problems we noted at  this institution to Education\u2019s Inspector General for further investigation.", "Examples of the questionable expenditures we identified at three other  institutions we visited follow:    We were unable to complete testing for about $147,000 of grant fund  transactions at Grantee A due to a lack of readily available supporting  documentation. For one transaction that was fully documented, the  grantee improperly used $2,127 in grant funds to pay late fees assessed to  the college. Once we pointed out that grant funds cannot be used for this  purpose, the college took corrective action by writing a check to  reimburse the grant.", "Grantee B used $27,530 to prepay subscription and contract services that  would be delivered after the grant expired.", "Grantee F used more than $1,500 in grant funds to purchase fast food and  over $4,800 to purchase t-shirts for students.", "We presented Education with the results of our analysis supporting each  of our findings related to our grantee visits, and senior officials expressed  commitment to follow up on each of the findings in coordination with  grantees.", "The annual performance reports that grantees are required to submit to  receive continued funding provide a key tool for monitoring grantee  performance, but we found evidence that the program office is not  consistently reviewing these reports. In reviewing seven annual  performance reports that fiscal year 2006 grantees submitted late, we  found six that lacked detail, provided inaccurate information, or were  incomplete. For example, one grantee reported that 80 percent ($2.3  million) of total funds allotted for the year were committed to \u201cother  unspecified activities\u201d instead of clearly listing how the funds were spent,  as required. Another institution in the final year of its grant submitted a  report that was mostly blank, but it was counted as complete by program  staff until we pointed out the discrepancy. The lack of information  provided by the institution limits OPE\u2019s ability to follow administrative  requirements for closing the grant, and it also significantly impairs its  ability to understand the impact federal funds had on this particular  campus or whether funds were used appropriately. Education  subsequently requested that the school finalize its performance report a  full year after it was originally due.

According to one senior Education official,  technical assistance is generally provided to Title III and V grantees on a  case-by-case basis at the discretion of program officers. There are no  particular criteria to determine when a program officer should provide  technical assistance. For example, officials at a few of the institutions we  spoke to told us that Education should provide technical assistance  whenever the grant administration staff at an institution changes. Another  senior Education official said that technical assistance should be provided  when annual performance reports show numerous grantees experiencing  similar problems, or if program officers receive numerous calls on a  particular issue. Since we found evidence that program staff may not  consistently review these reports, the extent to which this type of follow- up is occurring is unclear.", "According to grantees we interviewed, the technical assistance Education  provides is not consistent throughout the grant cycle. Specifically, several  officials from schools at which we conducted interviews were  complimentary of the technical assistance Education provided when they  were applying for grants. Some of those officials, however, noted a  precipitous drop in assistance during the first year after grants were  awarded when grantees often need help with implementation challenges,  such as recruiting and retaining highly qualified staff, securing matching  funds for endowments, and overcoming construction delays. In the past,  grantees had an opportunity to address such challenges at annual  conferences sponsored by Education, but these conferences have not been  held since 2006. Nearly 40 percent of the 113 grantees that provided  comments in their annual performance reports requested that Education  resume providing the conferences on a regular basis. According to  Education officials, resource constraints have prevented them from  holding the conferences, but plans are under way to hold a conference in  fall 2009. Since Education stopped convening conferences, schools, and in  some cases higher education advocacy groups, have hosted conferences at  which Education staff participated. For example, five conferences or  workshops held for the Title V program in 2008 were hosted by schools or  advocacy groups. Officials from a few schools we interviewed said it is  important for Education to take the lead in planning conferences to ensure  that grantees receive information that is consistent with program rules.  They also noted that when conferences were held in locations such as  Washington D.C., participation could be expensive and suggested  Education consider holding regional conferences to make it more  affordable for grantees to attend.", "Officials from about half of the schools and some officials from advocacy  groups we interviewed also reported that Education could strengthen  grantee performance by more broadly disseminating information about  successful projects. Education has included limited information on its  Web site about six current and past projects. However, the information for  each project is maintained on the specific Title III or V program pages,  rather than being presented in a centralized location for the benefit of all  grantees. For example, one of the projects that highlighted student  retention efforts at a Native Hawaiian institution, a topic that has wide  applicability across the grant programs, was only located at the  Strengthening Institutions Program Web site. Additionally, this Web  information did not consistently include contact information to allow  interested schools to contact the featured grantees. School officials said  such information sharing would provide lessons learned from similar  projects and better leverage the federal investment. For example, an  official at a 2-year Strengthening Institutions grantee in North Carolina  told us he independently identified a contact at a Title III grantee to  discuss the application process, but suggested that a clearinghouse of  successful projects would be helpful for connecting institutions with  similar challenges.", "As we reported in 2004 and 2007, Education\u2019s ability to target technical  assistance is also limited in that the annual performance reports used to  obtain feedback about program improvements may discourage candor  because the reports identify grantees and are used to make continued  funding decisions. The department also does not readily use the feedback  it obtains from grantees to improve the programs. In 2004, we  recommended that Education use appropriately collected feedback from  grantees to target its technical assistance. While Education agreed with  the recommendation and officials said they were considering ways to  obtain feedback separate from the annual performance reporting process,  Education continues to rely on these reports to obtain feedback.  Education has separate feedback mechanisms in place to measure  customer satisfaction and gauge the need for program improvement for  some of its other programs. One senior Education official said the  current process for obtaining feedback is adequate for assessing the needs  of Title III and V grantees. However, our review of the annual performance  ercent  reports that fiscal year 2006 grantees submitted found that only 22 p provided feedback. Additionally, a representative from the contractor  responsible for compiling information from the reports said that the  narrative data\u2014where feedback from grantees can be found\u2014is not  summarized for Education. The 113 grantees that provided feedback in  these reports made a number of suggestions for improving the program,  including requests for improved communications from Education,  consistency in timing of events and reporting requirements, re-establishing  annual conferences for grantees, and clarifying program regulations. For  instance, Education has posted program regulations on its Web site, but 61  of 113 grantees that provided feedback specifically requested that  Education clarify the regulations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the current challenges low-income and minority serving institutions  face, and the projected growth in the college-age population, Title III and V  funds will continue to play an integral role in helping these institutions  address some of their most critical needs.

Education\u2019s role in monitoring and  providing assistance to Title III and V grantees is critical to ensuring that  the substantial investment the federal government makes in these  programs leads to improvements in institutional capacity and student  outcomes. When we reviewed the management of these programs in 2004  and 2007, Education had begun several initiatives to improve its  monitoring and assistance.

Previously, we  recommended that the Secretary of Education take steps to ensure that  monitoring and technical assistance plans are carried out and targeted to  at-risk grantees and the needs of grantees guide the technical assistance  offered. At the core of such an approach, which Education has not fully  implemented, would be plans to guide its monitoring and technical  assistance efforts following a thorough assessment of the risk and needs  of grantees. Such an approach would also ensure that more information is  shared among grantees about common implementation challenges and  successful projects to better leverage the considerable federal investment,  and ensure that grantees have an opportunity to provide feedback on areas  for program improvement.
