Examples of key DCAA actions to date include the following. (1) Eliminating production metrics and implementing new metrics intended to focus on achieving quality audits. (2) Establishing an anonymous Web site to address management and hotline issues. DCAA's Assistant Director for Operations has been proactive in handling internal DCAA Web site hotline complaints. (3) Revising policy guidance to address auditor independence, assure management involvement in key decisions, and address audit quality issues. DCAA also took action to halt auditor participation in nonaudit services that posed independence concerns. In addition to correcting the fundamental weaknesses in DCAA's mission and overall management environment, we believe certain legislative measures as well as other actions could enhance DCAA's effectiveness and independence. For example, granting DCAA certain authorities and protections--similar to those offered to presidentially appointed inspectors general (IG) under the IG Act--could enhance DCAA's independence.

Our current report, which the Committee is  releasing today, presents the results of our DCAA-wide audit, including (1)  an assessment of DCAA\u2019s management environment and quality assurance  structure; (2) an analysis of DCAA\u2019s corrective actions in response to our  July 2008 report and two DOD reviews, and (3) potential legislative and  other actions that could improve DCAA\u2019s effectiveness and independence.", "To assess DCAA\u2019s overall management environment and quality assurance  structure, we analyzed DCAA\u2019s mission statement and strategic plan,  performance metrics, policies and audit guidance, and system of quality  control. We also reviewed audit documentation for 69 selected audits and  cost-related assignments at certain field audit offices (FAO) in each of  DCAA\u2019s five regions for compliance with generally accepted government  auditing standards (GAGAS) and other applicable standards. We selected  37 audits of contractor internal control systems performed by seven  geographically disperse DCAA field offices within the five DCAA regions  during fiscal years 2004 through 2006. Our approach focused on DCAA  offices that reported predominately adequate, or \u201cclean,\u201d opinions on  audits of contractor internal controls over cost accounting, billing, and  cost estimating systems issued in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.  We did this  because contracting officers rely on these opinions for 3 or more years to  make decisions on pricing and contract awards, and payment. For  example, audits of estimating system controls support negotiation of fair  and reasonable prices. Also, the FAR requires contractors to have an  adequate accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursable or other  flexibly priced contract. Billing system internal control audit results  support decisions to authorize contractors to submit invoices directly to  DOD and other federal agency disbursing offices for payment without  government review. Because DCAA uses the results of internal control  audits to assess risk and plan the nature, extent, and timing of tests for  other contractor audits and assignments, the conclusions and opinions in  these audits impact hundreds of other DCAA audits. At the same seven  DCAA field offices, we selected an additional 32 cost-related assignments  for review, including 16 paid voucher reviews, 10 overpayment  assignments, 2 requests for equitable adjustment audits, and 4 incurred  cost audits that were completed during fiscal years 2004 through 2006. We  reviewed supporting documentation for the cost-related assignments to  determine whether DCAA auditors were identifying and reporting  contractor overpayments and billing errors.", "To assess DCAA corrective actions, we reviewed the status and analyzed  several key actions that DCAA initiated as a result of our earlier  investigation, including changes in performance metrics and policy and  procedural guidance, as well as DCAA efforts in response to DOD  Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Defense Business Board  recommendations. To identify potential legislative and other actions that  could improve DCAA\u2019s effectiveness and independence, we considered  DCAA\u2019s current role and responsibilities; the framework of statutory  authority for auditor independence in the Inspector General Act of 1978,  as amended; best practices of leading organizations that have made  cultural and organizational transformations; our past work on DCAA  organizational alternatives; GAGAS criteria for auditor integrity,  objectivity, and independence; and GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government on managerial leadership and oversight.", "Throughout our audit, we met with the DCAA Director and DCAA  headquarters policy, quality assurance, and operations officials and DCAA  region and FAO managers, supervisors, and auditors. We also met with  DOD Office of Inspector General (OIG) auditors responsible for DCAA  audit oversight and DOD OIG hotline office staff. In addition, we met with  the former DOD Comptroller/CFO to discuss plans for the Office of  Comptroller/CFO and Defense Business Board reviews, and we continued  to meet with and obtain information from the new DOD Comptroller/CFO  and his staff. We also met with the Comptroller\u2019s new DCAA Oversight  Committee. We conducted our performance audit from August 2006  through December 2007, at which time we suspended this work to  complete our investigation of hotline allegations regarding audits  performed at three DCAA field offices. We resumed our work on the  performance audit in October 2008 and performed additional work  through mid-September 2009 to evaluate DCAA\u2019s quality assurance  program during fiscal years 2007 and 2008, assess DCAA corrective actions  on identified audit quality weaknesses, and consider legislative and  organizational placement options for DCAA. We conducted our  performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We performed our  investigative procedures in accordance with quality standards set forth by  the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (formerly  the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency).", "Today, I will summarize the results of our audit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Widespread Management Environment and Audit Quality Problems", "paragraphs": ["We found audit quality problems at DCAA offices nationwide. Of the 69  audits and cost-related assignments we reviewed, 65 exhibited serious  GAGAS or other deficiencies similar to those found in our investigation,  including compromise of auditor independence, insufficient audit testing,  and inadequate planning and supervision. Although not as serious, the  remaining four audits also had GAGAS compliance problems. In addition,  while DCAA did not consider 26 of the 32 cost-related assignments we  reviewed to be GAGAS audits, DCAA did not perform sufficient testing to  support reported conclusions on that work. According to DCAA officials,  DCAA rescinded 80 audit reports related to our prior investigation as well  as the audit leading to today\u2019s report because the audit evidence was  outdated, insufficient, or inconsistent with reported conclusions and  opinions and reliance on the reports for contracting decisions could pose a  problem. About one third of the rescinded reports relate to unsupported  opinions on contractor internal controls and were used as the basis for  risk-assessments and planning on subsequent internal control and cost- related audits. Other rescinded reports relate to Cost Accounting  Standards (CAS) compliance and contract pricing decisions. Because the  conclusions and opinions in the rescinded reports were used to assess risk  in planning subsequent audits, they impact the reliability of hundreds of  other audits and contracting decisions covering billions of dollars in DOD  expenditures.", "A management environment and agency culture that focused on  facilitating the award of contracts and an ineffective audit quality  assurance structure are at the root of the agencywide audit failures we  identified. DCAA\u2019s focus on a production-oriented mission led DCAA  management to establish policies, procedures, and training that  emphasized performing a large quantity of audits to support contracting  decisions and gave inadequate attention to performing quality audits. An  ineffective quality assurance structure, whereby DCAA gave passing  scores to deficient audits compounded this problem.", "Although the reports for all 37 audits of contractor internal controls that  we reviewed stated that the audits were performed in accordance with  GAGAS, we found GAGAS compliance issues with all of these audits. The  issues or themes are consistent with those identified in our prior  investigation.", "Lack of independence. In seven audits, independence was compromised  because auditors provided material nonaudit services to a contractor they  later audited; experienced access to records problems that were not fully  resolved; and significantly delayed report issuance, which allowed the  contractors to resolve cited deficiencies so that they were not cited in the  audit reports. GAGAS state that auditors should be free from influences  that restrict access to records or that improperly modify audit scope.", "Insufficient testing. Thirty-three of 37 internal control audits did not  include sufficient testing of internal controls to support auditor  conclusions and opinions. GAGAS for examination-level attestation  engagements require that sufficient evidence be obtained to provide a  reasonable basis for the conclusion that is expressed in the report. For  internal control audits, which are relied on for 2 to 4 years and sometimes  longer, the auditors would be expected to test a representative selection of  transactions across the year and not transactions for just one day, one  month, or a couple of months. However, we found that for many  controls, the procedures performed consisted of documenting the  auditors\u2019 understanding of controls, and the auditors did not test the  effectiveness of the implementation and operation of controls.", "Unsupported opinions. The lack of sufficient support for the audit  opinions on 33 of the 37 internal control audits we reviewed rendered  them unreliable for decision making on contract awards, direct-billing  privileges, the reliability of cost estimates, and reported direct cost and  indirect cost rates. For example, we found that:    For many controls, DCAA did not perform any testing at all. For  example, audits of contractor accounting systems do not include any  transaction testing. Instead, these audits focus on a review of the  adequacy of contractor policies and procedures. At least six of the nine  accounting audits we reviewed did not include procedures for  confirming contractor segregation of allowable and unallowable cost.", "DCAA issued an adequate opinion on the accounting system for a  major DOD contractor after performing a walkthrough of the  accounting process and interviewing two employees.", "In billing system audits we reviewed, DCAA auditors often tested only  two, three, or sometimes five transactions to support audit conclusions  on contractor systems and related internal controls. Further, the  auditors performed limited procedures such as determining whether  the vouchers were mathematically correct and included current and  cumulative billed amounts. Twenty of the 22 billing system audits we  reviewed did not include tests to identify duplicate invoices.", "DCAA auditors reported on the adequacy of a contractor\u2019s billing  system based on tests of four vouchers, all issued on the same day.", "In an audit of controls over indirect and other direct cost for a business  segment of one of the top five DOD contractors, DCAA auditors tested  12 out of about 22,000 transactions processed from May through July  2005.", "We also found that reports did not adequately disclose the criteria used in  performing individual audits. According to GAGAS, audit reports should,  among other matters, identify the subject matter being reported and the  criteria used to evaluate the subject matter. Criteria identify the required  or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation  and provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding the  findings. None of the 37 internal control audit reports we reviewed cited  specific criteria used in individual audits. Instead, the reports uniformly  used boilerplate language to state that DCAA audited for compliance with  the \u201cFAR, CAS, DFARS, and contract terms.\u201d As a result the user of the  report does not know the specific Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),  Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), or contract terms used as criteria to  test contractor controls. This makes it difficult for users of the reports to  determine whether the reports provide the level of assurance needed to  make contracting decisions.  Similarly, the 32 cost-related assignments we reviewed did not contain  sufficient testing to provide reasonable assurance that overpayments and  billing errors that might have occurred were identified. As a result, there is  little assurance that any such errors, if they occurred, were corrected and  that related improper contract payments, if any, were refunded or credited  to the government. Contractors are responsible for ensuring that their  billings reflect fair and reasonable prices and contain only allowable costs,  and taxpayers expect DCAA to review these billings to provide reasonable  assurance that the government is not paying more than it should for goods  and services.  We identified the following problems with these  assignments.", "Paid voucher reviews. DCAA performs annual testing of paid vouchers  (invoices) to determine if contractor voucher preparation procedures are  adequate for continued contractor participation in the direct-bill  program. Under the direct-bill program, contractors may submit their  invoices directly to the DOD disbursing officer for payment without  further review. Although DCAA does not consider its reviews of contractor  paid vouchers to be GAGAS engagements, it has not determined what  standards, if any, apply to these assignments. In addition, for the 16 paid  voucher assignments we reviewed, we found that DCAA auditors failed to  comply with DCAA Contract Audit Manual (CAM) guidance. Rather than  documenting the population of vouchers, preparing sampling plans, and  testing a random (statistical) sample, auditors generally did not identify  the population of vouchers, did not create sampling plans, and made a  small, nonrepresentative selection of as few as one or two invoices for  testing to support conclusions on their work. The auditors performed  limited procedures such as determining whether the vouchers were  mathematically correct and included current and cumulative billed  amounts. Based on this limited work, the auditors concluded that controls  over invoice preparation were sufficient to support approval of the  contractors\u2019 direct billing privileges. This is of particular concern because  we determined that Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)  certifying officers rely on DCAA voucher reviews, and they do not repeat  review procedures they believe to be performed by DCAA.", "Overpayment assignments. DCAA performs overpayment assignments  to verify that contractors have billing procedures and internal controls in  place to identify and resolve contractor billing errors and overpayments in  a timely manner. DCAA guidance states that these engagements should be  conducted in accordance with GAGAS to the extent applicable under the  circumstances. However, none of the 10 overpayment assignments we  reviewed were performed or reported as GAGAS engagements. We found  that auditor judgments about the population and selection of transactions  for these assignments did not provide a representative universe for testing  and concluding on contractor controls over billings and payments  received. For example, for the 10 assignments we assessed, the auditors  selectively reviewed an accounts receivable aging report to identify  overpayments and determine if they had been resolved. As a result, this  work does not provide reasonable assurance that contractors have  adequate controls in place to identify and correct overpayments and  billing errors and make appropriate, timely refunds and adjustments.", "Incurred cost audits. The purpose of incurred cost audits is to examine  contractors\u2019 cost representations and opine on whether the costs are  allowable, allocable to government contracts, and reasonable in  accordance with the contract and applicable government acquisition  regulations.  DCAA performs these audits as GAGAS attestation  engagements. For the four incurred cost audits we reviewed, we found  that the auditors did not adequately document their judgments about  control risk or the sampling and test methodologies used. In addition, we  found that the auditors traced claimed pool and base costs (indirect costs)  to the contractors\u2019 accounting books and records to determine their  accuracy and allowability. However, the auditors did not perform  sufficient, detailed testing of claimed indirect and direct costs. For  example, the auditors traced and reconciled indirect costs to contractor  accounting system data, but did not test a representative selection of  direct costs. As a result, the scope of work performed was not sufficient to  identify claimed costs, if any, that were not adequately supported or  unallowable costs, if any, that should have been questioned.", "Production environment and audit quality issues. DCAA\u2019s mission  statement, strategic plan, and metrics all focused on producing a large  number of audit reports and provided little focus on assuring quality  audits. For example, DCAA\u2019s current approach of performing 30,000 to  35,000 audits and issuing over 22,000 audit reports with 3,600 auditors  substantially contributed to the widespread audit quality problems we  identified. Within this environment, DCAA\u2019s audit quality assurance  program was not properly implemented, resulting in an ineffective quality  control process that accepted audits with significant deficiencies and  noncompliance with GAGAS and DCAA policy. Moreover, even when  DCAA\u2019s quality assurance documentation showed evidence of serious  deficiencies within individual offices, those offices were given satisfactory  ratings. Considering the large number of DCAA audit reports issued  annually and the reliance the contracting and finance communities have  placed on DCAA audit conclusions and opinions, an effective quality  assurance program is key to protecting the public interest. Such a program  would report review findings along with recommendations for any needed  corrective actions; provide training and additional policy guidance, as  appropriate; and perform follow-up reviews to assure that corrective  actions were taken. GAGAS require that each audit organization  performing audits and attestation engagements in accordance with GAGAS  should have a system of quality control that is designed to provide the  audit organization with reasonable assurance that the organization and its  personnel comply with professional standards and applicable legal and  regulatory requirements, and have an external peer review at least once  every 3 years.", "DCAA officials advised us that going forward, DCAA will no longer rate an  FAO\u2019s overall compliance with GAGAS and DOD policy. The officials told  us that instead, DCAA headquarters plans to (1) report the detailed results  of the audit quality reviews, (2) make recommendations to FAOs for any  needed corrective actions, (3) conduct follow-up reviews for all FAOs with  identified audit deficiencies to ensure that corrective actions are taken,  and (4) provide training and policy guidance, as appropriate. If properly  implemented, these procedures would help to assure an effective audit  quality assurance program.", "In addition, the DOD IG reported an adequate (\u201cclean\u201d) opinion on DCAA\u2019s  most recent peer review results although the reported evidence indicated  that numerous audits had serious deficiencies in audit quality. In  conducting DOD\u2019s audit oversight review of DCAA audits, DOD IG audit  oversight reviewers considered the same results of DCAA\u2019s internal audit  quality assurance reviews that we analyzed and reviewed numerous  additional audits, which also identified significant GAGAS noncompliance  as evidenced by DOD IG peer review findings and recommendations.  Although the DOD IG report contained evidence of significant, systemic  noncompliance with professional standards throughout DCAA audits that  OIG staff reviewed and the IG report included numerous findings and  recommendations related to those issues, the DOD IG gave DCAA a  \u201cclean\u201d peer review opinion, concluding that for audits and attestation  engagements performed during fiscal year 2006, \u201c\u2026the internal quality  control system was operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance  that DCAA personnel were following established policies, procedures, and  applicable auditing standards\u2026.\u201d", "The overall report conclusion in the DOD IG report is inconsistent with  the detailed observations in the report, which indicate numerous  significant deficiencies in DCAA\u2019s system of quality control. Furthermore,  of the 80 audit reports that DCAA rescinded, 39 of the rescinded reports  were issued during fiscal year 2006\u2014the period covered by the last DOD  IG peer review. Therefore, we have concluded that DCAA\u2019s quality control  system for the period covered by the last DOD IG peer review was not  effectively designed and implemented to provide assurance that DCAA and  its personnel comply with professional standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DCAA Is Making Progress, but Sustained Leadership and Oversight Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["Although DCAA has taken several positive steps, much more needs to be  done to address widespread audit quality problems. DCAA\u2019s production- oriented culture is deeply imbedded and will likely take several years to  change. Under DCAA\u2019s decentralized management environment, there had  been little headquarters oversight of DCAA regions, as demonstrated by  the nationwide audit quality problems. DCAA\u2019s mission focused primarily  on producing reports to support procurement and contracting community  decisions with no mention of quality audits that serve taxpayer interest.  Further, DCAA\u2019s culture has focused on hiring at the entry level and  promoting from within the agency and most training has been conducted  by agency staff, which has led to an insular culture where there are limited  perspectives on how to make effective organizational changes.", "DCAA corrective actions. DCAA initiated a number of actions to address  findings in our July 2008 report, the DOD Comptroller/CFO August 2008  \u201ctiger team\u201d review, and the Defense Business Board study, which was  officially released in January 2009. Examples of key DCAA actions to date  include the following.", "Eliminating production metrics and implementing new metrics  intended to focus on achieving quality audits.", "Establishing an anonymous Web site to address management and  hotline issues. DCAA\u2019s Assistant Director for Operations has been  proactive in handling internal DCAA Web site hotline complaints.", "Revising policy guidance to address auditor independence, assure  management involvement in key decisions, and address audit quality  issues. DCAA also took action to halt auditor participation in nonaudit  services that posed independence concerns.", "Further, DCAA has enlisted assistance from other agencies to develop a  human capital strategic plan, assist in cultural transformation, and  conduct a staffing study. In March 2009, the new DCAA Comptroller/CFO  established a DCAA Oversight Committee to monitor and advise on DCAA  corrective actions.", "While these are positive actions, other DCAA actions have focused on  process improvements, and DCAA has not yet addressed the fundamental  weaknesses in its mission, strategic plan, audit approach, and human  capital practices.", "Although DCAA is making progress, we are concerned that DCAA actions  to date evidence some of the past cultural problems that could limit their  success. For example, DCAA identified the following six new performance  metrics as focusing on the intended outcome-related goal of achieving  quality audits that comply with GAGAS.  1.  Obtaining an unqualified DOD IG peer review opinion.  2.  DCAA\u2019s internal quality assurance program results show that 100  percent of the audits reviewed reflected professional judgment.  3.  Checklist confirmation that issued reports did not include serious  deficiencies.  4.  A goal that 45 percent of audit reports will have findings as an  indication of the tangible value of the audit work performed.  5.  A goal that 15 percent of the audits will use quantitative methods to  measure the extent to which advanced level audit techniques are used.  6.  A goal that auditors will meet 100 percent of their continuing  professional education requirements on time.", "Given the problems with DOD IG peer review results and DCAA\u2019s  ineffective quality assurance program, for these metrics to achieve the  intended audit quality goal, significant changes will be needed. DCAA also  retained three performance metrics that address issuing reports within  specified times to support contract awards and closeouts, for example:  1.  A forward-pricing audit timeliness goal of 95 percent based on  agreement with requesters.  2.  Incurred cost audit timeliness goals of 90 percent of corporate audits  completed within 12 months, 90 percent of major contractor audits  completed in 15 months, and 95 percent of non-major contractor audits  completed in 24 months.  3.  An efficiency goal of cost per direct audit hour of less than $113.45 to  be monitored at the agency level only.", "It is critical that agreements with the contracting community on timeliness  goals for forward-pricing and incurred cost audits allow performance of  sufficient audit procedures to help contracting officers ensure that prices  paid by the government are fair and reasonable, and that contract costs  comply with applicable laws, regulations, cost accounting standards, and  contract terms.", "Risk-based audit approach. DCAA did not agree to develop a risk-based  audit approach, as recommended by the Defense Business Board. DCAA  lacks a risk-based audit approach to address how it will perform required  audits with available audit resources, reassess the need to perform 30,000  or more audits annually and the appropriate level of audit resources, and  establish priorities for performing quality audits that meet GAGAS within  available resources. While resources are a key element of a risk-based  planning approach, DCAA is performing the Defense Business Board  recommended staffing study as a stand-alone effort rather than performing  this study in concert with an effort to establish a risk-based planning  process.", "DCAA policy guidance. DCAA\u2019s new policy guidance on adequate audit  documentation and testing does not contain sufficient instruction to  assure that auditors (1) adequately document significant decisions  affecting the audit objectives, scope and methodology, findings,  conclusions, and recommendations and (2) perform sufficient work to  support decisions to approve contractors for direct-bill status. For  example,    DCAA\u2019s new policy on \u201cWorkpaper Documentation of Judgmental  Selections\u201d\u2014requires a description of the universe (population) from  which items are selected for testing, identification of items and  attributes to be tested, and an explanation to support that the  judgmental selection will result in adequate audit coverage.", "Emphasizing the requirement that audit documentation include a  description of the population used for sampling and identification of  items and attributes to be tested is appropriate. However, the  requirement for an explanation in the audit documentation that the  judgmental selection will result in adequate audit coverage needs to be  sufficiently justified. GAGAS and AICPA standards require that  auditors document significant decisions affecting the audit objectives,  scope and methodology, findings, conclusions, and recommendations  resulting from professional judgment.", "DCAA\u2019s new policy on \u201cAudit Guidance for Annual Testing of  Contractor Eligibility for Direct Bill\u201d is intended to determine whether  continued reliance can be placed on the contractor\u2019s procedures for  preparation of interim vouchers. This policy change clarified and  consolidated audit steps related to the contractor\u2019s compliance with  contract provisions, added audit steps for reviewing vouchers under  time-and-material and labor-hour contracts, and removed the  requirement to verify that the contractor\u2019s Central Contractor  Registration is current. The policy memorandum states that this scope  of work performed does not constitute an audit or attestation  engagement under GAGAS.", "While it is within DCAA\u2019s purview to determine whether these  procedures constitute an audit, because direct-bill decisions present a  risk of undetected improper contract payments, prudent decisions to  continue a contractor\u2019s direct-bill authorization would necessarily be  based on testing a statistical sample of invoices and include a review  of supporting documentation, including documentation to confirm the  government received goods and services noted on the billing invoice.  We confirmed that Defense Finance and Accounting Service certifying  officers rely on DCAA reviews and that they do not repeat review  procedures they believe to be performed by DCAA.", "In addition, DCAA\u2019s policy to eliminate the \u201cinadequate-in-part\u201d opinion  for contractor internal control systems audits does not recognize different  levels of severity of control deficiencies and weaknesses and could  unfairly penalize contractors whose systems have less severe deficiencies  by giving them the same opinion\u2014\u201dinadequate\u201d\u2014as contractors having  material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that in combination would  constitute a material weakness.

The IG Act contains provisions that enhance the  independence of presidentially appointed IGs, including protections from  removal without congressional notification, access to independent legal  counsel, public reporting of audit results, rights to take statements from  contractor and other personnel, and budget visibility. These provisions  would enhance the important DCAA initiatives currently under way. In the  longer term, Congress could consider changes in organizational placement  after DCAA has had sufficient opportunity to effectively implement  current reform efforts.

We view DOD comments as being generally responsive  to the intent of our recommendations.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that DCAA consult  with DOD stakeholders and engage outside experts to develop a risk- based contract audit approach that identifies resource requirements and  focuses on performing quality audits that meet GAGAS. DOD stated that  DCAA already has a risk-based contract audit approach that identifies  resource requirements and focuses on performing quality audits that meet  GAGAS. However, DOD stated that DCAA will coordinate with the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD  (AT&L)) to assess DCAA audit requirements. DOD expects to complete  its assessment of stakeholder needs based on regulatory and statutory  requirements by December 2010.", "We appreciate these steps; however, we remain concerned that DCAA\u2019s  current approach of performing 30,000 to 35,000 audits and issuing over  22,000 audit reports with 3,600 auditors substantially contributed to the  widespread audit quality problems we identified. Generating that many  reports and doing that many audits with 3,600 auditors leaves very little  time to perform in-depth, complex audits of contractors.", "DOD did not concur on our recommendation to develop policies and  procedures related to direct-billing decisions, stating that (1) the  department believes that a review of the contractor\u2019s interim public  vouchers is an integral function of DCAA\u2019s continued assessment of a  contractor\u2019s billing system, (2) DCAA is in the best position to review and  approve contract interim billings based on its thorough understanding of  the contractor\u2019s system, (3) DOD believes that our concerns are mitigated  based on comprehensive supervisory and audit manager reviews, and (4)  DCAA does not believe that the approval of interim vouchers along with  the approval for contractors to be on direct billing results in a lack of  auditor objectivity.", "We continue to believe that DCAA\u2019s management (nonaudit) responsibility  to perform prepayment reviews of contractor vouchers for DOD and the  auditor\u2019s decision-making role of approving contractors for direct-billing  privileges based on its audit conclusions about the strength of the  contractor\u2019s system of internal controls, create audit objectivity issues.  Under normal circumstances, DCAA auditors must review contractor  vouchers prior to payment\u2014a management support function for DOD. By  obtaining direct-billing privileges, however, contractors can receive  payment for goods and services without a voucher review by DCAA prior  to payment. Because we found that this situation created an incentive for  DCAA to reduce its workload by recommending that contractors are  placed on direct billing, we recommended that DCAA develop new policies  and procedures to ensure a separation between staff reviewing vouchers  and staff making direct-bill decisions. DCAA did not explain the basis for  its belief that DCAA administrative staff have a thorough understanding of  the contractors\u2019 systems. Further, we disagree with DOD\u2019s statement that  our concerns are mitigated based on the comprehensive supervisory and  audit manager reviews because this is not supported by our findings. The  fact that DCAA approvals of contractor direct-bill privileges were not  based on sufficient audit procedures as demonstrated by our work and  DCAA\u2019s removal of over 200 contractors from the direct-bill program since  our July 2008 report support our concern that the existence of such an  incentive presents an objectivity impairment.", "With regard to our two recommendations to the DOD IG, the IG concurred  on our recommendation to reconsider the overall conclusions in its May  2007 peer review report on its audit of DCAA\u2019s system of quality control.  However, the IG did not agree with our recommendation to determine  whether the report should be rescinded or modified and did not take  action to do so. The IG comments stated that the IG took alternative action  that conformed to the intent of our recommendation, including  notification of DCAA on August 24, 2009, that the May 2007 \u201cadequate\u201d  opinion on DCAA\u2019s system of quality control would expire on August 26,  2009. In addition, the IG stated, \u201cWe have determined that it is not prudent  to allow the adequate opinion from our May 2007 report to carry forward.\u201d  However, peer review opinions neither \u201cexpire\u201d nor \u201ccarry forward\u201d  beyond the period covered by the peer review. Based on the significant  audit quality deficiencies identified in the IG peer review report, DCAA\u2019s  decision to rescind 80 audit reports\u201439 of which relate to the period of  the IG\u2019s peer review\u2014and the findings in our audit, we concluded that  DCAA\u2019s quality control system for the period covered by the DOD IG peer  review was not effectively designed and implemented to provide  assurance that DCAA and its personnel comply with professional  standards.", "DOD also provided comments on our matters for congressional  consideration. Although DOD disagreed with the matters we discussed, we  continue to believe these are valid matters for congressional  consideration. The IG Act provides many important authorities and  protections for IG\u2019s that could enhance DCAA\u2019s independence and  effectiveness. Further, if DCAA is unsuccessful in addressing our  recommendations for resolving fundamental weaknesses in its mission  and the overall management environment under the current organizational  placement, additional options would need to be considered.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my  statement.
