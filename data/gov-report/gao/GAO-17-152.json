In support of its mission, CBP operates a fleet of remotely piloted Predator B UAS and uses aerostats, including tactical aerostats and TARS. GAO was asked to review CBP's use of UAS and aerostats for border security.", "This report addresses the following questions: (1) How does CBP use UAS and aerostats for border security activities, and to what extent has CBP developed and documented procedures for UAS coordination? and (2) To what extent has CBP taken actions to assess the effectiveness of its UAS and aerostats for border security activities? GAO reviewed CBP documents; analyzed Predator B UAS, tactical aerostat, and TARS data on use and effectiveness from fiscal years 2013 through 2016; interviewed field and headquarters officials; and conducted site visits to observe CBP's use of UAS and aerostats along U.S. borders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses Predator B unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for a variety of border security activities but could benefit from documented coordination procedures in all operating locations. CBP uses its Predator B UAS to support a variety of efforts, such as missions to support investigations in collaboration with other government agencies (e.g., U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and to locate individuals illegally crossing the border. GAO found that CBP established various mechanisms to coordinate with other agencies for Predator B missions but did not develop and document coordination procedures in two of its three operational centers. Without documented coordination procedures in all operating locations consistent with internal control standards, CBP does not have reasonable assurance that practices in all operating locations align with existing policies and procedures for joint operations with other federal and non-federal government agencies.", "CBP uses aerostats\u2014unmanned buoyant craft tethered to the ground and equipped with video surveillance cameras and radar technology\u2014to support its border security activities along the southern U.S. border. In south Texas, the U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol) uses relocatable tactical aerostats equipped with video surveillance technology to locate and support the interdiction of cross-border illegal activity. At eight fixed sites across the southern U.S. border and in Puerto Rico, CBP uses the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) program to support its efforts to detect occurrences of illegal aircraft and maritime vessel border incursions.", "CBP has taken actions to assess the effectiveness of its UAS and aerostats for border security, but could improve its data collection. CBP collects a variety of data on its use of Predator B UAS, tactical aerostats, and TARS including data on their support for the apprehension of individuals, seizure of drugs, and other events (asset assists). For Predator B UAS, GAO found mission data\u2014such as the names of supported agencies and asset assists for seizures of narcotics\u2014was not recorded consistently across all operational centers, limiting CBP's ability to assess the effectiveness of the program. CBP has not updated its guidance for collecting and recording mission information in its data collection system to include new data elements added since 2014, and it does not have instructions for recording mission information such as asset assists. In addition, not all users of CBP's system have received training for recording mission information. Updating guidance and fully training users, consistent with internal control standards, would help CBP better ensure the quality of data it uses to assess effectiveness. For tactical aerostats, GAO found that Border Patrol collection of asset assist information for seizures and apprehensions does not distinguish between its tactical aerostats and TARS. Consistent with internal control standards, data that distinguishes between support provided by tactical aerostats and support provided by TARS would help CBP collect better and more complete information and guide resource allocation decisions, such as the re-deployment of tactical aerostat sites based on changes in cross-border illegal activity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that CBP document coordination procedures for Predator B operations in all operating locations, update guidance and implement training for collection of Predator B mission data, and update Border Patrol's data collection practices for aerostat asset assists.

CBP is responsible for securing  the U.S. border across nearly 4,000 miles with Canada and 2,000 miles  with Mexico, and CBP law enforcement personnel are responsible for  securing U.S. borders to prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful  movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband across U.S.  borders. To help secure the border, CBP law enforcement personnel use  a variety of technologies, which are critical to their ability to detect and  identify the illegal entry of narcotics and people between ports of entry.  For example, Border Patrol agents use, among other things, towers  equipped with surveillance cameras and radar technology to detect the  illegal entry of people between ports of entry. Along the south Texas  border, Border Patrol also uses tactical aerostats, which are relocatable  unmanned buoyant craft tethered to the ground equipped with video  surveillance cameras.", "In addition to surveillance technologies used by Border Patrol, CBP\u2019s Air  and Marine Operations (AMO) uses its air and maritime assets both  independently and as members of partnerships, task forces, and other  whole-of-government networks, to help detect and identify illegal entrants  and smugglers. AMO\u2019s fleet of air assets includes Predator B unmanned  aerial systems (UAS) equipped with video and radar surveillance  technology to conduct border security efforts. AMO also operates the  Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) program which includes fixed  site, aerostat-based radar systems that provide air surveillance across the  southern U.S. border and in Puerto Rico.

We assessed the reliability of these data by examining data for any  anomalies, reviewing CBP guidance and documents, and interviewing  CBP officials to understand their methods for collecting, reporting, and  validating the data. We found that data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. We compared CBP\u2019s available documentation of  its procedures for coordination of its use of Predator B UAS with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. In addition,  we reviewed provisions included in the Trade Facilitation and Trade  Enforcement Act of 2015 (Trade Facilitation Act) requiring CBP, acting  through AMO, to develop standard operating procedures to provide  command, control, communication, surveillance, and reconnaissance  assistance with UAS, including establishment of a process and procedure  for the submission, approval, prioritization and coordination of air support  requests from non-CBP law enforcement agencies. For tactical  aerostats and TARS, we reviewed CBP documents and information  related to its use of TARS and tactical aerostats for border security  activities.", "To determine the extent to which CBP assesses the effectiveness of  Predator B UAS and aerostats, we reviewed and analyzed CBP  information; asset assist data for seizures, apprehensions, and other  events; and met with responsible CBP program officials. For Predator B  UAS, we analyzed flight hour goal, asset assist, and launch rate data  from fiscal years 2013 through 2016, the time period for which data were  available in CBP\u2019s current system for recording Predator B mission  data. For tactical aerostats, we reviewed operational availability data  and analyzed asset assist data from May 2014 through fiscal year 2016,  the most recent time period for which data were available in CBP data  systems. For TARS, we reviewed operational availability and asset  assist data from fiscal years 2013 through 2016, the time period starting  when CBP assumed control of the program from the Department of  Defense.

First, with regard to the  types of activities for which Predator B aircraft are used, our analysis of  CBP data showed that over 80 percent of Predator B missions were in  support of law enforcement and extended border missions, as shown in  table 1. In particular, about 67 percent of missions were for law  enforcement activities, such as use of Predator B aircraft to locate  individuals illegally crossing the border and provide aerial surveillance  during investigations in joint operations with federal law enforcement  agencies and during special security events like Pope Francis\u2019s visit to  Juarez, Mexico, in February 2016. About 16 percent of missions were in  support of extended border operations, which are operations beyond U.S.  territorial lands and seas in support of federal and international law  enforcement partnerships. For example, CBP uses its Predator B  aircraft for interdiction operations with Joint Interagency Task Force \u2013  South, including maritime patrol missions in the source and transit zones,  which encompass the area from South America through the Caribbean  Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that is used to transport illicit drugs to  the United States (transit zone) from drug producing countries in South  America (source zone). In addition, about 14 percent of missions were  for training, and about 1 percent was for non-enforcement activities, such  as for natural disaster recovery efforts.", "With regard to CBP\u2019s use of Predator B aircraft in support of government  agencies, based on our analysis of CBP data, we found that half of all  Predator B flight hours from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 (51 percent)  were in support of Border Patrol to help, among other things, in its efforts  to detect the illegal entry of goods and people between U.S. ports of  entry. We also found that 32 percent of Predator B flight hours from  fiscal years 2013 through 2016 were in support of AMO, such as for  missions to train AMO UAS pilots. CBP\u2019s Predator B operations in  support of other federal agencies accounted for 15 percent of Predator B  flight hours from fiscal years 2013 through 2016, such as conducting  aerial surveillance for investigations during controlled deliveries of illegal  contraband by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We found  that 2 percent of Predator B flight hours from fiscal years 2013 through  2016 were attributed to support for state and local government agencies.  For example, CBP\u2019s Predator B operations in support of local law  enforcement agencies have included performing aerial surveillance during  officer safety incidents, such as an active shooting incident.", "As part of using Predator B aircraft to support other government  agencies, CBP has established various mechanisms to coordinate  Predator B operations. For example, at NASOCs, personnel from other  CBP components are assigned to support and coordinate mission  activities involving Predator B operations. Border Patrol agents assigned  to support NASOCs assist with directing agents and resources to support  its law enforcement operations and collecting information on asset assists  provided for by Predator B operations. Further, two of DHS\u2019s joint task  forces help coordinate Predator B operations. Specifically, Joint Task  Force \u2013 West, Arizona and Joint Task Force \u2013 West, South Texas  coordinate air asset tasking and operations, including Predator B  operations and assist in the transmission of requests for Predator B  support and communication with local field units during operations, such  as Border Patrol stations and AMO air branches. Further, CBP uses a  dedicated system\u2014called BigPipe\u2014to coordinate Predator B operations.  BigPipe distributes operational mission data to supported federal, state,  and local law enforcement agencies. In particular, BigPipe distributes  real-time and recorded mission information, including information from  sensors on AMO assets, including Predator B aircraft. According to CBP  officials, BigPipe allows for seamless and efficient secure communication  between AMO, Joint Task Force \u2013 West, Arizona, and other locations.", "In addition to these mechanisms, CBP has also documented procedures  for coordinating Predator B operations among its supported or partner  agencies in Arizona specifically by developing a standard operating  procedure for coordination of Predator B operations through its NASOC in  Arizona. These documented procedures include a description of the  responsibilities of participating agencies; procedures for sharing mission  information and collecting asset assist information from supported  agencies related to seizures and apprehensions; and requirements for  reviewing and tasking of air support requests for Predator B aircraft from  non-CBP government agencies. Joint Task Force \u2013 West, Arizona also  created an air integration strategy outlining the surveillance assets and  associated capabilities available to support operations in its AOR,  including a model to guide use of air and ground assets, including  Predator B aircraft and towers equipped with video and radar surveillance  technology. According to CBP officials we met with in Arizona, the  integration strategy, in conjunction with information on surveillance  technology deployment, were used to help plan and prioritize Predator B  patrol missions in areas lacking existing surveillance technology; for  example, along federal and tribal lands in Tucson Border Patrol sector\u2019s  AOR.", "However, CBP has not documented procedures for coordination of  Predator B operations among its supported agencies through its NASOCs  in Texas and North Dakota. CBP has established national policies for its  Predator B operations that include policies for prioritization of Predator B  missions and processes for submission and review of Predator B mission  or air support requests. However, these national policies do not include  coordination procedures specific to Predator B operating locations or  NASOCs, such as local tasking of air support requests to Predator B  versus other aircraft, procedures for sharing mission information across  multiple locations and agencies, and collection and reporting of asset  assist information from supported agencies during and after Predator B  missions. For example in Texas, Predator B operations are coordinated in  part through DHS\u2019s Joint Task Force \u2013 West, South Texas and air support  requests for Predator B aircraft may be submitted by government  agencies to the NASOC in Texas. Without documented coordination  procedures for Predator B operations in Texas, it is not clear how  requests submitted to the NASOC in Texas are reviewed, prioritized, and  coordinated with Joint Task Force \u2013 West, South Texas, including how  both entities reach agreement on requests that may involve competing  priorities.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  significant events should appear in management directives, policies, or  operating manuals to help ensure management\u2019s directives are carried  out as intended. The Trade Facilitation Act also requires that, as part of  standard operating procedures regarding use of UAS, AMO is to develop  a formal procedure to determine how UAS mission requests from non- CBP law enforcement agencies are prioritized and coordinated. Further,  CBP\u2019s strategic plan states that integrating surveillance capabilities into  the planning and execution of law enforcement operations is enabled by  sound standards, procedures, and processes that require interagency  coordination. CBP\u2019s Predator B aircraft are national assets used primarily  for detection and surveillance during law enforcement operations,  independently and in coordination with federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies throughout the United States. AMO officials  acknowledged that developing documented coordination procedures for  Predator B operations in North Dakota and Texas could strengthen  ongoing coordination efforts; however, CBP has not yet taken actions to  develop documented coordination procedures in those operating  locations due to differences across those locations. For example, AMO  officials told us that the current coordination process in Texas, which  relies on direct operator to operator coordination, may be inefficient at  times. Further, AMO officials stated that a coordination process through  Joint Task Force \u2013 West, South Texas is under development and that documented coordination procedures for Predator B operations could  strengthen CBP\u2019s coordination with other government agencies.

Border  Patrol agents operate video surveillance cameras on tactical aerostats in  flight from a local command and control center to detect, identify, monitor,  and track items of interest. For example, Border Patrol agents can  position video surveillance cameras to observe an item of interest such as  a person attempting to illegally enter the United States from Mexico by  crossing the Rio Grande River using a raft. Once an item of interest has  been identified, a Border Patrol agent operating a video surveillance  camera can relay information to other agents through direct land-mobile  radio communication or through a Border Patrol station Tactical  Operations Center.

The Operational Need Statement further stated that video  surveillance cameras on tactical aerostats in flight can enhance  surveillance coverage by increasing the elevation and viewing angle to  overcome obstructions from vegetation and bends in the Rio Grande  River, which limit the use of tower-mounted camera systems. Further,  CBP reported that video surveillance cameras on tactical aerostats can  view items of interest from a distance between 10 to 24 kilometers based  on the type aerostat and altitude of operation.", "Border Patrol agents also use tactical aerostats in south Texas to support  bi-national law enforcement efforts between Border Patrol and the  government of Mexico. Border Patrol officials we met with in south Texas  told us that information from video surveillance cameras on tactical  aerostats shared with the government of Mexico has resulted in seizures  of weapons and narcotics. For example in fiscal years 2014 through  2016, Border Patrol reported over 60,000 pounds of known marijuana  seized by the government of Mexico through assistance provided by  tactical aerostats.", "Border Patrol agents use other surveillance technologies to aid in  identifying items of interest with tactical aerostat video surveillance  cameras. For example, Border Patrol agents may use tactical aerostat  and relocatable tower video surveillance cameras concurrently within  tactical aerostat command and control centers. According to CBP  officials, video surveillance cameras on these towers help to enhance the  coverage area and provide continued coverage when aerostats are not in  flight. Border Patrol agents assigned to tactical aerostat sites are also  able to access information from unattended sensors, which can provide  cueing information to locate items of interest with tactical aerostat video  surveillance cameras.", "Border Patrol plans to use tactical aerostats until Remote Video  Surveillance System technology is deployed in Rio Grande Valley and  Laredo Border Patrol sectors, but is too soon to tell when such technology  will be deployed.

In June 2016, as  part of this study, AMO released a report including analysis of Predator B  aircraft Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER)\u2014a radar  system which collects radar images of moving objects\u2014use along the  U.S-Mexico border in Arizona and proposed performance metrics for  missions involving domain and situational awareness. AMO officials told  us it plans to analyze VADER use along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas  as part of this study starting in fiscal year 2017.", "In addition, in August 2015 DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate  (S&T) initiated a study of CBP\u2019s Predator B program through DHS\u2019s Joint  Requirements Council in partnership with AMO. The purpose of this  study is to (1) identify a recommended number of Predator B aircraft  assigned to operating locations or NASOCs and (2) determine whether  expanding the use of Predator B aircraft is the best use of funds for  border security. The study was initiated in response to the findings of a  2014 DHS Office of Inspector General report on CBP\u2019s Predator B  program and following a January 2015 Acquisition Decision Memorandum  that called for CBP to provide the Joint Requirements Council with  justification for the number of Predator B aircraft and their assignment to  operating locations.", "In September 2016, DHS released a report based on the S&T-led study  that recommended CBP not expand its Predator B program beyond its  current nine aircraft based on challenges identified in the report.  Challenges identified in DHS\u2019s report included, for example, the  availability of UAS pilots and staff to operate, maintain, and repair  Predator B aircraft. According to CBP officials, the agency plans to  resolve the challenges identified by the S&T-led study and maintain the  nine aircraft already in its Predator B program.", "With regard to data on Predator B operations, CBP collects and tracks  data that can help it monitor operational effectiveness, including (1) asset  assists, (2) detections of cross-border illegal activity, (3) the launch rate of  Predator B aircraft (i.e., the percentage of launched versus scheduled  missions), and (4) annual flight hour goals.", "Asset assists. CBP collects and maintains data on known assists for  apprehensions and seizures attributed to support by Predator B  aircraft. According to CBP data provided to us, Predator B aircraft  assisted in the apprehension of 7,951 individuals from fiscal years  2013 through 2016 as shown in table 2. Further, CBP data shows  Predator B aircraft support assisted with the seizure of 9,190 pounds  of cocaine and 223,817 pounds of marijuana from fiscal years 2013  through 2016.", "Detections of cross-border illegal activity. CBP tracks the number  of detections made using VADER equipped on its Predator B aircraft.  CBP began use of VADER at its NASOCs in Arizona in fiscal year  2012 and Texas in fiscal year 2015. In 2014, CBP began collecting  data on the number of individuals detected by VADER in relation to  cross-border illegal activity. Our analysis of CBP data showed that  from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 about 98 percent of these  detections (20,858 of 21,384 detections) were attributed to VADER  used on Predator B aircraft operated from CBP\u2019s NASOC in  Arizona.", "Launch rate. CBP tracks the launch rate of its Predator B aircraft.", "Our analysis of Predator B aircraft launch rate data showed a 69  percent launch rate from fiscal years 2013 through 2016. CBP also  tracks reasons for Predator B mission cancelations. Our analysis of  Predator B mission cancellations found that 20 percent of all Predator  B scheduled missions from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 were  canceled due to weather. We also found that CBP\u2019s NASOC in Texas  had the highest percentage of weather-related mission cancelations  (37 percent) among NASOCs, followed by North Dakota (28 percent)  and Arizona (26 percent), for Predator B missions scheduled from  fiscal years 2013 through 2016. Other reasons identified for  cancellations of scheduled missions from fiscal year 2013 through  2016 include aircraft maintenance (5 percent of scheduled missions)  and lack of available crew (4 percent of scheduled missions), among  others. For more information on the limitations related to CBP\u2019s use of  Predator B aircraft, see appendix III.", "Annual flight hour goals. CBP sets and tracks annual Predator B  program flight hour goals as part of AMO\u2019s annual operational flight  hour planning process. Our analysis of CBP data showed that CBP  met 93 percent of its set flight hour goals from fiscal years 2013  through 2016. For more information on CBP\u2019s Predator B flight hour  goals, see table 3.", "These studies and data collection efforts provide CBP with useful  information for assessing the effectiveness of its Predator B program.  However, CBP could strengthen these efforts by more consistently  recording data on Predator B missions across its operating locations. Our  analysis of CBP data found that users recorded information about  supported agencies and asset assists inconsistently across Predator B  operating locations within its system for recording Predator B mission  data. We found that for law enforcement missions in support of multiple  agencies and part of operations through joint task forces, users did not  consistently record the name of the joint task force supported. For  example, some users listed the supported agency only as \u201djoint task  force\u201d without identifying the task force name, while others identified the  name of the task forces supported.", "Similarly, we found that some users listed one or multiple agencies that  are members of the Joint Interagency Task Force \u2013 South (such as U.S.  Coast Guard or AMO) rather than identifying the task force itself. Users  also misidentified supported agencies for other types of missions. For  example, users did not consistently record AMO as the supported agency  for maintenance and training missions and at times recorded Border  Patrol instead as the supported agency. We also found users did not  consistently record information on asset assists for Predator B missions.  For example, no asset assist information for seizures of narcotics were  recorded for CBP\u2019s NASOC in North Dakota from fiscal years 2013  through 2015 despite participation in law enforcement operations  involving investigations related to the illegal production and distribution of  narcotics. For example in fiscal year 2013, Predator B aircraft launched  from its NASOC in North Dakota provided aerial support for investigations  related to methamphetamine production and marijuana cultivation;  however, as CBP does not consistently record information on asset  assists, it is not known if those investigations resulted in the seizure of  narcotics.", "CBP\u2019s written guidance for recording Predator B mission data has not  been updated since 2014 to include new data variables and system  functions added to its system for recording Predator B mission data.  Further, it does not include definitions and instructions for collecting and  recording information on missions with multiple supported agencies and  asset assists for seizures and apprehensions. According to AMO officials,  guidance for recording Predator B mission information has not been  updated due to resource and time constraints.", "AMO officials at NASOCs responsible for recording Predator B mission  information told us that in the absence of updated guidance from CBP,  they developed local guidance to address changes made to CBP\u2019s  system for recording Predator B mission data. However, according to  AMO officials, not all data are collected and recorded consistently at  NASOCs as a result of differing local guidance. For example, in Arizona,  NASOC officials record multiple supported agencies while NASOC  officials in North Dakota only record the agency submitting the air support  request even if more than one agency is supported. Moreover, according  to AMO officials, not all users across Predator B operating locations have  received training to use its system for recording Predator B mission data.  While AMO has provided training to users responsible for recording  mission information for manned aircraft and vessels in the same system  at its operating locations, such as air branches, according to AMO  officials, no training has been provided at its NASOCs for Predator B  operations. According to AMO officials, a working group of NASOC  officials met in 2015 to discuss Predator B mission data collection across  its NASOCs and identified the need to record data consistently across  operating locations. AMO officials we spoke with told us that limited  resources have affected its ability to develop and implement training  across all Predator B operating locations. According to NASOC officials  responsible for recording Predator B mission information, updated  guidance and training could help ensure data is collected consistently  across locations as its system for recording Predator B mission data is  periodically updated with new features and requirements.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for  pertinent information to be recorded and communicated to management  in a form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out internal  control and other responsibilities. This includes the accurate recording and reporting of data necessary to demonstrate agency operations.  Additionally, internal control standards state that all transactions and  other significant events need to be clearly documented, and the  documentation should be readily available for examination. The  documentation should appear in management directives, administrative  policies, or operating manuals and may be in paper or electronic form.  Without clear guidance and training, users may continue to record  Predator B mission data inconsistently for certain mission variables such  as supported agencies and outcomes for asset assists. As a result, CBP  is not well positioned to capture complete and consistent data from which  to assess the effectiveness of its Predator B program. Updated guidance  and training for users for Predator B mission data collection would help  CBP ensure consistent recording across all Predator B operating  locations to support CBP\u2019s efforts to assess the effectiveness of its  Predator B program.", "We also found that CBP collects additional information on its use of  Predator B aircraft for non-CBP law enforcement agencies, but this  information is not linked to data in its system for recording Predator B  mission data. As mentioned previously, CBP uses Predator B aircraft to  conduct missions in support of a variety of government agencies which  are submitted to AMO as air support or mission requests. AMO  Procedure 2014-07 includes procedures for submission and review of  requests for Predator B aircraft from non-CBP law enforcement agencies  and states that Predator B air support requests provide for oversight to  ensure that mission requests are vetted and prioritized and requires an  electronic archive be kept of all requests. CBP\u2019s procedures require  requests from non-CBP law enforcement agencies for Predator B aircraft  support to be submitted through an air support request form which is  reviewed and approved by CBP. Although CBP has a process for  submission and review of air support requests for Predator B aircraft by  non-CBP law enforcement agencies, these air support request forms are  not recorded in its system for recording Predator B mission data.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes that  internal controls are an integral part of each system that management  uses to regulate and guide its operations, and that communication of  information and control activities are an integral part of an entity\u2019s  planning, implementing, review, and accountability for stewardship of  government resources and achieving effective results. Furthermore, the  standards state that control activities, which include a wide range of  diverse actions and maintenance of related records, need to be clearly  documented and help to ensure that all transactions are completely and  accurately recorded. CBP currently tracks air support request forms  submitted from non-CBP law enforcement agencies for Predator B  missions using a separate internal system. However, by not logging or  recording these requests in its system for recording Predator B mission  data, CBP does not document in a single system complete information  about its use of Predator B aircraft for non-CBP law enforcement  purposes, such as the names of the state and local government agencies  supported, making it more difficult for CBP to analyze its Predator B  mission data.", "While CBP currently documents requests, recording air support request  forms in its system for recording Predator B mission data could allow CBP  to further facilitate implementation of provisions included in the Trade  Facilitation Act by ensuring such requests are documented in the same  system as mission data. Specifically, these provisions require CBP to  develop a process and procedure for the submission, approval,  prioritization and coordination of air support requests from non-CBP law  enforcement agencies for command, control, communication,  surveillance, and reconnaissance assistance through unmanned aerial  systems. By documenting Predator B air support request forms in its  system for recording Predator B mission data, CBP could also better oversee implementation of procedures related to Predator B air support  requests along with mission information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Collects and Tracks Data to Assess Effectiveness of Its Use of Tactical Aerostats, but Could Strengthen its Data Collection Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CBP has conducted two evaluations of tactical aerostats and collects and  tracks data on its use of tactical aerostats. First, with regard to the two  evaluations, CBP conducted these to inform its initial deployment in 2012  and continued use in 2014. In August 2012, CBP, in collaboration with the  Department of Defense, conducted an initial evaluation of the operational  utility of tactical aerostats in Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector.  CBP completed a second evaluation of its use of tactical aerostats in July  2014 to further assess the operational utility and functionality of tactical  aerostats within Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector. The purpose of  the second evaluation was to support Border Patrol\u2019s continued use of  tactical aerostats by examining operational effectiveness and comparison  of capabilities and performance of tactical aerostats compared to other  existing surveillance technology\u2014for example, towers equipped with  video surveillance cameras and ground sensors. CBP concluded that  tactical aerostats enhance Border Patrol\u2019s situational awareness; are  deployable over typical terrain with proper planning and site preparation;  are operable and maintainable in the operational environment; and are a  visual deterrent to transnational criminal organizations. CBP also  concluded that tactical aerostats contributed to its operational  effectiveness and that they provide greater cumulative surveillance  coverage than towers or other ground-based systems.", "Second, with regard to data, CBP collects and tracks data on its use of  tactical aerostats to assess effectiveness, including data on (1)  operational availability (i.e., percentage of time an aerostat is in flight  providing surveillance data to CBP), (2) asset assists for apprehensions  of individuals and seizures of narcotics, and (3) the number of detections  of items of interest.", "Operational availability. According to CBP data provided to us,  tactical aerostat operational availability from May 2015 through fiscal  year 2016 across all sites averaged 62 percent with a range of 51 to  81 percent. CBP set a performance goal of greater than 60 percent for  tactical aerostat operational availability. A variety of factors can  influence operational availability of a tactical aerostat, including  equipment maintenance and weather as aerostat flight is subject to  weather restrictions. See appendix III for more information about  limitations on CBP\u2019s use of tactical aerostats.", "Asset assists. Border Patrol collects and maintains data on known  assists for apprehensions and seizures attributed to support provided  by tactical aerostats. Border Patrol collects data on asset assists for  known seizures and apprehensions using DHS\u2019s Enforcement  Integrated Database (EID), which includes an asset assist data field in  which Border Patrol agents can specify whether an asset, such as a  tower or ground sensor, contributed to the apprehension of individuals  and seizure of drugs and other contraband. In May 2014, CBP  added an asset assist data field in EID to capture known asset assist  data for \u201caerostats\u201d. Our analysis of CBP data showed that a majority  of asset assists attributed to aerostats for the apprehension of  individuals and seizure of narcotics were in Rio Grande Valley Border  Patrol sector from May 2014 through fiscal year 2016. Specifically, 98  and 99 percent of total asset assists for apprehensions of individuals  and seizures of narcotics were recorded in Rio Grande Valley Border  Patrol sector, respectively. For more information on asset assists  attributed to aerostats for seizures of narcotics and apprehension of  individuals, see appendix IV.", "Detections of items of interest. Border Patrol also collects  information on the number of detections of items of interest at each  tactical aerostat site using video surveillance cameras on tactical  aerostats through an internal system. Border Patrol developed a  system for agents operating tactical aerostat surveillance cameras to  record detections made at each site. According to Border Patrol  officials, detections recorded by agents are detections of cross-border  illegal activity and exclude other activities observed through tactical  aerostat surveillance cameras such as recreational activities including  fishing. Table 4 summarizes the number of detections recorded  across all tactical aerostat sites from fiscal years 2014 through 2016.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  agencies should promptly and accurately record transactions to maintain  their relevance and value for management decision making. In  collecting and recording asset assist information, Border Patrol does not  distinguish between tactical aerostats and TARS. Border Patrol issued  guidance in May 2016 to users for recording tactical aerostat asset assist  information in EID, which stated users were to include tactical aerostat  and TARS under the same asset assist data field for aerostat. Without a  separate mechanism to record tactical aerostat asset assists, users could  potentially misidentify asset assist information related to tactical aerostats  to TARS, limiting the completeness and usefulness of the data. For  example, CBP has two tactical aerostats and one TARS deployed in Rio  Grande City Border Patrol station\u2019s AOR (see figure 3), and the two types  of systems provide distinct types of support when assisting with, for  example, seizures and apprehensions. By recording asset assist  information in EID for TARS and tactical aerostats under the same data  field, CBP is not able to determine the contribution of each separate  program. According to Border Patrol officials, the agency has not yet  taken actions to develop a mechanism to collect asset assist information  that distinguishes between TARS and tactical aerostats, but such a  mechanism would be useful and could be developed outside of EID. In  addition, according to Border Patrol officials, asset assist data in  conjunction with detection information has been used to evaluate tactical  aerostat site deployment locations related to proximity to cross-border  illegal activity. Specifically, CBP officials told us the data were used to  inform the relocation of a tactical aerostat site due to changes in cross- border illegal activity in Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol sector. Due to  the constant change in cross-border illegal activity, costs associated with  re-deployment of tactical aerostat sites (between $60,000 to over  $100,000 per site), and time needed to locate and obtain access for land  use for re-deployment, better data collection practices to distinguish  between asset assists associated with tactical aerostats and TARS would  help CBP to better ensure its data are complete to help guide resource  allocation decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Collects and Tracks Data on its Use of TARS To Assess Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["CBP collects and tracks data on its use of TARS to assess effectiveness,  including (1) operational availability or percentage of time an aerostat is in  flight providing surveillance data to CBP, (2) tracks of interest (TOI)  identified using TARS, and (3) assets assists associated with TOIs from  TARS.

We found these data were reliable for  our purposes of reporting summary data across fiscal years 2013 through  2016. We assessed CBP\u2019s data collection and management practices for  Predator B UAS and tactical aerostats for usage and performance data  against the management standards and practices contained in Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To identify costs associated with UAS and aerostats, we obtained and  reviewed financial summary data and cost per flight hour information for  Predator B UAS, TARS, and tactical aerostats. These data include  summary information on end-of-year obligations and expenditures by cost  category compiled by CBP for fiscal year 2015, the most recent fiscal  year for which complete data was available.

For example:", "Weather. Hazardous weather can directly impact take off and landing  of Predator B aircraft at Air and Marine Operations (AMO) National Air  Security Operations Centers (NASOC), including storms and cloud  cover. As previously mentioned, weather accounted for 20 percent of  Predator B mission cancelations from fiscal years 2013 through 2016.  Hazardous weather can also limit where Predator B aircraft operate  away from its NASOC launch site. According to CBP officials we  spoke with in North Dakota, weather in locations distant from where a  Predator B aircraft is launched can also limit operating locations as  there are no diversion airports along the U.S.-Canadian border for  CBP\u2019s Predator B aircraft to land. CBP took steps to mitigate the  impact of hazardous weather in January and February 2016 by  deploying Predator B aircraft from Corpus Christi, Texas, to San  Angelo, Texas, at San Angelo Regional Airport which had favorable  weather conditions. CBP\u2019s deployment of Predator B aircraft at San  Angelo Regional Airport was in accordance with a Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA)-issued Certificate of Waiver or Authorization  (COA) to conduct its border security mission in Texas, lasted  approximately 3 weeks, and was supported by an existing AMO Air  Unit co-located at San Angelo Regional Airport. According to AMO  officials, three Predator B aircraft are scheduled to be deployed to  San Angelo Regional Airport from January 2017 through April 2017.", "National airspace access. CBP\u2019s Predator B aircraft operations are  limited to COA-designated and restricted airspace. To fly outside of  COA-designated airspace, CBP must request and receive an  addendum to an existing COA or submit a new COA to FAA. CBP\u2019s  Predator B operations in special use or restricted airspace are subject  to agreements established between CBP and the Department of  Defense which may limit airspace access to certain time periods.  According to CBP officials we spoke with in Arizona, Predator B flights  are often excluded from restricted airspace managed by the  Department of Defense along border areas which can affect the ability  of Predator B aircraft to support U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol).  For example, CBP officials told us Predator B aircraft infrequently  support Yuma Border Patrol sector as portions of its area of  responsibility (AOR) along the border are covered by an area of  restricted airspace managed by the U.S. Marine Corps who typically  limit Predator B aircraft access to one hour or less per day. In  addition, CBP officials also told us it infrequently flies Predator B  aircraft in southern California due to airspace restrictions related to  the volume of commercial air traffic in and around Los Angeles,  California and San Diego, California."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tactical Aerostats", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of documents and interviews with CBP officials,  CBP\u2019s use of tactical aerostats is limited, in part, due to weather, access  to airspace, and real estate.
