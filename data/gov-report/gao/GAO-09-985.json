Timely testing of HIV-positive individuals is important to improve health outcomes and to slow the disease's transmission. It is also important that individuals have access to HIV care after being diagnosed, but not all diagnosed individuals are receiving such care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides grants to state and local health departments for HIV prevention and collects data on HIV. In 2006, CDC recommended routine HIV testing for all individuals ages 13-64. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides grants to states and localities for HIV care and services. GAO was asked to examine issues related to identifying individuals with HIV and connecting them to care. This report examines: 1) CDC and HRSA's coordination on HIV activities and steps they have taken to encourage routine HIV testing; 2) implementation of routine HIV testing by select state and local health departments; 3) available information on CDC funding for HIV testing; and 4) available data on the number of HIV-positive individuals not receiving care for HIV. GAO reviewed reports and agency documents and analyzed CDC, HRSA, and national survey data. GAO interviewed federal officials, officials from nine state and five local health departments chosen by geographic location and number of HIV cases, and others knowledgeable about HIV."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is required to ensure that HHS agencies, including CDC and HRSA, coordinate HIV programs to enhance the continuity of prevention and care services. CDC and HRSA have coordinated to assist health care professionals who provide HIV-related services. For example, in 2007 and 2008, CDC provided funding to HRSA to expand consultation services at the National HIV/AIDS Clinicians' Consultation Center. Both CDC and HRSA have taken steps to encourage routine HIV testing--that is, testing all individuals in a health care setting without regard to risk. For example, CDC has funded initiatives on routine HIV testing and HRSA has provided for training as part of these initiatives. Officials from over half of the 14 selected state and local health departments in GAO's review reported implementing routine HIV testing in their jurisdictions. However, according to officials we interviewed, those that implemented it generally did so at a limited number of sites. Officials from most of the selected health departments and other sources knowledgeable about HIV have identified barriers that exist to implementing routine HIV testing, including lack of funding and legal barriers. CDC officials estimated that approximately 30 percent of the agency's annual HIV prevention funding is spent on HIV testing. For example, according to CDC officials, in fiscal 2008, this would make the total amount spent on HIV testing about $200 million out of the $652.8 million CDC allocated for domestic HIV prevention to its Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. However, CDC officials said that they could not provide the exact amount the Division spends on HIV testing, because they do not routinely aggregate how much all grantees spend on a given activity, including HIV testing. CDC estimated that 232,700 individuals with HIV were undiagnosed--that is, unaware that they were HIV positive--in 2006, and were therefore not receiving care for HIV. CDC has not estimated the total number of diagnosed HIV-positive individuals not receiving care, but has estimated that 32.4 percent, or approximately 12,000, of HIV-positive individuals diagnosed in 2003 did not receive care for HIV within a year of diagnosis. State-level estimates of the number of undiagnosed and diagnosed HIV-positive individuals not receiving care for HIV are not available from CDC. HRSA collects states' estimates of the number of diagnosed individuals not receiving care, but data are not consistently collected or reported by states, and therefore estimates are not available for comparison across all states. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It has been more than 28 years since the first cases of acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States were reported in  June 1981. Since that time, approximately 1.7 million Americans have been  infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including more than  580,000 who have died. The most recent data available from the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 1.1 million people  living with HIV in the United States at the end of 2006, and that 56,300 new  HIV infections occurred that year.", "Not all of those living with HIV are aware of their HIV-positive status.  Timely testing of individuals who are HIV positive but have not yet been  diagnosed is important both in improving health outcomes for those  individuals and in slowing transmission of the disease. Research has  shown that the earlier individuals are treated for HIV the better their  prognosis becomes. In addition, many individuals who know that they are  HIV positive adopt behaviors that reduce their risk of spreading the  disease, while those who are unaware of their status are more likely to  pass HIV on to others. According to CDC, it has been estimated that the  majority of new HIV infections are transmitted from individuals who are  unaware of their status.", "Testing for HIV can occur in health care settings, such as public health  clinics, private doctors\u2019 offices, health maintenance organizations (HMO),  and emergency rooms, or in non-health care settings, such as community- based organizations. According to data from the 2007 National Health  Interview Survey (NHIS), less than 40 percent of adults in the United  States reported having ever been tested for HIV. Further, CDC estimates  that in 2006, 36 percent of those who were diagnosed with HIV were not  tested until late in the course of their disease, meaning that they were  diagnosed with AIDS within 1 year of receiving an HIV-positive result. A  number of studies have shown that late testing can occur after HIV- positive individuals have made numerous visits to health care settings,  indicating missed opportunities to test for HIV.", "HIV testing is the first step to connecting HIV-positive individuals to the  care that they need. Connecting HIV-positive individuals to care can occur  through, for example, assistance in scheduling appointments and by  providing transportation to and from appointments. It is also important to  ensure that individuals have access to and remain in care after they have  been diagnosed. New advances in HIV treatments have reduced mortality  rates and have the potential to extend the lives of individuals diagnosed  with HIV. However, not all diagnosed HIV-positive individuals are  accessing care options.", "CDC provides funding to state and local health departments for HIV  prevention, including counseling, testing, and referral services, through  cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts. CDC also provides funding  to community-based organizations and a smaller amount to national  professional organizations such as the National Medical Association. In  addition to providing funding, CDC conducts research, surveillance, and  epidemiologic studies on HIV. CDC has also issued a series of  recommendations related to HIV testing in health care settings, the most  recent of which were released in 2006. A major component of the 2006  recommendations is for all health care settings to test all individuals for  HIV without regard to risk\u2014a practice called routine HIV testing. This  represents a significant change from prior CDC guidance, which generally  recommended that health care settings target testing to groups at high risk  of contracting HIV or to high-prevalence areas. Additionally, CDC has  identified the requirement for separate written informed consent or  pretest counseling as barriers to routine HIV testing. While the 2006  recommendations suggest these practices not be required for HIV testing,  there is some disagreement over whether this would take away important  protections. States and localities are not required to adopt CDC\u2019s  recommendations, and state HIV testing laws vary. For example, according  to a study on state HIV testing laws, some states\u2019 laws require separate  written informed consent for HIV testing and others do not.", "While CDC is the federal agency primarily responsible for HIV prevention,  HHS\u2019 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is the agency  responsible for administering grant programs authorized by the Ryan  White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE  Act) and subsequent legislation that provide funding to states, localities,  and others for HIV-related services. The CARE Act was enacted to address  the needs of jurisdictions, health care providers, and people with HIV and  their family members. Each year, assistance to over 530,000 mostly low- income, underinsured, or uninsured individuals living with HIV is provided  through CARE Act programs. The 2006 reauthorization of CARE Act  programs, like the 2000 reauthorization, required states to submit an  estimate of the size and demographics of the population with HIV within  the state and a determination of those who have HIV but are not receiving  HIV-related services. HRSA characterizes this as an unmet need estimate,  that is, the number of individuals in a state who know their HIV-positive  status but who are not receiving care for HIV. In addition to  administering CARE Act programs, HRSA provides training to health care  providers and community service workers who work with people with HIV  and evaluates best-practice models of health care delivery.", "Given their respective roles in funding HIV prevention and care, CDC and  HRSA have coordinated on HIV activities in the past. Additionally, the  CARE Act requires the Secretary of HHS to ensure that HHS agencies,  including CDC and HRSA, coordinate HIV programs to enhance the  continuity of prevention and care services for individuals with HIV or  those at risk of the disease.", "As Congress prepares to reauthorize CARE Act programs, you asked us to  examine various issues related to identifying and caring for individuals  with HIV. In this report, we examine: (1) the actions taken by CDC and  HRSA since 2006 to coordinate on HIV-related activities, and steps the  agencies have taken to encourage implementation of routine HIV testing;  (2) the extent to which select state and local health departments have  implemented routine HIV testing in their jurisdictions and what barriers  exist to its implementation; (3) available information on how much of  CDC\u2019s HIV prevention funding is spent on HIV testing; (4) national data  on the types of settings where HIV tests are conducted and the types of  settings where HIV-positive results occur; (5) available data on national  and state estimates of the number of undiagnosed and diagnosed HIV- positive individuals who are not receiving care for HIV; and (6) what  barriers exist to care for HIV and what initiatives are being implemented to  connect diagnosed HIV-positive individuals to such care.

We also reviewed meeting  minutes from the CDC/HRSA Advisory Committee on HIV and Sexually  Transmitted Diseases (STD) Prevention to identify HIV activities  coordinated by CDC and HRSA. In addition, we interviewed officials at  CDC and HRSA as well as a judgmental sample of officials from 14 state  and local health departments knowledgeable about these topics.

In a recent survey by the  Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, the primary reason people gave for not  being tested is that they do not think they are at risk. The second most  common reason was that their doctor never recommended HIV testing.  While 38 percent of adults said that they had talked to their doctor about  HIV, only 17 percent said that their doctor had suggested an HIV test.  According to this survey, African Americans and Latinos were more likely  than adults overall to have had such a conversation with their doctor and  for the doctor to have suggested testing. Sixty-seven percent of African  Americans and 45 percent of Latinos said that they had talked to their  doctor about HIV and 29 percent of African Americans and 28 percent of  Latinos said that their doctor had suggested an HIV test.", "Technological advances have increased the benefits associated with HIV  testing as well as with regular care and treatment for HIV. First, advances  in testing methods, such as rapid HIV tests, have made testing more  feasible in a variety of different settings and increased the likelihood that  individuals will receive their results. Rapid tests differ from conventional  HIV tests in that results are ready sometime from immediately after the  test is performed to 20 minutes after the test is performed, which means  that individuals can get tested and receive their results in the same visit.  Second, the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has  transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a treatable condition. For  example, a 25-year-old individual who is in care for HIV can expect to live  only 12 years less than a 25-year-old individual who does not have HIV.", "In addition, studies have found that people generally reduce risky  behaviors once they learn of their HIV-positive status. According to one  study, people who are unaware that they are HIV positive are 3.5 times  more likely to transmit the disease to their partners than people who know  their status. At the same time, research has shown that individuals are  often unaware of their status until late in the course of the disease despite  visits to health care settings. For example, one study looked at HIV case  reporting in a state over a 4-year period. The study found that of people  who were diagnosed with HIV late in the course of the disease, 73 percent  made at least one visit to a health care setting prior to their first reported  positive HIV test, and the median number of prior visits was four."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding for HIV Testing", "paragraphs": ["Funding for HIV testing can come from insurance reimbursement by  private insurers as well as Medicaid and Medicare, although these payers  do not cover HIV testing under all circumstances. Funding for HIV testing  can also come from other government sources, such as CDC, CARE Act  programs, or state and local funding. A study by CDC and the Henry J.  Kaiser Family Foundation that looked at the insurance coverage of  individuals at the time of their HIV diagnosis from 1994-2000 found that   22 percent were covered by Medicaid, 19 percent were covered by other  public-sector programs, and 27 percent were uninsured.", "The cost of an HIV test varies based on a number of factors, including the  type of test performed, the test result, and the amount of counseling that is  associated with the test. For example, from a payer\u2019s perspective, the  costs of a rapid HIV test are higher for someone who is HIV positive than  for someone who is not, primarily because rapid testing requires an initial  rapid test and a confirmatory test when the result is positive with  counseling conducted after both tests. Additionally, eliminating pretest  counseling can lower the cost of HIV testing by about $10, regardless of  the type of test. According to the most recent data available from CDC, in  2006, the cost of an HIV test could range from $10.16 to $86.84 depending  on these and other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC HIV Testing Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["CDC issued its first recommendations for HIV testing in health care  settings in 1987. These recommendations focused on individuals engaged  in high-risk behaviors and specifically recommended that people who  were seeking treatment for STDs be tested for HIV on a routine basis.  Throughout the 1990s and 2000s CDC updated these recommendations  periodically to reflect new information about HIV. For example, in 2001,  CDC modified its recommendations for pregnant women to emphasize  that HIV testing should be a routine part of prenatal care and that the  testing process should be simplified to eliminate barriers to testing, such  as requiring pretest counseling. CDC\u2019s 2001 recommendations also  recommended that HIV testing be conducted routinely in all health care  settings with a high prevalence of HIV; in low-prevalence settings it was  recommended that HIV testing be conducted based on an assessment of  risk. In 2003, CDC introduced a new initiative called \u201cAdvancing HIV  Prevention: New Strategies for a Changing Epidemic.\u201d The initiative had a  number of strategies, including two that specifically applied to health care  settings: (1) making HIV testing a routine part of medical care; and   (2) further reducing perinatal transmission of HIV by universally testing all  pregnant women and by using HIV rapid tests during labor and delivery or  postpartum if the mother had not been tested previously.", "Elements of the Advancing HIV Prevention initiative were incorporated  into CDC\u2019s revised HIV testing recommendations for heath care settings in  2006. The 2006 recommendations represent a major shift from prior  recommendations for health care settings in that they no longer base HIV  testing guidelines on risk factors. Rather, they recommend that routine  HIV testing be conducted for all patients ages 13 through 64 in all health  care settings on an opt-out basis. CDC also recommends that persons at  high risk of HIV be tested annually; that general consent for medical care  encompass consent for HIV testing (i.e., separate written consent is not  necessary); and that pretest information, but not pretest counseling be  required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC HIV and AIDS Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["According to CDC, tracking the prevalence of HIV is necessary to help  prevent the spread of the disease.

While all states collect AIDS case  counts through name-based systems, prior to 2008 states collected HIV  data in one of two different formats, either by name or by code. CDC  does not accept code-based case counts for counting HIV cases because  CDC does not consider them to be accurate and reliable, primarily  because they include duplicate case counts. In order for CDC to use HIV  case counts from a state for CDC\u2019s estimated diagnoses of HIV infection,  the name-based system must be mature, meaning that the state has been  reporting HIV name-based data to CDC for 4 full calendar years. CDC  requires this time period to allow for the stabilization of data collection  and for adjustment of the data in order to monitor trends.

For example, an official from 1 state health department told us  that health care providers have said that they would do routine HIV testing  if they could identify who would pay for the cost of the tests. The need for  funding was corroborated by officials from an organization that contracts  with state and local health departments to coordinate HIV-related care and  services. These officials told us that they had often seen routine HIV  testing end when funding streams dried up and noted that there has been  little implementation of CDC\u2019s 2006 routine HIV testing recommendations  in their area outside of STD clinics and programs funded through the  Expanded HIV Testing initiative.", "Officials from state and local health departments we interviewed and other  sources also cited lack of insurance reimbursement as a barrier to routine  HIV testing. When identifying lack of funding as a barrier to routine HIV  testing, officials from two state health departments we interviewed  explained that there is a general lack of insurance reimbursement for this  purpose. Other organizations we interviewed and CDC also raised the lack  of insurance reimbursement for routine HIV testing as a barrier. For  example, one provider group that we spoke with said that many providers  are hesitant to offer HIV tests without knowing whether they will be  reimbursed for it. In a recent presentation, CDC reported that out of 11  insurance companies, as of May 2009, all covered targeted HIV testing,  but only 6 reimbursed for routine HIV testing. CDC also reported that as  of this same date only one state required that insurers reimburse for HIV  tests regardless of whether testing is related to the primary diagnosis.  CDC noted that legislation similar to this state\u2019s has been introduced, but  not passed, in two other states as well as at the federal level.", "Medicare does not currently reimburse for routine HIV testing, though the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services initiated a national coverage  analysis as the first step in determining whether Medicare should  reimburse for this service. While federal law allows routine HIV testing as  a covered service under Medicaid, individual states decide whether or not  they will reimburse for routine HIV testing. According to one study,  reimbursement for routine HIV testing has not been widely adopted by  state Medicaid programs. Many insurers, including Medicare and  Medicaid, base their reimbursement policies on the recommendations of  the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which is the leading independent  panel of private-sector experts in prevention and primary care. While the  Task Force has recommended that clinicians conduct routine HIV testing  when individuals are at increased risk of HIV infection and for all pregnant  women, it has not made a recommendation for routine HIV testing when  individuals are not at increased risk, saying that the benefit in this case is  too small relative to the potential harms.", "In addition, officials from three state health departments we interviewed  discussed legal barriers to implementing routine testing. For example,  officials from one department said that implementation of routine HIV  testing would require a change in state law to eliminate the requirement  for pretest counseling and written informed consent. Similarly, officials  from another department said that while their department had been able  to conduct routine testing through the Expanded HIV Testing initiative,  expanding it further might require changing state law to no longer require  written informed consent for HIV testing. The officials explained that  while the initiative did have a written informed consent form, the  department had been able to greatly reduce the information included on  the form in this instance. The department is currently in the process of  looking for ways to further expand HIV testing without having to obtain  changes to state law. According to a study published in the Annals of  Internal Medicine, as of September 2008, 35 states\u2019 laws did not present a  barrier to implementing routine HIV testing, though the 3 states discussed  above were identified as having legal barriers.", "Officials from 3 of the state and local health departments we interviewed  discussed operational barriers to integrating routine HIV testing with the  policies and practices already in place in health care settings. For  example, an official from a state health department said that the  department tries to work past operational barriers to routine HIV testing,  but if after 6 months the barriers prove too great in one site the  department moves implementation of routine HIV testing to another site.  An official from another state health department noted that in hospital  settings it can take a long time to obtain approval for new protocols  associated with routine HIV testing. NASTAD conducted a survey of the 25  state and local health departments that received funding through the  Expanded HIV Testing initiative and found that health departments  reported some barriers in implementing routine HIV testing, including  obtaining buy-in from staff in health care settings and providing adequate  training, education, and technical assistance to this staff.

Studies have also been conducted to evaluate  how infected prisoners fare in their HIV treatment upon release from  prison, as inmates often encounter social and economic changes including  the need to secure employment and housing, establish connections with  family, and manage mental health and substance abuse disorders.

From December 2003 through June 2004, more than 5,000  persons had been tested for HIV, and according to a CDC report, 108   (2.1 percent) had received confirmed positive results.", "CDC officials told us that CDC is currently completing three pilot studies  which began in September 2006. These studies were conducted to develop  interventions for HIV-positive persons being released from several prisons  or halfway houses in three states: California (prisons), Connecticut  (prisons), and Pennsylvania (halfway houses).", "CDC officials explained that CDC has established a Corrections  Workgroup within the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD,  and Tuberculosis Prevention. In March of 2009, the workgroup hosted a  Corrections and Public Health Consultation: \u201cExpanding the Reach of  Prevention.\u201d This forum provided an opportunity for subject matter  experts in the fields of corrections and academia as well as  representatives from health departments and community-based  organizations to develop effective prevention strategies for their  correctional systems.", "According to a Special Projects of National Significance program update,  HRSA\u2019s \u201cEnhancing Linkages to HIV Primary Care and Services in Jail  Settings\u201d initiative seeks to develop innovative methods for providing care  and treatment to HIV-positive inmates who are reentering the  community. This 4-year project, which began in September 2007, is  different from the \u201cHIV/AIDS Intervention, Prevention, and Community of  Care Demonstration Project for Incarcerated Individuals within  Correctional Settings and in the Community\u201d in that it focuses entirely on  jails. HRSA defines jails as locally operated facilities whose inmates are  typically sentenced for 1 year or less or are awaiting trial or sentencing  following trial. Under the initiative, HRSA has awarded grants to 10  demonstration projects in the following areas: Atlanta, Georgia; Chester,  Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; Columbia, South  Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; New York, New York; Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania; Providence, Rhode Island; and Springfield, Massachusetts.", "Besides funding demonstration projects and creating workgroups, HRSA  and CDC have issued guidance to states. HRSA issued guidance in  September 2007 explaining allowable expenditures under CARE Act  programs for incarcerated persons. The guidance states that  expenditures under the CARE Act are only allowable to help prisoners  achieve immediate connections to community-based care and treatment  services upon release from custody, where no other services exist for  these prisoners, or where these services are not the responsibility of the  correctional system. The guidance provides for the use of funds for  transitional social services including medical case management and social  support services. CARE Act grantees can provide these transitional  primary services by delivering the services directly or through the use of  contracts. Grantees must also develop a mechanism to report to HRSA on  the use of funds to provide transitional social services in correctional  settings. In 2009, CDC issued HIV Testing Implementation Guidance for  Correctional Settings. This guidance recommended routine opt-out HIV  testing for correctional settings and made suggestions for how HIV  services should be provided and how prisoners should be linked to  services. The guidance also addressed challenges that may arise for  prison administrators and health care providers who wish to implement  the guidelines in their correctional facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected State Health Departments Have Coordinated with Their Respective State Departments of Corrections on HIV- Positive Prisoner Transition Programs", "paragraphs": ["Of the eight state health departments in our review that had HIV transition  programs in place, several have implemented programs that coordinate  with the state\u2019s department of corrections to provide prisoners with  support services to help them in their transition back to the community.  We provide examples of three of these programs below.", "Officials from one state health department said that their department uses  CARE Act and state funding to provide a prerelease program that uses the  state\u2019s department of corrections prerelease planners to make sure that  prisoners with HIV are linked to care. Prisoners meet with their prerelease  planner 60-90 days prior to release, and the planner links them to care  services, has them sign up for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program and  Medicaid, and follows up with them after their release to ensure that they  remain in care. Additionally, the department of corrections provides 30  days of medications to prisoners upon release. The state department of  health has been working with the department of corrections to help them  transition HIV-positive prisoners for the past 10 years.", "According to officials from another state health department, their  department uses state funds to provide transitional case management for  HIV prisoners who are transitioning back into the community. Specialized  medical case managers meet and counsel prisoners with HIV who are  within 6 months of being released. Within 90 days of release, the prisoner  and the medical case manager may meet several times to arrange housing,  complete a Medicaid application, obtain referrals to HIV specialists and to  the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, and provide the prisoner with  assistance in obtaining a state identification card. Case managers will also  work with the prisoner for 3 months after release so that the prisoner is  stable in the community. After 90 days, the person can be transferred into  another case management program or they can drop out. The client is kept  on the AIDS Drug Assistance Program if they are not disabled.", "According to officials from a third state health department, their  department uses \u201cProject Bridge,\u201d a nationally recognized program to  transition prisoners back into the community and into CARE Act  programs. The Project Bridge program provides transition services to  prisoners. Ninety-seven percent of the Project Bridge participants receive  medical care during the first month of their release from prison. The state  attributes the success of this program to the productive relationship  between the state health department and the department of corrections.  Project Bridge participants are involved in discharge planning with case  managers starting 6 months before their discharge. Participants then  receive intense case management for approximately 18-24 months after  their release. During this period they are connected with medical and  social services. According to state officials, the program has also been  effective in decreasing recidivism rates.", "Officials we interviewed from state health departments described several  limitations to their departments\u2019 programs. One state health department  official explained that their department does not have the staff to  coordinate services for all of the state\u2019s 110 jails. Officials from two other  state health departments explained that state budget cuts are threatening  the continuation of their departments\u2019 prisoner transition programs. One  state health department official explained that finding the transitioning  HIV-positive prisoner housing in the community is often very difficult. The  lack of available housing has impacted their HIV care because they are so  focused on finding housing that they are unable to focus on taking their  medication or going to medical appointments. One state health department  official explained that their department\u2019s prisoners with HIV are  sometimes not interested in being connected to care in the community.  Another state health department official explained that the lack of funding  for prisoner transition programs is a limitation of their program."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Part A Grantees\u2019 Living HIV/AIDS Cases Used by HRSA to Determine Fiscal Year 2009 CARE Act Base Grants", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Part A Grantees\u2019 Living  HIV/AIDS Cases Used by HRSA to Determine  Fiscal Year 2009 CARE Act Base Grants Atlanta, Ga.", "Austin, Tex.", "Baltimore, Md.", "Baton Rouge, La.", "Bergen-Passaic, N.J.", "Boston, Mass.", "Caguas, P.R.", "Charlotte-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.", "Chicago, Ill.", "Dallas, Tex.", "Denver, Colo.", "Detroit, Mich.", "Dutchess County, N.Y.", "Fort Lauderdale, Fla.", "Fort Worth, Tex.", "Hartford, Conn.", "Houston, Tex.", "Indianapolis, Ind.", "Jacksonville, Fla.", "Jersey City, N.J.", "Kansas City, Mo.", "Las Vegas, Nev.", "Los Angeles, Calif.", "Memphis, Tenn.", "Miami, Fla.", "Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J.", "Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn.", "Nashville, Tenn.", "Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y.", "New Haven, Conn.", "New Orleans, La.", "New York, N.Y.", "Newark, N.J.", "Norfolk, Va.", "Oakland, Calif.", "Orange County, Calif.", "Orlando, Fla.", "Philadelphia, Pa.", "Phoenix, Ariz.", "Ponce, P.R.", "Portland, Ore.", "Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.", "Sacramento, Calif.", "San Antonio, Tex.", "San Diego, Calif.", "San Francisco, Calif.", "San Jose, Calif.", "San Juan, P.R.", "Santa Rosa, Calif.", "Seattle, Wash.", "St. Louis, Mo.", "Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.", "Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton, N.J.", "Washington, D.C.", "West Palm Beach, Fla."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Part B Grantees\u2019 Living HIV/AIDS Cases Used by HRSA to Determine Fiscal Year 2009 CARE Act Base Grants", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Thomas Conahan, Assistant Director;  Robert Copeland, Assistant Director; Leonard Brown; Romonda McKinney  Bumpus; Cathleen Hamann; Sarah Resavy; Rachel Svoboda; and Jennifer  Whitworth made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
