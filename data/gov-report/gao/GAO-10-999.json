These jurisdictions are estimated to receive about two-thirds of the intergovernmental assistance available through the Recovery Act. This report also responds to GAO's mandate to comment on the jobs estimated in recipient reports. GAO collected and analyzed documents and interviewed state and local officials and other Recovery Act award recipients. GAO also analyzed federal agency guidance and interviewed federal officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of September 3, 2010, about $154.8 billion of the approximately $282 billion of total funds made available by the Recovery Act in 2009 for programs administered by states and localities had been paid out by the federal government. Of that amount, over 65 percent--$101.9 billion--had been paid out since the start of federal fiscal year 2010 on October 1, 2009. As of July 31, 2010, the 16 states and the District had drawn down $43.9 billion in increased FMAP funds. If current spending patterns continue, GAO estimates that these states and the District will draw down $56.2 billion by December 31, 2010--about 95 percent of their initial estimated allocation. Most states reported that, without the increased FMAP funds, they could not have continued to support the substantial Medicaid enrollment growth they have experienced, most of which was attributable to children. Congress recently passed legislation to extend the increased FMAP through June 2011, although at lower rates than provided by the Recovery Act. As of August 27, 2010, the District and states covered in GAO's review had drawn down 72 percent ($18.2 billion) of their awarded State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) education stabilization funds; 46 percent ($3.0 billion) for Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I, Part A; and 45 percent ($3.4 billion) for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B. In the spring of 2010, GAO surveyed a nationally representative sample of local educational agencies (LEA) and found that job retention was the primary use of education Recovery Act funds in school year 2009-2010, with an estimated 87 percent of LEAs reporting that Recovery Act funds allowed them to retain or create jobs. Nationwide, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) obligated $25.6 billion in Recovery Act funds for over 12,300 highway projects, andreimbursed $11.1 billion as of August 2, 2010. The Federal Transit Administration obligated $8.76 billion of Recovery Act funds for about 1,055 grants, and reimbursed $3.6 billion as of August 5, 2010. Highway funds were used primarily for pavement improvement projects, and public transportation funds were used primarily for upgrading transit facilities and improving bus fleets. The EECBG program provides about $3.2 billion in grants to implement projects that improve energy efficiency; of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion has been allocated directly to recipients. As of August 2010, DOE has obligated about 99 percent of the $2.8 billion in direct formula grants to recipients, who have in turn, obligated about half to subrecipients. The majority of EECBG funds have been obligated for three purposes: energy efficiency retrofits to existing facilities, financial incentive programs, and buildings and facilities. As of August 7, 2010, housing agencies had obligated about 46 percent of the nearly $1 billion in Recovery Act Public Housing Capital Fund competitive grants allocated to them for projects such as installing energy-efficient heating and cooling systems in housing units. HUD officials anticipate that some housing agencies may not meet the September 2010 obligation deadline, resulting in those funds being recaptured. GAO believes HUD should continue to closely monitor agencies' progress in obligating remaining funds. As of July 31, 2010, HUD had outlayed about $733 million (32.6 percent) of TCAP funds and Treasury had outlayed about $1.4 billion (25.5 percent) of Section 1602 Program funds. GAO updates the status of agencies' efforts to implement GAO's 58 previous recommendations and makes 5 new recommendations to improve management and strengthen accountability to the Departments of Transportation (DOT), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the over 18 months since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  of 2009 (Recovery Act) was enacted in February 2009, the Department of  the Treasury has paid out approximately $154.8 billion in Recovery Act  funds for use in states and localities. These funds have been used to  support and preserve services in a wide range of areas including health,  education, transportation, and housing.", "The Recovery Act\u2019s recurring mandate specifies several roles for GAO,  including conducting bimonthly reviews of how Recovery Act funds are  being used in selected states and whether they are achieving the stated  purposes of the act. Specifically, the stated purposes of the Recovery Act  are to    preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery;   assist those most impacted by the recession;    provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by  spurring technological advances in science and health;  invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other  infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and  stabilize state and local government budgets in order to minimize and  avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and  local tax increases.", "In this report, the seventh in a series in response to the act\u2019s mandate, we  update and add new information on the following: (1) selected states\u2019 and  localities\u2019 uses of Recovery Act funds, (2) the approaches taken by the  selected states and localities to ensure accountability for Recovery Act  funds, and (3) states\u2019 plans to evaluate the impact of the Recovery Act  funds they receive. As in our previous reports, we collected and reported  data on programs receiving substantial Recovery Act funds in 16 selected  states, certain localities, and the District of Columbia, and made  recommendations when changes could result in improvements. The  selected jurisdictions for our in-depth reviews contain about 65 percent of  the U.S. population and are estimated to receive collectively about two- thirds of the intergovernmental assistance available through the Recovery  Act. For this report, we visited a nonprobability sample of 167 entities  within the 16 states and the District for our program reviews. These  entities represented a range of types of governments and the program  areas shown in table 1. The local governments also varied by population  sizes and economic conditions (unemployment rates greater than or less  than the state\u2019s overall unemployment rate).", "As in past reports, the programs we selected for review were chosen  primarily because they have begun disbursing funds to states or have  known or potential risks. The risks can include existing programs  receiving significant amounts of Recovery Act funds or new programs. In  some cases, we have also collected data from all states, and from an array  of localities, to augment the in-depth reviews. This report focuses on the  following programs:    Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP);    State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF);    Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 as  amended (ESEA);    Parts B and C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as  amended (IDEA);    Federal-Aid Highway Surface Transportation and Transit Capital    State Energy Program (SEP);    Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) Program;    Weatherization Assistance Program;    Public Housing Capital Fund;    Tax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP); and    Grants to States for Low-Income Housing Projects in Lieu of Low- Income Housing Credits Program under Section 1602 of division B of  the Recovery Act (Section 1602 Program).", "The Recovery Act also requires us to comment on the estimates of jobs  created or retained reported by recipients. In this report, we provide  updated information concerning recipient reporting in accordance with  our mandate for quarterly reporting. The Recovery Act requires that  nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funds, including grants, contracts,  and loans submit quarterly reports which are to include a list of each  project or activity for which Recovery Act funds were expended or  obligated and information concerning the amount and use of funds and  jobs created or retained by these projects and activities, among other  information. The latest of these recipient reports covered the activity as of  the Recovery Act\u2019s passage through the quarter ending June 30, 2010.", "In this report, we also discuss state and local budget use of Recovery Act  funds; federal requirements and guidance; and oversight, transparency,  and accountability issues related to the Recovery Act and its  implementation. The report provides overall findings, discusses agency  actions in response to the open recommendations we made in our prior  reports, and presents new recommendations. Our oversight of programs  funded by the Recovery Act has resulted in more than 62 Recovery Act  related products. See the GAO Related Products section of this report for a  list of these products.", "Going forward to meet our reoccurring Recovery Act mandates, we will  continue to capitalize on the work we have done over the past 18 months  in the selected states and the District. However, our focus will shift from  reporting on the uses of funds by the selected states and the District for a  group of programs funded by the Recovery Act to providing enhanced  analysis of the use of Recovery Act funds by states and localities for a  single program funded by the Recovery Act in each bimonthly review. We  will also shift our review of recipient reporting to focus specifically on  implementation within that Recovery Act program. Given that, as of  September 3, 2010, more than half\u2014about $154.8 billion of the  approximately $282 billion\u2014of total Recovery Act funds for programs  administered by states and localities had been paid out by the federal  government, evolving to this approach is appropriate and will allow us to  provide Congress and other decision makers with more in-depth analyses  of programs funded by the Recovery Act and to be responsive to  congressional interest in the impact and outcomes of programs as  Recovery Act implementation moves forward.", "In conducting our work for this report, we analyzed guidance and  interviewed officials at the Office of Management and Budget. We also  analyzed grant awards\u2014as well as relevant regulations and federal agency  guidance on programs selected for this review\u2014and spoke with relevant  program officials at the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services  (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), Education, Transportation,  Energy, and Housing and Urban Development. In addition, we spoke to  entities that play roles in oversight of Recovery Act spending, including  federal agency inspectors general, state and local auditors, as well as the  Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (the Board), which was  established by the Recovery Act. We also integrated information from our  prior Recovery Act reports into this review where appropriate.", "In addition, we continued our review of the use of Recovery Act funds for  the 16 selected states, the District, and selected localities. We conducted  interviews with state budget officials and reviewed proposed and enacted  budgets and revenue forecasts to update our understanding of the use of  Recovery Act funds in the 16 selected states and the District. To update  our understanding of local governments\u2019 use of Recovery Act funds, we  met with finance officials and city administrators at the selected localities.", "Where statements about state law are attributed to state officials, we did  not analyze state legal materials for this report but relied on state officials  and other state sources for description and interpretation of relevant state  constitutions, statutes, legislative proposals, and other state legal  materials.

The federal  government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a  formula based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national  average per capita income. The rate at which states are reimbursed for  Medicaid service expenditures is known as the Federal Medical Assistance  Percentage (FMAP), which may range from 50 percent to no more than 83  percent. To obtain federal matching funds for Medicaid, states file a  quarterly financial report with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS) and draw down funds through an existing payment  management system used by the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS).", "The Recovery Act initially provided eligible states with an estimated $87  billion through increased FMAP rates for 27 months from October 1, 2008,  to December 31, 2010. On August 10, 2010, federal legislation was enacted  amending the Recovery Act and providing for an extension of increased  FMAP funding through June 30, 2011, but at a lower level. On February  25, 2009, CMS made increased FMAP grant awards to states, and states  may retroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures that occurred  prior to the effective date of the Recovery Act. Generally, for fiscal year  2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased FMAP is  calculated on a quarterly basis and is comprised of three components: (1)  a \u201chold harmless\u201d provision, which maintains states\u2019 regular FMAP rates at  the highest rate of any fiscal year from 2008 through 2011; (2) a general  across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points in states\u2019 regular  FMAPs through the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, which will then be  phased down until July 1, 2011; and (3) a further increase in the FMAPs  for those states that have a qualifying increase in unemployment rates.", "For states to qualify for the increased FMAP, they must pay the state\u2019s  share of Medicaid costs and comply with a number of requirements,  including the following:    States generally may not apply eligibility standards, methodologies, or  procedures that are more restrictive than those that were in effect  under their state Medicaid programs on July 1, 2008;  states must comply with prompt payment requirements;  states cannot deposit or credit amounts attributable (either directly or  indirectly) to certain elements of the increased FMAP in any reserve or  rainy-day fund of the state; and  states with political subdivisions\u2014such as cities and counties\u2014that  contribute to the nonfederal share of Medicaid spending cannot  require the subdivisions to pay a greater percentage of the nonfederal  share than would have been required on September 30, 2008.", "In addition, CMS requires states to separately track and report on  increased FMAP funds. To help states comply with these requirements,  CMS provided the funds to states through a separate account in an  existing payment management system. CMS also provided guidance in the  form of State Medicaid Director letters and written responses to frequently  asked questions, and the agency continues to work with states on an  individual basis to resolve any compliance issues that may arise.", "Despite these restrictions, states are able to make certain adjustments to  their Medicaid programs without risking their eligibility for increased  FMAP funds. For example, the Recovery Act does not prohibit states from  reducing or eliminating optional services, such as dental services, or  reducing provider payment rates. States also continue to have flexibility in  how they finance the nonfederal share of Medicaid payments, and may  implement new financing arrangements or alter existing ones\u2014such as  provider taxes, intergovernmental transfers, and certified public  expenditures\u2014to generate additional revenues to help finance the  nonfederal share of their Medicaid programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased FMAP Key to States\u2019 Continued Efforts to Support Medicaid Enrollment Growth", "paragraphs": ["The FMAP rates in the 16 states and the District increased substantially  immediately following enactment of the Recovery Act, and most states\u2019  rates continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace, through the fourth  quarter of federal fiscal year 2010. During the fourth quarter of federal  fiscal year 2010, the increased FMAP averaged about 11 percentage points  higher than the regular 2010 FMAP rates, with increases ranging from  about 9 percentage points in Iowa to nearly 13 percentage points in  Florida. For all states and the District, the largest proportion of the  increased FMAP was the component attributable to the across-the-board  increase of 6.2 percentage points, followed by qualifying increases in  unemployment rates in each of the states. The \u201chold harmless\u201d  component further contributed to the increased FMAP in five sample  states, although to a lesser extent. (See table 2.)", "As of July 31, 2010, the 16 states and the District had drawn down $43.9  billion in increased FMAP funds, which is 75 percent of the total $58.9  billion in increased FMAP that we estimated would be allocated to these  states and the District through December 31, 2010. (See table 3.) If  current spending patterns continue, we estimate that the 16 states and the  District will draw down $56.2 billion by December 31, 2010\u2014about 95  percent of the initial estimated allocation. The national drawdown mirrors  the experiences of our sample states, with the 50 states and the District  having drawn down 74 percent of their estimated total allocation of nearly  $87 billion through the end of 2010.", "While the increased FMAP funds are for Medicaid services only, the  receipt of these funds may free up funds that states would otherwise have  had to use for their Medicaid programs. Similar to their reported uses in  fiscal year 2009 and the first half of fiscal year 2010, the 16 states and the  District most commonly reported using or planning to use these freed-up  funds to cover increased Medicaid caseloads, maintain program eligibility  levels, and to finance general budget needs. As with our last survey, most  states reported that increased FMAP funding continues to be a major  factor in their ability to cover enrollment growth, which has continued to  increase since our last Recovery Act report. Between February 2010 and  June 2010, overall enrollment across the 16 states and the District grew by  an average of nearly 2 percent, with a cumulative increase of 18 percent  since October 2007\u2014a rate of increase that is significantly higher than in  years prior to the recession. The increase in Medicaid enrollment  continues to be attributable primarily to children, a population that is  sensitive to economic downturns. However, the highest rate of increase  during this period occurred among the nondisabled, nonaged adult  population\u201435 percent, compared to an increase of nearly 19 percent for  children.", "In addition, 10 states and the District reported using freed up funds to  maintain benefits and services or to maintain payment rates for  practitioners or institutional providers. Six states reported using these  funds to meet prompt payment requirements, and five states and the  District reporting using the funds to help finance their State Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program or other local public health insurance  programs. While most states continue to report using freed-up funds for  multiple purposes, North Carolina and Ohio again reported that they use  these funds exclusively to finance general budget needs.", "Despite increases in program enrollment since October 2007, state  responses were mixed when asked about changes in the time it takes to  process new Medicaid applications. While six states reported an increase  in the time it takes to process new applications\u2014most commonly  attributing this change to an increase in the volume of new applications  and staff cutbacks\u2014nine states and the District reported no change or a  decrease in the processing time. Most states and the District reported  processing applications, on average, within federally-required time  frames."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Have Taken Actions to Sustain Their Medicaid Programs; Further Adjustments Will Depend on Federal Legislation", "paragraphs": ["When asked about the long-term outlook for their Medicaid programs, the  District and all but three of the 16 states reported a concern about  sustaining their Medicaid programs once increased FMAP funding is no  longer available. When asked about the factors driving their concerns,  most states and the District reported (1) the increased share of the state\u2019s  Medicaid payments in 2011; (2) the current projection of the state\u2019s  economy and tax revenues; and (3) the current projected growth in the  state\u2019s Medicaid enrollment for 2011. Mississippi, Ohio, and Texas did not  report concerns about their Medicaid programs\u2019 sustainability once  increased FMAP funds are no longer available. Due to these concerns,  most states reported taking actions to adjust their Medicaid programs,  including reducing or freezing provider payment rates, implementing new  or increasing existing provider taxes, or reducing certain optional benefits.  Specifically, 12 states reported reducing or freezing provider payment  rates. When given a list of 13 types of providers, these states reported  implementing 55 payment rate reductions and 46 payment rate freezes, for  a total 101 different rate actions taken since February 2009; on average,  these states reduced or froze payment rates for 8 types of providers.  States frequently reduced or froze payment rates to nursing facilities,  clinics, and home health providers, among others. (See table 4.)", "In addition, 10 states and the District reported implementing 28 new or  increased provider taxes. In contrast to states\u2019 changes to provider  payment rates, however, states\u2019 taxation efforts were concentrated among  a handful of provider types. Specifically, 21 of the 28 taxes were imposed  on inpatient hospitals, nursing facilities, and outpatient hospitals\u2014 providers for which most states reported paying on a cost basis. (See  figure 2.)", "In some cases, states reported implementing payment rate reductions and  new taxes on the same providers. For example, at least half of the states  that implemented new or increased taxes for inpatient hospitals, nursing  facilities, or outpatient hospitals also reduced or froze payments to those  same providers. In addition to changes to payment rates and provider  taxes, eight states reported making reductions to optional benefits and  services, most commonly reducing or eliminating dental services for  adults. Several states provided estimates of savings or increased revenue  generated by actions they undertook. For example,    California estimated savings of nearly $600 million from payment rate  freezes for long-term care providers and other rate reductions, and the  discontinuation of dental and certain other optional services;    Michigan estimated savings of $152 million from an 8 percent  reduction in payment rates for all providers;    Pennsylvania projected that a new hospital provider tax will generate  $498 million in new revenue for the state; and    New York estimated that increases in various provider taxes will  generate an additional $184 million annually.", "States were less certain when asked about future program changes that  may be necessary to sustain their Medicaid programs after Recovery Act  funding ends, and their uncertainty was likely due to questions  surrounding a potential extension of the increased FMAP, as well as  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) provisions. At the  time of our survey, the legislation amending the Recovery Act to extend  the increased FMAP had been proposed but not yet enacted, and the  PPACA had just recently been enacted. Despite states\u2019 uncertainties,  however, 12 states and the District reported on the survey that their 2011  budgets had assumed a full extension of the increased FMAP, and many of  these states had not developed a contingency plan in the event that such  legislation was not enacted. Nationally, 30 states assumed an extension of  increased FMAP in their 2011 budgets.", "Under the recent amendments to the Recovery Act, states\u2019 increased  FMAP rates will decrease by at least 3 percentage points beginning on  January 1, 2011, and continue to be phased down to their regular FMAP  rates by July 1, 2011. For states that had assumed a full extension of the  increased FMAP, the available federal funds will be less than anticipated.  The effect of these decreases in states\u2019 FMAP rates will vary depending on  each state\u2019s unique economic circumstances and the size of their Medicaid  population.", "PPACA also includes several provisions that could affect states\u2019 Medicaid  programs, and 12 states and the District reported that PPACA will be a  major factor in their ability to make future changes to their programs. For  example, the maintenance-of-eligibility requirement under PPACA  precludes states from receiving federal Medicaid funding if they apply  eligibility standards, methods, or procedures under their plan or waiver  that are more restrictive than those in effect on the date of PPACA\u2019s  enactment until the date the Secretary of HHS determines that a health  insurance exchange established by the state is fully operational, which  must be no later than January 1, 2014. PPACA also requires states to  expand Medicaid eligibility by 2014 to cover all persons under age 65 who  are not already eligible under mandatory eligibility groups and with  incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, but states have the  option to expand eligibility immediately and to receive federal funds for  these individuals. While the District has already been approved by CMS to  expand eligibility to cover this group prior to 2014, and two other states\u2014 California and Colorado\u2014reported that they are planning to do so, it  remains to be seen how all the states will respond to this option."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Local Educational Agencies Reported Using Recovery Act Funds for Job Retention and One- Time, Nonrecurring Purchases, While Education Continues Monitoring Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "As Many LEAs Reported Facing Budget Cuts and Fiscal Pressures, Job Retention Was the Primary Use of Recovery Act Education Funds", "paragraphs": ["Our review of states\u2019 use of Recovery Act funds covers three programs  administered by the U.S. Department of Education (Education)\u2014the State  Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF); Title I, Part A of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended; and the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part B, as amended. As part of this  review, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of local  educational agencies (LEA)\u2014generally, school districts\u2014about their uses  of Recovery Act funds for each of these programs. We also met with  program officials at the U.S. Department of Education to discuss ongoing  monitoring and technical assistance efforts for Recovery Act funds  provided through ESEA Title I, IDEA, and SFSF. At the state level, we  spoke with state ESEA Title I officials in five states and the District of  Columbia, which had relatively low drawdown rates of ESEA Title I  Recovery Act funds. We also interviewed state officials in five states and  the District of Columbia about their application for and implementation of  the School Improvement Grant program. Finally, we interviewed officials  in eight LEAs located in four states to understand how they were using  their Recovery Act funds.", "Even with Recovery Act Funds, an Estimated One-Third of LEAs  Experienced Funding Cuts in School Year 2009-2010 and More  Anticipated Cuts in 2010-2011  Education funding in the United States primarily comes from state and  local governments. Prior to the influx of Recovery Act funding for  education from the federal government, LEAs, on average, derived about  48 percent of their fiscal year 2008 funding from state funds, 44 percent  from local funds, and 8 percent from federal funds. These percentages,  however, likely shifted due to increased federal funding through the  Recovery Act and reductions in some state budgets for education. While  the federal role in financing public education has historically been a  limited one, the federal funds appropriated under the Recovery Act  provide a significant, but temporary, increase in federal support for  education to states and localities, in part, to help them address budget  shortfalls. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Recovery  Act provided approximately $100 billion for discretionary education  programs in fiscal year 2009, which, when combined with regular  appropriations for discretionary education programs, represents about a  235 percent increase in federal funding compared to fiscal year 2008.", "Over the last 2 years\u2014a time period when many states have dealt with  decreasing revenues as a result of the sustained economic downturn\u2014a  number of states in our review experienced K-12 education cuts. (See  table 5 below for expenditure changes for states in fiscal years 2008 and  2009.) Nationwide, 34 states reported that they cut K-12 education funding  in fiscal year 2010, including 12 of the 16 states in our review, according  to the Fiscal Survey of States. In some states, such as Arizona and  Georgia, these fiscal year 2010 cuts were in addition to expenditure cuts in  fiscal years 2009 or 2008. However, other states such as Colorado, Florida,  Massachusetts, and Michigan experienced cuts to education expenditures  in fiscal year 2009 but did not report cutting K-12 funding in 2010. Looking  forward to fiscal year 2011, cuts for K-12 education had been proposed in  10 of the 16 states in our review, according to data presented in the June  2010 Fiscal Survey of States report. Given that nearly half of LEA  funding, on average, is provided by the states, the impact of state-level cuts to education could significantly affect LEA budgets.", "The funding condition of LEAs across the country is mixed, and districts  expected it to worsen in the 2010-2011 school year, even with Recovery  Act funding\u2014however, the new Education Jobs Fund created in August  2010 will provide some additional funding. As shown in figure 3, an  estimated one-third of LEAs faced funding decreases in the 2009-2010  school year, but according to our survey conducted in March and April  2010, more than one-half of LEAs\u201456 percent\u2014are expecting to face  funding decreases in the upcoming 2010-2011 school year. LEA officials  we spoke with in California and Massachusetts expect funding declines in  2010-2011 which come on top of cuts made in prior years, indicating that  state-level cuts to education have been the primary reason for their large  funding declines and continue to provide an uncertain landscape for  school funding in coming years. Public Law 111-226, enacted on August 10,  2010 provides $10 billion for the new Education Jobs Fund to retain and  create education jobs nationwide. The Fund will generally support  education jobs in the 2010-2011 school year and be distributed to states by  a formula based on population figures. States can distribute their funding  to LEAs based on their own primary funding formulas or LEAs\u2019 relative  share of federal ESEA Title I funds.", "However, while many LEAs reported worsening funding situations, the  overall funding levels of many other LEAs increased or remained the same  in the 2009-2010 school year; although before the new Education Jobs  Fund was created, a smaller proportion reported expecting funding  increases in 2010-2011. Specifically, around half of LEAs reported that  their overall funding level in the 2009-2010 school year had increased  compared to the previous year, and an estimated 12 percent reported that  their funding had remained the same. We contacted several school  officials who had reported on the survey that their district\u2019s funding had  increased for the 2009-2010 school year, for the 2010-2011 school year, or  during both years. These officials offered a variety of explanations for  such funding increases, including increased enrollment numbers due to  having added a grade level, having won competitive grant awards, a  rebound in state tuition revenue, and having received state aid for a  previously approved capital project, including additions to a middle school  and high school.", "Moreover, before the creation of the Education Jobs Fund, of those LEAs  experiencing funding decreases, the percentage of LEAs that anticipated  funding cuts greater than 5 percent is notably higher for the 2010-2011  school year than for the 2009-2010 school year. Specifically, as shown in  figure 4, an estimated 31 percent of LEAs expected funding reductions  greater than 5 percent in the 2010-2011 school year, compared to 18  percent of LEAs that experienced cuts of this magnitude during the 2009- 2010 school year. The percentage of LEAs who anticipated funding cuts of  10 percent or higher is also projected to increase somewhat, from 8  percent in the 2009-2010 school year to 14 percent in the 2010-2011 school  year. Officials in some of the school districts we visited in June and July  2010\u2014before the creation of the Education Jobs Fund\u2014noted that their  funding situation would likely be more dire in the 2011-2012 school year,  when Recovery Act funds are no longer available. For example, Boston  Public Schools in Massachusetts, which reported experiencing funding  decreases this year and the past 2 years, is already preparing for a  decreased budget in fiscal year 2012 and beginning to plan how to address  budget shortfalls. Additionally, fewer LEAs anticipate funding increases of  more than 5 percent for the 2010-2011 school year than for the 2009-2010  school year. Specifically, as shown in figure 4, only 5 percent of LEAs  reported anticipating overall funding levels to increase by more than 5  percent for the 2010-2011 school year compared to 17 percent in the 2009- 2010 school year.", "We also found statistically significant differences between the fiscal  situations of urban and rural LEAs and between LEAs of different sizes.  For example, significantly more urban LEAs than rural LEAs experienced  total funding increases of over 5 percent in the 2009-2010 school year.  Specifically, an estimated 32 percent of urban LEAs experienced total  funding increases of over 5 percent in the 2009-2010 school year compared  to an estimated 8 percent of rural LEAs. We did not find a significant  difference between urban and rural LEAs for the 2010-2011 school year,  however. While urban LEAs generally fared better than rural LEAs, we  found that a larger percentage of the largest LEAs reported expecting a  budget decrease for the 2010-2011 school year when compared to all other  LEAs. Specifically, we found that 36 percent of the largest LEAs expected  funding to decrease by between 1 and 5 percent in the 2010-2011 school  year compared to 26 percent of all other LEAs.", "To Address Expected Funding Decreases, in Spring 2010 Many  LEAs Reported Being Very Likely to Cut Teachers, Related Staff,  and Other Items  Of the 56 percent of LEAs expecting funding decreases, many reported  being likely (somewhat or very) to take personnel actions such as cutting  positions or freezing pay. However, this information was reported before  the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund was created. Our survey results also  show that some LEAs also reported being likely to furlough teachers.  Specifically, an estimated 76 percent of LEAs that expected funding  decreases reported they were likely to cut noninstructional positions and  an estimated 70 percent reported they were likely to cut instructional  positions. (See fig. 5.) For example, when we met with officials in  California\u2019s Mountain View-Whisman School District in June 2010, before  the Education Jobs Fund had been created, they expected to cut 20  percent of their K-3 teaching staff in the upcoming school year in part due  to projected revenue decreases of between 6 to 10 percent. Given these  planned reductions in instructional staff, an estimated 70 percent of LEAs  reported being likely to increase class size in the coming school year. For  example, LEA officials in Mountain View-Whisman School District, Elk  Grove Unified School District in California, and Revere Public Schools in  Massachusetts said they were increasing class sizes to deal with budget  shortfalls. In addition to cutting positions, an estimated 61 percent of LEAs  expecting funding decreases are likely to reduce professional development  or teacher training. Approximately 55 percent of LEAs expecting funding  decreases reported being likely to freeze pay, and around one-third  reported being likely to furlough teachers. For example, officials at San  Bernardino City Unified School District and Elk Grove Unified School  District in California told us they had decided to furlough some employee  groups for at least 9 days in the 2010-2011 school year.", "Similarly, many LEAs expecting funding decreases also reported being  likely (somewhat or very) to take nonpersonnel actions, such as reducing  instructional supplies and eliminating summer programs. Specifically, an  estimated 87 percent of LEAs expecting funding cuts are likely to reduce  instructional supplies or equipment, 73 percent are likely to defer  maintenance, 71 percent are likely to reduce energy consumption, and 50  percent are likely to reduce custodial services. (See figure 6.) For  example, LEA officials in Elk Grove Unified School District said they were  very likely to reduce the purchase of instructional supplies\u2014or have  already reduced them\u2014and noted that this may result in teachers and  parents voluntarily purchasing additional supplies for classrooms. In  addition, LEA officials in Kingston Community Schools, Plymouth  Educational Center in Michigan, Elk Grove Unified School District, and  Boston Public Schools told us they had been deferring maintenance and  would continue to defer it, though they would not defer any maintenance  that would compromise the safety of children. Examples of deferred  maintenance projects included painting rooms, replacing a roof, promptly  fixing air conditioners, and resurfacing parking lots. LEA officials in  Boston Public Schools and Elk Grove Unified School District said they  were very likely to reduce energy consumption through such efforts as  lowering the temperature in schools in winter months, offering incentives  to schools with lower energy consumption, and using more energy- efficient light bulbs. Officials in Boston Public Schools, San Bernardino  City Unified School District, and Elk Grove Unified School District said  they had reduced custodial services in their schools and some would likely  further reduce them. Smaller proportions of schools reported being likely  to reduce transportation, shorten the school year, or close or consolidate  schools. A Boston Public Schools official told us the district planned to  reduce transportation costs by creating smaller transportation zones, and  also hopes to close and consolidate up to 20 schools to reduce costs. In  addition, we found that significantly higher percentages of the largest  LEAs reported being likely to reduce transportation services. Specifically,  50 percent of large LEAs reported being likely to reduce transportation  services, compared to 35 percent of all other LEAs.", "Recovery Act Funds Allowed Most LEAs to Retain or Create  Teaching Positions and Related Jobs, though Some Still Lost Jobs  in School Year 2009-2010  Recovery Act funds for education allowed over three-quarters of LEAs to  retain or create teaching positions and related jobs during the 2009-2010  school year, though some LEAs still reported losing jobs even with the  additional federal funding. The use of the Recovery Act funding for these  purposes is consistent with one of the primary goals of the Recovery Act,  which is to save and create jobs in order to help economic recovery. An  estimated 87 percent of LEAs across the country reported that Recovery  Act funding allowed them to retain or create jobs. Specifically, a higher  percentage of LEAs reported retaining staff positions\u201477 percent\u2014than  creating new staff positions \u201439 percent\u2014for the 2009-2010 school year.  In addition, a significantly higher percentage of large LEAs reported that  Recovery Act funding allowed them to retain school staff, with nearly all\u2014 98 percent of the largest LEAs in the country\u2014reporting using Recovery  Act funding for retention. While most LEAs were able to retain or create  jobs with Recovery Act funding, some of these LEAs\u2014nearly 1 in 4\u2014still  reported losing jobs overall in their LEA in the 2009-2010 school year. (See  fig. 7.)", "Retaining jobs was top use of Recovery Act funds for three  education programs: LEAs used large portions of their Recovery Act  IDEA Part B; ESEA Title I, Part A; and SFSF education stabilization funds  toward staff retention in the 2009-2010 school year. According to our  survey, nearly 70 percent of LEAs spent more than half to all of their  Recovery Act SFSF education stabilization funds to retain jobs for the  2009-2010 school year. (See fig. 8.) Although a smaller percentage of LEAs  reported using half to all of their IDEA Part B and ESEA Title I, Part A  Recovery Act funding\u201425 percent and 27 percent, respectively\u2014for job  retention, retaining staff was still the top use cited by LEAs for IDEA Part  B and ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funding. For example, LEA  officials in Kingston Community School District told us they had used all  of their Recovery Act SFSF education stabilization funds and ESEA Title I,  Part A funds, and most of their Recovery Act IDEA Part B, funds to retain  staff.", "A number of factors may explain why such a large percentage of LEAs  spent a significant amount of their Recovery Act funding for job retention.  For example, a large portion of school expenditures are employee-related  costs\u2014with salaries and benefits accounting for more than 80 percent of  local school expenditures, according to Education\u2019s most recent data.  Also, given the fiscal uncertainty and substantial budget shortfalls facing  states, federal funds authorized by the Recovery Act have provided LEAs  with additional flexibility to pay for the retention of education staff.  Overall, the impact of Recovery Act education funds on job retention may  be significant because K-12 public school systems employ about 6.2  million staff, based on Education\u2019s estimates, and make up about 4 percent  of the nation\u2019s workforce. In fact, through the reporting period ending  June 30, 2010, nearly two-thirds of full-time equivalent positions reported  on Recovery.gov have resulted from Recovery Act education programs.", "Based on our visits to states and LEAs, we were told that Recovery Act  SFSF funds, in particular, have provided additional resources and  flexibility allowing LEAs to retain staff. For example, one state education  official noted that LEAs have more flexibility in spending SFSF funds for  general education expenses because ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA Part B  programs target special populations\u2014disadvantaged youth and students  with disabilities, respectively. This official said that because funding levels  for general education programs in his state have decreased while federal  funding levels for ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA Part B programs have  increased, LEAs have used SFSF funds to shore up funding for general  education and, in particular, preserve jobs.", "Instructional positions were more often retained and created than  noninstructional positions: Substantially more LEAs retained or created  positions for instructional staff compared to noninstructional staff  positions for the 2009-2010 school year. Instructional staff typically  includes classroom teachers and paraprofessionals and noninstructional  staff can include office support, janitorial staff, and school security staff.  Specifically, an estimated 74 percent of LEAs nationally retained jobs for  instructional staff, compared to 48 percent that retained them for  noninstructional staff. Furthermore, 33 percent of LEAs reported creating  new instructional staff positions with Recovery Act funding compared to  the 22 percent that created them for noninstructional staff. (See fig. 9).  According to a number of LEA officials we interviewed, LEAs often spent  Recovery Act funding in ways that would benefit students directly in the  classroom, thereby focusing on creating and retaining positions for  instructional staff before creating and retaining jobs for noninstructional  staff, such as administrative and auxiliary staff. For example, officials  from the Plymouth Educational Center said that in order to minimize the  impact on students, they have made or would consider making cuts to  administration, security guards, and paraprofessionals, and instituting  further pay cuts before letting go of teachers.", "Fewer LEAs Used Large Portions of Their Recovery Act Funding to  Hire Staff Than to Retain Staff, although Fund Use for Hiring  Varied by Program  Although our survey results indicate that LEAs overall spent a significant  amount of their Recovery Act funding from all three programs to retain  jobs, LEAs also reported using Recovery Act funding to hire new staff. As  indicated in figure 10, the percentage of LEAs that reported using  Recovery Act funding to hire new staff varied across the three programs.  For example, 4 percent and 6 percent of LEAs reported spending half or  more of their Recovery Act IDEA Part B and SFSF funding, respectively, to  hire new staff, while 15 percent of LEAs reported the same use for their  Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A funds. Overall, nearly three-quarters of  LEAs did not use any of their Recovery Act SFSF funding to hire new staff,  concentrating instead on using that funding for staff retention.", "Nearly One in Four LEAs Reported Losing Jobs, Even with  Recovery Act Funding, Due to Decreasing Budgets and Other  Factors  Even with the additional Recovery Act funding provided to LEAs in school  year 2009-2010, nearly one-quarter of LEAs reported losing jobs, primarily  due to decreasing overall budgets. Without Recovery Act funds, it is likely  that the magnitude of job losses in these LEAs would have been higher,  given that nearly all of the LEAs experiencing job loss overall also  reported retaining jobs. Specifically, an estimated 92 percent of LEAs  where LEA officials indicated the number of teachers had decreased also  said that Recovery Act funds had allowed them to retain jobs during the  school year. Also, almost 30 percent of LEAs used Recovery Act funds to  create new jobs during the 2009-2010 school year, even as their overall  number of jobs decreased. For example, according to a Boston Public  Schools official, the number of staff in the district had decreased in the  2009-2010 school year, but the district also used Recovery Act funds for  both retention and job creation. For example, the district hired 16 new  English as a Second Language teachers and specialists with ESEA Title I,  Part A Recovery Act funds even as they let go of teachers during school  closures.", "Decreasing overall budgets at the LEA level was the main reason that  LEAs reported losing jobs in School Year 2009-2010. Specifically, 67  percent of LEAs that lost jobs reported that their budget was a factor to a  great or very great degree. (See fig. 11.) For example, officials from Elk  Grove Unified School District in California told us they laid off about 500  staff at the end of the 2009-2010 school year due to budgetary pressures,  after exhausting their reserves and spending Recovery Act funds. In  addition to budgetary factors, LEAs lost jobs because of staff attrition and  declining enrollment, although to a much lesser extent.", "In addition to retaining and hiring staff, LEAs spent Recovery Act funds on  items that could help build long-term capacity, while also avoiding  creating recurring costs for LEAs. Overall, LEAs reported several one-time  expenditures such as purchasing computer technology, providing  professional development for instructional staff, and purchasing  instructional materials as among some of the highest uses of funds after  job retention and creation. (See fig. 12.)", "LEA officials reported making one-time purchases with Recovery Act  funds to enhance district capacity. For example, at Plymouth Educational  Center in Michigan, officials told us that Recovery Act funds were used to  enhance computer technology for both students and teachers. Further,  several LEA officials told us they had used IDEA Part B Recovery Act  funds to purchase professional development and assistive technologies  that would help build the district\u2019s capacity to serve more students with  disabilities. These officials told us that they will be able to educate  students with disabilities far more affordably within the district than by  paying external providers\u2014a benefit they anticipate will continue even  after the Recovery Act funds are spent. For example, in rural Michigan,  officials told us that IDEA Part B funding has allowed the Kingston  Community Schools to build capacity by partnering, along with other  schools from the surrounding area, with the University of Kansas to  provide coaching and training to teachers who can then provide services  to more students with disabilities. In addition, LEA officials in Boston,  Massachusetts, said they had used these funds to obtain equipment and  provide professional development so they could serve more students with  autism within the district."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Majority of LEAs Maintained the Same Level of Service as the Prior Year, but Some LEAs Reported Not Being Able to Maintain Service Levels", "paragraphs": ["Although more than half of all LEAs reported being able to provide  students with the same level of service in 2009-2010 as in 2008-2009, a  number of LEAs reported they had not been able to maintain the same  level of service at their LEA for the same time frame. Specifically, an  estimated 63 percent of LEAs nationally reported that Recovery Act SFSF  funds allowed them to maintain the same level of service to students in  their LEA in school year 2009-2010 as compared to the previous school  year. However, 40 percent of the largest LEAs reported not being able to  maintain the same level of service compared to 16 percent of all other  LEAs.

For example, an estimated 28 percent  of LEAs reported making modest progress and just 13 percent of LEAs  reported making significant progress in increasing teacher effectiveness\u2014 the highest percentage among the four areas. (See fig. 14.) However, some  of these goals, such as improving standards and assessments, are more  likely to be pursued at the state level than at the local level, while others,  such as supporting struggling schools, may not apply to all districts. In  order to receive SFSF funding, states had to submit an application to  Education that required each state to provide several assurances,  including that it would implement strategies to advance four core areas of  education reform, as described by Education: (1) increase teacher  effectiveness and address inequities in the distribution of highly qualified  teachers; (2) establish a pre-K-through-college data system to track  student progress and foster improvement; (3) make progress toward  rigorous college- and career-ready standards and high-quality assessments  that are valid and reliable for all students, including students with limited  English proficiency and students with disabilities; and (4) provide  targeted, intensive support and effective interventions to turn around  schools identified for corrective action or restructuring. Furthermore, in  order to receive the remainder of their SFSF allocations (Phase II), states  had to agree to collect and publicly report on more than 30 indicators and  descriptors related to the four core areas of education reform described  above. While states will be responsible for assuring advancement of these  reform areas, LEAs were generally given broad discretion in how to spend  the SFSF funds. It is not clear how LEA progress in advancing these four  reforms will affect states\u2019 progress toward meeting their assurances.  Education officials noted that they were not surprised that fewer LEAs  reported expanding reform efforts in 2009-2010 given their budget  situation. Figure 14 depicts the extent to which LEAs reported making  modest or significant progress in each of the four reform areas.", "Almost all LEAs we surveyed stated that ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA  Part B Recovery Act funds allowed their LEAs to either expand or  maintain education reform efforts in 2009-2010, but a small and increasing  percentage of LEAs expect to reduce reform efforts in 2010-2011 than  reduced such efforts in 2009-2010. In addition to retaining and creating  jobs, Education officials reported they intended the use of Recovery Act  funds to spur education reform in LEAs to improve student achievement.  Education provided guidance to states and LEAs on ways to use the  Recovery Act funds to stimulate reform, as well as to retain jobs. Because  LEAs are required to obligate 85 percent of their Title I, Part A Recovery  Act funding by September 30, 2010, unless approved for a waiver, Title I,  Part A education reform efforts in districts without waivers could decrease  because fewer funds would be available in the upcoming school year.", "ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act Funding Enhanced Education  Reform Efforts at Nearly Half of All LEAs and Helped Enhance or  Maintain Reform at Nearly All LEAs  Most LEAs report that Recovery Act funding for ESEA Title I, Part A  allowed them to either expand or maintain education reforms for  disadvantaged students in both 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but the  percentage of districts that expect to expand reform is lower for 2010-2011  than for the 2009-2010. According to our survey results, an estimated 48  percent of LEAs indicated that the additional ESEA Title I, Part A  Recovery Act funding they received allowed their LEA to expand  education reform efforts in 2009-2010. For example, officials from one  Michigan LEA told us they used the ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act  funding to enhance a tutoring program for all at-risk students in math and  language arts. Officials at another LEA told us the ESEA Title I, Part A  Recovery Act funding allowed them to enhance their after-school tutoring  program targeted at English language learners. Moreover, an additional 48  percent of LEAs stated that the funding allowed them to maintain reform  efforts for ESEA Title I, Part A programs. However, the percentage of  districts anticipating ESEA Title I, Part A funding that will allow their  district to expand reform efforts is lower for the 2010-2011 school year  than for the 2009-2010 school year. (See fig. 15) While an estimated 3  percent of LEAs stated that even with the additional Recovery Act funding  provided under ESEA Title I, Part A, education reform efforts decreased in  the 2009-2010 school year, this percentage increased to 11 percent when  we asked LEAs to look ahead to the 2010-2011 school year. Title I, Part A  reform efforts could potentially decrease in the coming school year, in  part because LEAs are required to obligate 85 percent of ESEA Title I, Part  A Recovery Act funds by September 30, 2010, unless they receive a waiver.", "IDEA Part B Recovery Act Funding Allowed Most LEAs to Either  Expand or Maintain Reform Efforts for Special Education Students  Most LEAs report that Recovery Act funding for IDEA Part B allowed them  to either expand or maintain education reform efforts for special  education students in both 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but the percentage of  districts that expect to expand reform is lower for 2010-2011 than for the  previous year. Specifically, in 2009-2010, we estimate that 43 percent of  LEAs nationally expanded reform efforts for special education students  because of the additional IDEA Part B Recovery Act funding in 2009-2010.  (See fig. 16). For example, an official in Boston, Massachusetts, told us  that the Boston Public Schools has used some of its IDEA Part B Recovery  Act funding to train teachers and purchase equipment to enhance  classroom services for autistic students. In addition, 55 percent of LEAs  noted that the Recovery Act funding allowed them to maintain ongoing  education reform efforts targeted for special education students in the  same year. For example, in Michigan, one LEA official we interviewed  stated that the LEA had used Recovery Act funding to maintain  intervention services for special education students. Looking ahead to the  2010-2011 school year, however, a lower percentage of districts\u201428  percent\u2014expect to expand reform.", "Given the Increase in IDEA Recovery Act Funding in 2009-2010,  about 36 Percent of LEAs Exercised Flexibility to Decrease Local  Spending on Special Education, and Primarily Used Funds to  Retain Staff  In the 2009-2010 school year, among the 86 percent of LEAs that reported  receiving Recovery Act IDEA Part B funds, an estimated 36 percent  reported taking advantage of the maintenance-of-effort (MOE) flexibility  under IDEA that allows them to reduce their local, or state and local,  spending on students with disabilities. IDEA requires LEAs to budget at  least the same total or per capita amount of local funds for the education  of children with disabilities as the LEA spent in the most recent prior year  for which information is available. As provided for in IDEA, in any fiscal  year in which an LEA\u2019s federal IDEA Part B allocation exceeds the amount  the LEA received in the previous year, an eligible LEA may reduce local  spending on students with disabilities by up to 50 percent of the amount of  the increase, as long as the LEA uses those freed-up funds for activities  authorized under ESEA, which supports activities for general education.  Because Recovery Act funds for IDEA Part B count as part of an LEA\u2019s  overall federal IDEA allocation, in fiscal year 2009, the total increase in  IDEA Part B funding for LEAs was far larger than the increases in previous  years, which provided a greater incentive for many LEAs to take  advantage of the MOE flexibility in the 2009-2010 school year. Of the 36  percent of LEAs exercising the flexibility, an estimated 41 percent  reported spending more than half of the \u201cfreed-up\u201d local funds on retaining  staff. Other uses of the freed-up funds included providing professional  development for instructional staff, purchasing computer technology, and  hiring new staff.", "We also found an example of an LEA that planned to take advantage of the  MOE flexibility even though it was not eligible to do so. Based on our  review of budget documents and local officials\u2019 statements, the Syracuse  City School District (SCSD) had reduced their 2009-2010 spending by  about $2.3 million. We determined, and local officials subsequently  agreed, that SCSD was not eligible for the MOE reduction because it was  not meeting performance indicators related to graduation and drop-out  rates among disabled students and it had a significantly high percentage of  students with disabilities being suspended for more than 10 days, among  other indicators. When we notified LEA officials of its ineligibility during  our visit in March 2010, they attributed their situation to  miscommunication among staff in the special education and finance  offices and a misunderstanding of the eligibility rules for reducing MOE.  LEA officials informed us that they would follow up on this issue and take  steps to ensure they met MOE requirements. SCSD subsequently provided  documentation showing that they were indeed meeting MOE  requirements.", "While the decision by LEAs to decrease their local spending can free up  funds to address other needs in the current school year, it could also have  implications for future local spending on special education. Because LEAs  are required to maintain their previous year\u2019s level of local spending on  special education and related services to continue to receive IDEA Part B  funds, LEAs taking advantage of the spending flexibility will only be  required to maintain these expenditures at the reduced level in subsequent  years. If LEAs that use the flexibility to decrease their local spending do  not voluntarily increase their spending in future years, and federal IDEA  Part B allocations decrease\u2014specifically by returning to levels  comparable to those before the Recovery Act\u2014the total federal, state, and  local spending for the education of students with disabilities will decrease  compared to overall spending before the Recovery Act. However, while  LEAs may maintain the lower level of spending, because of the IDEA  requirement that children with disabilities receive a \u201cfree appropriate  public education,\u201d (FAPE) districts may not be able to maintain services  for students with disabilities at the lower levels of spending. For example,  in Elk Grove Unified School District (California), which reduced local  spending in 2009-2010, local officials reported that they have plans to  include in their budget for 2010-2011 an amount equal to or greater than  their 2008-2009 spending to ensure that services to students with  disabilities are maintained. Officials said they needed to do this in order to  maintain services for students with disabilities. In contrast, a charter  school in Michigan reported that it may not be able to restore funding to  previous years\u2019 levels, given decreases in state funding, but would make  sure it provided services for students with disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Vary in the Rate at Which They Draw Down Recovery Act Funds for Education Programs", "paragraphs": ["As of August 27, 2010, states covered by our review had drawn down 72  percent ($18.2 billion) of the awarded SFSF education stabilization  funds; 46 percent ($3.0 billion) of Recovery Act funds for ESEA Title I,  Part A; and 45 percent ($3.4 billion) of Recovery Act funds for IDEA Part  B. Some states had drawn down a much larger portion of their funds than  other states. (See table 6.) For example, Arizona, Georgia, Illinois and New  Jersey had drawn down all of their SFSF education stabilization funds as  of August 27, 2010, while Florida, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Texas had  drawn down less than 55 percent of these funds.", "As noted in a previous report, drawdowns typically lag behind actual  expenditures. For example, state officials in New Jersey stated that  drawdown figures lag expenditures because funds are only drawn down  once districts submit for reimbursement. However, because LEAs are  required to obligate 85 percent of ESEA Title I Recovery Act funds by  September 30, 2010, a low drawdown rate could indicate either that a large  percentage of districts have sought and obtained or will seek and obtain  waivers from this requirement or are at risk of not meeting this  requirement. To help mitigate the effects of the funding cliff\u2014when  Recovery Act funding is no longer available\u2014Education officials are  encouraging districts to use carryover waivers to spread ESEA Title I, Part  A funds over 2 years. Specifically, in a webinar Education officials hosted  on June 15, 2010, Education officials explained how districts could  minimize the impact of the funding cliff by strategically using carryover  waivers. Also, officials in states we contacted appeared to be following  Education\u2019s suggested strategy to encourage the use of carryover waivers.  We spoke to state officials in five states and the District of Columbia with  relatively low drawdown rates and some of these officials told us they  were encouraging districts to spread the funds over the 2-year period  rather than try to obligate 85 percent of the funds by September 30, 2010.  For example, Massachusetts state officials told us they have encouraged  all districts receiving Recovery Act Title I funds to apply for a carryover  waiver to allow them the flexibility to use Recovery Act funds throughout  the two-year period. Similarly, officials in New York state told us they had  requested a blanket waiver for all districts in the state, which was  approved by Education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Is Continuing to Provide Technical Assistance and Guidance and Is Monitoring States\u2019 Use of Recovery Act Funds", "paragraphs": ["Education has completed 16 of the 18 on site-monitoring visits it  scheduled for the 2009-2010 monitoring cycle (including 11 states and the  District of Columbia that are in our review), according to department  officials. The most frequent monitoring findings related to the Recovery  Act had to do with districts failing to follow fiscal and set-aside  requirements, such as the requirements to document time and effort of  employees paid with Title I, Part A funds and properly calculate how much  funding was required to be set aside for specific purposes, according to  Education officials. Regarding fiscal requirement findings, the most  frequent findings included districts\u2019 failure to (1) determine whether  services provided in schools receiving ESEA Title I, Part A funding were  comparable to those services provided to students in other district schools  not receiving ESEA Title I, Part A funding, (2) determine whether federal  funding had been used to \u201csupplant\u201d local or state funds by paying for  services that had previously been provided using local or state funds, or  (3) document that employees funded through multiple funding sources  were dedicating the appropriate proportion of their time and effort to  serving disadvantaged students. Regarding set-aside calculations,  Education officials said that they found that some districts had not  included Recovery Act funding in their calculations as required. Education  officials provided examples of corrective actions state educational  agencies and LEAs with fiscal or set-aside calculation findings could take  to resolve these issues. For example, calculations for comparability or set- asides could be corrected to comply with requirements.", "For the 2010-2011 monitoring cycle, Education officials plan to conduct  on-site visits in 11 states, including 2 in our review, and the Bureau of  Indian Education. During each of these 12 monitoring visits, Education  officials will assess state and local implementation of the School  Improvement Grant program in addition to the implementation of regular  and Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A requirements. Department officials  said that during the upcoming monitoring cycle, they will continue to shift  their monitoring focus away from strict audits towards providing technical  assistance. Department officials also told us that they will develop state- specific technical assistance for the states reviewed during the 2009-2010  monitoring cycle to help them resolve identified challenges.", "Education officials told us they continue to engage state and local officials  using a variety of technical assistance efforts. Such efforts include issuing  written guidance, hosting webinars, and giving presentations at state  ESEA Title I conferences to explain and discuss federal guidance.  Education officials also noted that they constantly communicate with state  and local officials over the telephone and through email, and issue  frequently asked questions to share their answers to questions from state  and local officials. Department officials also noted that they have offered  state-specific technical assistance to state and local officials in several  states, particularly in states with new ESEA Title I leaders. Some of these  technical assistance efforts have been initiated as a direct result of the  Recovery Act, according to Education officials, who also said that the  increased technical assistance efforts have created a strain on their  resources and capacity.", "Education Continues to Address Recovery Act Issues within Its  Ongoing IDEA Monitoring Efforts  Regarding IDEA, in the fall of 2009, Education officials reported that they  pursued their regular targeted monitoring visits and technical assistance,  which covers 16 states or territories, and in response to the Recovery Act,  Education\u2019s Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) is also  performing a desk review of all states. According to Education officials,  the department uses annual performance report information and focused  monitoring priorities to determine in which states it will conduct  monitoring visits. In the course of its monitoring visits, the department  verifies the effectiveness of state systems for general supervision, data  collection, and fiscal management, as well as reviews state progress  toward the goals from its state performance plan. In conducting site visits,  OSEP reviews state records, makes visits to selected LEAs for on-site  examination of student records, and assesses state special education  systems. Following these visits, Education issues a report on findings and,  when noncompliance is found, requires states to demonstrate correction  of the noncompliance.", "For fall 2010, Education is pursuing some additional monitoring and  providing additional support to states in implementing the Recovery Act.  Specifically, in addition to its annual monitoring visits, OSEP is planning to  visit up to 10 additional states this year. These additional visits will be less  intensive than the regular monitoring visits, and will focus more on the  Recovery Act than the annual monitoring visits. Also in response to the  Recovery Act, the department has assigned four Recovery Act Facilitators,  who work with four teams that will provide support and guidance to states  regarding their Recovery Act monitoring efforts and the reporting of  accurate data for recipient reporting under the Recovery Act.", "While they did not have any Recovery Act-specific findings in their most  recent monitoring visits, OSEP officials did report some areas on which  they will be focusing in their upcoming monitoring. OSEP officials  reported that one of the issues they have been focusing on for several  years is ensuring timely obligation and expenditure of funds. After finding  10 years ago that states had failed to obligate a total of $32.8 million in  IDEA funds before the end of the 27-month timeframe required under the  law, the department began to track state-level draw-downs, and now  works to remind states that have balances above a certain threshold when  the deadlines for obligating funds are approaching. OSEP officials  reported that in subsequent years, after they began tracking drawdowns,  the expired unobligated funds have declined to about $5.6 million. Also,  OSEP officials reported that some states were calculating their state-level  MOE spending without including spending on special education from  sources outside of the state educational agency. For example, if other  state departments are providing counseling or rehabilitation services, that  spending must be included. Finally, OSEP officials reported that while  state education agencies generally require LEAs to provide a budget for  their intended uses of IDEA funds, and require LEAs to attest that they are  complying with MOE requirements, states do not always perform  monitoring later to ensure that LEAs can document that they spent the  funds according to their budgets. In one example, in Iowa, we found  equipment purchases under IDEA larger than $5,000 for a single piece of  equipment that were not submitted to the state for approval as state  officials reported was required. In other examples, we found that the Des  Moines Public School District purchased equipment for about $25,000, and  the Marshalltown Community School District in Iowa purchased $8,400 in  communications equipment and software, without seeking review and  approval from the state prior to purchase, as state officials said was  required. As we completed our reviews, the LEAs were making changes in  their procedures to ensure state approval of IDEA equipment purchases  greater than $5,000.", "Given State-Level Budget Situations, Education Has Approved  Waivers Allowing States to Decrease Their State Spending on  Special Education  Because of declines in state-level budgets, Education has approved waiver  applications from states to decrease their state-level spending on special  education. Under IDEA, the Secretary of Education may waive state-level  MOE requirements for equitable purposes due to \u201cexceptional or  uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous  and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State.\u201d Education  approved a state-level waiver for one state in our review\u2014Iowa\u2014for  2009. Education officials said that the waiver will only apply for 1 year,  and, in 2010 Iowa must return its spending on special education to the  2009 level unless the state applies for and receives another waiver.", "Education officials said that the department is considering each  application individually based on its own merits, and is reminding states in  its approval letters that they must provide services to students with  disabilities that would still meet the requirement under the law that the  state provide a free appropriate public education, despite any cuts. In a  June 2010 memorandum, Education said that it was considering the  impact of other sources of funding for special education, including those  from the Recovery Act, when making waiver decisions. Education  officials also told us that they want to ensure that cuts to special education  services are equitable when compared to other budget cuts, and therefore  they consider the percentage decrease in spending on special education in  relation to that of other items in the states\u2019 budget, both education-related  and other items. Education\u2019s guidance also notes that states that receive a  waiver may be subject to additional monitoring, and Education officials  told us that each of the waiver-approved states will be among the 16 states  chosen for full monitoring visits described above and subject to additional  monitoring to make sure that free appropriate public education was  provided.", "Education Has Begun to Monitor SFSF Grantees and Address  Initial Challenges Associated with Monitoring Noneducation State  and Local Agencies  Education has begun to monitor SFSF grantees, and as of August 30, 2010  had conducted on-site monitoring of 1 state\u2014New York\u2014and Washington,  D.C. included in our review as well as desk reviews of two states in our  review\u2014Georgia and North Carolina. Education has not yet completed  its monitoring reports to states, but department officials told us that its  findings were minor and that it would work with states to address any  findings. For example, Education officials told us that some of the minor  findings included not providing timely certification documents, ensuring  that all jobs were reported on required recipient reports, or adhering to  monitoring schedules of subrecipients. Education has 10 more on-site  monitoring visits planned between September and November 2010 and 10  planned for 2011.", "Education officials reported some challenges they experienced during  their initial monitoring visits because of the differing types of  subrecipients and the amount of documentation to review. Education\u2019s  Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) is charged with  administering and monitoring SFSF funds. While OESE is experienced  with monitoring LEAs, SFSF educational stabilization funds may also flow  to Institutions of Higher Education, which OESE has little or no  experience overseeing. Further, SFSF government services funds provide  funding to a broad range of state and local agencies that Education does  not normally monitor. For example, SFSF government services funds  subrecipients consist of a variety of noneducational entities including state  police forces, fire departments, corrections departments, and healthcare  facilities and hospitals. Since this is the first SFSF monitoring effort,  Education officials told us that it will take time for Education\u2019s staff to  become familiar with these subrecipients and the types of documentation  they provide. In addition, Education officials reported that the amount of  information necessary to monitor SFSF funds was voluminous and  required more time than was expected, but they are continuing to work to  improve the SFSF monitoring process.", "In September 2009, we reported that some states faced challenges in  developing monitoring plans for SFSF funds, and we recommended that  Education take action such as collecting and reviewing documentation of  state monitoring plans to ensure that states understand and fulfill their  responsibility to monitor subrecipients of SFSF funds. Education acted on  our recommendation and required states to submit SFSF monitoring plans  to Education by March 12, 2010. Education officials told us they are  reviewing the plans to ensure that states planned to adequately monitor  SFSF subrecipients.", "Given State-Level Budget Situations, Education Has Approved  SFSF Waivers Allowing States to Decrease Their State Spending on  Education  The Secretary of Education has granted an SFSF MOE waiver to one state  in our review\u2014New Jersey\u2014allowing the state to reduce 2009 state  support for education below 2006 levels. The department grants these  waivers once a state certifies that state education spending did not  decrease as a percentage of total state revenues. As we reported in May,  the states we reviewed told us they met SFSF MOE levels in fiscal year  2009 or obtained waivers. Because of declines in state-level budgets, two  states in our review\u2014Florida and New Jersey\u2014requested a waiver from  Education to decrease their 2009 state-level spending on education. After  these states\u2019 2009 state education funding figures were finalized,  Education officials told us they reviewed waiver applications to ensure  that state education funding in 2009 met the requirements for an SFSF  waiver. Education officials reported that New Jersey\u2019s and Rhode Island\u2019s  waivers have been approved and that they are currently reviewing South  Carolina\u2019s and Florida\u2019s waivers.", "Education Announced Race to the Top Grants and SFSF Phase II  Awards  Education has announced that the District of Columbia and 11 states,  including Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and  Ohio, will receive Race to the Top grants. This program is a competitive  grant fund created by the Recovery Act as part of SFSF providing $4.35  billion in funding for statewide reform efforts and to develop common  academic assessments. In addition, Education officials reported that  almost all of the SFSF Phase II funds have been awarded to most states.  As such, states now have access to their entire allotment of SFSF funds  and all SFSF funds must be obligated by September 30, 2011.", "Education Released New Clarifying Guidance on Recipient  Reporting   As in previous reporting periods, FTE positions funded by Education  grants accounted for a large proportion of all reported FTEs.  Specifically,  Education recipients reported around 450,000 FTEs, which represent 60  percent of the nearly 750,000 FTEs reported for the period ending June 30,  2010.  To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, in  May and March 2010 GAO made several recommendations to Education,  including that Education re-emphasize the responsibility of sub-recipients  to include hours worked by vendors in their quarterly FTE calculations  and that Education provide clarifying guidance to recipients on how to  best calculate FTEs for education employees during quarters when school  is not in session.  Education implemented our recommendations by issuing  clarifying guidance on August 26, 2010, that specifies how education sub- recipients are to calculate FTEs for recipient reporting for Education- specific situations, such as how to calculate FTEs for teachers not  working during the summer months who are considered full-time  employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Though the Application Process Has Taken Longer Than Expected, States and LEAs Are Preparing to Implement School Improvement Grants as Soon as Applications Are Approved", "paragraphs": ["Setbacks in issuing final written guidance and resource constraints at  Education have slowed the application process for School Improvement  Grants (SIG)\u2014competitive awards to help turn around the lowest  performing schools\u2014according to department officials. According to  Education officials, one reason that the state application process took  longer than expected was that the department had to revise the final  requirements it initially released in December 2009. According to  Education officials, some language in the Consolidated Appropriations  Act, 2010  necessitated changes to these requirements. Education  officials released revised guidance in late January 2010 and again in June  2010 with a few additional revisions. While the changes to the guidance  and other delays created a challenge for some states, Education assisted  states in moving their applications forward by responding to questions in a  timely manner. In addition, Education extended the application deadline  set in the initial guidance document to allow time for the department to  offer technical assistance and for states to revise their applications given  the changed requirements.", "In addition to the delay caused by issuing revised guidance, department  officials said that staffing constraints had limited the department\u2019s ability  to review state applications, which ranged from 200 to 400 pages in length,  and to help state officials revise these applications. They noted that, in  some cases, states had to revise the application, sometimes more than  once, in order to comply with SIG requirements. Because certain  compliance issues related to more than one part of the application  (depending on how states put their applications together), Education staff  had to reread each application in full after each resubmission to ensure  compliance. Overseeing the substantial influx of additional ESEA Title I  funds provided through the Recovery Act, including SIG funds,  substantially increased staff workload, particularly given that staffing  levels did not increase, said a senior Education official. While one staff  member works full-time to coordinate the SIG application process at the  department, the 17 other staff who were assigned to work on SIG  application reviews assumed these responsibilities in addition to their  other monitoring, technical assistance, and programmatic duties,  according to a senior Education official.", "State officials in some states and the District of Columbia told us that  they had encountered various challenges in applying for and implementing  the School Improvement Grants and that timeframes have been tight.  These states were at different stages in the process of selecting LEAs to  receive SIG funds, but were taking various steps to address the tight  timeframes and work through challenges, and expected that districts  would be ready to use the grant funds in the 2010-2011 school year. For  example, officials in New York told us in late August that they had nearly  completed their review of districts\u2019 SIG applications. They also noted  encountering challenges in New York City, where school districts are not  allowed to replace principals or close schools\u2014steps required by certain  school turnaround models\u2014and having to work through two specific  collective bargaining issues. In contrast, New Jersey officials said they had  completed their review of district applications and selected 12 schools,  representing 7 school districts to receive SIG funds, with some districts  receiving grants for multiple schools. To ease tight time frames, Michigan  officials told us that while awaiting approval from Education, they had  created an iterative application process for districts, whereby districts  were required to submit an initial statement of intent in June, followed by  a more detailed initial application in mid-July. State education officials  told us they reviewed these initial drafts and gave local officials feedback  before the final applications were due. As of late July, Education had  approved SIG applications for 48 states and the District of Columbia,  including all 16 of the states and the District of Columbia in our review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Obligations for State Transportation Projects Are Nearly Complete, but Spending from Other Federal Transportation Sources Has Slowed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Use of Transportation Funds", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) obligated $25.6  billion in Recovery Act funds for over 12,300 highway projects and  reimbursed $11.1 billion as of August 2, 2010.

Figure 17 shows FHWA\u2019s and FTA\u2019s reimbursements during the Recovery  Act.", "Nationally, 44 percent of funds obligated for highway projects had been  reimbursed as of August 2, 2010. Reimbursement rates varied widely  among the 16 states and the District\u2014between 23 percent and 77 percent.  Illinois, Iowa, and Mississippi had the highest reimbursement rates\u2014each  at 65 percent or more. Officials in all 3 states told us that in selecting  projects they emphasized projects that could be completed quickly, and  each undertook more pavement resurfacing projects\u2014which can be  quickly initiated\u2014than any of the other states we reviewed. Five states  had reimbursement rates below 30 percent\u2014of particular note, California,  which received almost 1 out of every 10 Recovery Act highway dollars  apportioned nationwide, had the second lowest reimbursement rate  among the 16 states and the District at 26 percent ($633 million). Officials  from California noted that the state had undertaken a number of large  projects that had the potential to offer long-term benefits but for which  construction could not be initiated quickly. For example, California used  about $197 million in Recovery Act funds to partially finance the Caldecott  Tunnel improvement project (total estimated cost of $420 million).  California awarded a contract in November 2009 and began construction  of a new tunnel on a congested stretch of highway between Oakland and  Orinda in February 2010, nearly 1 year after the Recovery Act was enacted.  California officials also attributed the state\u2019s lower reimbursement rates to  having a majority of its projects administered by local governments, which  are often reimbursed more slowly than state-administered projects.  According to California officials, as of June 30, 2010, about 62 percent or  $1.5 billion of California\u2019s $2.5 billion are obligated for local government  projects. California officials stated that locally-administered highway  projects take longer to reach the reimbursement phase because of the  additional steps required to approve local highway projects and because  localities with relatively small projects tend to seek reimbursement in one  lump sum at the end of a project to minimize time and administrative  costs.", "The effect of projects sponsored by local agencies on reimbursements is  not limited to California. Among all the 16 states and the District,  reimbursement of funds suballocated for metropolitan, regional, and local  use lagged behind state projects. Suballocated funds can be administered  through local transportation agencies such as city or county agencies that  can lack familiarity with federal requirements. As we have previously  reported, local agencies have had challenges selecting projects that will  meet these requirement and suballocated funds have generally taken  longer to obligate than nonsuballocated funds. Data show this pattern  extending to reimbursements as well. New Jersey and Arizona had the  lowest reimbursement rates on suballocated projects, 10 and 18 percent,  respectively. Our past reports have noted that New Jersey and Arizona  were among the slowest states to select projects for funding in  suballocated areas.", "Table 7 shows the total reimbursement rates in the 16 states and the  District, as well as the reimbursement rates for state and suballocated  projects.", "Recovery Act highway obligations were used primarily for pavement  improvement projects, such as resurfacing, reconstruction, and  rehabilitation of existing roadways. Recovery Act public transportation  funds were used primarily for upgrading transit facilities and improving  bus fleets (see fig. 18).", "States Asked FHWA to Deobligate Funds after the 1-Year Deadline,  but Some Suballocated Areas Faced Challenges in Identifying  Additional Projects for Funding  As we have previously reported, an economic stimulus package should  assure that projects are undertaken quickly to provide a timely stimulus to  the economy. The Recovery Act included obligation deadlines to  facilitate the timely use of funds, including early March 2010 (1-year)  deadlines to obligate Recovery Act highway and transit funds. In our May  2010 report, we reported that the states met these deadlines.", "Since the March 2010 deadline for obligating Recovery Act highway funds,  states have asked FHWA to deobligate some funds and are subsequently  asking FHWA to obligate these funds to new projects. To use states\u2019 full  apportionments, those funds must be obligated again by September 30,  2010, after which all unobligated highway funds will no longer be available  to the states. As of August 2, 2010, about $397 million, or 2.6 percent, of  total Recovery Act highway funds remained to be obligated in the 16 states  and the District. Nationally, about $565 million remained. These amounts  have increased steadily since the March 2010 deadline\u2014for example, in  the 1-month period between June 30, 2010, and August 2, 2010, the amount  available for obligation increased from about $509 million to $565 million  (see fig. 19).", "Projects supported with suballocated funds generally had higher levels of  unobligated funds compared with projects using funds that are not  suballocated. As of August 2, 2010, $199 million of the $7.7 billion available  to suballocated areas nationwide remained to be obligated before the  September 30, 2010, deadline. Also, several of the states we reviewed had  unobligated suballocated funds that were roughly three to five times larger  than the national average (see table 8). FHWA officials told us that the  timely expenditure of funds on projects administered by local public  agencies remains an area of concern and that the agency is closely  monitoring these projects to ensure, on behalf of the states, that all funds  are obligated. These funds will be withdrawn after September 30, 2010, if  these funds are not obligated.", "State officials identified several reasons projects might have been delayed  in suballocated areas. Officials from the Arizona Department of  Transportation, in which 12.4 percent of suballocated funds were  unobligated, said that many suballocated areas did not have projects ready  for federal-aid funding in part because of limited staff and other resources  to move projects through approvals and prepare documentation in a  manner consistent with federal requirements. Officials from North  Carolina, in which 8.9 percent of suballocated funding was deobligated,  told us that local agencies using suballocated funding faced challenges  completing environmental documents, acquiring rights-of-way, and  finalizing bid documents. As a result, many projects local agencies  considered to be \u201cready-to-go\u201d did not meet various federal standards, and  agencies had to find other projects, which created delays.", "Among the states we reviewed, most of the funds that the states asked  FHWA to deobligate were from contract award savings. From March 2,  2010, to June 7, 2010, the 16 states and the District that we are reviewing  requested FHWA to deobligate almost $457 million. About 85 percent of  those funds were deobligated due to contracts continuing to be awarded  below state cost estimates (see fig. 20).", "Withdrawn projects accounted for only about $17 million, or 4 percent, of  deobligations from March 2 to June 7, 2010, less than 1 percent of the total  $15.2 billion available to the 16 states and the District for highways. Two  projects using suballocated funds in California accounted for about $9.7  million of the $17 million in withdrawn projects. In both cases, the project  was withdrawn and later established as a new project. California officials  told us they withdrew one $1.8 million project because local officials  wanted to expand the scope of the project. Another $7.9 million project  was withdrawn because it had an incorrect right-of-way certification.  Officials told us that the state subsequently resubmitted the project and  funding was obligated after correcting the certification.", "Contract Data from FHWA\u2019s Recovery Act Data System Continues  to Be Inaccurate  In May 2010, we reported that while progress has been made in awarding  Recovery Act contracts and initiating work, the accuracy of contract data  in FHWA\u2019s Recovery Act Data System (RADS) is of concern. Among other  information, the Recovery Act requires the U.S. Department of  Transportation (DOT) to report to Congress on the number of projects for  which contracts have been awarded, for which work has begun, and for  which work had been completed, and the amount of federal funds  associated with these contracts. DOT established RADS because it had  not previously collected and reported such information for the regular  federal highway formula program. DOT relies on states to enter data into  RADS and uses automated data checks and rules, as well as periodic  reviews by FHWA Division office officials located in every state, to  improve the accuracy of state-reported data.", "We continued to find problems with the accuracy of RADS contract data.  For example, more than 3,100 contracts were shown as having been  awarded on the same date the funds were obligated. We also found that  about 1,400 contracts were reported as awarded before FHWA obligated  the funds. Because contracts are normally awarded several weeks or  months after funds are obligated by FHWA, the numbers and amounts of  contracts awarded and work begun is likely overstated. Because FHWA  does not have accurate data from states in RADS, it is not able to use  RADS to meet the Recovery Act reporting requirements for contracts.", "FHWA officials acknowledged that they cannot use data from RADS to  provide information on contract award amounts. Officials said they  instead use data from FHWA\u2019s financial management system to meet the  Recovery Act reporting requirements for contracts because this system  receives more checks for data accuracy. However, using FHWA\u2019s financial  management system can also overstate the amount of funds under  contract. FHWA reports data at the project level, not at the contract level;  this is important because one project can include several contracts. When  reporting at the project level, FHWA reports the entire project as being  under contract once one contract is awarded, even if several more remain  to be awarded. FHWA provided project-level data in its report to Congress  dated May 7, 2010, but these data were labeled in the report as contract  data. As noted above, the Recovery Act requires DOT to report not only  the number of projects, but also the total amount of federal funds  associated with contracts that have been awarded, work has begun, and  work is completed.", "FHWA has taken some steps to improve data accuracy in RADS, but  officials said that there was no date for when they would implement  changes. These officials said they have assembled a state advisory group  to look at the challenges that exist in RADS and make recommendations  on improvements. FHWA officials said they have not had sufficient  resources to incorporate additional data checks into the software that  would check for errors. Such checks could ensure that milestones are  sequentially entered, thereby improving the accuracy of these data.", "Many States Requested That FHWA Transfer Funds to FTA for  Public Transportation Projects and Many States and Transit  Agencies Elected to Use Some Funds for Operating Expenses,  Although Data on Operating Expenses Is Limited  As we reported in our prior Recovery Act work, states have the option to  request that FHWA transfer Recovery Act highway funds to FTA for use in  public transportation programs, just as they do in the regular Federal Aid  Highway Program. While most states transfer some funds each year to  address transit priorities, data from Recovery Act funds indicated that 21  states requested FHWA transfer some Recovery Act funds to the states\u2019  public transportation program. Many states transferred funds shortly after  Recovery Act funds became available in February 2009. For example,  Caltrans transferred almost $2 million in July 2009. Caltrans officials told  us that their state has a robust transfer program because of the state\u2019s  extensive public transportation system and the system\u2019s many needs.  Caltrans\u2019 subrecipients used this funding for two large projects identified  in the state\u2019s transportation improvement plan but for which sufficient  funding had not been available. Specifically, one subrecipient is  purchasing two buses for a rural transit agency, and the second is  constructing a new intermodal transit hub that will serve the north Lake  Tahoe area. Caltrans officials said that the Recovery Act funding was  sufficient to complete these programs.", "According to FTA data, many state departments of transportation (DOT)  and transit agencies also used a portion of Recovery Act funds for public  transportation operating expenses. In June 2009, Congress gave urbanized  areas and states the authority to use a maximum of up to 10 percent of  certain Recovery Act transit funds for operating expenses. Data provided  by FTA indicated that, nationwide, urbanized areas and states used about  $190 million, or about 2 percent of Recovery Act funding for public  transportation, toward operating expenses as of August 25, 2010. FTA  officials told us that urbanized areas and states determine how much  Recovery Act funds they spend on operating expenses. According to FTA  data, 169 grantees throughout the U.S. chose to use a portion of public  transportation funds for operating expenses. This represented  approximately 25 percent of total Recovery Act public transportation  grantees. These 169 grantees ranged from major urban transit agencies in  San Francisco and St. Louis to transit agencies in smaller cities such as  Charlottesville, Virginia, and Pocatello, Idaho. In addition, 18 states used a  portion of their Recovery Act funding to pay for operating expenses for  rural public transportation.", "FTA provided us data on the dollar amounts that urbanized areas and  states obligated for operating expenses, but noted that they did not begin  to track at a national level the percent of funds each state or urbanized  area was using for operating expenses until August 2010.  FTA officials  also said that they rely on FTA\u2019s regional offices\u2014as part of the grant  approval and review process\u2014to ensure that urbanized areas and states  plan to spend no more than the 10 percent threshold. However, they are  considering instituting a control in its electronic grants management  system so that staff could not award a grant if an urbanized area or state  was over the 10 percent threshold. FTA officials also noted that there is no  reporting requirement to make publicly available the percent of funds that  urbanized areas and states are using for operating expenses but that they  are considering placing summary information on the use of Recovery Act  transit funds for operating expenses on the FTA Web site.", "We spoke with several states and transit agencies about whether they used  Recovery Act funds for operating expenses. For example, officials from  Michigan\u2019s Department of Transportation, after asking nonurban transit  agencies for input, found that funding for operating expenses was a  priority. According to Michigan Department of Transportation officials,  the majority of nonurban transit systems in Michigan are demand  response\u2014meaning that passengers are picked up and dropped off where  they want to go within a defined service area\u2014and officials told us that  expenses for these services have been increasing annually. As a result,  officials said the state used the maximum 10 percent of Recovery Act  transit funds for this purpose.", "Officials from Caltrans told us that they used 1.1 percent of their Recovery  Act funds for the operating expenses of their paratransit program. They  added that these expenses were already allowable as capital expenses  under both the Recovery Act as originally enacted and the regular federal  transit programs. Caltrans officials told us that if they had the option to  use transit funds for public transportation operating expenses when the  Recovery Act was first enacted, they would have used the full 10 percent.  However, because California had already identified and requested that  funds be obligated for capital projects prior to when the option to use  these funds for operating expenses became available, they chose to adhere  to their initial plan rather than risk that the funds be deobligated and  applied for another purpose.", "Transit officials from Illinois and New Jersey said their states chose not to  use Recovery Act funds for operating expenses. Illinois DOT officials told  us they decided early in the process to devote all Recovery Act funds to  capital projects, so that the use of these funds was evident to the public.  Illinois also chose to use state funds to cover all administrative expenses  related to managing Recovery Act funds both to ensure maximum impact  on capital projects and minimize paperwork needed to clear  administrative charges for payments. New Jersey Transit officials told us  they used Recovery Act funds for preventive maintenance\u2014such as bus  mechanical maintenance\u2014which they said was considered a capital  expense but did not produce new infrastructure. Officials noted that this  reduced pressure on the transit agency\u2019s budget, which freed up state  funds for operating expenses.", "As we reported in May 2010, a portion of the highway money that was  transferred was not obligated by the Recovery Act\u2019s March 2010 1-year  obligation deadline for highways and transit. We noted that the U.S.", "Department of Transportation (DOT) did not treat these funds as subject  to the Recovery Act obligation deadline for either FHWA or FTA because  it concluded that once Recovery Act highway funds were transferred to  FTA, they were subject to the provisions of the law that apply generally to  the transfer of highway funds to FTA. At the time, we expressed no  opinion on DOT\u2019s determination but stated that we were exploring this  issue further.

FHWA officials stated that with the  emphasis placed on the economic benefits to be gained, the obligation of  Recovery Act funds and meeting the act\u2019s statutory deadlines have taken  priority. States are facing drastic fiscal conditions, and FHWA officials  noted economic and budget difficulties in many states have led to staffing  shortages. FHWA officials also suggested that uncertainty about future  program funding levels may have slowed spending because a long-term  reauthorization of federal programs has not yet been enacted.", "Nationally, as of June 30, 2010 (the end of the third quarter of the fiscal  year), states had $19.7 billion remaining to be obligated, 63 percent more  funds than they did at the same time for the 3 previous years (see fig. 21).", "In addition, while funding available to states for highways has increased in  each of the last 3 fiscal years, we found that as of July 31, 2010, the  reimbursement of regular federal highway formula program funds were  lower compared with the reimbursement at the same point in the 3  previous fiscal years (see fig. 22).", "As Figure 23 shows, this trend was also true on a monthly average basis.  Specifically, the reimbursement of regular federal highway formula funds  for the first 10 months of fiscal year 2010 has been almost 18 percent (or  about $4.3 billion) less than the average reimbursement in the previous 3  fiscal years.", "In the last 3 months of fiscal year 2010, state highway agencies not only  have to request FHWA obligate over $500 million in remaining Recovery  Act funds, but also $19.7 billion of regular federal highway formula funds.  The amount of unobligated regular federal highway formula funds varied  among states. For example, Illinois had none as of June 30, 2010, while  Utah had $178.4 million\u2014almost 6 times as much compared with its  average balance of unobligated funds over the 3 previous years.  Nationally, we found 16 states with over twice the amount of unobligated  funds, while 5 states had fewer unobligated funds than in the past. Some  state officials told us they had not been obligating regular federal highway  formula funds as quickly because they had been focusing on meeting the  Recovery Act obligation deadlines and did not have the resources to do  both.", "Because states did not spend regular federal highway formula funds at the  same pace as in previous years, while also spending Recovery Act funds,  the full economic benefits of Recovery Act funds are likely to be delayed.  Specifically, if states had awarded contracts and begun expending those  regular federal highway formula funds at the same rate as in previous  years and in conjunction with spending Recovery Act funds, states would  have experienced an earlier stimulus effect. Funding being obligated now  for projects will need up to several months to award contracts and initiate  construction, and the effect on the economy comes when construction is  initiated and workers are employed.", "FHWA officials said they expect all regular program funds to be obligated  by the end of the fiscal year. To ensure that all authorized funds are  obligated nationally each year, FHWA redistributes obligation authority  from states that are not able to obligate their funds to other states that are.  Despite projects being obligated at a slower rate than in previous years, in  August 2010, when we completed our review, the 16 states and the District  all reported to FHWA that they would fully obligate fiscal year 2010  highway formula funds. We will continue to monitor the relationship of  obligations and reimbursements in both the regular federal highway  formula program and Recovery Act in future reviews.", "DOT Is Developing Plans to Assess the Impact of the Recovery Act  but Has Not Committed to Assessing Long-Term Benefits  The goals of the Recovery Act were not only to promote economic  recovery and to preserve and create jobs but also to make investments in  transportation and other infrastructure that would provide long-term  economic benefits. However, the Recovery Act did not include  requirements that DOT or states measure the impact of funding on  highway and transit projects to assess whether these projects ultimately  produced long-term benefits. In our May 2010 report, we noted that,  although DOT developed performance plans to measure the impact of  Recovery Act transportation programs, these plans generally did not  contain an extensive discussion of specific goals and measures needed to  assess the impact of Recovery Act projects. As we have reported, it is  important for organizations to measure performance to understand the  progress they are making toward their goals. In our May 2010 report, we  noted several efforts DOT initiated to strengthen its capacity to assess the  impact of Recovery Act funds. For example, DOT is exploring  opportunities to link databases that stored information about road  smoothness and congestion, bridge structural sufficiency, and transit  performance with financial data.", "Our May report recommended that DOT assess the results of Recovery Act  transportation investments and determine whether these investments  produced long-term benefits. We further recommended that, in the near  term, DOT determine the types of data and performance measures needed  to conduct such an assessment and, as appropriate, identify specific  authority DOT may need to collect and report on these measures. In its  response, DOT noted that it expected to be able to report on Recovery Act  outputs, such as the miles of road paved, bridges repaired, and transit  vehicles purchased, but not on outcomes, such as reductions in travel  time, nor did it commit to assessing whether transportation investments  produced long-term benefits. DOT further explained that limitations in its  data systems, coupled with the magnitude of Recovery Act funds relative  to the overall annual federal investment in transportation, would make  assessing the benefits of Recovery Act funds difficult. DOT indicated that,  with these limitations in mind, it is examining its existing data availability  and, as necessary, would seek additional data collection authority from  Congress if it became apparent that such authority were needed. While we  are encouraged that DOT plans to take some steps to assess its data needs,  it has not committed to assessing the long-term benefits of Recovery Act  investments in transportation infrastructure. We are therefore keeping our  recommendation on this matter open.", "DOT Plans to Report on State Progress in Meeting Maintenance-of- Effort Provisions  As we have previously reported, timely information on the progress states  are making in meeting the Recovery Act maintenance-of-effort provisions  could better inform policymakers\u2019 decisions on the usefulness and  effectiveness of the maintenance-of-effort requirements and of including  similar provisions in future legislation. The Recovery Act required  governors to certify that their states will maintain the level of spending for  the types of transportation projects funded by the Recovery Act that it  planned to spend the day the Recovery Act was enacted. As part of this  certification, the governor of each state was required to identify the  amount of state funds planned to be spent from February 17, 2009, through  September 30, 2010. Timely information is also important to assessing the  impact of Recovery Act funding and whether it achieves its intended  effects of providing countercyclical assistance and increasing overall  spending.", "Our earlier reports have noted that DOT does not have current information  on the progress states are making toward meeting their certified amounts.  This is because the Recovery Act does not require states to report final  expenditures until February 2011. As a result, DOT will not make a  determination as to whether states have met their required program  expenditures until some 6 months after the maintenance-of-effort  provision time period expires on September 30, 2010. We have also  reported that the challenges to implementing a maintenance-of-effort  provision have been tremendous\u2014as of mid-August 2010, for example,  DOT had not yet fully accepted the certifications of three states. As we  have reported, these implementation challenges, coupled with the fiscal  challenges states have faced, raise questions as to whether the  maintenance-of-effort provision will achieve its intended purpose of  preventing states from substituting federal funds for some of their planned  spending on transportation programs. That said, DOT and FHWA have  invested a significant amount of time and work to ensure consistency  across states on how compliance with the act is certified and reported. As  a result, DOT is in an advantageous position to understand lessons  learned\u2014what worked, what did not, and what could be improved in the  future.", "Our March 2010 report recommended that DOT gather timely information  on the progress states are making in meeting the maintenance-of-effort  requirements. Specifically, we recommended that DOT gather these data  and report preliminary information to Congress within 60 days of the  maintenance-of-effort period on (1) whether states met required program  expenditures as outlined in their maintenance-of-effort certifications; (2)  the reasons that states did not meet these certified levels, if applicable;  and (3) lessons learned from the process. In response, DOT officials stated  that DOT will encourage states to report preliminary data for the certified  period ending September 30, 2010, and deliver a preliminary report to  Congress within 60 days of the certified period. DOT officials said they  have developed a timeline for obtaining information to produce this report  and will issue guidance by October 1, 2010, requesting that states update  actual aggregate expenditure data and provide the data to DOT by  November 15, 2010. DOT officials said they will use this information to  develop the report to Congress, and it will submit the report no later than  November 30, 2010.", "Publicly Available Information Continues to Overstate the Extent  to Which Recovery Act Funds Were Directed to Economically  Distressed Areas  Our previous reports have identified challenges DOT faced in  implementing the Recovery Act requirement that states give priority to  projects located in economically distressed areas. In July 2009, we  reported substantial variation in the extent to which states prioritized  projects in economically distressed areas and how they identified these  areas. Many states based their project selections on other factors and only  later identified whether these projects were in economically distressed  areas. We also found instances of states developing their own eligibility  requirements for economically distressed areas using data or criteria not  specified in the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as  amended. In response to our recommendation, FHWA, in consultation  with the Department of Commerce, issued guidance to the states in August  2009 that defined \u201cpriority,\u201d and directed states to give priority to projects  that were located in an economically distressed area and could be  completed within the 3-year time frame over other projects. In addition,  FHWA\u2019s guidance set out criteria for states to use to identify economically  distressed areas based on \u201cspecial need.\u201d", "Three states\u2014Arizona, California, and Illinois\u2014developed their own  eligibility requirements or applied a special-need criterion that overstated  the number of counties, and thus the amount of funds, directed to  economically distressed areas. For example, California designated all  counties as economically distressed, and we identified 219 projects with  an estimated cost of $1.1 billion coded as being in economically distressed  areas that should not have been so coded. In early February 2010, FHWA  determined the documentation these states provided to justify these  additional designations was not consistent with FHWA guidance. In May  2010, we recommended that FHWA advise these states to correct the  designations, and in July 2010, FHWA instructed its division offices to  advise the states to revise their designations and to report these projects  as being in noneconomically distressed areas.", "In December 2009, DOT testified to the House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure that 57 percent of projects were in  economically distressed areas\u2014including 99 percent and 100 percent of  Recovery Act highway funding in California and Arizona, respectively.  However, as we noted above, these data had not yet been corrected by  DOT and therefore overstated the amount of funding, and this testimony is  DOT\u2019s only public accounting of how states implemented this provision of  the Recovery Act. Because FHWA\u2019s July guidance did not direct states  other than Arizona, California, and Illinois to correct existing entries, we  reviewed RADS data on projects in economically distressed areas. We  found about 2,300 projects that did not appear to meet FHWA\u2019s guidance  for classifying projects in economically distressed areas and thus appeared  to contain errors that would result in an overstating of the funds directed  to these areas. For instance, over 2,100 of these entries did not include an  explanation justifying the designation of an area as economically  distressed. In response to this information, DOT officials told us that they  manually compared these entries with maps designating distressed area  and other data sources. When we completed our review, FHWA officials  said they were able to verify that most of these data were accurate;  however, they did not provide documentation of the analysis to us. DOT  stated it does not intend to correct this information because the Recovery  Act does not contain a specific requirement that DOT report on the extent  to which distressed areas prioritized and directed funds to economically  distressed areas. However, without accurate publicly available  information, it is difficult to determine the extent to which Recovery Act  funds were directed to areas most severely impacted by the recession or to  know the extent to which states prioritized these areas in selecting  projects for funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Recovery Act Provisions Do Not All Contain Reporting Requirements, Additional Reporting Would Help Decision Makers and the Public Better Understand If Its Goals Were Met", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act included a number of requirements and provisions  designed to support the Act\u2019s goals of promoting economic recovery,  creating jobs, and, in the case of transportation funds, making investments  that contribute to long-term economic benefits.

Noting the large amount of federal  transportation funding provided in the Recovery Act, we have previously  made recommendations that DOT take additional steps to go beyond the  specific reporting requirements in the Act, and that DOT develop plans to  assess the long-term benefits of Recovery Act funds on the transportation  system.

Consistent with this, many recipients we  visited had spent less than 8 percent of the amount awarded. While many  recipients have spent only a small part of their funding, DOE is taking  steps to accelerate spending. For example, DOE has encouraged recipients  to meet a spending target of 20 percent by September 30, 2010. DOE  officials believe this has had a positive impact on spending rates. In  particular, DOE officials note that many recipients receiving less than  $250,000 met DOE\u2019s target of spending 20 percent as of June 30, 2010\u20143  months ahead of schedule.

In many of the communities we visited, energy-efficiency  improvements were made to public buildings, but the types of projects  selected for implementation in public buildings and facilities varied  considerably. For example, projects included improvements to a waste  treatment plant, occupancy sensor lighting at public schools, solar trash  compactors to reduce the frequency of trash pickup, solar parking meters,  and replacement of personal computer workstations with more energy- efficient virtual desktops that reduce both power consumption and  environmental waste.", "While not required, grant recipients were also encouraged to implement  programs and projects that leveraged other public or private resources,  enhanced workforce development, persisted beyond the funding period,  and promoted energy market transformation, such as revolving loans and  energy savings performance contracting. Recipients that we visited  indicated that their selection of projects was also based on a variety of  additional criteria, including: communities\u2019 determination of energy  savings; job creation; availability of staff and other resources; the extent to  which communities could benefit after Recovery Act funds run out; the  ease with which projects could be easily implemented; the potential for  return on savings; and populations to be served. For example, the District  chose to focus on target populations that they had been unable to serve,  such as nonprofits and small businesses. Kent County, Michigan also  considered the availability of county staff to complete the project. Several  recipients have selected projects that leverage other state energy  efficiency programs. For example, in Arizona, EECBG funds were used to  take advantage of a program that encourages commercial and government  customers to implement energy efficiency projects for which a public  utility will pay up to 30 percent of the cost.

In particular, several  recipients we visited indicated that DOE guidance regarding timeline  requirements, drawing down funds, and Buy American requirements was  at times unclear, duplicative, and ever-changing. DOE is working to  provide greater assistance to recipients that DOE officials believe will  increase responsiveness and clarify guidance. In particular, DOE is adding  staff in order to reduce the workload of project officers and monitors to  give them more time to assist recipients. DOE also recently issued  guidance that reduces reporting requirements, reduces workloads, and  streamlines communication with recipients.", "Regarding timeline requirements, grant recipients reported that DOE\u2019s  guidance on the timeline for obligating, spending, and drawing down  EECBG funds has been confusing. For example, DOE\u2019s Funding  Opportunity Announcement, as well as its Program Notice 10-011 for the  EECBG program, states that EECBG recipients are to obligate all funds  within 18 months of the effective date of their award and expend all funds  within 36 months of the effective date of their award. Most recipients  had been awarded funding in the fall of 2009, and several of the recipients  we visited believed they were on track to obligate funds within 18 months  of the effective date of their award (by the spring of 2011). However, in  April 2010, DOE set internal milestones designed to help recipients ensure  that they are on track to meeting their obligation and expenditure  deadlines. Specifically, DOE requested that recipients have 90 percent of  their funds under contract and obligated by June 25, 2010, and to spend a  minimum of 20 percent of their funds by September 30, 2010. While DOE  reports that some recipients found the guidance useful and that the new  guidance was helpful in getting many recipients to obligate funds quickly,  several recipients we visited said they were confused by this new  guidance. These recipients expressed concern that because of the  milestones, they had to obligate funds sooner than expected\u2014instead of  having 18 months to obligate funds, they had to have funds obligated in  half the time\u2014approximately 9 months after funds had been awarded. In  addition, National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO)  representatives said that DOE had not made clear to recipients that the  revised timelines were \u201cmilestones\u201d and not deadlines and that several  recipients had the impression that funds could be taken away if recipients  did not meet the revised spending targets.", "Regarding requirements on drawing down funds, while DOE reports that  many recipients found information on drawing down funds helpful, a few  recipients we visited were confused about when they needed to draw  down funds to their accounts. These recipients believed that based on  DOE guidance, they should draw down their entire award soon after it was  awarded. For example, Colorado Springs, Colorado, officials reported that  they drew down the entire $3.7 million award as of March 2010 based on  their understanding of the Funding Opportunity Announcement, even  though they were not yet ready to spend it. In April, a Colorado Springs  official realized the mistake, and the city paid back $3.1 million in mid-May  2010. However, in Jackson County, Michigan, local officials also  mistakenly drew down their award and told us that when they tried to  return the money, DOE required them to make interest payments on the  amount. DOE issued guidance on June 23, 2010, in response to recipient  questions on drawing down funds.", "Regarding Buy American requirements, recipients report that guidance on  the Buy American requirement was difficult to understand and ever- changing. The Buy American requirement of the act generally requires that  grant recipients use iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced in the  United States on all Recovery Act-funded projects. However, some  recipients found that it was unclear how to comply with the Buy American  requirements in a reasonable way and that the guidance was lacking or  difficult to understand. For example, Colorado Springs officials said that  DOE did not have a list of eligible vendors and that trying to ensure  compliance with the Buy American requirement delayed their light  emitting diode (LED) street lighting-replacement projects by at least 4  months. For Berks County, Pennsylvania, officials, it was difficult to  determine the source of some components of a product and therefore  whether the product could be used. NASEO representatives said that  DOE\u2019s guidance did not provide sufficient detail to enable officials to  determine the types of brands or goods they could purchase and that  recipients did not have the expertise to trace the supply chain of  manufactured goods to determine origin. In recent months, DOE has made  numerous attempts to help recipients understand Buy American  requirements, including guidance e-mailed to all recipients in May, a  webinar in June, and subsequent notice to recipients regarding the  guidance. DOE officials did note that they were concerned about providing  lists of vendors because that might be viewed as an endorsement of  particular vendors at the potential exclusion of other eligible vendors.  DOE officials said that DOE cannot recommend specific products, in part,  due to the large number of eligible products and because of the potential  ethical and liability concerns associated with a federal agency  recommending specific manufacturers.", "While many recipients have not had problems understanding program  requirements and have successfully navigated requirements through  training and technical assistance provided by project officers, DOE is  working to give project officers the tools to better assist recipients in  navigating DOE guidance. In particular, since March and April 2010, DOE  has added staff in order to reduce the workload of project officers and  monitors, which DOE officials believe has increased its responsiveness to  recipients in clarifying guidance. In addition, as of July 2010, DOE is  providing project officers with the Automated Standard Application for  Payment (ASAP) reports, so that they can monitor the drawdown of funds.

During desktop monitoring, monitors examine  recipients\u2019 reports to assess progress and determine compliance with  federal rules and regulations, goals, and objectives of the grants and the  reporting and tracking of resources expended by the recipient and its  subrecipients. During on-site monitoring, monitors review deficiencies  identified through routine monitoring and how the recipient is resolving  the outstanding quality and operational issues. On-site monitoring may  also include interviews with contractors to determine whether follow-up  protocols were conducted and deficiencies were corrected. During work- site monitoring, monitors review the project, facility, or building being  completed. One of the project officers\u2019 key functions is to conduct both  on-site and desktop monitoring. DOE monitoring is conducted at minimum  frequencies (see table 10), depending on the funding received by the  recipient, and can be increased if project officers have sufficient cause,  resources, time, and approval of management. In these reviews, project  officers evaluate both financial and project status by evaluating financial  records, activities, budgets, and spending plans to ensure sufficient  progress is being made against planned activities. The monitoring  questions were updated on July 30, 2010, downsizing the number of  questions asked from over 100 to about 30 questions in on-site reviews and  about 6 multi-part questions in quarterly reviews. Now, the desktop  monitoring quarterly checklist consists of financial questions such as \u201cFor  each activity, does the expenditure match, within reason, the amount of  work completed?\u201d and programmatic questions such as \u201cFor each activity,  is the grantee on track to meet performance goals?\u201d DOE is also  developing guidance that includes best practices for how states should  monitor their subrecipients.", "As of July 28, 2010, DOE has conducted 3,985 desktop reviews of the  EECBG program, and about 170 on-site reviews. Through its monitoring,  DOE has found that smaller recipients have been more likely to fail to  complete quarterly programmatic and financial reporting to DOE. While 97  percent of larger recipients (recipients with grants greater than $2 million)  have completed required quarterly reports due April 30, only 79 percent of  recipients receiving less than $250,000 completed quarterly reports.", "While DOE monitors its grant recipients (as well as conducts work-site  reviews of subrecipients as needed), grant recipients are expected to  monitor their subrecipients. While DOE does not expect grant recipients  to have a formal monitoring plan, DOE does require that state recipients  \u201cdevelop a sub-granting process\u2026that prevents fraudulent spending\u201d  DOE is also developing guidance that includes best practices for how  states should monitor their subrecipients. Several of the states we visited  do have a formal plan in place for monitoring their subrecipients. A few of  the states we visited have begun monitoring their subrecipients. For  example, Colorado reviews monthly reports prepared by subrecipients,  Michigan project managers review detailed expenditure and employment  data submitted by subrecipients on a quarterly basis, and Massachusetts is  beginning to monitor subrecipients through regular interactions with  subrecipients.", "DOE also expects localities to have a system for monitoring to ensure that  subrecipients comply with EECBG requirements. However, for localities  that received direct funding, and as we also found in our May 2010 report  on DOE\u2019s Weatherization Assistance Program, DOE provides localities  with discretion in developing and implementing internal controls, and as a  result, several localities we visited did not have a formal monitoring plan  in place for monitoring subrecipients or work performed. Many of the  localities we visited have developed a system for monitoring, which may  include monitoring procedures such as evaluation of the reasonableness of  costs, monitoring of building improvements and post-improvement audits,  checking payroll for compliance with Davis-Bacon requirements, checking  the validity of expenses, and announced and unannounced site visits.  However, despite guidance on how to report jobs, it is unclear if all  localities\u2019 systems for monitoring include measures to ensure the  reliability of reported data. For example, in one locality, an official  reported that there were no data quality steps to ensure the reliability of  the total job count. Another recipient said that it requested greater  clarification on what was expected from DOE regarding internal controls  but did not get more than a general answer about providing good  accountability for the use of funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recipients Face Challenges as They Begin to Report Outcomes While DOE Works to Provide Guidance", "paragraphs": ["EECBG recipients are required to report on outcomes quarterly to DOE on  three categories of activity and results metrics. The categories are jobs  created or retained; standard programmatic metrics, such as obligations,  outlays, and metrics associated with the EECBG activity undertaken;  and other critical metrics, such as energy savings and energy cost savings.  Recipients report to DOE through its Performance and Accountability for  Grants in Energy system (PAGE). In addition, recipients of grants greater  than $2 million must report to DOE monthly on funds spent and funds  obligated, amount of relevant activity completed, and additional  information as required per activity. Several recipients we visited were  reporting programmatic metrics such as obligations, expenditures, and  jobs created. In addition, several recipients we visited were just beginning  to implement projects. However, DOE officials have told us that they are  not required to report until the completion of their projects. As a result,  several recipients do not yet have data to report for critical outcome  metrics such as energy savings and emissions reductions.", "Some recipients we visited experienced challenges reporting outcomes  using these metrics. For example, in one locality, officials said that they  planned to estimate jobs because they do not have hourly contracts.  Similarly, in another locality, officials were not aware of how to calculate  full-time equivalents (FTE) per OMB guidance. In addition, because they  experienced challenges in measuring impact metrics, recipients in Georgia  have a variety of methods for calculating a metric value. For example,  officials from Columbus, Georgia, stated that energy savings from  upgrades to traffic lights will be estimated by making assumptions on the  amount of energy used by the original lights compared to improved traffic  lights. A Warner Robins, Georgia, official explained the city intends to  report project impacts by comparing past monthly utility bills for the  water treatment plant to new monthly utility bills. To measure the impact  of energy efficiency improvements, Cobb County, Georgia, plans a mixed  approach. According to officials, the county will take field measurements  of the performance of old equipment prior to removal and replacement  equipment as well as use energy models or engineering estimates,  including estimates provided by the county\u2019s energy audit consultant.  Cobb County also intends to use the new energy software procured  through the EECBG grant to benchmark and track energy use, cost, and  savings and revise calculations based on observed energy usage for each  facility. To help ensure consistency, Georgia has provided guidance from  DOE to its subrecipients detailing instructions on estimating and reporting  energy savings.", "In addition, some recipients experienced challenges in the process for  reporting metrics, especially due to DOE\u2019s reporting system, PAGE. DOE  provides resources to assist recipients in navigating the PAGE reporting  system on a Web site and offers assistance to recipients via a helpdesk.  However, several recipients described the reporting process as  overwhelming or frustrating and that reporting was time consuming and  required extensive resources. One DOE project official said he would like  to see the reporting process streamlined because it is too complicated for  recipients. An official from one EECBG locality in California said that if he  had known about the extent of the reporting burden, he may not have  applied for the grant. In particular, some recipients said the PAGE  reporting system was not user-friendly, and others were confused about  what to input into the PAGE system. Similarly, one DOE project officer  said that it seems that every time recipients log in, there is a new structure  or a new report that is required to be filled out. Other grant recipients said  that using OMB\u2019s federalreporting.gov and DOE\u2019s PAGE system is difficult  because the systems ask for information to be reported in different ways.  In addition, some officials have reported challenges in understanding for  how many quarters they are required to report some metrics, especially  energy saved once a project has been implemented.", "Adding to recipients\u2019 frustration about the reporting process has been the  volume of contact from various DOE offices about reporting requirements  or changes in reporting requirements. For example, one DOE project  officer that we spoke with said that grant recipients have expressed  frustration at having received so much e-mail about guidance or changes  to guidance received from different DOE offices. In addition, in Redding,  California, officials initially expressed frustration that questions about  reporting guidance required calls to several DOE staff to find the right  person to answer their questions. Kent County, Michigan, officials said  that reporting has been challenging because of the multiple guidance  released and because DOE\u2019s PAGE system was not user-friendly.", "DOE is beginning to take steps to deal with the amount of guidance and  requirements being provided to recipients. DOE plans to issue guidance in  August 2010 to assist recipients in navigating the PAGE system, how to  correctly categorize metrics and how to interpret and understand financial  reporting requirements. In addition, DOE expects to issue formal guidance  for the reporting period ending August 30, 2010, in which DOE will no  longer require recipients with formula awards greater than $2 million to  report obligations and performance metrics on a monthly basis. In  addition, all recipients will no longer report hours worked through  nonfederal funds or outlays of nonfederal funds on a quarterly basis. DOE  estimates that these changes will increase administrative reporting  efficiency by approximately 40 percent across the program. In addition, in  June 2010, DOE began an effort called \u201cOne Voice\u201d that is intended to  improve and streamline communication with recipients. This effort will  entail the circulation of a weekly newsletter with announcements  regarding guidance, training, and events and will also include an effort to  streamline communication via e-mail.

For example, as of March 31, 2010,  we found service providers in the District and Georgia had weatherized  about 14 percent and 11 percent of homes identified in their state  weatherization plans, respectively. By the end of June 2010, although both  recipients\u2019 production targets were still below DOE\u2019s approved goal of 30  percent, the District and Georgia reported they have increased their  production to about 25 percent and about 22 percent, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Recipients Still Face Challenges with Implementing Internal Controls to Ensure Program Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Some recipients are still challenged with establishing controls to ensure  compliance with weatherization program and Recovery Act requirements.

In our May 2010 report, we  recommended that DOE should develop best practices for key internal  controls that should be present at the local weatherization agency level to  ensure compliance with key program requirements. DOE provides  recipients with the discretion to develop and implement these internal  controls in accordance with each state\u2019s weatherization plan. Local  agencies use various methods to prevent fraudulent or wasteful use of  Recovery Act funds, such as conducting risk assessments.", "Since our last report, we have identified challenges in the implementation  of internal controls for some local weatherization agencies. For example,  in the District, we conducted client file reviews and found that while some  weatherization project data were not present in the physical files, much,  but not all, of this data was in an online software system used to manage  weatherization projects. While the online system appeared to be a useful  tool in managing weatherization projects, it has not yet been fully  implemented and does not contain all of the data necessary to track  individual weatherization projects from start to finish. As a result, at the  time of our review, neither the physical files nor the online weatherization  management system presented a complete record of weatherization  projects. District officials reported that they conducted inspections of  local weatherization agencies in early July 2010\u2014roughly 2 weeks after  our review\u2014and found that all agencies they reviewed had copies of all  required documentation in the physical files. Additionally, District officials  reported they are continuing to fully implement the online reporting  system and address issues associated with incomplete data. In Florida, the  state agency responsible for administering the program had instituted  various management controls over the program, but our review of two  local weatherization agencies revealed internal control gaps and  compliance issues similar to those identified in our May 2010 report. For  example, weatherization work done was often not consistent with the  recommendations of home energy audits and no reasons were given for  the differences; in some instances, work was charged to the program but  not done or lacked quality; several potential health and safety issues were  not addressed; and contractors\u2019 prices were not being compared to local  market rates, as required by the state weatherization agency. State officials  have acknowledged these problems and have taken steps to address the  problems, including changing procedures and guidelines and instructing  contract field monitors to be more attentive to these issues.

These monitoring visits consist of a financial review of the  service provider\u2019s records pertaining to salaries, materials, equipment, and  indirect costs; program reviews of the service provider\u2019s records,  contracts, and client files; and a production review, consisting of the  inspection of weatherized homes by the state agencies and by the service  provider. In our May 2010 report, we recommended that DOE set time  frames for development and implementation of state monitoring programs;  DOE generally agreed with this recommendation and indicated it will take  steps to address this issue.", "We found in the states we reviewed that levels of monitoring varied  considerably. Some state monitoring plans are fully implemented. For  example, in Arizona, state officials reported program monitors conduct file  reviews of all completed units each month using a statewide database.  Also, program monitors visit each of the 10 service providers at least once  a month, exceeding DOE\u2019s requirement of yearly visits to local service  providers. Iowa officials reported inspecting at least 5 percent of the  weatherized homes for each local agency and providing monitoring at 15  of 18 local agencies.", "In contrast, monitoring procedures in other states have either just been  fully implemented or are still facing challenges. We identified some issues  in our May 2010 report related to weatherization monitoring in Georgia.  Some monitoring positions remained vacant, and oversight of the  providers had been slow to start. However, state officials at the agency  responsible for the weatherization assistance program have since taken  steps to address these issues. Specifically, they told us that their  contractor had filled all monitoring positions, and all 22 of its providers  have received monitoring visits. Additionally, Pennsylvania officials are  still facing challenges. For example, state officials reported weatherization  program monitors are not in compliance with some Recovery Act  monitoring procedures, and they are not getting about half of their  monitoring reports back to the agencies within 30 days of the site visit.  DOE reported the need for Pennsylvania\u2019s department responsible for  administering the program to improve the financial management system to  better track actual costs for each unit weatherized on a service provider  basis. State officials reported they are working on corrective actions to  address these concerns by August 2010.", "Finally, some recipients, such as California and the District, were delayed  in spending Recovery Act weatherization funds and have just begun to  implement monitoring efforts. For example, in California, program  officials recently began on-site monitoring of Recovery Act activity in June  2010, and by July 31, they visited seven of the 38 service providers.  Additionally, program officials also conduct quarterly performance visits  as needed for providers with production deficiencies, monthly Recovery  Act expenditure and performance analyses, fiscal monitoring, on-site  monitoring of whistleblower complaints and high-risk agencies, and Davis- Bacon on-site reviews to ensure employees are paid appropriately and  paperwork is in compliance. Similarly, District officials reported a number  of monitoring procedures are in place, such as annual monitoring reviews  of local weatherization agencies and site inspections of at least 10 percent  of weatherized units.

A long-term  goal of the weatherization program is to increase energy efficiency  through cost-effective weatherization work, and DOE relies on its  recipients to ensure compliance with this cost-effectiveness requirement.  For example, in Arizona, the agency responsible for administering the  weatherization program calculates the estimated kilowatt hour usage  reduction and utility costs savings resulting from weatherization work  performed on homes. As of June 2010, officials estimated that Recovery  Act weatherization services have resulted in approximately $267,000 in  savings for the residents in the 1,930 homes weatherized. Florida officials  reported contracting with the University of Florida to conduct a study of  overall energy savings utilizing consumption data obtained from clients\u2019  utility bills.

In September 2009, HUD  awarded 396 competitive grants in the amount of $995 million to 212  public housing agencies. (Subsequently, three housing agencies returned  competitive grants totaling approximately $14 million to HUD). The  Recovery Act required housing agencies that received competitive grants  to obligate 100 percent of their competitive grant funds within 1 year of  the date when competitive funds became available to agencies for  obligation, which means they have until September 2010 to obligate 100  percent of their funds. As of August 7, 2010, 179 housing agencies  reported obligations totaling about $460.1 million for 340 grants. This  reflects about 46.3 percent of the total Public Housing Capital Fund  competitive funds allocated to them (see fig. 24). In addition, there were  57 grants (14 percent) located at 39 housing agencies for which no  competitive funds had been obligated. Further, another 102 grants (26  percent) had less than 20 percent of their funds obligated. As the  September 2010 obligation deadline approaches, HUD officials said they  are working to ensure that housing agencies meet the deadline, but expect  that some housing agencies may not. HUD will recapture any funds not  obligated by the deadline and return them to the Department of the  Treasury. One hundred forty-four housing agencies had also drawn down  funds to pay for project expenses already incurred. As of August 7, 2010,  these 144 public housing agencies had drawn down about $93.5 million, or  about 9.4 percent of the total allocated to them. The Recovery Act required  housing agencies to expend 60 percent of obligated funds within 2 years  and expend 100 percent of Recovery Act funds within 3 years of the initial  date when funds were provided to agencies for obligation.", "More specifically, housing agencies have been using their competitive  grants for the creation of energy-efficient communities, gap financing for  projects stalled because of financing issues, public housing  transformation, and improvements addressing the needs of the elderly or  persons with disabilities:    For the creation of energy-efficient communities, HUD awarded 36  grants totaling $299.7 million for substantial rehabilitation or new  construction and 226 grants totaling $305.8 million for moderate  rehabilitation. For example, in New Jersey funds are to be used to  incorporate green features in two new buildings with public housing  units. Some of the energy-efficient features of the project include  water conserving fixtures, Energy Star lighting packages in all interior  units, and Energy Star or high-efficiency commercial grade fixtures in  all common areas, as well as daylight sensors or timers on all outdoor  lighting. In Massachusetts, funds are to be used to reduce the annual  energy and water costs of more than $4,000 per unit in a physically  distressed site. The project will redevelop a portion of the site into  innovative, high-efficiency affordable housing for current residents  with the new construction of 96 affordable rental units and a  community center.", "For gap financing for projects that were stalled due to financing issues,  HUD awarded 38 grants totaling $198.8 million. For example, in  Pennsylvania, $10 million in funds are to be used to construct 50 units  of a 101-unit development that will be a mixture of walk-up and duplex  apartments and three-scattered site buildings replacing a high-rise  building demolished in 2008.", "For public housing transformation, HUD awarded 15 grants totaling  $95.9 million to revitalize distressed or obsolete public housing  projects. For example, in Illinois, funds are to be used on a multiphase,  mixed-finance project that will build public housing, rental, and for- sale apartments and houses on housing agency land and vacant city  lots.", "For improvements addressing the needs of the elderly or persons with  disabilities, HUD awarded 81 grants totaling $94.8 million. For  example, in Texas, funds are to be used to complete work on common  areas to make them accessible and ADA-compliant, upgrade and  improve space used for supportive services, and add energy-efficient  lighting, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning in properties housing  the elderly. In California, funds are to be used to provide upgrades to  nine dwelling units for accessibility improvements for the elderly and  disabled, as well as improvements to common spaces used for  supportive services targeted to those residents.", "As discussed above, HUD officials expect that some housing agencies may  not meet the September 2010 competitive grant obligation deadline. They  noted that among all the competitive grant projects nationwide, the 75  grants supported by mixed-financing have been at greatest risk of missing  the obligation deadline. HUD\u2019s Office of Urban Revitalization has assigned  a grant manager to each of the mixed-finance competitive grant projects to  track and monitor their progress. Officials with 5 of the 10 housing  agencies we visited that had received competitive grants told us they were  experiencing challenges related to mixed-financing of their projects, but  they still anticipated meeting the deadline. Because funding for these  projects comes from multiple sources, if one financing party is not able to  finalize its part of the contract by the obligation deadline, the housing  agency will not be able to close on the contract. As a result, the housing  agency would not be able to obligate its competitive grant funds on time  and the funds would be recaptured. For example, one housing agency is  relying on a 4 percent low-income housing tax credit to pay for about $10  million of the $40 million cost for the first phase of its project. The 4  percent tax credit was contingent on the state selling tax-exempt bonds,  and according to HUD field office officials, the state\u2019s difficulty doing so  had prevented the housing agency from securing the tax credit. State  officials told us they notified the project developer on August 5, 2010, that  the tax-exempt bonds, which will generate the tax credits, had been  approved, which would allow the housing agency to submit its final  paperwork to HUD by September 18, 2010.", "Additionally, HUD field staff have taken several steps to assist public  housing agencies in obligating Recovery Act competitive grant funds by  the September 2010 deadline. HUD field officials told us that they have  been communicating regularly with housing agencies via e-mail and  telephone to address their questions, provide technical assistance, and  monitor their progress. For example, field staff in one field office in Texas  use weekly conference calls to communicate with all of the housing  agencies in their jurisdiction and answer their questions about obligation- related issues for competitive grants. The officials also told us they have  dedicated three staff to work with the five public housing agencies under  their jurisdiction that received 14 competitive grants. HUD field staff in  Illinois have contacted each competitive grant recipient in their region on  a weekly basis and use an internal tracking sheet to monitor progress.  HUD officials in Massachusetts have provided additional oversight to  smaller housing agencies to help them better understand federal  procurement policies. Based in part on these efforts, HUD field staff  believed that housing agencies in Massachusetts would meet the  September 2010 obligation deadline.", "As we note in our May 2010 Recovery Act report, HUD plans to  redistribute $17.16 million of competitive and formula grant funds that  were rejected or returned by housing agencies by awarding a new set of  competitive grants. HUD plans to redistribute these funds to qualified  housing agencies that previously applied for competitive grants but did not  receive them because HUD had obligated all of the nearly $1 billion  allocated to the program. Given HUD\u2019s emphasis on green, energy-efficient  housing, HUD will limit the redistribution of funds to those applications  for energy retrofit projects. Prior to funding any of the remaining  applications, HUD planned to verify that potential recipients still would be  able to complete the work outlined in their original applications and that  they currently are in compliance with Recovery Act requirements. Of the  23 public housing agencies that HUD has contacted and verified their  eligibility to receive additional competitive grant funds, 22 agencies  accepted the additional funds. According to HUD officials, they may be  able to redistribute these funds by the end of fiscal year 2010. According to  HUD officials, once the housing agencies receive the redistributed funds,  housing agencies must obligate 100 percent of the funds within 1 year,  expend 60 percent within 2 years, and expend 100 percent within 3 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Housing Capital Fund Formula Grants Have Also Supported a Variety of Projects", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act required HUD to allocate $3 billion through the Public  Housing Capital Fund to public housing agencies using the same formula  for amounts made available in fiscal year 2008. HUD allocated Capital  Fund formula dollars to 3,134 public housing agencies shortly after  passage of the Recovery Act and, after entering into agreements with  housing agencies, obligated these funds on March 18, 2009. As we  previously reported, all housing agencies met the March 17, 2010,  obligation deadline for formula grants by either obligating all of their funds  or rejecting or returning a portion of the funds. The Recovery Act also  required that public housing agencies expend 60 percent of their formula  funds within 2 years from when the funds became available and expend  100 percent of their formula grant funds within 3 years from when the  funds became available. Housing agencies have been making progress in  drawing down funds in accordance with these deadlines. According to  HUD data, as of August 7, 2010, 3,075 housing agencies had drawn down  funds totaling more than $1.6 billion from HUD, or about 55 percent of the  total allocated to the housing agencies, to pay for project expenses already  incurred (see fig. 25).", "Public housing agency officials said they have been using these funds to  support a variety of improvement projects at public housing sites,  including performing roofing and gutter work, replacing windows and  doors, rehabilitating unit interiors, and replacing heating, cooling, and hot  water systems. For example, a housing agency in California used formula  funds to rehabilitate vacant units at two sites quickly to make them  available for lease to prospective low-income tenants. Work at both sites  included repairing damaged walls, ceilings, and floors; removing old  plumbing fixtures; replacing tile and appliances; and painting the interiors  of units (see fig. 26).", "In Pennsylvania, a housing agency is using formula funds to rehabilitate 23  row houses on the last remaining blighted block adjacent to a large  redevelopment the housing agency had already completed. Combined with  the previous redevelopment, once this project is complete, there will be  more than 700 total units in an approximate four square block area. Work  on the last block of the development began in March 2010 (see fig. 27).  According to housing agency officials, this redevelopment project not only  has provided additional public housing units, but also has increased  property values for row homes in the area from $40,000 or $50,000 to  asking prices of up to $125,000.", "HUD has employed multiple monitoring efforts for Recovery Act funds and  has found that only a few housing agencies had deficiencies relating to  their obligations. For the second year of implementation, HUD\u2019s strategy  for monitoring Recovery Act formula and competitive grant funds includes  a combination of remote and on-site reviews of housing agencies\u2019  administration of Recovery Act requirements, the same approach it used  for monitoring housing agencies during the first year of the Recovery Act.  Specifically for the formula grant funds, HUD developed a four-tier  monitoring approach that includes  quick-look reviews of all Recovery Act formula grant obligation  documents generated from February 26, 2010, to March 17, 2010, by  543 housing agencies that had obligated less than 90 percent of  formula grant funds as of February 26, 2010. HUD completed the quick- look reviews in July 2010;    on-site and remote reviews. Housing agencies currently designated as  troubled will have a minimum of one on-site review. Housing agencies  that are nontroubled may be subject to additional remote or on-site  reviews depending upon factors including having open audit findings,  failing to expend funds in prior years, and having procurement-related  deficiencies such as not revising procurement policies to reflect  Recovery Act requirements. HUD anticipates that about 25 percent of  grant recipients will be subject to these reviews, which the agency  plans to complete by February 2011;  quality assurance and quality control reviews by HUD\u2019s Office of Field  Operations, which HUD plans to conduct between December 2010 and  March 2011; and  independent reviews (performed by an outside contractor) of housing  agencies that HUD identified as being the top 100 to 125 funded  agencies with the largest formula grant award amount. The  independent reviews are to be completed by June 2011.", "According to HUD officials, as a result of its quick-look reviews of 543  housing agencies, HUD staff identified 26 housing agencies that were  potentially deficient in meeting HUD requirements for obligating formula  grant funds and required further review. For example, some housing  agencies signed contracts to obligate funds after the March 17, 2010,  deadline. HUD staff also determined that some housing agencies obligated  funds for products and services that were not approved for Recovery Act  use, such as paying the local police department to provide security  services. In addition, HUD staff identified 24 housing agencies with minor  deficiencies that did not warrant further review. Finally, there were 22  housing agencies that did not submit final documentation requested by  HUD staff for the quick-look reviews. HUD plans to conduct on-site  reviews of those housing agencies if they do not submit the requested  documentation.", "HUD created a panel comprised of officials from its Office of Field  Operations, Office of Capital Improvements, and Office of General  Counsel to examine in greater detail those 26 housing agencies with  potential deficiencies identified via the quick-look reviews, as well as  potential deficiencies identified by other means. Of the 26 housing  agencies, the panel determined that deficiencies at 8 housing agencies  were significant and necessitated a recapture of funds. As of August 27,  2010, the panel reviews identified approximately $1 million in Recovery  Act funds that necessitated recapture. HUD is in the process of  recapturing these funds and will return them to the Department of the  Treasury. HUD plans to continue conducting panel reviews and will  recapture Recovery Act funds from any housing agency found to have  deficiencies.", "HUD adopted a similar multireview approach for its second-year  monitoring of Recovery Act competitive grant funds. HUD has been  conducting remote reviews of all 393 competitive grants and had planned  to complete them by August 20, 2010. As of August 23, 2010, HUD field  staff reported having completed 371 remote reviews of competitive grants.  HUD officials are in the process of analyzing the results of these reviews.  While HUD officials have not completed their reviews, as of August 27,  2010, the agency may recapture approximately $12 million in competitive  grant funds based on remote review findings and other means. For  example, after reviewing one project\u2019s proposed building site, HUD staff  found that the project would be located in an industrial space next to a  railroad track with little access to roadways, raising both transportation  and environmental concerns. HUD also plans to conduct quality assurance  and quality control reviews for a random sample of 20 to 25 percent of the  remote reviews, which HUD plans to complete by September 2010. In  October and November 2010, HUD also plans to review obligations made  by housing agencies that had not fully obligated their grant funds within 2  weeks of the September 2010 deadline. Finally, from January to March 17,  2011, HUD plans to conduct on-site reviews of all eight housing agencies  that received competitive grant funds and were designated as troubled as  of September 30, 2009. Given that less than half of the competitive grant  funds have been obligated to date, we believe that it is important for HUD  to continue to closely monitor progress in meeting the obligation deadline.  In addition, because HUD identified some deficiencies among those  housing agencies that obligated their formula grant funds near the  deadline, we believe it will be important for HUD also to review those  competitive grant obligations made by housing agencies just prior to the  deadline.", "As part of its second-year strategy, HUD developed a management plan for  the administration of Recovery Act funds, including the need for an  additional 11 FTEs to carry out Recovery Act responsibilities. This was in  response to our March 2010 recommendation that HUD develop such a  plan to address its resource needs for both the Recovery Act funds and the  existing Capital Fund program. Similarly, HUD\u2019s Office of Public and  Indian Housing also agreed to develop a management plan addressing the  activities and resources needed to administer its existing Capital Fund  program. In July 2010, HUD provided us with its management plan for the  Public Housing Capital Fund program. The plan summarized the key  activities HUD undertakes to monitor and facilitate the use of these funds  by program area, including rule and policy development, planning,  program awards, program management, technical assistance, and  reporting. The plan also included the specific activities, tasks, and  resources used for each of these existing program areas, identifying  approximately 91 existing FTEs in its headquarters and field offices to  support these activities. According to HUD\u2019s management plan, HUD\u2019s  current staffing level is sufficient to manage its existing Capital Fund  program, but the agency could more efficiently utilize its current  resources. As a result, HUD plans to realign current staff to focus on its  core missions, including Recovery Act responsibilities.", "HUD\u2019s management plan for its existing Capital Fund program states that  HUD currently has the staff and resources required to effectively  implement its core programs. However, officials in two HUD field offices  we visited stated that they revised their oversight strategies for their  regular programs to accommodate Recovery Act work. For example,  officials in one HUD field office told us that most of the field office\u2019s  resources have been devoted to the Recovery Act and, as a result, staff  have done less on-site monitoring of non-Recovery Act grant recipients.  However, the officials noted that their staff still have been conducting  remote monitoring of all recipients, although staff have not conducted any  asset management reviews of grant recipients this year. At another HUD  field office, an official told us that since the Recovery Act was passed,  Recovery Act work has been a top priority for HUD nationwide. He noted  that other housing work, especially conducting on-site reviews, has been  deferred to meet Recovery Act requirements. According to HUD  headquarters officials, as a consequence of field office monitoring of  Recovery Act requirements, field staff conducted reviews (on-site or  remote) of every housing agency in the country, something they would not  have accomplished in the course of their routine monitoring activities.

South Carolina\u2014which did not  meet the February deadline and did not have enough demand\u2014returned  $13 million of its original $25.4 million TCAP allocation. Alabama, which  did meet the deadline, returned $3 million of its original $32 million  allocation because it did not have enough demand for TCAP funds and  would not be able to use all the funds. (We further discuss why some  HFAs were challenged to meet deadlines for TCAP and the Section 1602  Program later in this section.) HUD officials told us that they plan to  reallocate the $16 million through a competitive process and develop  criteria to be issued in a HUD notice this fall. HUD officials said they  expect only HFAs that have demonstrated program progress to be eligible  for consideration since the existing TCAP deadlines for disbursing 75  percent of funds by February 2011 still would apply. HUD officials told us  that they heard informally from about 20 HFAs interested in receiving  additional TCAP funds.", "For the Section 1602 Program, Treasury had obligated $5.5 billion and  outlayed about 25.5 percent ($1.4 billion) as of July 31, 2010, up from the  13.6 percent outlayed as of April 30, 2010 (see fig. 29).", "Unlike HUD, Treasury has not taken back any funds because the first  deadline for the HFAs to disburse funds is December 31, 2010. Specifically,  under Section 1602 Program rules, HFAs must commit the funding to  projects by December 2010 and can continue to disburse funds to awarded  projects through December 31, 2011, provided that the project owners  spend at least 30 percent of the eligible project costs by December 31,  2010. HFAs must disburse all Section 1602 Program funds by December  2011, or the funds the HFAs have not disbursed must be returned to  Treasury. Originally, Treasury\u2019s guidance required that HFAs had to make  all Section 1602 Program disbursements by December 31, 2010, or return  the undisbursed funds to Treasury, but Treasury extended the  disbursement deadline to December 31, 2011.", "In the six previous Recovery Act reports, we have collected and reported  data on programs receiving substantial Recovery Act funds in 16 selected  states and the District of Columbia. These 16 states and the District of  Columbia together have about 65 percent of the U.S. population and will  receive an estimated two-thirds of the TCAP funds and about 60 percent of  the Section 1602 Program funds.

Because HFAs must disburse their TCAP and  Section 1602 Program funds to project owners within 3 days, these figures  would closely track disbursements. As shown in figure 30, Arizona, Iowa,  and the District of Columbia have drawn down more than 50 percent of  their TCAP funds, and Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania have drawn  down more than 50 percent of their Section 1602 Program funds as of July  31, 2010. When we reported in May, North Carolina was the only state out  of the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia to have drawn down  more than 50 percent of its funds from one of the programs.", "However, the level of outlays, and therefore HFA spending, continues to  vary considerably across the states. We previously reported that the  difference in spending across the 16 states and the District of Columbia  depended on when the HFA requested Section 1602 Program funds, the  level of construction activity, and the HFA\u2019s implementation timeline.  For example, Treasury officials told us that while 40 HFAs had requested  funds by September 2009, the Mississippi Home Corporation (MHC)  requested funds for the first time in February 2010. According to Treasury  officials, Treasury outlayed funds to MHC for the first time on August 12,  2010.

For example, some owners of stalled projects said that their  projects could not have continued without TCAP and Section 1602  Program funds. TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds also made some  rural projects and special needs population projects\u2014such as farm worker  housing, housing for formerly homeless, and housing for the disabled\u2014 more feasible and attractive to third-party investors. Officials from one  HFA we interviewed told us that investors scrutinize the financial outlook  for rural projects because they expect that the income for these projects  will be tight or non-existent.  HFAs, project owners, and investors also told  us that in a difficult market, investors are less likely to risk investments in  these types of projects. We interviewed nine HFAs that awarded financing  to 385 projects\u2014154 (40 percent) were rural and 37 (10 percent) were  special needs population projects\u2014which may not have moved forward  without the assistance of the TCAP and Section 1602 Program.", "LIHTC projects that received TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds  typically had less investor equity than LIHTC projects had prior to the  economic downturn. The decrease in investor equity varied for each  project and by state. The nine HFAs that we interviewed reported that  equity in LIHTC projects prior to the economic downturn generally ranged  from 50 to 80 percent of the total financing for a project. In contrast, for  projects receiving TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds from the nine  HFAs that we interviewed, investor equity represents on average 43  percent of a project\u2019s overall financing. For LIHTC projects receiving  TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds, the decrease in investor equity has  been offset by the increase in federal funds.", "Some HFA officials, project owners, and third-party investors that we  interviewed currently believe that demand for LIHTCs is re-emerging since  the credit markets were severely disrupted in 2008. However, some of  them said that third-party investor demand still was not at a level where  most projects were feasible. Investor demand and tax credit prices have  been picking up in some states and regions more than others. According to  some investors with whom we spoke, investor demand and tax credit  prices tended to be higher on the coasts than in the middle of the country.  Investors also preferred certain types of projects, such as those that were  larger, located in urban areas, and catered to seniors. Projects that were  smaller, located in rural areas, and targeted special needs populations  more often lacked third-party investors.", "Since the economic downturn, the composition of third-party investors  also has changed. First, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which according to  an investor, had bought the largest share of tax credits (40 percent in 2006)  and were the primary third-party investors in special population projects,  exited the marketplace. Second, according to another investor, the low tax  credit prices have resulted in higher yields that in turn have attracted  \u201cyield-driven\u201d investors, including insurance companies, large  corporations, and individuals. Banks, which had invested in the tax credit  markets primarily because of Community Reinvestment Act requirements,  have continued to do so. However, if tax credit prices continue to rise,  yields will decrease, which may cause \u201cyield-driven\u201d investors to exit the  market.", "Because the LIHTC market is still rebounding and some states continue to  face challenges attracting investors, the majority of HFAs that we  interviewed support temporarily extending the Section 1602 Program. If  the Section 1602 Program were not extended, some project owners  anticipated scaling back development activities and being more selective  about which projects they develop. Some HFAs and project owners who  supported the extension of the Section 1602 Program believe the funds  would be most useful if used to fill financing gaps, to fund rural and  special needs population projects, and to provide grants or funds to  nonprofits that are developing projects that target such needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some HFAs and Projects May Face Challenges in Meeting HUD and Treasury Deadlines for Using Funds", "paragraphs": ["Some HFAs and projects may face challenges in meeting TCAP and  Section 1602 Program deadlines for reasons ranging from increased  workload to the time needed to assemble financing to construction delays.

One  HFA reported that it typically closed from 18 to 22 projects annually, but  this year would close 60 projects. Two other HFAs reported that they  typically closed from 8 to 15 projects annually, but expected to close 50  and 85 projects this year, respectively.", "Most HFAs Likely Will Meet TCAP Deadlines, but Those That Have  Delayed Disbursing TCAP Funds May Face Challenges  For TCAP, the potential challenges HFAs face appear to be related to how  they structured the timing of the TCAP disbursements. According to HUD  officials, it is difficult to determine which states may have difficulty  meeting TCAP spending deadlines because states took different  approaches to awarding funds.  A few HFAs may be at a disadvantage in  terms of meeting 2011 and 2012 deadlines because they chose to award  TCAP funds late in the development process to ensure that commitments  from other financing sources are in place and the projects will be  successfully completed. As a result, these HFAs have disbursed a small  percentage of their TCAP funds to date. The HFA officials we interviewed  in nine states did not believe the TCAP disbursement deadline was a  challenge for their projects.", "Treasury Plans for Ensuring That Section 1602 Program Projects  Meet Spending Deadlines Remain Unclear  According to some HFA officials, some project owners may face  challenges meeting the 30 percent spending deadline (December 31, 2010)  for Section 1602 Program projects, due to reasons that affected some  projects allocated Section 1602 Program or TCAP funds, ranging from the  timing needed to assemble or disburse funding by HFAs, litigation, and  routine construction delays. According to HFA officials with whom we  spoke, some projects needed to wait for FHA mortgage insurance approval  or approval from other sources of subsidies before receiving final HFA  approval. Officials from one HFA with whom we spoke said that while all  their Section 1602 Program projects were shovel-ready, getting all parties  educated and comfortable about the requirements of the new program  took time. Some projects had been stalled for months, and it took time to  \u201cramp up\u201d all parties engaged in the projects. In addition, some projects  encountered delays during the construction process due to weather or  other issues typical of development projects such as waiting for  construction permits from local agencies. Other projects were delayed due  to legal issues unrelated to the Section 1602 Program. For example,  Florida Housing Finance Corporation officials told us that as of August  2010, about $22.3 million in Section 1602 Program funds were allocated to  projects involved in litigation.", "Furthermore, in HFAs that delayed the decision to participate in the  Section 1602 Program or that had a slow start to launching the Section  1602 Program projects have collectively had less time to spend eligible  funds than in other states where funds were awarded earlier. For example,  the MHC did not request Section 1602 Program funds from Treasury until  February 2010. MHC told us that it is concerned that each of its 17  projects receiving Section 1602 Program funds may not meet the 30  percent spending deadline. One HFA said that a typical LIHTC project  would take about 15 months from applying for funds to closing the project  and commencing construction. Our review of projects in nine states shows  that these HFAs had not yet awarded Section 1602 Program funds to 75  projects as of June 30, 2010. Further, as of June 30, 2010, about 39 percent  of Section 1602 Program projects (98 of 252 projects) that have been  awarded funds in these nine states have not yet closed, which is the first  step to being able to draw funds from entities that provide financing.", "Treasury initially required HFAs to return all Section 1602 Program funds  not disbursed by December 31, 2010. In a regulation of August 31, 2009,  Treasury extended the deadline for disbursing Section 1602 Program funds  by 1 year, provided project owners met the 30 percent spending  requirement. Treasury had determined that completion of projects by  December 31, 2010, was too restrictive and would preclude funding of  otherwise eligible projects. Treasury officials told us that the new 30  percent requirement was put in place to assure that project owners were  making some progress by the original (December 31, 2010) deadline date.", "Missing the deadline for the 30 percent spending requirement could have  significant implications for the viability of Section 1602 Program projects.  If project owners failed to meet this spending deadline, they would not be  eligible to receive any additional Section 1602 Program funds. If prevented  from receiving the rest of their Section 1602 Program award, project  owners might not be able to find replacement financing and committed  financing sources might withdraw their funds. If projects could not secure  replacement financing quickly, they would be unlikely to be completed in  accordance with Section 1602 Program and LIHTC requirements and  would be stalled again. Under such a scenario, the HFA would be  responsible for recapturing any Section 1602 Program funds that were  disbursed to the project prior to the 30 percent spending deadline.", "Treasury officials told us that they plan to enforce the deadline  requirement, and would provide written guidance to HFAs that will  describe the kind and format of information to be reported to Treasury to  document whether projects have met the spending deadline. Treasury  officials told us that they do not plan to collect this information until after  the deadline has passed.

For long-term monitoring under the  LIHTC program, third-party investors in the project perform long-term  asset management, and HFAs perform limited compliance reviews.", "HFAs must review LIHTC projects at least annually to determine  project owner compliance with tenant qualifications and rent and  income limits.", "Additionally, every 3 years the HFAs must conduct on-site inspections  of all buildings in each LIHTC project and inspect at least 20 percent of  the LIHTC units and resident files associated with those units.", "However, under TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, HFAs must monitor  the disbursement and use of funds throughout the construction period.  HFAs also must perform long-term asset management, which imposes  ongoing responsibilities on the HFAs for the viability of each project.", "An HFA\u2019s asset management activities may include monitoring current  financial and physical aspects of project operations.

These approaches are designed to monitor the physical and  financial health of projects and compliance with LIHTC affordability  restrictions.", "In response to an open-ended question in our survey asking about what  changes in oversight activities HFAs planned to put in place to assure  compliance with the TCAP and Section 1602 Program, 37 HFAs said they  would make some changes in oversight activities, 11 said they would make  no changes in oversight activities, and 6 said they were not sure what  changes they would make or they did not answer the question. Changes  in activities varied across HFAs. For example, of the 37 HFAs that said  they would make some changes, 13 HFAs noted that they would make  changes to their disbursement process to more closely track the use of  TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds, 9 HFAs said they would increase  overall monitoring of projects or reporting required by project owners, and  7 HFAs planned to implement or increase the frequency of site visits or  inspections. Eleven HFAs said they would not change their oversight  activities, but 6 of those 11 HFAs noted that they would rely on their  experience in and established procedures for monitoring their lending  programs or disbursement of other federal funds.", "HFAs Have Increased Oversight during Construction Phase of  TCAP and Section 1602 Program Projects  HFAs have been providing greater oversight during the construction  period for projects that receive TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds.  This oversight includes monitoring disbursements of the program funds,  overseeing the construction process, and ensuring compliance by TCAP  projects with federal cross-cutting requirements such as Davis-Bacon  wage requirements and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969  (NEPA). For example, HFAs must review payrolls for all TCAP projects  to ensure that project owners and contractors are paying prevailing wages  to individuals employed in the construction of the projects. HFAs also had  to ensure that all TCAP projects complied with the NEPA environmental  review process prior to receiving any TCAP funds. However, according to  HUD officials, up to one-third of HFAs lacked prior experience in  overseeing compliance with these federal cross-cutting requirements.", "Under TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, HFAs have been disbursing a  greater volume of funds than in the past and, as a result, have taken  additional steps to limit risk and increase monitoring. For example, one  HFA we interviewed expected to disburse the same amount of funds in 1  month as it previously disbursed annually. For standard LIHTC projects,  HFAs only allocate tax credits and do not disburse funds. HFAs assume  greater risk by disbursing TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds because  they are responsible for repaying funds to HUD and Treasury, respectively,  in the event of noncompliance. The nine HFAs we interviewed are  supporting an average of 23 to 62 percent of the total development costs of  projects through awards of TCAP or Section 1602 Program funds. Prior to  the Recovery Act, three of these HFAs typically did not provide loans or  grants to LIHTC projects, but now they are providing an average of 23 to  47 percent of total project financing through TCAP and Section 1602  Program project awards. The remaining six HFAs typically funded up to  about 33 percent of the total project financing for some LIHTC projects  through other loan programs prior to the Recovery Act. HFAs have  mitigated risks by broadening the scope of guarantees and by requiring  project owners to certify the accuracy of the information provided.", "Approaches to overseeing the construction process varied across HFAs,  although most HFAs we interviewed planned to apply their existing  construction oversight framework to oversee TCAP and Section 1602  Program projects. These activities include site inspections of varying  frequency. For example, some HFAs we interviewed planned to conduct  monthly site inspections, while two HFAs said that construction  superintendents would visit project sites twice per month or more  frequently if needed. Site inspections help confirm whether work  performed on a project is carried out as planned and approved by the  HFA. One HFA also told us that it planned to facilitate communication  among project owners, investors, and other lenders by sharing information  or holding more frequent meetings with these stakeholders.", "HFAs and project owners told us that meeting Davis-Bacon wage reporting  and NEPA environmental review requirements for TCAP projects required  time and resources, and it was easier for HFAs with prior experience to  meet the requirements. We previously reported that HFAs viewed Davis- Bacon and NEPA requirements as a challenge and followed up with HFAs  and project owners on ways that they have been meeting the requirements.  To comply with Davis-Bacon wage requirements, some HFAs developed  new processes for data collection and planned to apply additional scrutiny  to data received from project owners or more frequent reporting, and  other HFAs developed training for project owners. To comply with NEPA  requirements, some HFAs and project owners drew upon their experience  administering HOME funds, which also require NEPA compliance.  Project owners said that in some cases they allocated additional resources  to projects to complete environmental reviews ahead of project closings.", "In Response to New Asset Management Responsibilities, HFAs  Have Increased Long-Term Monitoring and Put in Place Stricter  Requirements for Project Owners  In response to the new asset management responsibilities HFAs have  accepted under TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, all HFAs we  interviewed reported that they had strengthened their procedures for long- term monitoring to meet the program requirements, mitigate risks, and  help ensure projects\u2019 long-term physical and financial viability.  Approaches to long-term asset management varied depending on an HFA\u2019s  resources, workload, and asset management experience. However, all nine  of the HFAs we interviewed have implemented some oversight changes,  such as increasing the number of inspection visits over the 15-year tax  credit compliance period and the frequency of reporting, as well as  enhancing financial monitoring of projects receiving TCAP and Section  1602 Program funds when compared with standard LIHTC projects.", "Of the nine HFAs we interviewed, four HFAs said that instead of  inspecting projects every 3 years as required by the LIHTC program, they  will inspect projects annually or more often. Seven HFAs said that they  will require reports from project owners on a monthly, quarterly, or as- requested basis that may include information such as project income  statements. Five of the nine HFAs we interviewed have the ability to  approve and remove the project\u2019s management agent and general partner  of the project owner if the project is in noncompliance with LIHTC  requirements or the terms of the HFA\u2019s agreement with the project owner.  Two HFAs said that they have new software systems in place to manage  asset management activities, and four said they plan to provide additional  training for staff to manage the monitoring and reporting for TCAP and  Section 1602 Program projects. HFAs said that they have also  strengthened financial requirements for project owners. All nine HFAs  require annual financial audits or reports. Other changes HFAs have made  include requiring or performing capital needs assessments to determine  the condition and expected life of the physical infrastructure, calculating  replacement costs, and assessing whether a project\u2019s replacement reserve  will be adequate to meet the expected capital needs of a project. Some  HFAs also require project owners to provide guaranties that the project  owner will ensure compliance with program requirements or the project  owner will be personally liable to repay TCAP and Section 1602 Program  funds to the HFA. Some HFAs also have strengthened requirements for  financial reserves or changed how and when the reserves can be accessed  to ensure that there is a source of funds to draw upon in the event the  project encounters operating difficulties. Some project owners with whom  we spoke said that HFAs have been careful in structuring requirements to  protect the HFAs\u2019 interests and that in some cases the HFAs\u2019 requirements  and plans for monitoring were stricter than those typically required by  third-party investors.", "Nearly all HFAs we interviewed noted that a third-party investor provides  additional oversight and monitoring or financial interest in a project. TCAP  requires tax credits to remain in transactions, and project owners typically  sell the tax credits to third-party investors. Therefore, most TCAP projects  have some level of private investment and oversight. In contrast, the  Section 1602 Program allows HFAs to exchange all of the tax credits  awarded to a project in return for Section 1602 Program funds. As a result,  many Section 1602 Program projects do not have third-party investor  oversight. However, some HFAs have required third-party investor  participation in all or the majority of their Section 1602 Program projects,  and they plan to work in coordination with investors on asset management  activities. Based on information from our survey, 32 HFAs expected to  have a total of 485 projects without third-party investors out of a total of  825 projects expected to be financed with Section 1602 Program funds.  In our survey, about half of the HFAs planned to outsource asset  management functions for TCAP and the Section 1602 Program. Based on  our interviews with nine HFAs, we found that HFAs with past asset  management experience and HFAs with a smaller volume of projects often  chose to conduct their own asset management activities over the 15-year  compliance period. In contrast, HFAs with little asset management  experience or many projects requiring oversight often chose to hire a  third-party contractor to perform asset management activities.  However,  one HFA in each of these categories chose to work in coordination with  individual investors on asset management activities rather than relying  solely on its own asset management efforts or the work of outsourced  asset managers.", "Five of the nine HFAs we interviewed are conducting their own asset  management activities because they have significant experience managing  loan portfolios or because the number of projects is manageable. One HFA  we interviewed has 35 years of asset management experience, and two  have 20 years of asset management experience. One of these HFAs also  conducts asset management for HUD\u2019s performance-based contract  administration program and has won awards for its asset management  systems. Six HFAs we interviewed said they have or are developing  policies, procedures, or \u201cwatch lists\u201d to assess project performance and  identify projects that may be in need of additional monitoring.", "One of the two HFAs we interviewed planning to outsource asset  management activities has contracted with a national syndicator to  provide asset management for its projects without private investment.  The syndicator has said that it will provide the same asset management  services to the HFA as it would provide to investors in its LIHTC  investment funds. The HFA has a staff person that is receiving an asset  management certification and will work closely with the syndicator to  ensure that asset management functions are performed in accordance with  the syndicator\u2019s scope of work. The syndicator\u2019s scope of work covers  both the leasing and asset management phases and includes activities such  as providing quarterly project performance reports that rate the risk of the  project based on market conditions and project owner capacity,  conducting annual property inspections, and performing annual long-term  financial analysis. The syndicator said that it helped the HFA structure a  more comprehensive scope of work because it felt that the asset  management activities started too late to ensure project success.", "HFAs noted a range of challenges associated with asset management. One  HFA we interviewed said that explaining the HFA\u2019s new asset management  role to developers has been a challenge because the HFA does not usually  act as a lender or party with long-term interests in the projects. Rather, the  agency\u2019s primary role is that of tax credit allocation with compliance  monitoring as required by IRS. HFAs also noted the cost of asset  management as a challenge. A few HFAs are charging low or no fees for  asset management because of the stress the fee puts on the project  budgets. Other HFAs have estimated a fee based on market research and  costs associated with their current operations, but they are not sure the  fee will be sufficient to cover costs. Most HFAs we interviewed estimated  that their initial asset management costs would be highest during the first  years implementing TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, including the  initial construction monitoring period. For example, one HFA estimated  that 20 - 30 percent of its asset management costs would be incurred  within the first 2 years of overseeing TCAP and Section 1602 Program  projects. However, some HFAs and investors noted future challenges as  projects age. They said that between the fifth to twelfth year of a project\u2019s  life, projects may begin to show signs of physical and financial stress due  to capital replacement needs, diminishing reserves, or resident turnover.  One investor said that HFAs may not have the financial resources to  support troubled projects in the same way as an investor would."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Strategy for Monitoring TCAP Does Not Fully Consider Project Risks", "paragraphs": ["HUD officials told us that the agency has been relying on existing  monitoring systems to determine whether funds have been spent properly  or to track projects that have not been complying with the terms and  conditions of TCAP agreements. The monitoring systems consist of HUD  Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits (thus far ongoing in three states),  HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (OFHEO) reviews in  10 states, HOME reviews done by HUD field offices when projects include  both TCAP and HOME funds, and HFA reviews. HUD officials told us that  they can rely on existing Office of Community Planning and Development  (CPD) field staff to carry out HUD\u2019s monitoring and also would plan to  look for patterns of problems identified by the OIG, OFHEO, CPD staff, or  HFAs during oversight and review activities. HUD officials noted that the  agency\u2019s emphasis so far has been on the obligation, outlay, and tracking  of funds to the HFAs and their disbursement to project owners.", "As well as HFAs, HUD officials also expect that third-party investors will  monitor TCAP projects for compliance in the same way that these  stakeholders have been responsible for monitoring LIHTC projects. TCAP  requires tax credits to remain in transactions, and project owners typically  sell the tax credits to third-party investors. However, we found that in  some cases projects included a limited amount of LIHTCs and project  owners chose not to sell these credits to a third-party, thereby limiting or  precluding third-party oversight of these projects. In traditional LIHTC  projects, third-party investors play an important role in ensuring  compliance with tax credit program requirements because they risk losing  their ability to claim the tax credits if the project is not in compliance with  these requirements. Some HFAs told us that they will coordinate with and  rely on reviews and audits that investors and private construction lenders  perform to satisfy the HFAs\u2019 asset management obligations under TCAP.  In cases when an HFA is coordinating with a third-party investor, the  investor may provide early warning information that would be useful to  the HFA if the HFA had to act quickly to assist the project or ensure  compliance with TCAP requirements. But, some TCAP projects received a  nominal amount of tax credits, and project owners chose not to sell the  tax credits. These projects lack the additional oversight provided by third- party investors. In these cases, HFAs may be the sole monitor, other than  HUD, ensuring that funds are spent properly and that the project owners  comply with TCAP terms and conditions.", "HUD officials acknowledged that in the absence of a significant third-party  investment, the amount of overall scrutiny a TCAP project would receive  is reduced; however, HUD officials told us that at this point in time they  were not aware of how many projects either had nominal LIHTC awards  or lacked third-party investors. Our limited review showed that some  TCAP projects in Florida received a nominal amount of tax credits and  lacked third-party investors that otherwise would provide an added layer  of oversight for compliance with TCAP requirements. Specifically, we  found that 13 of 25 projects (52 percent) that were allocated TCAP funds  in Florida had received a nominal amount of LIHTCs.  The Florida Housing  Finance Corporation (FHFC) explained that it had awarded $100 in  LIHTCs to each of these projects and that the project owners made $650  equity investments to the projects in return for the tax credit awards  instead of selling the tax credits to a third-party investor.  FHFC plans to  institute oversight activities for all of its TCAP and Section 1602 Program  projects.  Nonetheless, HUD has not required HFAs to enhance their  oversight or take other actions to account for the absence or limited  involvement of third-party investors. Without the oversight provided by  third-party investors and with the limited monitoring planned by HUD,  these TCAP projects may constitute a higher risk to HUD and to the HFAs  that they will become troubled or fall out of compliance with LIHTC  requirements.", "In addition, although HUD\u2019s monitoring strategy relies partly on  monitoring by third-party investors and HOME program reviews, HUD  officials told us that they will not know how many TCAP projects have  third-party investors or how many also have HOME funds until projects  are completed and HFAs submit final reports on the projects. Therefore,  HUD cannot currently determine the number of projects that are being  monitored by others. Additionally, HUD does not currently know how  many TCAP projects will be covered through HOME reviews. According to  HUD officials, once projects are complete and all project information has  been reported to HUD, it plans to use that information to tailor a  monitoring plan to these projects. It will be important for HUD\u2019s TCAP  monitoring strategy to recognize the differences in risk for projects  without third-party investor oversight and those with investor oversight as  well as those projects not covered by HOME reviews.", "As discussed above, HUD officials said they have been focused on getting  Recovery Act funds to HFAs. Since beginning TCAP, HUD has drawn upon  limited staff resources in headquarters to administer and track the  spending of TCAP funds\u2014its Office of Affordable Housing Programs  administers TCAP, and four existing headquarters staff from the HOME  program work on TCAP (three part-time and one full-time). HUD officials  noted that the Recovery Act does not set aside administrative resources to  HUD to either implement the TCAP program, which was performed by  existing HOME program staff, or to monitoring HFAs for compliance. In  comparison, the Recovery Act provided additional resources for  monitoring under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which HUD\u2019s  CPD also performs.", "Without a plan for identifying projects without third-party investor  oversight and ensuring sufficient oversight when investors are absent,  HUD will face constraints in ensuring that TCAP projects remain in  compliance with program requirements, some of which apply for 15 years  or more.

According to Treasury officials, they have designed a risk- based system in which they plan to conduct compliance monitoring on-site  for 23 HFAs and remote monitoring for the remainder of the HFAs by the  end of calendar year 2010. Whether monitoring is conducted on-site or  remotely depends on factors such as identified risks and the size of the  grant. The review generally consists of an interview, followed by a review  of program files, a review of a sample of project files, a review of financial  management information, and a cross-check to the records held at  Treasury. After the review is completed, if there are any findings, staff  request a corrective action or action plan, depending on the nature and  severity of the noncompliance. According to Treasury officials, if staff  recommend a corrective action or action plan, Treasury will follow up to  ensure that the HFA takes the necessary corrective action.

Treasury officials said that the kinds of issues they found in  their reviews relate to failure to properly document files, lack of a policy  to handle fraud by project owners, and, in one case, unresponsiveness to  Treasury\u2019s request for documentation. Treasury officials told us that these  issues were often resolved during the compliance review, but that some  issues required additional follow-up with the HFAs.

Jobs must be counted in accordance with methodology provided  by OMB. OMB guidance limits the number of jobs reported to the actual  use of the funds in each quarter. In cases of construction funding based on  a mix of financing sources, HFAs can count the jobs created or retained  based on the proportion of TCAP funds. In addition to reporting through  FederalReporting.gov, HFAs report information on TCAP projects through  two HUD systems. HFAs use HUD\u2019s Integrated Disbursement and  Information System to report on the selection of TCAP projects by HFAs  as well as disbursement of TCAP funds.

About two-thirds of the HFAs in our survey said that they will conduct a  review of the information being provided by the project owners, but others  said that they relied on signed statements from the project owners  attesting to the accuracy of the jobs estimates. Furthermore, because of  the differences in job reporting methodology for TCAP and the Section  1602 Program, job counts reported for the programs varied widely. We  previously reported that some HFAs were concerned about  underreporting jobs that TCAP funds created because of OMB\u2019s  requirement that they count only jobs directly funded by TCAP. They  said that because projects funded under TCAP would not have moved  forward without TCAP funds, all the jobs associated with the projects  should be counted.

However, our  review identified two areas of concern: one that relates to HUD\u2019s  identification of higher-risk TCAP projects and another that relates to  challenges that some project owners may face in meeting a December  2010 deadline for spending funds in Treasury\u2019s Section 1602 Program.", "Under TCAP, HFAs have increased responsibilities for asset management  and monitoring compliance of project owners with the terms and  conditions of the program.

Nonetheless, HUD has not identified projects that lack this  additional level of oversight and thus may be at higher risk of  noncompliance with TCAP and LIHTC requirements. Although HUD relies  in part on HFAs to provide oversight, HUD does not know the extent to  which the HFAs will provide additional oversight for projects that lack  third-party investors. HUD is relying on existing monitoring systems and  resources, but has not fully identified those projects that may be subject to  review under its existing system (such as TCAP projects that also have  HOME funds) or developed additional guidance or oversight of TCAP  projects where there is little or no third-party oversight. HUD could take a  more active role in monitoring TCAP projects\u2014first by identifying those  projects that may present a higher risk of noncompliance, and second by  identifying those projects that also have HOME funds. HUD could also  more effectively use limited oversight resources by using a risk-based  approach that considers whether a TCAP project has third-party investors  and whether HFAs are providing enhanced oversight. Likewise, by  gathering information about the number of the projects that have TCAP  and HOME funding, HUD could more effectively plan reviews and deploy  staff. Without a more rigorous approach to oversight, HUD will be limited  in its efforts to ensure that TCAP projects meet program requirements and  continue to provide a source of affordable housing.", "Treasury\u2019s regulations require project owners to spend 30 percent of  eligible project costs by December 31, 2010, to continue receiving  additional Section 1602 Program funds in 2011.

For instance, as of June 30, 2010, about 39 percent of Section 1602  Program projects that we reviewed have yet to close, leaving little time to  meet the spending deadline. Projects that do not meet the deadline would  not be eligible to receive any additional Section 1602 Program funds.

Because over 2,300 state,  local, and tribal governments are eligible for direct formula EECBG grants  and the grants are also awarded on a competitive basis, the program has  many different types and sizes of recipients. For example, each state-level  recipient must use at least 60 percent of its allocation to provide subgrants  to local government units that are not eligible for direct grants, making the  state the prime recipient while the local government unit is a subrecipient.  Larger local government units receive grants directly from DOE, making  them prime recipients.

For example, District of Columbia officials  from the District\u2019s Department of the Environment told us that their work  under the EECBG program had not started in time for them to report for  the period that ended on June 30, 2010. California Energy Commission  officials noted that they had only a few EECBG recipients for the last  reporting round, but there were 50 or 60 recipients for this fourth round.  Another recipient commented that reporting was fairly easy now because  they were only reporting internal data they controlled, as compared to  contractor data, but the official anticipated more complexity as the  program expands.", "Officials from all of the state-level government units we interviewed that  had FTEs to report said they followed OMB\u2019s December 18, 2009, guidance  on FTE calculations. Specifically, they collected the number of hours  worked that were funded by the Recovery Act and divided that total by the  number of hours in a full-time work schedule, with defined processes in  place to collect the EECBG recipient reported data. For example, Arizona  Department of Commerce officials said that their office is responsible for  reporting EECBG recipient data to the state\u2019s Office of Economic  Recovery centralized reporting team. The Office of Economic Recovery  works closely with the Arizona Department of Commerce to ensure that  the reporting data are accurate. Additionally, Arizona officials said there is  a review and approval process in place to check that the hours reported by  the program\u2019s subrecipients are accurate. Officials in the Colorado state  energy office noted that it has been easier collecting hours worked from  EECBG subrecipients because DOE requires reporting the hours worked  and the same data is used to convert hours to FTEs for OMB reporting.  However, officials from a few other states said that generating the most  comprehensive and complete job numbers available from subrecipients is  still a challenge. The same challenge surfaced in education and housing  programs that we previously reviewed.", "A few local government EECBG recipients we interviewed used methods  other than the OMB guidance to estimate their number of FTEs, possibly  resulting in over or undercounting. For example, while DOE guidance  explicitly states that the job-year estimate issued by the Council of  Economic Advisers for job creation potential is not appropriate in  determining direct jobs created or retained and should not be used for  reporting to either OMB or DOE, a New Jersey recipient informed us that  she planned to use this number to estimate her township\u2019s FTEs. We  informed the recipient that this was incorrect. In New York, a county  official said that an EECBG contractor was conducting work under a  Recovery Act contract, but the county did not report any FTEs in its most  recent quarterly report because the official did not think the contractor  had any documented jobs created or saved. Related to the problem with  complete FTE numbers, several EECBG recipients reported confusion  about including data from subrecipients on jobs, which OMB guidance  states should be included. For example, officials from a county in  California stated they received conflicting information about including  jobs from subrecipients and vendors in their recipient reports. The  officials said that the conflicting information emanated from different  levels within DOE and between DOE\u2019s and OMB\u2019s guidance. The county  officials believed they did not get a clear answer from DOE as to the  difference between subrecipients and vendors. Deciding that it was better  to over report jobs than to under report jobs, they included subrecipient  and vendor hours that could be project-related in their recipient reports.", "Based on the recipients we interviewed, there was some evidence that  larger EECBG direct grant recipients seemed to conduct more thorough  recipient reporting data quality reviews than smaller direct grant  recipients, possibly due to their enhanced administrative capacity. For  example, a large EECBG grant recipient in Georgia reported that it  improves data accuracy by prepopulating reports for subrecipients so they  only need to include job numbers and vendor disbursements. In some  instances, it also compares the subrecipient data to other documents, such  as invoices and Davis-Bacon reports. However, according to a city official  in Georgia, for their small grant, no specific data quality reviews are  conducted other than a city official reviewing the hours worked. Colorado  state officials said that communities that received under $2 million in  direct formula grants have more difficulty administering EECBG grants  and meeting the reporting requirements because they have limited staff  resources.

A few recipients,  however, did not estimate the number of FTEs correctly for this round of  reporting, resulting in under or over counting. For example, in one case,  subrecipients in Florida did not include the hours worked by contractors  who performed weatherization work at individual homes, which they  attributed to a lack of awareness of the requirement to report the hours. In  California, a local weatherization assistance provider also expressed  confusion regarding reporting subcontractor hours. In Pennsylvania, a  state official indicated some weatherization subrecipients experienced  difficulties, at least in their initial reports, in submitting FTE information  through a new Web-based reporting system that collects and calculates  FTE information from the subrecipients.

The DOE official  noted that access to FederalReporting.gov during the reporting period  helped DOE identify recipients who had not yet filed and helped assist  those who had unsuccessfully filed, entered the wrong awarding agency  code, or confused the reporting required by OMB with DOE\u2019s system. In  addition, he said that communicating the extended time frame for  reporting before the reporting period actually began alleviated last-minute  confusion or frustration on the part of recipients or reviewers, causing  fewer recipients to wait until the last minute to file. Also, the official  commented that the July 14 to July 20, 2010, late submission period, during  which recipients were still allowed to file, allowed recipients experiencing  access issues to FederalReporting.gov to submit reports. During this time  period, DOE staff was also able to identify and assist with issues such as  Central Contractor Registration numbers and getting new passwords for  the last approximately 100 recipients filing reports. The DOE official noted  that while the continuous correction provision has added to the workload  of the DOE team, the period allows them greater time to review more  recipient reported data than previously, identify potential errors, and work  with agency reviewers and recipients to improve data quality.", "The senior official listed a number of frustrations DOE encountered during  the fourth round of reporting, most of which are in areas where they felt  FederalReporting.gov is technologically limited. For example, according to  the official, FederalReporting.gov lacks some basic logic tests for  matching award numbers, with most of the mismatches resulting from  prefix differences. The lack of this matching capability creates extra work  for the DOE staff, but the Board declined to run separate matching  routines for each agency.", "In an April 2010 audit report of DOE\u2019s efforts to ensure the accuracy and  transparency of reported Recovery Act results, the DOE Inspector  General\u2019s (IG) office found that the department had taken a number of  actions designed to do so and made two recommendations, which DOE  had already started to address. For example, recipient reported data  elements are compared to information maintained in the department\u2019s  financial systems. The IG recommended that DOE adjust the quality  assurance process to include adding comparisons of other data elements,  and a senior DOE official reported that for this round of reporting, the  department has added several data elements to the original four that were  reviewed centrally by the headquarters Recovery Operations Group. Now  reviewers compare recipient reports in FederalReporting.gov against DOE  systems to identify recipient information that falls outside expected  results in seven different areas. According to DOE, these areas are key  project markers being tracked by the public, the administration, Congress,  and within the department to determine if the high-level goals of  stimulating the economy and creating jobs outlined in the Recovery Act  are being met. The DOE official said that increased attention has been  placed on data quality within DOE systems as a result of this review  process, which has created new communication channels and processes  to identify issues and correct them.

Because such a wide  variety of information is required and since some elements are being  reported for the first time, OMB used a variety of methods to train federal  agencies and recipients of Recovery Act funding on how to comply with  their reporting responsibilities. OMB and federal agencies provided several  types of clarifying information to recipients, as well as opportunities to  interact and ask questions or receive help with the reporting process.  These included weekly phone calls between OMB and groups representing  the state budget and comptrollers offices, weekly calls between state  reporting leads, webinars, a call center, and e-mail outreach.

Officials from Illinois noted that recipient  reporting was one of the few efforts that brought their otherwise very  independent state agencies together. Colorado state officials reported that  the program and accounting staffs within each state agency are working  together closely to help ensure the accuracy and quality of the Recovery  Act data. A few state officials, however, commented that although  communication with federal agencies and other entities has increased due  to the recipient reporting requirements, the communication is aimed  primarily at dispelling confusion and is not necessarily positive. For  example, Texas state officials commented that the one change that has  been prompted by recipient reporting is the significant effort required to  communicate reporting requirements to subrecipients and to collect,  review, and submit the data.", "Officials from a number of states expressed hopes that the increase in  intergovernmental interactions resulting from the Recovery Act reporting  requirements will continue after the act\u2019s reporting requirements expire.

Michigan officials noted that they hope the changes  will be long-standing. As another example, a representative from a state  association described Recovery Act-related problem solving between the  audit and technology communities.

As a result, it may take 15 months or more since the end of  the fiscal year in which the audit finding was initially identified before any  work is begun. Auditee\u2019s management reports their progress in taking  corrective action in the schedule of prior audit findings where the status of  the finding is reported as either corrected (closed) or not (open). The  auditor then reviews this schedule and it is included in the next Single  Audit reporting package. If the awarding agency delayed issuing a  management decision to the auditee, it is possible that corrective action on  the finding was also delayed, and, as a result, the finding may have  remained open. In addition, several state auditors have expressed  frustration regarding Single Audit findings that remain open years after  they were initially identified, without the auditee or the federal awarding  agency taking action. The lack of attention to ensuring prompt corrective  action impairs the federal government\u2019s ability to ensure that unallowable  costs have been repaid or that internal control deficiencies have been  corrected. Shortening the timeframes required for issuing management  decisions by federal agencies and monitoring the auditee\u2019s implementation  of timely corrective actions by the federal agency will help to ensure that  appropriate audit follow-up and resolution are achieved.", "Figure 31 illustrates an example of the Single Audit reporting time frames.", "As we reported in prior Recovery Act reports, the problem that the Single  Audit reports are not due until 9 months after the fiscal year-end was  exacerbated by the extensions to the deadline to file Single Audit reports.  The federal awarding agencies, consistent with OMB guidance, had  routinely granted such extensions. In February 2010, HHS, the cognizant  agency for audit, adopted a policy of no longer approving requests for such  extensions. Further, in March 2010, OMB issued a memorandum, in  response to our recommendation, that directed federal agencies to not  grant any requests made to extend the Single Audit reporting deadlines for  fiscal years 2009 through 2011. Despite this guidance, we found that the  Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) did not receive Single Audit reporting  packages for fiscal year ending 2009 from 5 of the 16 selected states and  the District of Columbia within the 9-month time frame provided by  statute. Single Audit reporting packages include a schedule of internal  control deficiencies and the auditee\u2019s plans for correcting them. Thus,  when submissions of reporting packages are late, the auditees\u2019 efforts to  correct internal control deficiencies may be delayed. According to OMB  guidance, late submissions of the Single Audit to FAC in either of the 2  prior fiscal years would prevent the auditor from attaining low-risk auditee  status, which could likely result in an increase in the scope of audit  coverage to address the additional risk for the subsequent year\u2019s audit of  the auditee. While the focus of our bi-monthly reports has been on  Recovery Act funds, in general, the Single Audit pertains to federal  expenditures awarded from the Recovery Act as well as from other federal  sources; thus, internal control deficiencies identified in a program  expending Recovery Act funds would generally affect all other sources of  federal funds for that program as well.", "As of August 5, 2010, five of the states participating in the project did not  submit their completed fiscal year 2009 Single Audit reports to FAC by the  March 31 due date; one of these states had not yet submitted its fiscal year  2009 Single Audit Report as of August 24, 2010.

The use of competition is generally  considered a fundamental tenant of public procurement. In addition, fixed- price contracting generally places the maximum amount of risk on the  contractor because the government pays a fixed price even if actual costs  of the product or service exceed the contract price. Of the 208 contracts  we reviewed, 86 percent were reported by state and local officials as being  competed and 79 percent were reported as fixed-price contracts.  Further, in five states all of the contracts we reviewed were reported as  being competed, and in four states all of the contracts we reviewed were  reported as being fixed-price contracts.

Officials also gave various  reasons why some contracts were not awarded as fixed-price contracts.  For instance, officials reported that, for many contracts, fixed-price  contracts were not used because use of another contract type was the  agency\u2019s standard practice for a particular type of project.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, officials  said that the use of Recovery Act funds from the COPS Hiring Recovery  Program (CHRP) grant helped support community policing and crime  prevention efforts by allowing the city to hire 50 additional police officers.  Similarly, officials in Colorado Springs, Colorado, reported using Recovery  Act funds from the JAG program to fund the salaries of community service  officers.

Officials in San Jos\u00e9 and Redding, California, also  cited budget gaps for the current fiscal year and reductions in revenue  from property taxes and other sources as examples of their governments\u2019  fiscal challenges. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, officials said their fiscal  condition has slightly improved due to an unanticipated 4 percent increase  in 2010 sales tax revenue over actual 2009 revenue. Despite this increase,  Colorado Springs is not planning to expand services in 2010. Officials from  the city of Austin reported an increase in sales tax revenue and declines in  other revenue sources, such as fees and charges for commercial and  residential development.

For example,  Cincinnati, Ohio, officials said the city hopes to continue funding the 50  police officers hired under the 3-year CHRP grant by using city revenues to  cover expenditures after 2012. Officials in Wilmington, North Carolina,  reported that the city intends to replace JAG funding for law enforcement  equipment and services with general funds and other grant funds. San  Jos\u00e9, California, officials said the city plans to pursue other grant  opportunities in order to continue funding city infrastructure projects  currently benefiting from the use of Recovery Act funds. In contrast,  officials in a number of localities said that because Recovery Act funds  were primarily used for one-time projects they do not need to develop a  specific plan to prepare for the end of Recovery Act funding. For example,  officials in Farmington Hills, Michigan, reported that the city used  Recovery Act funds for one-time expenditures, such as equipment  purchases and energy-efficiency upgrades, and therefore does not need to  develop an exit strategy. Similarly, in Tupelo, Mississippi, officials said the  city used Recovery Act funds for infrastructure-related, \u201cstand-alone\u201d  projects requiring minimal or no long-term financial support and  specifically avoided applying for a CHRP grant because of the requirement  to retain officers hired under the grant after Recovery Act funding ends.

For example, New Jersey received $8 million for an energy rebate program  and $14 million for energy-efficiency programs. Michigan received $30  million in Recovery Act funds to provide energy-efficiency retrofits for  residential, commercial, industrial, and public buildings. Many of our  selected states, as well as the District, reported that the Recovery Act  continues to have a positive effect on their fiscal stability. As an example,  Arizona state officials told us that Recovery Act funds helped their state  through the worst part of the recession by preventing deeper cuts in social  programs, and giving officials breathing room to figure out what fiscal  steps to take in the long term. Officials in Ohio credit the over $7.9 billion  in Recovery Act funds they have received as of August 1, 2010, with  helping to protect jobs and continue services in their state. Officials in  Illinois and the District said that they would be in more dire fiscal  condition without SFSF and the increased FMAP funds from the Recovery  Act. In Iowa, Recovery Act funds received in fiscal year 2011 helped  officials balance their fiscal year 2011 budget while avoiding tax increases  and reducing the amount by which officials needed to draw down the  state\u2019s reserve fund. Recovery Act funds also reduced the need in  Massachusetts to use more of the state\u2019s authorized fiscal year 2010 rainy- day reserve funds to balance the budget, according to state officials. City  officials told us that Recovery Act funds helped the District maintain a  balanced budget for fiscal year 2011 without tapping into the city\u2019s rainy- day fund.", "Several states and the District contacted for this review reported that they  incorporated measures to prepare for the end of Recovery Act funding in  their fiscal year 2011 budget or in budgets in prior cycles. For example,  in Mississippi officials told us the legislature sharply reduced spending to  offset reductions in Recovery Act funding. According to city officials, the  District\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget, as well as the mayor\u2019s proposed fiscal  year 2011 budget, reflects the reduction in revenues that will result from  the reduction in Recovery Act funds in fiscal year 2011. Officials in some  states reported they were planning for the end of Recovery Act funding.  For example, Florida officials told us they were in the early stages of  developing their fiscal year 2012 budget which will include a plan to  address the phasing out of Recovery Act funds. According to Michigan  officials, they have made some structural changes such as reforms to the  public school employees\u2019 retirement plan and are working to devise  solutions for when the Recovery Act funds run out in fiscal year 2012. In  Georgia, officials said they are preparing for the cessation of Recovery Act  funds by planning additional budget reductions. They also are projecting  moderate revenue growth. New York officials told us that they will address  the phasing out of Recovery Act funds this fall when they develop the  budget for the next fiscal year.", "State officials reported mixed assessments of changes to their states\u2019 fiscal  conditions since we contacted them for our May 2010 report. Officials in  several states noted that they continue to face difficult budget challenges.  Several states told us that their fiscal condition has generally remained the  same since our May report. Some states have seen signs that their fiscal  condition is shifting and showing signs of improvement. For example,  state officials reported that tax revenue collections in Massachusetts  during the last 2 months of fiscal year 2010 were above revenue estimates  by $191 million and $149 million respectively, and the commonwealth  ended fiscal year 2010 with tax collections above budget estimates. State  officials in Pennsylvania also reported that revenues were $58 million  ahead of estimates in June\u2014the first month since December 2007 that  revenues exceeded estimates. Arizona officials also told us that their April  and May revenues were much better than they had projected, however,  they noted that the trend did not continue in June and July. In another  example, Michigan officials told us that in June 2010, total wage and salary  employment was up 23,400 jobs compared to June 2009. This was the first  year-over-year increase in total wage and salary employment in Michigan  since March 2005. These signs of improvement, in contrast to revenue  declines, are consistent with national trends reported in the June 2010  Fiscal Survey of States issued by the National Governors Association and  the National Association of State Budget Officers. According to the  Fiscal Survey, states are projecting a slight rise of 3.9 percent in tax  collections for fiscal year 2011 recommended budgets relative to fiscal  year 2010 estimates. However, states estimate that their 2010 tax revenues  will represent an almost 12 percent decline in states\u2019 sales, personal  income, and corporate income tax collections since fiscal year 2008, the  last fiscal year in which states were not significantly affected by the  national recession.

These  acts, respectively, require that projects receiving federal funds pay  prevailing wages and meet federal environmental requirements.", "The Section 1602 Program allows HFAs to exchange returned and unused  tax credits for a payment from Treasury at the rate of 85 cents for every  tax credit dollar. HFAs can exchange up to 100 percent of unused 2008  credits and 40 percent of their 2009 allocation. HFAs may award Section  1602 Program funds to finance the construction or acquisition and  rehabilitation of qualified low-income buildings in accordance with the  HFA\u2019s Qualified Allocation Plan, which establishes criteria for selecting  LIHTC projects. Section 1602 Program funds may be committed to project  owners that have not sold their LIHTC allocation to private investors, as  long as the project owner has made good faith efforts to find an investor.  However, some HFAs have required Section 1602 Program projects to  include some tax credit equity from private investors. Section 1602  Program funds are subject to the same requirements as the standard  LIHTC program, and like TCAP funds, may be recaptured if a project does  not comply with the requirements. HFAs may submit applications to  Treasury for Section 1602 Program funds through 2010. The last day for  HFAs to commit funds to project owners is December 31, 2010, but they  can continue to disburse funds for committed projects through December  31, 2011, provided that the project owners paid or incurred at least 30  percent of eligible project costs by the end of 2010. Congress appropriated  \u2018such sums as may be necessary\u2019 for the operation of the Section 1602  Program. The Joint Committee on Taxation originally estimated the budget  impact of this program at $3 billion. As of the end of April 2010, however,  Treasury had obligated more than $5 billion to HFAs in Section 1602  Program funds. Section 1602 Program funds are not considered by  Treasury to be federal financial assistance and, therefore, the Section 1602  Program is not subject to many of the requirements placed on TCAP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title IV-E Adoption Assistance and Foster Care Programs", "paragraphs": ["Administered by the Administration for Children and Families within the  Department of Health and Human Services, the Foster Care Program helps  states to provide safe and stable out-of-home care for children until the  children are safely returned home, placed permanently with adoptive  families, or placed in other planned arrangements for permanency.

For the youth  program, Labor encouraged states and local areas to use as much of these  funds as possible to expand summer youth employment opportunities.
