The agency has not adequately managed its networks, software updates, user accounts and passwords, and user privileges, nor has it consistently logged security-relevant events. Other information security controls--including physical security, background investigations, segregation of duties, and system changes--also exhibited weaknesses, increasing the risk that unauthorized users could breach FAA's air traffic control systems, potentially disrupting aviation operations. While acknowledging these weaknesses, agency officials stated that the possibilities for unauthorized access were limited, given that the systems are in part custom built and that they run on older equipment that employs special-purpose operating systems, proprietary communication interfaces, and custom-built software. Nevertheless, the proprietary features of these systems cannot fully protect them from attacks by disgruntled current or former employees who are familiar with these features, nor will they keep out more sophisticated hackers. A key reason for the information security weaknesses that GAO identified in FAA's air traffic control systems is that the agency had not yet fully implemented its information security program to help ensure that effective controls were established and maintained. Although the agency has initiatives under way to improve its information security, further efforts are needed. Weaknesses that need to be addressed include outdated security plans, inadequate security awareness training, inadequate system testing and evaluation programs, limited security incident-detection capabilities, and shortcomings in providing service continuity for disruptions in operations. Until FAA has resolved these issues, the information security weaknesses that GAO has identified will likely persist."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) performs critical functions that  contribute to ensuring safe, orderly, and efficient air travel in the national  airspace system.

FAA\u2019s quarterly administrator\u2019s fact book for  March 2005 reports that, in 2004, air traffic in the national airspace system  exceeded 46 million flights and 647 million people. According to the  agency\u2019s 2004 annual performance report for its air traffic organization,  Year One\u2014Taking Flight, at any one time as many as 7,000 aircraft\u2014both  civilian and military\u2014could be aloft over the United States (see fig. 1).  More than 36,000 employees support the operations that help move aircraft  through the national airspace system.", "The agency\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission depends on the adequacy and  reliability of its air traffic control systems, a vast network of computer  hardware, software, and communications equipment. These systems reside  at, or are associated with, several types of facilities: air traffic control  towers, Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities, Air Route Traffic  Control Centers (or en route centers), and the Air Traffic Control System  Command Center. According to FAA,   Four hundred eighty-eight air traffic control towers (see fig. 2) manage  and control the airspace within about 5 miles of an airport. They control  departures and landings as well as ground operations on airport  taxiways and runways.", "One hundred seventy Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities  provide air traffic control services for airspace that is located within  approximately 40 miles of an airport and generally up to 10,000 feet  above the airport, where en route centers\u2019 control begins. Terminal  controllers establish and maintain the sequence and separation of  aircraft.", "Twenty-one en route centers control planes over the United States\u2014in  transit and during approaches to some airports. Each center handles a  different region of airspace. En route centers operate the computer suite  that processes radar surveillance and flight planning data, reformats it  for presentation purposes, and sends it to display equipment that is used  by controllers to track aircraft. The centers control the switching of  voice communications between aircraft and the center as well as  between the center and other air traffic control facilities. Two en route  centers also control air traffic over the oceans.", "The Air Traffic Control System Command Center (see fig. 3) manages  the flow of air traffic within the United States. This facility regulates air  traffic when weather, equipment, runway closures, or other conditions  place stress on the national airspace system. In these instances, traffic  management specialists at the command center take action to modify  traffic demands in order to keep traffic within system capacity.", "As aircraft move across the national airspace system, controllers manage  their movements during each phase of flight. See figure 4 for a visual  summary of air traffic control over the United States and its oceans.", "The air traffic control systems are very complex and highly automated.  These systems process a wide range of information, including radar,  weather, flight plans, surveillance, navigation/landing guidance, traffic  management, air-to-ground communication, voice, network management,  and other information\u2014such as airspace restrictions\u2014that is required to  support the agency\u2019s mission.", "To support its operational management functions, the agency relies on  several interconnected systems to process and track flights around the  world. In order to successfully carry out air traffic control operations, it is  essential that FAA\u2019s systems interoperate, functioning both within and  across facilities as one integrated system of systems. Each type of facility  that we described in the previous section consists of numerous interrelated  systems. For example, each of the en route centers, according to FAA  officials, relies on 16 systems to perform mission-critical information  processing and display, navigation, surveillance, communications, and  weather functions. In addition, systems from different facilities interact  with each other so that together they can successfully execute the entire air  traffic control process. For example, systems integrate data on aircraft  position from surveillance radars with data on flight destination from flight  planning data systems, for use on controllers\u2019 displays.", "As FAA modernizes its air traffic control systems, information security will  become even more critical. The agency\u2019s modernization efforts are  designed to enhance the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the national  airspace system through the acquisition of a vast network of radar,  navigation, communications, and information processing systems. Newer  systems use digital computer networking and telecommunications  technologies that can create new vulnerabilities and expose them to risks  that must be assessed and mitigated to ensure adequate protection. New  vulnerabilities may also result from FAA\u2019s increasing reliance on  commercially available hardware and software and from growing  interconnectivity among computer and communication systems. Increasing  interconnection increases the extent to which systems become vulnerable  to intruders, who may severely disrupt operations or manipulate sensitive  information.", "The administrator has designated the CIO as the focal point for information  system security within the agency. The CIO is responsible for overseeing  the development of the information security program, including oversight  of information security policies, architectures, concepts of operation,  procedures, processes, standards, training, and plans. This responsibility is  delegated to the Office of Information Systems Security, whose mission is  to protect the agency\u2019s infrastructure through leadership in innovative  information assurance initiatives. In addition, the agency has established  Information System Security Manager positions, with more detailed  information security responsibilities, within FAA\u2019s various lines of business,  such as the air traffic organization.", "We have previously reported information security weaknesses at FAA. For  instance, in December 2000, we reported that the agency had physical  security vulnerabilities, ineffective operational systems security,  inadequate service continuity efforts, an ineffective intrusion detection  capability, and ineffective personnel security. We also noted that the agency  had not yet implemented its information security program.", "Information system controls are an important consideration for any  organization that depends on computerized systems and networks to carry  out its mission or business. These controls should provide adequate  protections against outside as well as inside threats. It is especially  important for government organizations, such as FAA, where maintaining  the public trust is essential. Inadequately protected systems are at risk of  intrusion by individuals or groups with malicious intent, who could use  their illegitimate access to obtain sensitive information, disrupt operations,  or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks.", "Since 1997, we have designated information security as a governmentwide  high-risk area. Our previous reports, and those of agency inspectors  general, describe persistent information security weaknesses that place a  variety of federal operations at risk of disruption, fraud, and inappropriate  disclosure. Congress and the executive branch have taken actions to  address the risks associated with persistent information security  weaknesses. In December 2002, Congress enacted the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA), which is intended to strengthen the  information security of federal systems. In addition, the administration has  taken important steps to improve information security, such as integrating  it into the President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard.

In addition, to determine whether  information system general controls were in place, adequately designed,  and operating effectively, we conducted vulnerability testing and  assessments of systems from within the agency\u2019s network. We also held  discussions with agency staff to gain an understanding of FAA\u2019s processes  and controls. In addition, in order to take advantage of their prior work in  this area, we held discussions with OIG staff and reviewed recent  information security reports pertaining to air traffic control systems.

Organizations secure their networks, in part, by  installing and configuring network devices that permit authorized network  service requests, deny unauthorized requests, and limit the services that are  available on the network. Devices used to secure networks include  (1) firewalls that prevent unauthorized access to the network, (2) routers  that filter and forward data along the network, (3) switches that forward  information among segments of a network, and (4) servers that host  applications and data. Network services consist of protocols for  transmitting data between network devices. Insecurely configured network  services and devices can make a system vulnerable to internal or external  threats, such as denial-of-service attacks.

The combination of identification and authentication\u2014such as  user account/password combinations\u2014provides the basis for establishing  individual accountability and for controlling access to the system.  Accordingly, agencies (1) establish password parameters, such as number  of characters, type of characters, and the frequency with which users  should change their passwords, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of  passwords for authenticating the identity of users; (2) require encryption  for passwords to prevent their disclosure to unauthorized individuals; and  (3) implement procedures to control the use of user accounts.

DOT policy also addresses the necessity to assign only one user  to a given ID and password.", "FAA did not adequately control user accounts and passwords to ensure that  only authorized individuals were granted access to its systems. Because the  agency did not always comply with complexity requirements, passwords  on numerous accounts may be easy for an attacker to guess. Additionally,  one of the databases we reviewed did not require strong passwords. We  also identified database passwords that were not adequately protected  because they were (1) readable by all system users on two Web servers,  (2) in clear text format on multiple shared server directories, and  (3) written into application program code. Such weaknesses increase the  risk that passwords may be disclosed to unauthorized users and used to  gain access to the system.

For this reason, it is vital that employees  and contractors who use computer resources in their day-to-day operations  be made aware of the importance and sensitivity of the information they  handle, as well as the business and legal reasons for maintaining its  confidentiality, integrity, and availability. FISMA mandates that all federal  employees and contractors who use agency information systems be  provided with periodic training in information security awareness and  accepted information security practice.

The training records that we reviewed showed that  personnel with significant information security responsibilities had  received specialized training.", "Despite the agency\u2019s progress in security awareness training, we identified  shortcomings with the program. For example, although FAA implemented a  Web-based training tool, the agency does not require all employees and  contractors to use it. As a result, not all contractors and employees receive  annual training, training is not appropriately tracked and reported, and the  training provided in place of the tool is not always adequate. Although FAA  reported in its most recent FISMA report that 100 percent of its employees  and contractors had taken security awareness training, it was unable to provide documentation for more than one-third of selected employees  and contractors. Further, the agency does not have an effective tracking  mechanism for security awareness training. In some circumstances,  management relies on verbal responses from employees and contractors  on whether they have completed training, but it has no uniform reporting  requirements. Instead they receive responses in different forms, such as  telephone conversations, e-mails, and faxes. In instances where the Web- based tool is not used, the awareness training may be inadequate. At one of  the sites we visited, this training consisted of a briefing that did not cover  information system security and risks. Further, the agency had not  developed guidance or procedures for system-specific security training, as  required by OMB and NIST.", "Without adequate security awareness and training programs, security  lapses are more likely to occur. As in our 2000 report, we were able to  access sensitive security information on the Internet.

Weaknesses in physical security, background  investigations, segregation of duties, and application change controls  increase the level of risk. A key reason for FAA\u2019s weaknesses in information  system controls is that it has not yet fully implemented an information  security program to ensure that effective controls are established and  maintained. Effective implementation of such a program provides for  periodically assessing risks, establishing appropriate policies and  procedures, developing and implementing security plans, promoting  security awareness training, testing and evaluating the effectiveness of  controls, implementing corrective actions, responding to incidents, and  ensuring continuity of operations.

We acknowledge that we focused our  examination on the technical controls of three critical systems. In addition,  we reviewed management and operational controls at five sites and FAA  headquarters and relied on the OIG\u2019s prior work pertaining to air traffic  control systems. We concluded that significant information security  weaknesses remain that could potentially lead to a disruption in aviation  operations.", "The CIO also indicated that the implications of the findings in this report  should be tempered by the understanding that individual system  vulnerabilities are further mitigated by system redundancies and separate  access controls that are built into the overall air traffic control system  architecture to provide additional protection that is not considered within  the context of this review. He was concerned that our report does not  always balance the identification of individual system issues with  consideration of the relative risk that an issue may pose to the overall  system and that the public may be prone to infer from the report that the  security risks to the air traffic control system are higher than they may  actually be. We acknowledge that FAA may have other protections built  into the overall system architecture. However, as noted in this report, the  complex air traffic control system relies on several interconnected  systems. As a result, the weaknesses we identified may increase the risk to  other systems. For example, FAA did not consistently configure network  services and devices securely to prevent unauthorized access to and ensure  the integrity of computer systems operating on its networks.", "In addition, the CIO indicated that all security findings for air traffic control  systems, including those from our report, are evaluated and prioritized for  action and that FAA has established a sound track record for moving  quickly to address priority issues\u2014as demonstrated by the extensive  actions the agency has taken on issues identified in our previous reports  and in DOT OIG reports. For example, according to the CIO, FAA  established an extensive information security training program; deployed  intrusion detection systems; and established the Computer Security  Incident Response Center as a prevention, detection and reporting  capability on a 24x7x365 basis. Finally, he stated that as a result of FAA\u2019s  information security actions, it achieved 100 percent of the President\u2019s  Management Agenda goals for certification and authorization of its  systems, completed certification and authorization for over 90 percent of  its systems in fiscal year 2004, and completed 100 percent of its  certifications and authorizations by June 30, 2005.
