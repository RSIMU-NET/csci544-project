At the end of fiscal year 1997, 275 Indian gaming operations existed in 28 states. These operations included casino gaming, which ranged from multimillion-dollar casinos, to a unit with a few slot machines, to bingo. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, among other things, established a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means to promote tribal economic development, shield it from organized crime, and ensure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by both the operators and players. To this end, the act established the National Indian Gaming Commission to oversee Indian gaming and differentiated the roles of the Commission, the states, and the tribes. The Commission is responsible for ensuring that tribal gaming is conducted in compliance with the act and the Commission\u2019s regulations. In actual practice, the states, as well as the tribes, are responsible for ensuring compliance with tribal-state compacts\u2014agreements negotiated between the states and tribes that identify which party will be responsible for licensing, monitoring, and enforcing the gaming activities. Thus, the day-to-day oversight of casino gaming was left to the states and tribes to negotiate\u2014not the Commission.

These proposals included reconfiguring the Commission to promulgate minimum federal standards for Indian casino gaming. Minimum standards would be established for such areas as background checks, licensing, surveillance, and monitoring. The Commission\u2019s funding and staffing needs were also discussed during hearings. In order to better understand the organizational structure, staffing, and funding levels needed for an enhanced Commission, you requested (1) information on the National Indian Gaming Commission\u2019s organization, staffing, funding, and responsibilities from 1991 through 1997; (2) similar information on state gaming agencies in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, and Washington, as it relates to casino gaming; and (3) for those states, the views of the heads of the gaming agencies on the elements critical to regulating gaming."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["From an estimated $100 million when the act was passed in 1988, revenue from Indian gaming reached $1.2 billion in 1992, $3.2 billion in 1994, and exceeded $6 billion in 1996. As we reported last year, casinos accounted for most of the Indian gaming revenue, and a few large casinos accounted for a major portion of the casino revenue. In 1996, according to the Commission, for every $1 in revenue derived from Indian bingo gaming, almost $15 derived from Indian casino gaming. Although tremendous growth in total revenue has occurred, not every Indian gaming operation has been successful. In addition, not every operation has been without controversy. One contentious issue concerns the types of casino games that can be played within states.", "The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 established several requirements. One requirement is that net revenues from tribal gaming are to be used to (1) fund tribal government operations or programs, (2) provide for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members, (3) promote tribal economic development, (4) donate to charitable organizations, or (5) help fund the operations of local government agencies. In addition, tribes may distribute a portion of their net revenues directly to tribal members as per-capita payments. However, such a distribution requires a revenue allocation plan that must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior.", "The act established three classes of gaming to be regulated by a combination of tribal governments, state governments, and the National Indian Gaming Commission. Briefly, Class I gaming includes traditional forms of Indian gaming connected with tribal ceremonies or celebrations and is regulated solely by the tribes. Class II gaming includes bingo and other similar games and is regulated by the tribes and the Commission. Class III gaming includes casino games and slot machines and, although the Commission has regulatory responsibilities under the act, is regulated primarily by the tribes and states according to a compact that governs the gaming activities. For ease of discussion, we use \u201cIndian bingo gaming\u201d to refer to all Class II gaming and \u201cIndian casino gaming\u201d to refer to all Class III gaming.", "The compact for Indian casino gaming is a negotiated agreement that establishes the state\u2019s and tribe\u2019s regulatory and oversight roles and specifies the games allowed. It may include provisions concerning the standards for the operation and maintenance of the gaming facility, the application of the tribe\u2019s and the state\u2019s laws and regulations that are related to the gaming activity, and the state\u2019s assessment of the amounts necessary to defray the costs of regulating or overseeing the gaming activity. A compact may cover a single gaming operation or multiple operations, depending upon what is negotiated.", "The act requires that tribes and states negotiate compacts to balance the interests of both the state and the tribe. In addition, the Secretary of the Interior must approve the compacts. The act also requires that the tribe\u2019s governing body must pass a tribal gaming ordinance or resolution before the tribe can have casino gaming. Furthermore, if a management company is to run the gaming operation, a management contract is required. Per the act, the Commission must approve tribal gaming ordinances or resolutions and management contracts.", "At the end of fiscal year 1997, of the 275 Indian gaming operations, 203 had casino gaming, according to the Commission. Of these 203, 141 were operating with an approved compact, while 62 were not. Of the 57 Indian casinos in the four states that we visited that had Indian gaming, 45 were operating with a compact approved by the Secretary. Three tribes in Washington operated the remaining 12 without a Secretary-approved compact. Of those, 11 casino operations of two tribes contained slot machines, which Washington does not allow, and Washington would not agree to a compact allowing them. According to state officials, these two tribes are allowed to operate under a court order until pending litigation on this issue is settled. The other tribe with one operation had a compact approved by the state but not by the Secretary, as of the end of fiscal year 1997. The tribe has since submitted the compact for approval, and approval was granted on March 30, 1998. In these four states, about 60 percent of all of the federally recognized tribes (46 of 78) have negotiated compacts, but not all have opened casino operations or had successful operations.", "Figure 1 shows the number of Indian casino gaming operations by state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Indian Gaming Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Organization, Staffing, and Funding", "paragraphs": ["The National Indian Gaming Commission is headed by a Chairman and two associate commissioners.

In the first few years of existence, the Commission focused its efforts on its responsibility to promulgate regulations. Later, the Commission focused on reviewing and/or approving various gaming reports and submissions for both bingo and casino gaming as well as on its monitoring activities. It reviews or approves (1) tribal ordinances for bingo and casino gaming that establish how tribes will comply with the Commission\u2019s regulations; (2) management contracts that establish the relationship between the tribe and its gaming operator, including the payment to be made for this service; (3) annual independent audits of the financial statements; and (4) background investigation reports.", "The Commission monitors compliance with its regulations and the requirements of the act.

The number of gaming operations in a state, however, does not correlate directly to the state agency\u2019s staffing level. For example, for 17 Indian casinos, Michigan committed 2 staff to oversee gaming operations. Washington, which has 11 Indian casinos, committed 24 staff to oversee the gaming operations.

Generally, the states are reimbursed for the expenditures they actually incur for their licensing, certification, or oversight costs. Arizona bills the tribes for services provided, but if bills for services do not cover all expenditures, Arizona allocates the remaining amount (shared enforcement expenditures) on the basis of the number of gaming machines an operation has. New Jersey also bills for services provided but allocates any remaining costs equally among the casinos.

Specifically, the Alliance stated that the state\u2019s oversight responsibility is limited to monitoring, rather than enforcement; would prefer a different presentation of the state\u2019s revenue and expenditures; and stated that the intervals for monitoring activities were less frequent than what the Department said it performed.
