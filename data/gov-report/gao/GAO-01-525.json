In the absence of a complete, enforceable enterprise architecture, such investments are unwise. DOD runs the risk that its components will spend billions of dollars to modify and modernize financial management systems independently from one another, forcing DOD to maintain a system that suffers from duplication, limited interoperability, and unnecessarily costly operations and maintenance. As part of its plan to invest in financial management systems modernization, DOD has tried to use lessons learned from its Year 2000 program. DOD can build upon these actions to ensure that it uses recognized best practices for enterprise architecture management. This approach will allow DOD to position itself to cost effectively manage the billions of dollars it plans to spend on financial management operations.

Such an architecture provides a clear and comprehensive picture of an entity, whether it is an organization (e.g., federal department, agency, or bureau) or a functional or mission area that cuts across more than one organization (e.g., financial management or combat identification).

However, we also reported that the plan\u2019s discussion of the future environment was focused on DFAS and did not address how financial management reform and modernization would address such areas as asset accountability and control and budget formulation. Additionally, we reported that the 200 planned initiatives were not clearly linked to DOD\u2019s future financial management environment and that the plan did not address feeder systems\u2019 data integrity.

However, because responsibility and accountability for these initiatives are diffused across many DOD components and activities, and because these initiatives are not part of an integrated portfolio of investments, departmentwide aggregated information on the estimated costs for these initiatives is limited.", "To illustrate, DFAS currently has 32 modernization projects underway, but neither DFAS\u2019 System Integration Directorate nor its CIO could provide us with either the total acquisition cost or the life-cycle cost of these projects, because such information is not maintained centrally in DFAS and would have to be obtained from the managers for the respective projects. Instead of estimated costs, DFAS officials provided budgetary data for fiscal years 2000 through 2007, which show that DFAS plans to invest $2.2 billion during this 8-year period to acquire and operate systems associated with its modernization activities.", "Similarly, DOD does not have a reliable estimate of the cost to make the military service and defense agency feeder systems compliant with federal financial management requirements. While the Financial Management Improvement Plan identifies approximately $1.4 billion, this covers only a portion of the projects identified in the plan. Moreover, the Director for Business Policy, Office of the DOD Comptroller, who is responsible for maintaining the plan, told us that this cost estimate was questionable and that one of the first steps in the Financial and Feeder System Compliance Process is to develop a reliable cost estimate for the effort.", "We also found that some DOD components are investing in different financial management solutions. For example, the Army, Naval Air Systems Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) have separate programs underway that are estimated to cost about $700 million, $750 million, and $900 million, respectively, to implement different commercially available products for automating and reengineering various enterprise operations. Among the functions that these commercial \u201centerprise resource planning\u201d products address is financial management. In the case of DLA, the agency plans to establish teams that would define interfaces (hardware and software) that are to perform, for example, rate conversion to allow DLA to exchange information with DFAS and others.", "DOD acknowledges the need to manage the relationships among these different modernization activities. Specifically, it recently issued a program budget decision directing all components that are pursuing enterprise resource planning solutions to report to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer by March 31, 2001, on how their respective efforts will use and interface with DOD\u2019s current and planned standard systems. Additionally, in the future, all DOD components must submit a similar report no later than 90 days after they decide to begin planning or designing an enterprise resource planning systems solution. While this decision acknowledges the above-cited problem of DOD components investing separately in financial management processes, it does not address the root problem\u2014that a DOD-wide financial management enterprise architecture is not being used to guide and constrain these investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have a financial management enterprise architecture, and it does not currently have the management structures and processes in place to effectively develop, implement, and maintain one. DOD has not applied recognized best practices: in particular, support and sponsorship by the head of the enterprise, and assignment of accountability and commensurate authority for developing, implementing, and maintaining a DOD-wide financial management enterprise architecture. Nevertheless, DOD\u2019s various components are either spending or planning to spend billions of dollars to acquire new or modify existing financial management systems. In the absence of a complete, enforceable enterprise architecture for DOD-wide financial management operations and systems, making such investments is unwise. If DOD continues down this road, it runs the serious risk that its components will spend billions of dollars modifying and modernizing financial management systems independently from one another, resulting in DOD perpetuating an existing systems environment that suffers from duplication of systems, limited interoperablity, and unnecessarily costly operations and maintenance.", "As part of its plans for investing in financial management systems modernization, DOD has taken some actions that appropriately exploit lessons learned from its Year 2000 program. DOD can build upon actions such as these and activities already underway to ensure that it employs recognized best practices for enterprise architecture management. DOD can thus position itself to cost effectively manage the billions of dollars it plans to spend to address its high-risk financial management operations.

In particular, the Assistant Secretary should take appropriate steps to ensure that the Chief Architect   obtains executive buy-in and support,   establishes architecture management structure and controls,   defines the architecture process and approach,   develops the baseline architecture, the target architecture, and the sequencing plan, facilitates the use of the architecture to guide financial management modernization projects and investments, and   maintains the architecture.", "In addition, we recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence) report at least quarterly to the Senior Financial Management Oversight Council on the Chief Architect\u2019s progress in developing a financial management enterprise architecture, including the Chief Architect\u2019s adherence to enterprise architecture policy and guidance from OMB, the CIO Council, and DOD.", "Further, we recommend that the Senior Financial Management Oversight Council report to the Secretary of Defense every 6 months on progress in developing and implementing a financial management enterprise architecture.
