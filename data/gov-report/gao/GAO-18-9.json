Resource limitations and changes to operations require the Coast Guard to periodically reexamine the need for these stations. GAO was asked to review these efforts.", "This report addresses, among other objectives, the extent to which the Coast Guard has (1) a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat stations and (2) taken actions to implement its boat station process results.

In 2013, following this process, the Coast Guard and its contractor identified 18 unnecessarily duplicative boat stations with overlapping coverage that could be permanently closed without negatively affecting the Coast Guard's ability to meet its 2-hour search and rescue (SAR) response standard and other mission requirements. The process was designed to ensure the Coast Guard met or exceeded requirements to maintain SAR coverage and to account for such factors as boat downtime and surge capacity to respond to certain incidents. Further, the boat station analysis did not consider potential SAR responses by the Coast Guard's air stations and facilities, which can provide additional overlapping coverage. Coast Guard officials said that the closures would, among other things, help improve operations by consolidating boat station caseloads to help ensure personnel were active enough to maintain training requirements.", "In 2017, the Coast Guard affirmed that its leadership believes the 2013 study remains valid, but so far the agency has not taken actions to implement the closures identified by its sound process. Instead, the Coast Guard is recommending conversion of some year-round stations to seasonal stations that would operate during the summer. Coast Guard officials stated that seasonal closures are preferable to no action, given its limited resources, the significant overlapping SAR coverage, and potential to improve operations. However, permanently closing unnecessarily duplicative stations may better position the Coast Guard to improve its operations. It could also achieve up to $290 million in cost savings over 20 years, if stations were permanently closed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including one recommendation that the Coast Guard close unnecessarily duplicative stations that its analysis identified.

To fulfill its SAR responsibilities, along  with its other missions, the Coast Guard maintains multimission boat  stations, air stations, and air facilities, with associated assets such as  boats, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft, along our coasts and inland  waterways. While some missions conducted out of these stations, such  as ports, waterways, and coastal security, have increased in recent years,  annual Coast Guard search and rescue caseloads have decreased from  about 32,000 cases per year in 2004 to about 17,000 in 2016, a reduction  of 47 percent. The need to balance a broad array of missions, while  operating under constrained budgets in recent years, underscores the  importance for the Coast Guard to ensure its stations are needed and  optimally located.", "Many factors help determine the placement of stations and the allocation  of Coast Guard resources for their operations. These include population,  historical factors, environmental conditions such as water temperature,  and the availability of other rescue resources and partners. For example,  some geographic regions have boat stations in closer proximity because  when many of them were established, the crews used rowboats (which  moved at slow speeds for shorter distances) to conduct search and  rescue cases. In 1990, we reported that the Coast Guard and its  predecessor agencies had established over 400 stations since 1844, and  that about 200 of these stations had since been closed, destroyed by  storms, or transferred to other government entities. Since that 1990  report, the Coast Guard has attempted to close additional stations it  considered unnecessary, but met resistance from impacted communities  and others. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the  Coast Guard was tasked with expanded security-related mission  responsibilities and subsequently established eight additional stations.  However, the need for stations at particular locations has generally  decreased with changes in boating activity, boating equipment, and the  capabilities of other search and rescue providers such as local police and  fire departments.", "Changes to Coast Guard operations, such as additional mission  requirements to address emerging security issues, and resource  limitations, require the Coast Guard to periodically review the allocation of  these resources, including those directed toward stations to ensure they  are positioned to meet the Coast Guard\u2019s missions while not  unnecessarily duplicating efforts. Given the importance of the Coast  Guard\u2019s SAR and other missions, you asked us to review whether its  efforts to optimize station locations and allocate resources were sound  (i.e., defendable). This report addresses the extent to which the Coast  Guard (1) has a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat  stations, and the outcomes of the process; (2) has a sound process for  analyzing the need for its air stations and air facilities, and the outcomes  of the process; and (3) has taken actions to implement the results of its  process for analyzing the need for stations.", "To identify the extent to which the Coast Guard has a sound process for  analyzing the need for its boat stations, we reviewed laws, policies, and  procedures related to its SAR mission. We reviewed Coast Guard  documentation of processes it used to analyze the need for boat stations,  including a 2013 study documenting a contractor analysis that followed  the Coast Guard process, reviewed resource and budget factors, and  analyzed station activity levels. We also reviewed prior GAO reports on  the Coast Guard\u2019s previous attempts to close stations. To verify and  validate the Coast Guard\u2019s specific analytical process used to determine  overlapping SAR coverage among these stations, we obtained and  analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s analytical assumptions, the operational  parameters of the assets assigned to the stations (e.g., boat speeds), and  station locations. This analysis also allowed us to verify the soundness of  the Coast Guard\u2019s model used to identify overlap. We then independently  recreated and visually depicted overlapping SAR coverage provided by  the boat stations, based on Coast Guard data, assumptions, and  documentation, and compared it with SAR case data by geographic area.  We then analyzed Coast Guard data on single-boat SAR responses  (sorties) by station for fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the most recent  data available at the time of our review. We visited a nongeneralizable  sample of 12 boat stations we selected from within Coast Guard districts  where the Coast Guard had identified overlap, and interviewed Coast  Guard officials to identify local policies, station characteristics, local  coordination with emergency responders and federal agencies, and local  input to the Coast Guard\u2019s process for assessing station needs and  implementing changes to the locations of boat stations, if any. We  compared Coast Guard actions to evaluate boat stations against criteria  for sound evaluation design practices established in GAO\u2019s Designing  Evaluations guidance, the Coast Guard\u2019s SAR response standard, and  statutory requirements to conduct public outreach.", "To assess the reliability of Coast Guard SAR data, we interviewed  knowledgeable officials, reviewed documentation, and electronically  tested the data for obvious errors and anomalies. We interviewed Coast  Guard officials to discuss the reliability issues we identified, and officials  informed us of ongoing actions to resolve the issues.

We obtained and analyzed Coast Guard air  station and air facility locations and assumptions made for determining  overlapping SAR coverage in 2014 and used a mapping program to  visually depict overlapping coverage provided by aviation assets, based  on Coast Guard data, assumptions, and documentation. Additionally, we  interviewed Coast Guard officials to obtain information on the extent to  which the Coast Guard used findings and recommendations from  selected studies, strategies, and plans in its analyses of the need for and  locations of its air stations and air facilities.

Specifically, we reviewed the 2013 contractor  study, memoranda detailing field input on the results of the study and  their verification of the stations the study identified as unnecessarily  duplicative, and compared the recommended closures from the various  analyses to determine if the outcomes were consistent.

Coast Guard personnel  live and work at or near their stations so they can rapidly respond to  emergencies as they arise. This model facilitates the Coast Guard\u2019s  search and rescue response resource planning standard. Under this SAR  standard, Coast Guard plans for its units with SAR responsibilities to  arrive on the scene of a case within 2 hours of receiving a distress call.  Stations vary in their mission mix and pace of operations (i.e., operational  tempo) by geographic region or District, and by season. For example,  Coast Guard boat stations in D7 (Florida, Puerto Rico, South Carolina,  and the Caribbean) commonly conduct migrant interdiction operations,  whereas boat stations located along the Great Lakes (D9) rarely conduct  this mission. In some locations, SAR cases may be more common during  the summer boating season than in the winter. Stations in D9 have a  shorter boating season than stations in D7. According to Coast Guard  officials, while D7 has more total SAR cases than D9, cases in D9 are  concentrated in a shorter time period than in D7 (i.e., shorter boating  season). Boat stations also vary widely in size and function. For example,  Station New York in New York City has an authorized strength of 88  personnel, whereas Station Frankfort in Frankfort, Michigan, has an  authorized strength of 15 personnel. Both stations perform SAR and  other missions, but Station New York also conducts a high level of  homeland security missions, while Station Frankfort provides ice rescue  capability during the winter.

The Coast Guard hired a contractor to carry  out the analysis and identify potential cost savings from permanent  closures of such stations. Although focused on SAR coverage, the  process also included consideration of all Coast Guard missions carried  out at these stations. The contractor followed the 9-step process, with  certain steps conducted by the Coast Guard\u2013\u2013such as step 1, which  analyzed the system and identified overlapping SAR coverage\u2013\u2013and  developed and ranked different closure options to maximize cost savings.  Coast Guard officials provided additional district input on unique  characteristics of certain stations to further refine the closure options. The  final study identified 18 stations for closure that it estimated would  achieve cost savings without impeding the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to meet  its SAR response standard and carry out its other missions. We discuss  this further later in this report.", "The Coast Guard considers some overlap or redundancy to be  necessary, to account for such things as operational challenges, boat  maintenance downtime, personnel training requirements, and the need  for surge capacity to respond to certain incidents. Therefore, the Coast  Guard directed the contractor to analyze areas with triple or greater  station coverage as its baseline for analyzing whether stations were  unnecessarily duplicative. Based on the Coast Guard\u2019s review of this  coverage, it determined that the greatest extent of overlapping coverage  existed in Districts 1, 5, and 9, and directed the contractor to focus on  stations in those areas. Figure 5 shows the extent of overlapping Coast  Guard boat station SAR coverage as of September 2013 that was used  for the contractor study and is still accurate as of May 2017. It shows for  Districts 1, 5, and 9, up to quadruple or greater SAR coverage provided  by boat stations with overlapping response capabilities. According to the Coast Guard, in an attempt to be conservative in maintaining SAR  coverage, the optimization process did not consider the use of Coast  Guard air assets such as helicopters\u2014an additional layer of coverage\u2014 nor did it consider the availability of some local agencies that respond to  SAR cases, such as police departments and emergency responders.  Therefore, overlapping coverage depicted in figure 5 excludes air asset  responses and any responses or assistance provided by state and local  agencies. The extent of coverage in 2017 was the same as the Coast  Guard\u2019s 2013 contractor study reported.", "We determined that the actions taken to complete the station optimization  process are sound, consistent with our Program Evaluation guidance  which calls for, among other things, evaluating programs based on well- regarded criteria to achieve strong, defensible conclusions. In addition to  using the 2-hour response standard as a criterion, the optimization steps  identified actions to systematically analyze quantitative measures using a  documented ranking system to remove critical stations from consideration  for closure. For example, step 4 of the process evaluated the number of  security boardings conducted by selected stations, among other metrics,  and removed certain stations for consideration from closure based on a  systematic application of criteria related to other mission responsibilities.  Further, as described in table 1, the process began with consideration of  all boat stations in the contiguous United States, included steps to ensure  that data were reliable and appropriate, clearly identified limitations of the  analysis, and conducted simulations to assess how well the Coast Guard  would be prepared to carry out its responsibilities under different closure  alternatives, such as whether a station closure reduces or changes the  Coast Guard\u2019s ability to meet its response standard\u2014all actions included  in our Program Evaluation guidance.

Coast Guard officials within  Districts 1, 5, and 9 generally supported the contractor recommendations  to close some stations, with a few exceptions. For example, District 1\u2019s  input stated that one station recommended for closure by the contractor  analysis had a unique surf rescue capability that was not available at  adjacent or other nearby stations and thus this station did not provide  unnecessarily duplicative SAR coverage since no nearby station could  provide this capability. Thus, District 1 recommended that the station remain open. Given this input, the contractor removed this station from  consideration for closure. In another example, District 5 officials reported  that closure of one of its stations would increase response times from  adjacent stations due to the presence of shoaling and barrier island  conditions that could not be accounted for in the quantitative modeling.  Therefore, the contractor eliminated that station from consideration for  closure and recommended an alternative station for closure. This process  of obtaining regional input and validation from district officials was carried  out such that if a station identified for closure would negatively impact  critical missions, it was removed from closure consideration. This  additional district input resulted in a final contractor study that  recommended station closures that would achieve the greatest cost  saving without negatively impacting the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to meet  mission requirements.", "In addition to identifying stations with unique characteristics that  warranted keeping them open, additional district input also confirmed  contractor recommendations that some stations should be permanently  closed. For example, District 5\u2019s input concurred with the closure of six  stations, including one where officials we interviewed on site confirmed its  steadily diminishing SAR caseload. Our analysis of Coast Guard data  validated this station\u2019s low workload showing an average of seven single- boat response SAR cases annually from fiscal years 2010 through  2016. We also found that this station had been recommended for  closure in the past. In another example, District 9 input sought an  additional, seasonal closure of one station that the contractor analysis did  not evaluate for permanent closure due to one criterion applied by the  process. District 9\u2019s input provided additional context for this station,  saying that seasonal closure was preferable to taking no action because  there was significant response redundancy in this region. Moreover, the  district input noted that the acquisition of modern boats has increased the  range and reduced the response time of many stations. District input also  noted that improvements in public education and awareness of safe  boating practices, technology and availability of communications  equipment, and the increase in non-Coast Guard response resources has  resulted in a steady and dramatic decline in the stations\u2019 SAR workloads.  Our analysis of all Coast Guard single-boat response data for cases  within the contiguous United States for fiscal years 2010 through 2016  confirmed this decline, showing an annual average of 46 cases per  station in 2010 to an annual average of 39 cases per station in 2016, a  decline of about 15 percent.

Similarly, after the Coast Guard attempted to  close two air facilities in 2014, legislation was passed in 2014 and 2016  that prohibited Coast Guard air facility closures until January 2016 and  2018, respectively.", "Figure 7 provides a timeline of Coast Guard station change proposals or  actions, including at least eight Coast Guard attempts to close stations  between 1973 and 2014.

For example, prior  to the 2013 contractor study, at least two Coast Guard districts conducted  their own station analyses to identify opportunities to improve their  stations\u2019 operations. These analyses also recommended permanent and  seasonal closures of some stations. Specifically, in 2010, Coast Guard  District 9 began conducting a data-driven analysis of its stations to  optimize its boat forces. District 9 officials told us they initiated the  analysis due to budget constraints, the challenges they had in fully  staffing their stations, and their awareness of overlapping SAR coverage  within the district. District 9\u2019s analysis reviewed more than 16,000 SAR  cases over a 5-year period (2008\u20132012) to understand and quantify  potential response inefficiencies. According to Coast Guard officials, their  analysis determined that overall SAR caseload in District 9 was extremely  high in the summer months, but there was little or no SAR caseload for  some stations during the winter, a factor which also affected training  proficiency as personnel were not able to respond to enough cases to  maintain required qualifications. Based on the results of this analysis, in  December 2012, District 9 requested approval to permanently close five  stations and seasonally close three stations to achieve more effective  operations and improve maritime safety in the Great Lakes region.", "According to Coast Guard district officials, these recommended closures  provided no calculated savings to taxpayers because they involved  movement of personnel positions and assets to other stations, not their  elimination. Instead, the recommendations showed an effort to improve  operational efficiency and conserve Coast Guard resources. Furthermore,  among those stations in Districts 1, 5, and 9 recommended for permanent  closure in 2013, at least five\u2014Ashtabula, Ohio; Frankfort, Michigan;  Harbor Beach, Michigan; Shark River, New Jersey; and Block Island,  Rhode Island\u2014were also recommended for closure between 1985 and  1988.", "When we compared the 2012 recommendations from the District 9  analysis, the 2013 contractor analysis recommendations that used the 9- step Station Optimization Process, and additional 2013 district input, we  found similar results among the various analyses with respect to which  stations should be permanently or seasonally closed. Based on our  review of documentation and interviews with District 9 officials, as well as  our comparison of the results of the District 9 analysis with the results of  the contractor analysis, the 2013 recommendations are affirmed by the  District 9 analysis.

For example, officials told us that because  one station recommended for seasonal closure does not operate a boat  capable of offshore SAR responses, adjacent stations are already  directed to respond to certain offshore SAR cases in that station\u2019s area of  responsibility to meet the Coast Guard\u2019s 2-hour SAR standard. Officials  we interviewed from each of the seven stations we visited in District 9  noted their station\u2019s high SAR caseload concentration during the summer  months and the low or nonexistent SAR caseload during the winter. For  example, officials from two stations that the Coast Guard would like to  seasonally close during the winter told us that their stations had not  responded to an ice rescue in more than 7 years. Officials we interviewed  at one station recommended for permanent closure noted that  commercial boating traffic and the local population have been declining  for many years, that the station was not busy during the winter season,  and that the station had not conducted an ice rescue since 2002.", "In 2017, the Coast Guard affirmed that its leadership believed that the  results of the 2013 study remained valid as station workloads have  remained relatively consistent. Headquarters officials also told us that the  2013 study criteria and subsequent recommendations for permanent  closures were conservative because of previous unsuccessful attempts to  close stations, and to meet statutory requirements to maintain a certain  level of SAR coverage. They also told us that the analysis did not  consider additional layers of response even though these layers could  provide some additional SAR response backup for Coast Guard stations.  For example, the contractor\u2019s analyses of boat stations did not consider  SAR support provided by Coast Guard aviation assets, which generally  provide an additional layer of SAR coverage for boat stations. Moreover,  district officials told us that aviation assets in District 9 were recently  realigned to provide even greater response capability, including longer  range helicopters with de-icing capability to improve winter response  capability.", "The contractor analysis also did not take into account the potential SAR  capabilities of commercial towing operators and local first responders  which can also provide another layer of coverage to assist Coast Guard  stations with SAR coverage. For example, officials from each of the seven  stations we visited in District 9 told us that they coordinate with other  entities, such as commercial towing operators, who can conduct  responses for non-life-threatening incidents, such as providing fuel to or  towing disabled boats in their station\u2019s area of responsibility. Officials from  one station also told us that the local fire department has performed ice  rescues in the past, because people who require ice rescues tend to dial  911 first rather than call the Coast Guard, and thus local emergency  responders are able to respond faster than the Coast Guard. Officials  from another station told us that the local sheriff has two response boats,  and that the Coast Guard coordinates with local government and  responders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Station Closures Could Achieve Cost Savings", "paragraphs": ["Station closures could also achieve cost savings in addition to the  aforementioned efficiency improvements. For example, based on our  analysis of the contractor study, if its recommendations to permanently  close the 18 stations from D1, D5, and D9 were implemented, and  personnel and boat assets were moved or reduced in accordance with  the study recommendations, the study reported that these closures could  achieve potential cost savings of about $290 million over 20 years. In  addition, land disposition estimates were excluded from the study, which  could result in one-time proceeds from the sale of the land on which the  stations are sited, if the land value exceeded remediation costs.", "In addition to lost opportunities to improve operational efficiency and  effectiveness because stations were not closed previously, some of these  stations have also fallen into physical disrepair and will require funding for  repairs if the stations remain open, even if they are only operated  seasonally. For example, officials at one station we visited showed us a  boat dock that was improperly installed and thus was subsequently  damaged by waves and will need to be repaired or replaced. At this same  station, officials informed us that the furnace system requires daily,  manual adjustments to address temperature fluctuations that could cause  damage to the station. One official also told us that this station\u2019s building  structure is too big and costly, and its condition too poor, to be worth  keeping. Therefore, even if this station were seasonally closed, as  currently recommended\u2014despite the analysis results suggesting  permanent closure\u2014the station will continue to require personnel to be at  the station on a daily basis year round. Another station, which multiple  studies recommended for permanent closure because of unnecessary  duplication and a caseload insufficient to sustain the training  requirements of personnel stationed there, was rebuilt as a result of  extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy.

The Coast Guard held these meetings to explain why it was  necessary to optimize station locations and reallocate personnel from  closed stations to their adjacent stations; address overlapping SAR  coverage; and seasonally close unnecessarily duplicative stations. Coast  Guard officials from one station told us they held a public meeting with the  local fire department, police, and commercial towing operators to describe  planned changes for seasonal operations at the station, despite this  station having been recommended for permanent closure by studies and  district input. According to Coast Guard officials, while some local  responders in the District 9 area expressed some concerns, they  understood the need for change. In addition, according to headquarters  officials, the Coast Guard has also completed outreach efforts with  members of Congress who represent these communities.

Officials stated that  the Coast Guard has not implemented the results of its sound process  because past station closure efforts have been met with resistance from  affected communities.

Closing unneeded stations has historically been difficult,  but with improvements in technology, severely decreased workloads, and  continuing budget constraints, the importance of reevaluating the  operations of these stations is even greater.
