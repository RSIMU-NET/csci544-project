A debt issuance suspension period is any period for which the Secretary of the Treasury has determined that obligations of the United States may not be issued without exceeding the debt ceiling. During this period, which lasted until May 27, 2003, the Secretary took actions related to the Government Securities Investment Fund of the Federal Employees' Retirement System (the G-Fund), the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Civil Service fund), and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling. Also, during fiscal year 2003, the Secretary initiated several actions involving the Civil Service Fund, FFB, and the Treasury general fund that related to Treasury's efforts to manage the amount of debt subject to the debt ceiling. The Secretary took other actions to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, such as suspending the sales of State and Local Government Series Treasury obligations and recalling noninterest- bearing deposits held by commercial banks as compensation for banking services provided to Treasury. The actions taken, which were consistent with legal authorities provided to the Secretary and related to the G-Fund, the Civil Service fund, and ESF, initially resulted in interest losses to the G-Fund and ESF and principal and interest losses to the Civil Service fund. When the debt ceiling was increased to $7.4 trillion on May 27, 2003, the Secretary fully invested the G-Fund's investments and on May 28, 2003, fully restored the interest losses, as required by law. On June 30, 2003, the Secretary fully compensated the Civil Service fund for principal and interest losses, as required by law. The losses related to ESF could not be restored without special legislation. As a result, related ESF losses of $3.6 million were not restored. The actions initiated by Treasury in fiscal year 2003 that involved the early redemption of FFB debt obligations held by the Civil Service fund and exchanges of obligations among the Civil Service fund, FFB, and the Treasury general fund resulted in all three parties realizing gains or incurring losses. In some cases, GAO has been able to quantify the gains or losses that occurred as a result of these transactions. For example, according to FFB estimates, the Civil Service fund lost more than $1 billion in interest because of FFB's redemption of FFB obligations held by the Civil Service fund before their maturity date and unforeseen interest rate changes. In other cases, however, information needed to understand the potential consequences of these actions will not be available for a number of years. The Secretary currently lacks the statutory authority to restore such losses and has not developed documented policies and procedures that can be used to minimize such losses in future actions that may be taken by Treasury that involve FFB and an account with investment authority such as the Civil Service fund."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the Congress and the President have enacted laws to establish  a limit on the amount of public debt that can be outstanding (debt ceiling).

The law was amended to raise the debt ceiling  several times between February 1941 and June 1946. The ceiling  established in June 1946, $275 billion, remained in effect until August 1954.  At that time, the first temporary debt ceiling was enacted, which added   $6 billion to the $275 billion permanent ceiling.", "The Congress and the President have enacted numerous temporary and  permanent increases in the debt ceiling.

During that period, Treasury took several actions  that were similar to those discussed later in this report. For example,  Treasury redeemed Treasury obligations held by the Civil Service fund  earlier than normal in order to borrow sufficient cash from the public to  meet the fund\u2019s benefit payments and did not invest some of the fund\u2019s  receipts.

Those authorities, which Treasury used during the 2003 debt issuance  suspension period, addressed (1) redemption of Civil Service fund  obligations, (2) suspension of Civil Service fund investments, and   (3) suspension of G-Fund investments. 1.

In some  cases, the actual obligation that Treasury should purchase is also specified.  When a federal government account with investment authority needs to  pay benefits and expenses, Treasury is normally notified of the amount and  the date that the disbursement is to be made.

In March 2003, during its normal  reconciliation processes, Treasury identified this error. Although normally  such errors are corrected by investing the funds redeemed in error on the  date the error is detected, Treasury did not do so. Rather, it decided to hold  the excess funds in an uninvested funds account until they were needed to  pay Highway Trust Fund expenses. The funds were used to pay the fund\u2019s  expenses through March 24, 2003. According to Treasury officials, the  primary reasons for not making the necessary reinvestment transaction on  the date the error was detected and validated were that (1) the Highway  Trust Fund does not earn interest on its investments and (2) the time  necessary to identify the error and fully understand its impact meant that  very little time actually elapsed when the funds could have been invested.  Therefore, the Highway Trust Fund was not harmed by Treasury\u2019s decision  to not invest the funds. However, Treasury officials subsequently agreed  that the over-redemption should have been reinvested on the day the error  was detected and adequate information was available to understand the  amount that should have been invested, regardless of whether the Highway  Trust Fund earns interest on its investments. Holding the excess funds in  an uninvested funds account reduced the amount of debt subject to the  debt ceiling by no more than $343 million for 26 days during the 2003 debt  issuance suspension period.", "To determine whether Treasury would have exceeded the debt ceiling if it  had not committed this error or had reinvested the over-redeemed amount  of funds when the error was discovered, we reviewed the invested balances  in the G-Fund during this period. As noted elsewhere in this report,  Treasury used the G-Fund during the 2003 debt issuance suspension period  to ensure that the investment activities associated with federal government  accounts with investment authority, such as the Highway Trust Fund, do  not cause Treasury to exceed the debt ceiling. Based on our review, we  found that the debt ceiling would not have been exceeded even if Treasury  had not made the original error or had invested these funds when the error  was detected, since other policies and procedures would have ensured a  corresponding reduction in the amount of funds invested on behalf of the  G-Fund. For example, on February 27, 2003, the computation Treasury used  to determine the amount that should be invested in the G-Fund showed that  Treasury could invest about $22.9 billion of G-Fund receipts. If the Highway  Trust Fund error had not been made, this computation would have shown  that Treasury could have invested about $22.6 billion in the G-Fund, or  about $0.3 billion less than what was actually invested.

Each day from February 20, 2003, to May 27, 2003, Treasury determined the  amount of funds that the G-Fund would be allowed to invest in Treasury  obligations and, when necessary, suspended some investments and  reinvestments of the G-Fund receipts and maturing obligations that would  have caused the debt ceiling to be exceeded.", "On February 20, 2003, when the Secretary of the Treasury determined that a  debt issuance suspension period had begun, the G-Fund held about   $48.3 billion of Treasury obligations that would mature that day. To ensure  that it did not exceed the debt ceiling, Treasury did not reinvest about   $8.5 billion of these obligations on that date.", "The amount of the G-Fund\u2019s receipts that Treasury invested changed daily,  depending on the amount of the federal government\u2019s outstanding debt.  Although Treasury can accurately predict the outcome of some events that  affect the outstanding debt, it cannot precisely determine the outcome of  others until they occur. For example, the amount of obligations that  Treasury will issue to the public from an auction can be determined some  days in advance because Treasury can control the amount that will be  issued. On the other hand, the amount of savings bonds that will be issued  and redeemed and the amount of obligations that will be issued to, or  redeemed by, various federal government accounts with investment  authority are difficult to precisely predict. Because of these difficulties,  Treasury needed a way to ensure that the normal investment and  redemption activities associated with Treasury obligations did not cause  the debt ceiling to be exceeded and also to maintain normal investment and  redemption policies for the majority of these accounts. To do these things,  each day during the debt issuance suspension period, Treasury   calculated the amount of debt subject to the debt ceiling, excluding the  receipts that the G-Fund would normally invest;  determined the amount of G-Fund receipts that could safely be invested  without exceeding the debt ceiling and invested this amount in Treasury  obligations; and  suspended investment, when necessary, of the G-Fund\u2019s remaining  receipts.", "For example, on February 27, 2003, the amount of debt subject to the debt  ceiling, excluding the G-Fund\u2019s requested investment of about $49 billion,  was about $6,377 billion or about $23 billion below the debt ceiling.  Accordingly, Treasury invested about $23 billion in the G-Fund. The  remaining $26 billion was uninvested. In accordance with law, interest on  the uninvested funds was paid once the debt issuance suspension period  ended.", "During the 2003 debt issuance suspension period, the G-Fund lost about  $362.5 million in interest because its excess funds were not fully invested.  Subsection 8438(g)(3) of title 5, United States Code, requires the Secretary  of the Treasury to make the G-Fund whole by restoring any losses once the  debt issuance suspension period has ended. On May 27, 2003, when the  debt ceiling was raised, Treasury fully invested the G-Fund\u2019s receipts and  on May 28, 2003, fully restored the lost interest on the G-Fund\u2019s uninvested  funds. Consequently, the G-Fund was fully compensated for its interest  losses during the 2003 debt issuance suspension period. We verified that  after this interest payment, the G-Fund\u2019s obligation holdings were, in effect,  the same as they would have been had the debt issuance suspension period  not occurred.", "Actions Related to ESF On several occasions from March 31, 2003, through May 23, 2003, Treasury  did not reinvest some of the maturing obligations held by ESF. Because  ESF\u2019s obligations are considered part of the federal government\u2019s  outstanding debt subject to the debt ceiling, that debt is reduced when the  Secretary of the Treasury does not reinvest ESF\u2019s maturing obligations.  Since ESF was not fully invested, it incurred interest losses of $3.6 million  during the 2003 debt issuance suspension period. The Secretary of the  Treasury is not authorized by law to restore these losses.", "The purpose of ESF is to help provide a stable system of monetary  exchange rates. The law establishing ESF authorizes the Secretary of the  Treasury to invest ESF\u2019s balances not needed for program purposes in  obligations of the federal government. This law also gives the Secretary of  the Treasury the sole discretion for determining when, and if, the excess  funds will be invested.

The $15 billion in FFB  9(a) obligations do not count against the debt ceiling. These FFB 9(a)  obligations were the result of a series of transactions stemming from a  Treasury-directed exchange of Treasury obligations held by the Civil  Service fund for FFB 9(a) obligations to assist Treasury in managing the  debt during the 1985 debt ceiling crisis. This early redemption resulted in a loss of over $1 billion on October 18, 2002, to the Civil Service fund  because of lost interest.", "On March 5, 2003, FFB issued an FFB 9(a) obligation of about $15 billion  to the Civil Service fund in exchange for about $15 billion in Treasury  obligations that had been held by the Civil Service fund.

We have found that the initial transactions between FFB and the  Civil Service fund relating to a given period in which Treasury was  experiencing debt ceiling difficulties were fair to both parties on the date  of the exchange. However, quantifying the long-term effects of these  transactions on the parties involved is difficult and complex because the  exchanges were structured to last many years. The longer the period in the  analysis used to evaluate the fairness of a given transaction, such as a  present value analysis, the greater the probability that the underlying  assumptions used to determine the original exchange price will not  accurately reflect the future years\u2019 events. This risk is also incurred when  the obligations relating to an exchange remain outstanding for a long time.  When the assumptions used to determine the initial exchange prices are  not realized (e.g., the obligation is redeemed sooner than expected), gains  and losses can result from interest rate changes and reinvestment of the  repayment in obligations that do not have comparable maturities. For  further discussion on the limitations of using a present value methodology  to determine gains and losses, see appendix II.", "In some cases, we have been able to quantify the gains or losses that have  occurred or can be expected to occur that relate to the fiscal year 2003  transactions.

Most  market-based obligations are mirror images of existing Treasury  obligations that are traded on the open market and are purchased or sold at  open market prices. Par value specials, on the other hand, are issued and  redeemed at par.", "The interest rates for par value specials are specified in the enabling statute  or by administrative action. For example, for the G-Fund, Civil Service  fund, and Social Security funds, the par value rate is based on the average  rate for comparable marketable obligations, as defined by Treasury, with 4  or more years to maturity. This rate is established monthly, and all  investments for a given month must bear the same rate. When a federal  government account with investment authority needs to redeem  obligations to pay benefits and expenses, Treasury redeems these  obligations and pays the fund the par value plus any accrued interest.  Although only certain accounts are allowed to invest in par value specials,  the majority of the $2.8 trillion of account investments on January 31, 2003,  were invested in par value specials. Equity between accounts investing in  par value specials and the Treasury general fund is not maintained because  (1) the interest rate is determined only monthly and (2) the term of the  investment is not relevant, as shown in the following examples:  The interest rate used to invest an account\u2019s receipts is determined only  monthly. If market interest rates fall during the month, the Treasury  general fund pays the account more interest than market conditions  dictate; if market interest rates rise during the month, the investment  account receives less interest than market conditions dictate.", "Many federal government accounts with investment authority holding  par value specials hold these obligations for a number of years.  Accordingly, the interest rates can vary significantly. For example, the  Civil Service fund has obligations that carry interest rates ranging from  3.5 percent to 8.75 percent in its portfolio that matures on June 30, 2005.  Even the rates for the portfolio that matures on June 30, 2014, range  from 3.5 percent to 6.5 percent. However, when the obligations are  needed to pay benefits, they are redeemed at par regardless of current  market rates.

Activity associated with current-year  investments that were subsequently redeemed in the current investment  year for program benefits and expenses can be significant. Such activity  totaled well over $100 billion dollars between January 31, 2003, and   June 30, 2003, for the Civil Service and Social Security funds.

We found in a 1987 review  that the procedures for making adjustments to accounts holding par value  specials, which are still being used, do not ensure that the results of  adjustments are equitable.

The present value  approach was also used to determine the amount of losses incurred by the  Civil Service fund when FFB repaid its obligations before they were  scheduled to mature. A key assumption in making a present value  calculation is that the underlying assumptions on interest rates and cash  flows will not change. For example, if a present value calculation shows  that an obligation\u2019s cash flows are worth $1 billion today assuming that the  $1 billion can be invested in a 4 percent obligation that matures on June 30,  Year 2, then it is critical that the investment be made in an obligation that  bears an interest rate of 4 percent and that the obligation matures on   June 30, Year 2. Otherwise, a gain or loss can occur if interest rates change,  as shown in table 5.", "Although the initial exchange was fair, as shown in table 5, since the actual  terms of the obligations issued were not the same as those used in the  present value assumption, the account is subject to risks associated with  interest rate changes.", "Another limitation associated with a present value analysis is that it does  not consider reinvestment risk. For example, in the case of the March 5,  2003, exchange between FFB and the Civil Service fund, the Treasury  obligations exchanged matured from June 30, 2004, through June 30, 2011.  However, the FFB 9(a) obligation received had a different cash flow.  Therefore, if the principal and interest payments associated with the FFB  9(a) obligation could not be invested at the same discount factor used in  the present value analysis, then a gain or loss would result. If the cash flows  can be invested at a higher interest rate, then a gain will occur.

Specifically, the terms of the FFB 9(a) obligation held by the Civil Service  fund stated that if FFB redeemed its obligation before maturity, the  redemption price would be based on current market rates rather than par  value, which was the basis used in the 1985 exchange. Therefore, to ensure  that the value of the exchange was fair to both parties on the date of the  exchange, Treasury used a present value analysis to compare the value of  future cash flows expected from the Treasury obligations being exchanged  by the Civil Service fund with the value of future cash flows expected from  the FFB 9(a) obligation. On June 30, 2003, FFB redeemed its March 5, 2003,  9(a) obligation before the December 2035 maturity date.

The net result of the March 5, 2003, and June 30,  2003, transactions between the Civil Service fund and FFB was that the  Civil Service fund had about $1.153 billion more in Treasury obligations  than it did before the March 5, 2003, transaction. This increase in Treasury  obligations held by the Civil Service fund occurred because the prevailing  market interest rates at the time of the exchanges were lower than the rates  of the Treasury obligations exchanged with FFB. However, the Civil Service  fund had a gain of only about $139.5 million because it had to invest the  proceeds from the obligation FFB redeemed on June 30, 2003, at a lower  interest rate. In other words, the Civil Service fund had more principal to  invest but was unable to invest that principal at a rate as high as the rate of  the Treasury obligations it had surrendered. Therefore, the Civil Service  fund needed more principal to generate approximately the same returns as  the obligations it had originally surrendered during the transaction on  March 5, 2003. The long-term economic effect of the June 30, 2003,  transaction on the Civil Service fund depends on the terms of the  obligations in which the proceeds are invested.", "In this case, one way to have helped ensure that the Civil Service fund  would not have cash flow gains or losses associated with investment of the  proceeds from the FFB redemption would have been to invest the proceeds  using a methodology that ensured that the fund had cash flows similar to  those from the original Treasury obligations used for the exchange on  March 5, 2003. This methodology is commonly referred to as a \u201ccash flow\u201d  approach. However, the cash flow approach can also result in gains and losses, since it does not consider the reinvestment risks that may be  present. Appendix II discusses how the cash flow methodology ensures  that a cash flow gain or loss does not occur and how reinvestment risks are  not considered in this methodology.", "Treasury\u2019s approach for investing the June 30, 2003, FFB redemption  proceeds was to apply its normal investment policies and procedures. In  this case, Treasury, in effect, (1) replaced the dollar value of the obligations  used for the March 5, 2003, exchange with 3.5 percent Treasury obligations  and (2) divided the remaining proceeds equally over a 15-year period. While  this approach differs from the cash flow approach and may result in future  gains and losses, the key point is that Treasury has not yet developed  documented policies and procedures for managing such transactions. The  process of documenting the policies and procedures that should be used  for such transactions allows Treasury\u2019s management to understand the  impacts of various alternatives and whether they introduce any additional  risks to the parties involved. It also helps Treasury evaluate whether it may  need additional statutory authority to ensure that all accounts are  adequately protected. Further, if effectively implemented, documentation  of policies and procedures reduces the chance for confusion and risk of  errors should Treasury need to use the policies and procedures in the  future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FFB and Treasury General Fund Gains and Losses Associated with the 2003 Exchange Transaction", "paragraphs": ["FFB and the Treasury general fund had gains and losses associated with the  March 5, 2003, and the June 30, 2003, transactions.

Treasury agreed to pay FFB about $520 million more than the par value of  these obligations. As payment for this purchase, Treasury sold back to FFB  9(b) obligations issued by FFB that Treasury held. In effect, Treasury  canceled about $15.7 billion of the FFB 9(b) obligations it held with about  $15.2 billion of Treasury par value specials that FFB had received from the  Civil Service fund. Therefore, FFB had a gain and the Treasury general fund  had a corresponding loss on the exchange. Table 8 shows how this  transaction generated a gain for FFB.", "The March 5, 2003, exchange was in contrast to FFB\u2019s October 18, 2002,  early redemption of its 9(a) obligations held by the Civil Service fund. On  October 18, 2002, Treasury decided that the FFB 9(a) obligations being  redeemed prior to maturity that were related to Treasury's effort to manage  the 1985 debt ceiling would be redeemed at par value and that the Civil  Service fund would incur the loss. Treasury\u2019s redemption of par value  specials in excess of their par value is also in contrast to its normal policies  and procedures, which allow agencies holding the par value specials only  to redeem them from Treasury at face value to pay for the fund\u2019s benefits  and expenses. If Treasury had accepted the par value specials at par rather  than at current market rates, then the total losses to FFB would have been  about $1.153 billion rather than the $633 million total net loss resulting from the March 5, 2003, and June 30, 2003, transactions. The $1.153 billion  is also the amount of the gain FFB expects to make in future periods.", "The key difference between the March 5, 2003, exchange and the normal  exchanges between Treasury and federal government accounts with  investment authority related to their investments in par value specials is  that for the March 5, 2003, exchange between Treasury and FFB, a present  value analysis was used to calculate the amount of debt that should be  removed from Treasury\u2019s books\u2014the same analysis that Treasury used to  ensure that the exchange between FFB and the Civil Service fund was fair.  Whether FFB or the Treasury general fund incurs a gain or loss when par  value specials are used to cancel FFB 9(b) obligations depends greatly on  the value of the Treasury obligations held by the Civil Service fund that are  selected for the exchange. For example, if the interest rates on the Treasury  obligations held by the Civil Service fund had been 3.875 percent rather  than 5.25 percent, Treasury would have exchanged par value specials with  a value of about $16.2 billion held by the Civil Service fund with FFB, and  FFB would have provided these to Treasury to cancel the $15.7 billion of  FFB 9(b) obligations. In this case, Treasury would have recognized a gain  rather than the loss that was recorded because 5.25 percent par value  specials were used in the exchange. Table 9 provides a simplified example  of how this works."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FFB Issued Additional 9(b) Obligations on June 30, 2003, to Redeem FFB 9(a) Obligation", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, when FFB decided on June 30, 2003, to redeem prior  to maturity the 9(a) obligation it had issued to the Civil Service fund,  another present value analysis was performed. As a result of this analysis,  FFB had to borrow about $16.6 billion from Treasury using 9(b) obligations  to redeem the $15 billion FFB 9(a) obligation it had issued to the Civil  Service fund. FFB needed these additional funds because the FFB 9(a)  obligation was based on an interest rate yield of 5.25 percent and the  interest rate used in the present value analysis was 3.5 percent (the June  2003 Civil Service fund investment rate). According to FFB officials, the  following approach was used to structure this $16.6 billion loan from  Treasury:  FFB borrowed $15.4 billion using principal repayments that mirrored  principal payments used in the original FFB 9(a) obligation to the Civil  Service fund, which, in turn, mirrored the underlying FFB loans made to  its borrowers. For example, if FFB held a loan that called for a   $10 million principal payment on December 31, 2005, then FFB would  have borrowed $10 million from Treasury with a December 31, 2005,  repayment date. In effect, after these transactions, FFB\u2019s loan  repayments for its 9(b) obligations to Treasury mirrored the underlying  loan principal repayments that FFB expected to receive from its loan  portfolio.", "FFB borrowed about $1.1 billion using a short-term obligation.", "The $1.1 billion corresponds to FFB\u2019s net loss of $633 million and the  Treasury general fund\u2019s loss of $520 million, which were realized on the  March 5, 2003, and June 30, 2003, transactions.

According to FFB officials, these increased cash flows resulted from   (1) the reduced interest costs associated with the October 18, 2002, early  redemption of FFB 9(a) obligations issued to the Civil Service fund noted  earlier in this report and (2) the reduced interest costs associated with the  June 30, 2003, FFB 9(b) obligations that were used to redeem the FFB 9(a)  obligation issued to the Civil Service fund on March 5, 2003. Therefore,  once the short-term 9(b) obligation is redeemed, the future principal  payments associated with FFB\u2019s loan portfolio will, for all practical  purposes, mirror the principal payments that will be made to Treasury.  However, the interest earnings on FFB\u2019s loan portfolio will be far greater  than the interest payments that will be due to Treasury on FFB 9(b)  obligations issued to Treasury. This interest rate differential will then  translate into increased earnings for FFB that can be expected to offset the  losses associated with the 2003 exchange transactions with the Civil  Service fund."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Transactions between FFB and the Civil Service Fund", "paragraphs": ["During the 1985 debt ceiling crisis, Treasury for the first time invested  excess Civil Service fund receipts of the Civil Service fund in FFB 9(a)  obligations.

Since the federal agency obligations held by FFB  differed from the terms and conditions of the obligations held by the Civil  Service fund, the task of determining a fair exchange price was more  complicated than in 1985. Because the effects of these differences in terms  and conditions can be significant, a generally accepted methodology was  used that considered such factors as (1) the current market rates for  outstanding Treasury obligations at the time of the exchange, (2) the  probability of changing interest rates, (3) the probability of the federal  agency paying off the debt early, and (4) the premium the market would  provide to an obligation that could be redeemed at par regardless of market  interest rates.
