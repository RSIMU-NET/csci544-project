GAO's findings call into question competition data associated with nearly $3 billion in annual obligations for IT-related orders. DHS identified underlying issues resulting in the errors for its orders and took corrective action. DOD and HHS, however, had limited insight into why the errors occurred. Without identifying the issues contributing to the errors, DOD and HHS are unable to take action to ensure that competition data are accurately recorded in the future, and are at risk of using inaccurate information to assess whether they are achieving their competition objectives.", "GAO found that DOD, DHS, and HHS primarily cited two reasons for awarding a noncompetitive contract or order: (1) only one source could meet the need (for example, the contractor owned proprietary technical or data rights) or (2) the agency awarded the contract to a small business to help meet agency goals.", "GAO estimates that about 8 percent of 2016 noncompetitive IT contracts and orders at DOD, DHS, and HHS were bridge contracts, awarded in part because of acquisition planning challenges. GAO previously recommended that the Office of Federal Procurement Policy define bridge contracts and provide guidance on their use, but it has not yet done so. GAO believes that addressing this recommendation will help agencies better manage their use of bridge contracts.", "Additionally, GAO estimates that about 7 percent of noncompetitive IT contracts and orders were used to support outdated or obsolete legacy IT systems.

Competition for these IT products and services is a  key component to fostering IT innovation and achieving the best return on  investment for taxpayers. Federal agencies are generally required to  award contracts competitively but are permitted to award noncompetitive  contracts under certain circumstances, such as when only one contractor  can meet the need or to eligible small businesses in order to meet  agencies\u2019 small business goals.", "In some cases, noncompetitive contracts act as \u201cbridge contracts.\u201d While  there is no government-wide definition for bridge contracts, GAO has  defined it as an extension to an existing contract beyond the period of  performance (including base and option years), or a new, short-term  contract awarded on a sole-source basis to an incumbent contractor to  avoid a lapse in service caused by a delay in awarding a follow-on  contract. Bridge contracts can be a useful tool to avoid a gap in services  and are typically envisioned as short-term. However, in October 2015, we  found that some bridge contracts spanned multiple years, potentially  undetected by approving officials. When noncompetitive bridge contracts  are used frequently or for prolonged periods, the government is at risk of  paying more than it should for products and services. In addition, our past  work found that agencies are investing most of their IT dollars on  maintaining legacy IT systems, which are becoming increasingly  obsolete. For example, in May 2016, we found that many systems use  outdated software languages and hardware parts that are no longer  supported by their vendors. The government, in these instances, runs the  risk of maintaining systems that have outlived their effectiveness.", "You asked us to review the federal government\u2019s use of noncompetitive  contracts for IT, including the use of bridge contracts.

For the last objective, you requested that we ascertain  the extent to which our generalizable sample of contracts and orders  were in support of legacy systems as defined by the Modernizing  Government Technology Act (MGT), which was enacted in December  2017, after our work was underway.", "To examine the extent to which agencies used noncompetitive contracts  and orders to procure IT products and services, we analyzed  government-wide Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  (FPDS-NG) data on IT obligations from fiscal years 2013 through 2017  (the most recent and complete data available). To define IT, we used the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Category Management  Leadership Council list of IT product and service codes to identify IT- related products and services. To assess the reliability of the FPDS-NG  data, we electronically tested for missing data, outliers, and inconsistent  coding, and compared data on selected noncompetitive contracts to  contract documentation we obtained. Based on these steps, we  determined that FPDS-NG data were sufficiently reliable for describing  general trends in government-wide and IT contract obligations data for  fiscal years 2013 through 2017. We determined, however, that a subset  of noncompetitive obligations were inaccurately coded as noncompetitive  and thus not reliable. We explore this issue further in the body of this  report.", "To determine the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts and orders  for selected IT procurements, we selected the three agencies with the  highest reported obligations on IT noncompetitive contracts for fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 (the most recent year of data available at the  time we began our review)\u2014the Departments of Defense (DOD),  Homeland Security (DHS), and Health and Human Services (HHS).  These three agencies collectively accounted for 70 percent of all  noncompetitively awarded contracts for IT during this period. From these  agencies, we selected a generalizable stratified random sample of 171  fiscal year 2016 noncompetitive contracts and orders for IT above the  simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000 to determine the reasons for  using noncompetitive contracts and orders. The sample was  proportionate to the amount of noncompetitive contracts and orders for IT  at each agency. For each of the contracts and orders in our generalizable  sample, we analyzed selected contract documentation, such as  justification and approval documents (J&A), exception to fair opportunity  documents, and small business coordination records. Based on our  review of documentation, we excluded 29 contracts and orders because  they were awarded competitively, but had been miscoded as  noncompetitive or as having an exception to fair opportunity. As a result,  our sample consisted of 142 contracts and orders. See table 1 for a  breakdown by agency.", "To determine the extent to which IT procurements at selected agencies  were bridge contracts or in support of legacy systems, we leveraged the  generalizable sample described above to estimate the percentage of  bridge contracts and legacy IT systems at DOD, DHS, and HHS.  Agencies provided information as to whether the contracts and orders  within the generalizable sample met GAO\u2019s definition of a bridge contract  and whether the systems they supported met the definition of legacy IT  systems in OMB\u2019s draft IT Modernization Initiative or the definition  provided under the Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT).  OMB\u2019s draft IT Modernization Initiative defined legacy systems as  spending dedicated to maintaining the existing IT portfolio excluding  provisioned services such as cloud, while the MGT Act defined them as  an outdated or obsolete IT system. We verified the agencies\u2019  determinations of bridge contracts by reviewing documentation for the  contracts and orders in our generalizable sample. To obtain additional  insights into the bridge contracts and legacy systems, we selected a  nonprobability sample of 26 contracts and orders from our generalizable  sample of 142 contracts and orders for in-depth review. Our selection was  based on factors such as obtaining a mix of bridge contracts and  contracts used in support of legacy IT systems.", "For our in-depth review, we collected and analyzed contract file  documentation for the selected contracts and orders. In cases where we  selected a potential bridge contract, we also reviewed the contract  preceding it, additional bridge contracts (if any), and, if awarded at the  time of our review, the follow-on contract. We interviewed contracting and  program officials to gain insights into the facts and circumstances  surrounding the awards of IT noncompetitive contracts and orders. For  bridge contracts and orders, we asked about the reasons why bridge  contracts were needed and status of follow-on contracts; for legacy  contracts, we asked about the nature of the requirement and plans to  move to newer technologies or systems.

In addition, there are competition- related requirements for other types of contract vehicles, including  multiple award indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts and  the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule  (FSS). The rules regarding exceptions to full and open competition and  other competition-related requirements are outlined in various parts of the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). For example:", "Contracting officers may award a contract without providing for full  and open competition if one of seven exceptions listed in FAR  Subpart 6.3 apply. Examples of allowable exceptions include  circumstances when products or services required by the agency are  available from only one source, when disclosure of the agency\u2019s need  would compromise national security, or when the need for products  and services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the  federal government faces the risk of serious financial or other injury.  Generally, exceptions to full and open competition under FAR subpart  6.3 must be supported by written justifications that contain sufficient  facts and rationale to justify use of the specific exception.", "Depending on the proposed value of the contract, the justifications  require review and approval at successively higher approval levels  within the agency.", "Contracting officers are also authorized to issue orders under multiple  award IDIQ contracts noncompetitively. Generally contracting officers  must provide each IDIQ contract holder with a fair opportunity to be  considered for each order unless exceptions apply. Contracting  officers who issue orders over certain thresholds under an exception  to fair opportunity are required to provide written justification for doing  so. In April 2017 we found that government-wide, more than 85  percent of all order obligations under multiple-award IDIQ contracts  were competed from fiscal years 2011 through 2015.", "Orders placed under GSA\u2019s FSS program are also exempt from FAR  part 6 requirements. However, ordering procedures require certain  FSS orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold to be  placed on a \u201ccompetitive basis,\u201d which includes requesting proposals  from as many schedule contractors as practicable. If a contracting  officer decides not to provide opportunity to all contract holders when  placing an FSS order over the simplified acquisition threshold, that  decision must be documented and approved. The FAR allows for  orders to be placed under these circumstances based on the following  justifications: when an urgent and compelling need exists; when only  one source is capable of providing the supplies or services because  they are unique or highly specialized; when in the interest of economy  and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original FSS  order that was placed on a \u201ccompetitive basis;\u201d and when an item is  \u201cpeculiar to one manufacturer.\u201d", "Agencies may also award contracts on a sole-source basis in  coordination with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to eligible  8(a) program participants.

The fact that the full length of a bridge contract, or  multiple bridge contracts for the same requirement, is not readily apparent  from documents that may require review and approval, such as an  individual J&A, presents a challenge for those agency officials  responsible for approving the use of bridge contracts.

This  miscoding occurred at such a high rate that it put into question the  reliability of the competition data on orders totaling roughly $3 billion per  year in annual obligations. In each of these cases, contracting officers  identified these orders as being noncompetitively awarded when they  were, in fact, competitively awarded.

DHS officials told us that orders issued from single  award contracts should inherit the competition characteristics of the  parent contract. However, as FPDS-NG currently operates, contracting  officers have the ability to input a different competition code for these  orders. In this case, each of the single award contracts was competitively  awarded and therefore all the subsequent orders issued from these  contracts should be considered competitively awarded, as there are no  additional opportunities for competition. DHS has taken actions to  address this issue. DHS officials stated that in conjunction with DOD they  have asked GSA, which manages the FPDS-NG data system, to modify  FPDS-NG to automatically prefill competition codes for orders awarded  under single award contracts. DHS officials noted that GSA expects to  correct the issue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which should  mitigate the risks of agencies miscoding orders issued under single award  contracts in the future.

The Navy\u2019s J&A document noted that the contractor owned the  proprietary data rights to the transmitting equipment and software,  and the Navy required the equipment to be compatible and  interchangeable with systems currently fielded throughout the Navy.  Furthermore, the document noted that seeking competition through  the development of a new source would result in additional costs that  would far exceed any possible cost savings that another source could  provide and would cause unacceptable schedule delays.", "This example illustrates that decisions the program officials make  during the acquisition process to acquire or not acquire certain rights  to technical data can have far-reaching implications for DOD\u2019s ability  to sustain and competitively procure parts and services for those  systems, as we have previously reported. In our May 2014 report on  competition in defense contracting, we found that 7 of 14 justifications  we reviewed explained that the awards could not be competed due to  a lack of technical data. All 7 of these justifications or supporting  documents described situations, ranging from 3 to 30 years in  duration, where DOD was unable to conduct a competition because  data rights were not purchased with the initial award. We  recommended in May 2014 that DOD ensure that existing acquisition  planning guidance promotes early vendor engagement and allows  both the government and vendors adequate time to prepare for  competition. DOD concurred with our recommendation. In April 2015,  DOD updated its acquisition guidance to incorporate new guidelines  for creating and maintaining a competitive environment.

For example,  we selected three noncompetitive orders from our generalizable sample  for in-depth review that were used to buy accessories and maintenance  for the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) PRC-152 and 117G  radios. We found that although the three orders were not bridge  contracts, the underlying indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  contract\u2014which outlines the terms and conditions, including pricing for  the orders\u2014had been extended 12 months to continue services until the  follow-on IDIQ could be awarded. We also selected an Air Force order for  equipment for the Joint Strike Fighter instrumentation pallet for in-depth  review. Further analysis revealed that the underlying IDIQ was extended  for 5 additional months to continue services until officials could award a  follow-on contract for this requirement. Including these 2 additional bridge  contracts brings the total number of bridge contracts we identified during  this review to 15. For legacy contracts and orders we asked about the  nature of the requirement and plan to move to newer technologies or  systems. The selection process for the generalizable sample is described  in detail below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selection Methodology for Generalizable Sample", "paragraphs": ["We selected a generalizable stratified random sample of 171 contracts  and orders from a sample frame of 3,671 fiscal year 2016 IT  noncompetitive contracts and orders, including orders under multiple  award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts over $150,000 to  generate percentage estimates to the population. We excluded contracts  and orders with estimated values below the simplified acquisition  threshold of $150,000 as these contracts have streamlined acquisition  procedures. We stratified the sample frame into nine mutually exclusive  strata by agency and type of award, i.e. contract, order, and multiple  award order for each of the three agencies. We computed the minimum  sample size needed for a proportion estimate to achieve an overall  precision of at least plus or minus 10 percentage points or fewer at the 95  percent confidence level. We increased the computed sample size to  account for about 10 percent of the population to be out of scope, such as  competitive or non-IT contracts or orders. We then proportionally  allocated the sample size across the defined strata and increased sample  sizes where necessary so that each stratum would contain at least 10  sampled contracts or orders. The stratified sample frame and sizes are  described in table 5 below.", "We selected contracts and orders from the following components:", "DOD: Air Force, Army, Navy, Defense Information Systems Agency,  Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Security Service, Defense Threat  Reduction Agency, U.S. Special Operations Command, and  Washington Headquarter Services;", "HHS: Centers for Disease Control, Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services, Food and Drug Administration, Indian Health  Service, National Institutes of Health, and the Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Administration;", "DHS: Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of  Procurement Operations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,  U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S.  Secret Service.", "We excluded 29 contracts and orders as we determined they had been  miscoded as noncompetitive or as not having an exception to fair  opportunity. Based on these exclusions, we estimate the number of  noncompetitive contracts and orders in this population was about 3,000  (+/- 6.7 percent). All estimates in this report have a margin of error, at the  95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 9 percentage points or  fewer.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to December 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
