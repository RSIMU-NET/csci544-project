Students with disabilities were most often included in the regular reading assessment, and relatively few took alternate assessments. Nationwide, the percentage of students with disabilities who were excluded from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) was 5 percent, but varied across states, ranging from about 2 percent to 10 percent in 2002. Among the reasons for exclusion were differences in accommodations between states and the NAEP and variation in decisions among states about who should take the NAEP. National experts and officials in the four states we studied told us that designing and implementing alternate assessments was difficult because these assessments were relatively new and the abilities of students assessed varied widely. Officials in two states said they were not using an alternate assessment measured on grade-level standards because they were unfamiliar with such assessment models or because of concerns that the assessment would not appropriately measure achievement. In addition, learning the skills to administer alternate assessments was time-consuming for teachers, as was administering the assessment. Education provided support to states on including students with disabilities in statewide assessments in a number of ways, including disseminating guidance through its Web site. However, a number of state officials told us that the regulations and guidance did not provide illustrative examples of alternate assessments and how they could be used to appropriately assess students with disabilities.

In  an effort to improve the academic achievement of all students, including  those with disabilities, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) of 2001  requires that states, districts, and schools are held accountable for their  students\u2019 academic performance. Like all students, those with disabilities  must be included in statewide assessments of achievement under the  NCLBA. Assessments for students with disabilities are also required under  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). States must  provide options to ensure that students with disabilities are included in  annual assessments. States need to offer accommodations to meet these  students\u2019 needs, for example, by giving them more time to take the same  assessment as other students. States also are required to offer alternate  assessments that measure students\u2019 performance at the same grade-level  standards or at below grade-level standards. For example, students with  the most significant cognitive disabilities could be assessed on their  knowledge of academic content, such as fractions, by having to split  groups of objects into two, three, or equal parts.  Separately, under  NCLBA, states participate periodically in the National Assessment of  Educational Progress (NAEP), which provides a national picture of  student academic achievement and a common measure of student  achievement across states.", "Questions have been raised, however, about the extent to which students  with disabilities have been included in statewide assessments and whether  these assessments accurately reflected student performance. Given your  interest in these issues, we are providing you with information about (1)  the extent to which students with disabilities were included in statewide  assessments; (2) what issues selected states faced in implementing  alternate assessments; and (3) how the U.S. Department of Education  (Education) supported states in their efforts to assess students with  disabilities.", "To obtain this information we used multiple data collection methods. To  provide a national perspective, we reviewed and verified data on statewide  assessments for the most recent school year available, 2003-04, from the  State Consolidated Performance Reports provided by state officials to  Education. Complete data were not available for mathematics  assessments. Thus, we only verified reading-assessment data. This  included data from 48 states and the District of Columbia on the  participation rate of students with disabilities in assessments and data  from 50 states and the District of Columbia on the types of assessments in  which students with disabilities were included. Two states did not provide  participation rate data in a usable format for students with disabilities, and  one of these states also did not do so for all students. We also interviewed  national education organization representatives and assessment experts.  Second, we made site visits to four states\u2014Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts,  and Oregon\u2014to collect in-depth information from state, district, and local  officials. We selected these states to obtain variance in the participation  rate of students with disabilities in statewide assessments, the type of  alternate assessment data available in each state, innovative state  approaches to assessment, and the availability of state assessment data for  students with disabilities. We reviewed several national studies on the  effects of students being excluded from NAEP and determined they were  reliable for the purposes for which we used them. We also analyzed  Education\u2019s documents and Web site, legislation, and other materials  related to the assessment requirements for students with disabilities. We  conducted our work between September 2004 and June 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Students with disabilities are a complex and diverse group. These students  can have a wide range of physical and psychological disabilities, from  severe cognitive delays or emotional disorders to specific learning  disabilities that can affect their ability to learn. In addition, students with  the same disability may demonstrate different levels of academic aptitude  and achievement. Individual students with disabilities may demonstrate  grade-level or above achievement in some academic areas, while at the  same time demonstrating lower academic achievement in other areas.  Finally, students with disabilities may require different approaches to  assess their performance.", "Two federal laws specifically require states to administer assessments for  students with disabilities: NCLBA and the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA) last amended in 2004. NCLBA, which reauthorized  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was designed to improve  academic achievement for all students. NCLBA requires that students with  disabilities be included in statewide assessments that are used to  determine whether schools and districts meet state goals. Further, NCLBA  requires that all students, including students with disabilities, be measured  against academic achievement standards established by the states.  Specifically, NCLBA requires annual participation in assessments in third  through eighth grades and one high school grade for reading and  mathematics by the 2005-6 school year. To be deemed as making progress,  each school must show that the school as a whole, as well as each of  designated groups such as students with disabilities, met the state  proficiency goals. Schools must also show that at least 95 percent of  students in grades required to take the test have done so. Further, schools  must also demonstrate that they have met state targets on another  measure of progress \u2013 graduation rates in high school or attendance or  other measures in elementary or middle schools.", "Under NCLBA, states are required to participate in NAEP for reading and  math assessments in grades four and eight, although student participation  continues to be voluntary. The purpose of this requirement was to use  NAEP scores as confirmatory evidence about student achievement on  state tests.  According to Education, confirming state test results  represented a new formal purpose for the NAEP. Also called \u201cThe Nation\u2019s  Report Card,\u201d the NAEP has been conducted regularly since 1969. Since  then, this assessment has provided a national measure of student  achievement. The NAEP can be used to track trends in student  achievement over time or to compare student performance in a particular  state with the national average. In 1996, Education developed a new  inclusion policy that provided for accommodations allowing most students  with disabilities to participate meaningfully in the NAEP. This policy was  developed in response to increases in the numbers of students with  disabilities, the attention paid to their needs, and a corresponding demand  for information about their academic progress. Under the old policy, far  fewer students with disabilities had been included in testing.", "IDEA is the primary federal law that addresses the educational needs of  children with disabilities, including children with significant cognitive  disabilities. The law mandates that a free appropriate public education be  made available for all eligible children with disabilities, requires an  individualized education program (IEP) for each student, the inclusion of  students with disabilities in state and district assessments, and requires  states to provide appropriate accommodations for students who can take  the regular assessment and to develop alternate assessments for students  who cannot participate meaningfully in the regular assessment. The IEP  team, which develops the IEP, also decides how students with disabilities  participate in assessments, either without accommodations, with  accommodations, or through alternate assessments.", "Accommodations alter the way a regular assessment is administered. They  provide students with disabilities the opportunity to demonstrate their  academic achievement on a regular assessment without being impeded by  their disabilities. For example, a student may need extended time to finish  the assessment or someone to read the instructions aloud. Another  example of an accommodation is taking the assessment in a small group  setting.", "Alternate assessments are designed for the relatively few students with  disabilities who are unable to participate in the regular statewide  assessment, even with appropriate accommodations. For example, a  student with the most significant cognitive and physical disabilities may be  able to communicate only through moving her eyes and blinking. An  alternate assessment for this student could include teacher observation  reports and samples of student work. Similar to the regular assessments,  NCLBA requires that alternate assessments be aligned with the state\u2019s  achievement standards. However, these assessments may be scored  against grade-level or below grade-level achievement standards. See table  1 for examples of assessment types and achievement standards.", "An alternate assessment based upon grade-level achievement standards  reflects the same standards as the regular assessment. For example, a  student with an emotional disability, who might do her best work while  being supervised, could solve an algebraic problem for a missing variable  that is similar to items on the regular assessment while her teacher  observed her perform the task correctly. Because the items are similar in  complexity, the alternate assessment\u2014observing the student performing  the academic task correctly\u2014would measure the same grade-level  achievement standard as the regular assessment. For some students who  could not be accommodated on the regular assessment, this method  allows them to demonstrate their knowledge of grade-level academic  content.", "An alternate assessment based upon below grade-level achievement  standards reflects standards that are less complex than those on the  regular assessment. In contrast to a student solving an algebraic problem  for a missing variable, a student with a cognitive disability could  determine which coin is missing from a set of coins while his teacher  records his efforts on a videotape. For some students, the alternate  assessment allows them to demonstrate their knowledge of academic  content at their individual developmental levels. Education\u2019s guidance  states that these below grade-level standards are appropriate only for  students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. The guidance  placed no limit on the number of students that could be assessed against  these standards. Under NCLBA, states and districts can count the  proficient scores of students taking assessments with below grade-level  standards as meeting state achievement goals provided the number of  these students does not exceed 1 percent of all students.", "In addition, Education announced a new policy in April 2005 allowing  states additional flexibility in assessing some students with disabilities\u2014 those who are not significantly cognitively disabled, but face considerable  challenges in their academic development. For example, some students  with disabilities may be 3 to 5 years behind their peers academically. The  additional flexibility allows states to assess more students using less  complex or below grade-level achievement standards. Further, qualified  states were allowed to count the scores of these students as meeting state  achievement goals, as long as the number of proficient scores for these  students did not exceed 2 percent of all students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Students with Disabilities Participated in Statewide Reading Assessments in the 2003-04 School Year", "paragraphs": ["Most students with disabilities participated in statewide reading  assessments in the 2003-04 school year.

Education officials discussed several reasons students with  disabilities were excluded from the assessment including: (1) the student  had such a severe disability that the student could not meaningfully  participate; (2) the principal and the IEP team decided that the student  should not participate; and (3) the student\u2019s IEP required that the student  be tested with accommodations that NAEP does not allow. At the state  level, the percentage of students with disabilities who were excluded  varied in 2002. For example, over 10 percent of students with disabilities  were excluded from the 2002 NAEP reading assessment in three states,  and only 2 percent to 3 percent of students with disabilities were excluded  in a handful of other states.  According to Education officials, the  inclusion of students with disabilities in the NAEP assessments is affected  by sampling issues as well as by the limitations of accommodations that  are appropriate for the content covered by the NAEP.", "Research suggests that NAEP results for some states may be affected by  exclusion rates. A 2003 report commissioned by Education found that  different state exclusion rates affected NAEP\u2019s rankings of states on  student reading achievement. One purpose of the NAEP is to provide a  basis for comparing states, each of which has its own standards and  assessment system. These state rankings are often used by states and  other organizations to compare states and determine how well states are  educating their students. Additionally, state rankings are viewed by  parents and state and local officials as important indicators of the quality  of their states\u2019 education systems. The report examined how state  rankings would change under two different assumptions about how  excluded students would have performed on the assessment if they had  been included. The report found that state rankings changed for over half  of the states on both the fourth and eighth grade NAEP with both  assumptions. In one scenario, two states fell 6 places and one state fell 7  places in the state rankings.", "In addition, a 2003 report that was commissioned by the National  Assessment Governing Board, an independent, bipartisan body appointed  by Education, concluded that changes in state achievement on the NAEP  between 1998 and 2002 could be partially explained by changes in  exclusion rates. Changes in state results on the NAEP are frequently used  by states and researchers to gauge which states have successfully raised  student achievement. The study examined the 36 states that participated in  both the 1998 and 2002 NAEP reading assessments. The report concluded  that \u201ca substantial portion of variation in states\u2019 achievement score  changes can be accounted for by changes in their rates of exclusion. A  report released by Education, the 2002 NAEP Report Card, found similar  associations and said that there is a moderate tendency for exclusion rates  to be associated with achievement gains but that exclusion rates do not  entirely explain score gains.", "Some students with disabilities are excluded from the NAEP because it  does not allow some accommodations that are permitted by on statewide  assessments. Education officials said that certain accommodations would  interfere with the NAEP\u2019s measurement of the knowledge being assessed.  For instance, in the reading assessment, reading the passage and questions  aloud to a student was not permitted because the assessment is intended  to measure the student\u2019s ability to read the written word as well as  understand the meaning of the passage. Education officials also said that  some accommodations could not be administered with the assessment for  logistical reasons. For example, extending testing over several days was  not allowed because NAEP testing administrators are in each school only  one day. Education has not developed alternate assessments for the  NAEP. Table 3 lists accommodations that are allowed on some statewide  assessments but not on the NAEP.", "Another reason why states' exclusion rates for could vary on NAEP may  relate to state policies and requirements regarding student participation of  students with disabilities. Although states are required to participate in the  NAEP, student participation in this assessment is voluntary.  Whether  students with disabilities take the NAEP depends primarily on the  recommendation of the student's IEP team, along with the availability of  appropriate accommodations. Team decision criteria could vary across  states, leading to differences in exclusion rates.", "Education officials said they are implementing a new policy for how  students with disabilities should be included in the NAEP assessment that  will reduce variability in the inclusion of students with disabilities.  Previously, the student\u2019s IEP team and principal had to decide whether a  student could participate in the NAEP assessment, leaving room for  interpretation.  The new policy will require schools to include students in  the NAEP assessment if the students took the regular statewide  assessments (with or without accommodations) and the students\u2019 IEPs do  not specify that they be provided accommodations that NAEP does not  allow.  In addition, the new policy will require schools to include students  with disabilities who took the state\u2019s alternate assessment, if the school  believes that the students can participate meaningfully in the NAEP  assessment.

An alternate  assessment with below grade-level standards might include a student  reading one- or two-word items and matching them to familiar people,  places, or things.

Historically, special education teachers had little exposure to this  curriculum and its associated standards because they have taught  functional skills, such as shopping independently in stores. Officials in one  state told us that their teachers faced a learning curve to become familiar  with the academic curriculum and how to create appropriate ways for  their students to access that curriculum. For example, the grade-level  curriculum might teach students to determine the meaning of unknown  words from their context for the fourth grade reading assessment. A  special education teacher would need to learn the grade-level curriculum  and then match a student\u2019s skills with an appropriate task to demonstrate  mastery for the student\u2019s individual level. For example, a highly  functioning special education student might demonstrate mastery by using  a dictionary to determine the meaning of unknown words. A student with  significant cognitive disabilities might demonstrate mastery by associating  a picture with a familiar object, action, or event.", "Finally, despite the challenges of implementing alternate assessments,  teachers and state officials shared success stories for students with  disabilities. For example, officials who developed a guide matching grade- level and below grade-level standards told us that this investment was  worthwhile because it helped teachers become better teachers by  identifying a progression of standards for students with disabilities to  access grade-level academic curriculum. In addition, officials in some  states noted that it was valuable that special education teachers were  encouraged to teach academic curriculum to students with significant  cognitive disabilities under NCLBA. Teachers told us many stories of  student achievement, which exceeded their expectations. For example,  one teacher described teaching the difference between sweet and sour to a  student with severe and multiple disabilities. The student, after tasting  both, consistently signaled \u201csweet\u201d by looking toward the sweet item  repeatedly when asked which she preferred. Experts, officials and  teachers were generally positive about raising academic expectations for  students with disabilities and attributed this directly to NCLBA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Disseminated Information to States on Assessing Students with Disabilities, but Some State Officials Reported the Need for Alternate Assessment Examples", "paragraphs": ["Education\u2019s efforts to help states implement assessment requirements for  students with disabilities included a variety of activities.

Further, Education has conducted outreach efforts to states to  communicate the requirements for the inclusion of students with  disabilities under NCLBA and to improve state data systems to ensure they  capture the true achievement and participation of students in these  assessments. For example, the department\u2019s Office of Special Education  Program\u2019 Regional Resource Centers and other technical assistance  projects have collaborated with states through teleconferences,  preconference training sessions, and by providing technical assistance  materials and resources.  Education also made extensive use of its NCLBA  Web site, newsletters, and attendance at national education-related  conferences to disseminate guidance to states on NCLBA\u2019s assessment  requirements for all students, including students with disabilities.", "The department also funded two national centers that had, as part of their  focus, the assessment of students with disabilities\u2014the National Center on  Educational Outcomes and the National Alternate Assessment Center. The  National Center on Educational Outcomes examined the participation of  students in national and statewide assessments, including the use of  accommodations and alternate assessments and conducted research in the  area of assessment and accountability. In addition, the National Alternate  Assessment Center established principles of technical soundness for  alternate assessments and techniques for aligning alternate assessments  with grade-level content standards.", "Despite Education\u2019s efforts to assist states in this area, experts and some  state officials identified challenges in designing and implementing  alternate assessments. As noted above, many states had limited  experience with these assessments. Representatives from a national  education organization and officials in two of the four study states,  specifically the two states not using these assessments, said that they did  not know how alternate assessments that measured grade-level standards  would look, and that examples would be helpful. Further, only nine states  reported using these assessments in the 2003-04 school year. According to  Education officials, the department has made information on alternate  assessments available during preconference workshops at national  education-related conferences and through the National Center on  Educational Outcomes\u2019 Web site. Education officials also reported that the  department participated with state officials in a group including state  officials and national education experts that discussed and researched  alternate assessments. However, information provided to state officials  often included brief descriptions of alternate assessments but not  illustrative examples to help states. In March 2005, we told Education  about states\u2019 alternate assessment concerns. In May 2005, Education  announced additional efforts to help states use alternate assessments.  Under these efforts, which are being conducted by a department task force  and funded by $5 million from the department\u2019s Office of Special  Education and Rehabilitative Services, Education plans to provide  comprehensive technical assistance to states that lack alternate  assessment plans as early as the fall of 2005. According to Education  officials, plans for providing assistance to states in this area were still  being developed.

For example, the NCLBA section of Education\u2019s  Web site provided extensive information about the regulatory  requirements for alternate assessments. However, information on the  research, development, and use of these assessments was generally  accessed through a series of non-assessment-related Internet links on the  Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) section of Education\u2019s Web  site. Moreover, there was no Web link that associated the alternate  assessment information on the NCLBA section of the Web site with related  information on the OSEP section of the Web site.

In particular, NCLBA focused attention on the academic  performance of all students, requiring that the performance of groups,  such as students with disabilities, be considered in determining whether  schools meet state goals. IDEA has also emphasized the importance of  assessing the academic achievement of students with disabilities.  Education has provided much guidance to states on how to include  students with disabilities in statewide assessment systems. Despite their  efforts, some state and local officials as well as national organization  representatives reported they lacked alternate assessment examples or  models, particularly at grade-level standards, and were uncertain about  how to design and implement them. This uncertainty may have  contributed to some states not using alternate assessments with grade- level standards. As a result, some students with disabilities may not have  been provided the most appropriate type of assessment to measure their  achievement.
