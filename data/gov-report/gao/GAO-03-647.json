In 2002, GAO's Office of Special Investigations created a fictitious foreign school that Education subsequently certified as eligible to participate in the student loan program. GAO investigators subsequently successfully obtained approval for student loans totaling $55,000 on behalf of three fictitious students. Over the past decade, Education's Inspector General has investigated many instances of suspected student loan fraud involving individuals applying for loans for purported attendance at foreign schools. The conference report accompanying the 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act mandated that GAO examine and report on fraud, waste, and abuse with respect to student loans for Americans attending foreign schools."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Foreign schools offer unique educational opportunities for Americans and help ensure that U.S. students have a wide range of options in pursuing postsecondary education. Almost 70 percent of all U.S. residents receiving Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) funds to attend foreign schools are in medical school and they account for three-quarters of the total loan volume. While some foreign schools participating in the FFELP enroll large numbers of U.S. residents, others enroll only a few, as seen in the table below, which also indicates the countries wherein FFELP loan volume is highest. We found that FFELP is vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse in several ways. For instance, many foreign schools do not submit required audited financial statements and program compliance audit reports, which would allow Education to monitor for and detect significant fraud or other illegal acts. For fiscal year 2001, about 57 percent of foreign schools failed to submit audited financial statements, while the vast majority of foreign schools failed to submit program compliance audit reports. Education has taken limited steps to address instances of vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, and abuse. For example, Education has issued a reference guide and conducted training for foreign school officials. However, a number of foreign school officials reported that they had not received training prior to administering FFELP funds. In addition, we found that some foreign school officials are not properly determining and documenting student eligibility for loans; as a result FFELP funds may be provided to students who should not be receiving them. We also found that the on-line training to which Education refers foreign school officials presents information in some cases that is contrary to how foreign schools are to administer FFELP. Education could take additional action to reduce the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse, but will have to address the trade-offs that arise from its actions that may affect student access and burden for various program participants. A comprehensive risk assessment is one method that Education could employ to determine how to balance an appropriate level of oversight with the desire to provide American students access to foreign educational opportunities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent events have increased concerns about the potential for fraud in the  Department of Education\u2019s student loan programs, especially as it relates  to U.S. citizens and permanent residents (hereafter referred to as U.S.  residents) attending foreign schools. The Federal Family Education Loan  Program (FFELP), which provided about $23 billion in loans to students in  fiscal year 2000, is the only federal student financial aid program in which  foreign schools participate; about $226 million in FFELP loans were  disbursed to U.S. residents attending 407 foreign schools in the 2000-01  academic year. Many of these foreign schools enroll only a small number  of U.S. residents who receive FFELP funds, but a few schools enroll large  numbers.", "The conference report accompanying the 2001 Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education Appropriations Act directed that we examine and  report on the problem of fraud, waste, and abuse related to loans for U.S.  residents attending foreign schools. Accordingly, our specific objectives  were to determine (1) ways in which FFELP is vulnerable to fraud, waste,  and abuse with respect to loans for U.S. residents attending foreign  schools; (2) what Education has done to reduce FFELP\u2019s vulnerability; and  (3) additional actions that might reduce program vulnerability to fraud,  waste, and abuse.", "To address our objectives, we discussed the vulnerability of FFELP and  actions that Education has taken or could take to address such  vulnerability with officials from Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid  (FSA) and Office of Inspector General (OIG), school administrators and  representatives of lenders and guaranty agencies that help to administer  FFELP and guarantee payment to lenders if students fail to repay loans.  We also reviewed relevant documents published by Education, such as  The Student Guide, The Student Financial Aid Handbook for Foreign  Schools 2001-2002, and FSA\u2019s on-line training tutorial. We also reviewed  the Higher Education Act (HEA) and related Education regulations. To  further address the first objective, we reviewed GAO and OIG reports on  fraud investigations. In addition, to assess selected foreign schools\u2019 ability  to manage FFELP and their roles in reducing program vulnerability, we  conducted site visits to the administrative offices of four schools,  conducted telephone interviews with the administrators of an additional  eight schools, and reviewed student files at eight schools.  We selected  these schools to reflect a variety of foreign schools in terms of degree  programs offered, school type (private for-profit, private nonprofit, and  public), U.S. resident student enrollment, and whether they had electronic  access to Education\u2019s information systems. In reviewing student files at  those schools with fewer than 25 students receiving FFELP funds, we  reviewed the files of all such students to determine whether school  officials had ensured students\u2019 eligibility for loans.  In reviewing student  files at those schools with more than 25 students receiving FFELP funds,  we reviewed the files for those students for whom Education informed  schools, following its initial review of eligibility for student aid, that  additional information was needed to determine that students qualified for  loans. We also obtained information from Education\u2019s Postsecondary  Education Participants System (PEPS) to determine whether schools were  meeting the requirements for participation in FFELP. To further address  the second and third objectives, we interviewed others involved in the  FFELP process, such as school administrators and lending and guaranty  agency officials, and reviewed relevant documents provided by those  officials.", "We conducted our work between July 2002 and May 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Foreign schools can offer unique educational opportunities for U.S.  residents, such as improved language proficiency and knowledge of other  cultures, and help ensure that U.S. residents have a wide range of options  in pursuing postsecondary education. The number of loans certified for  U.S. residents attending foreign schools has risen from just under 4,600 in  the 1993-94 academic year to over 13,000 in the 2000-01 academic year.  Over 500 schools in 44 foreign countries are currently eligible to  participate. About 9,000 of these students attend foreign medical schools  and account for about three-quarters of the total loan volume. By country,  the highest volume of FFELP loans\u2014over $35 million\u2014are for students  attending school in Dominica; its sole eligible institution is a private, for- profit medical school. England, ranked fourth in loan volume, and Canada,  seventh, have the largest number of institutions eligible to participate in  the FFELP\u2014182 and 108, respectively. Those countries participating in the  FFELP and the top 10 foreign schools in loan volume for the 2000-01  academic year are indicated in figure 1. While a few foreign schools enroll  large numbers of U.S. residents who receive FFELP funds, the majority of  foreign schools enroll only a small number. For example, Queen\u2019s College  at the University of Oxford had just 3 students receiving FFELP funds in  2001. For more information on the ranges for numbers of U.S. residents  receiving FFELP funds for attendance at schools in different countries, see  appendix I.", "In order to participate in FFELP, foreign schools must submit a variety of  documents, such as an application and a copy of the most recent course  catalog. Once Education initially certifies the school for participation, the  school enters into a Program Participation Agreement (PPA) with  Education that requires it to comply with the laws, regulations, and  policies governing FFELP. PPAs vary, but some may be valid for up to   6 years. To maintain its ability to participate, the foreign school must  demonstrate that it is administratively capable of providing the education  promised and of properly managing the program, and that it is financially  responsible. Schools must submit program compliance audits and audited  financial statement reports to Education on an annual basis. Program  compliance audit reports are intended to demonstrate schools\u2019 ability to  administer FFELP in compliance with HEA and related Education  regulations, while audited financial statements serve as evidence of  schools\u2019 financial responsibility. Schools must submit recertification  materials to Education for continued participation in FFELP before the  expiration of their current PPA.", "Education evaluates the application and accompanying documentation to  determine whether a school is eligible to participate. Education\u2019s Foreign  Schools Team, consisting of eight staff members and one director, is  responsible for assisting and overseeing foreign schools. Some of the ways  in which the team oversees foreign schools, which are similar to the way  Education oversees domestic schools, are presented in table 1. Education  also has responsibility for maintaining information systems involved in the  loan process, which is discussed more fully below.", "While Education and the foreign schools each have specific  responsibilities, other parties are involved in the student loan process,  including students, lenders, and guaranty agencies. Students are  responsible for filing certain loan application materials, while lenders  make loans, and guaranty agencies repay lenders the loan funds if the  borrower defaults.", "Regardless of whether a student plans to attend a foreign or domestic  school, a student applying for a FFELP loan is required to first submit a  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The student must also  sign the Master Promissory Note (MPN), which outlines the students\u2019  responsibilities for repaying the loan. The information provided by the  student on the FAFSA is checked by Education against various  information systems, including Social Security Administration databases  and the National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS), to test the  accuracy of information and to assess the student\u2019s loan history.", "The administrators of the school the student plans to attend must certify  the student\u2019s eligibility for loans and the loan amount based on the output  from the FAFSA.  This output will indicate whether there are any issues  with the student\u2019s eligibility based on the information provided by the  student and the edit checks against the various databases. For example,  the output would indicate if the check against SSA\u2019s databases revealed  that the social security number provided did not match the name provided  by the student, or if the check against Education\u2019s NSLDS revealed that  the student was in default on previous loans. In addition, the output  includes the Expected Family Contribution, which is the amount the  student and his family are expected to contribute to educational expenses.  The administrators determine the student\u2019s financial need based on this  information, the cost of attendance, and the amount of financial aid other  than FFELP funds that the student is expected to receive.", "Once the school has certified the student\u2019s eligibility and loan amount and  the student has signed the MPN, the lender can disburse the loan.  Although lenders disburse loans for students attending domestic schools  to the school, a chief difference for students attending foreign schools is  that lenders may disburse loans either directly to students or to the foreign  school the student is attending. The guaranty agency then sends to the  student\u2019s school a student status confirmation report (SSCR), which lists  all students for whom loans were guaranteed for attendance at the school.", "School officials must indicate the enrollment status of these students and  return the form to the guaranty agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FFELP is Vulnerable to Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in Several Ways with Respect to U.S. Residents Attending Foreign Schools", "paragraphs": ["FFELP is vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse in several ways.

In  addition, Education has not conducted any on-site reviews to assess  schools\u2019 ability to administer FFELP since November 2000. Moreover,  exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse is increased because students  attending foreign schools, unlike students attending domestic schools, can  choose to receive loans directly and in one lump sum for the entire  academic year. Further, foreign schools do not submit required audited  financial statements and program compliance audit reports, which  compromises Education\u2019s ability to monitor for and detect significant  fraud or other illegal acts.

As a result, FFELP funds may be  provided to students who should not be receiving them.  In particular, we  found that several schools were using incorrect versions of documents  Education generated to alert school officials to information that might  indicate a student is ineligible for FFELP loans. We identified this problem  among those schools that did not have electronic access to Education\u2019s  information systems that contain data needed to determine students\u2019  eligibility for loans. Of the over 500 foreign schools participating in FFELP,  only 32 can electronically access these information systems. However,  these 32 schools certified about 70 percent of the total foreign school  FFELP loan volume for fiscal year 2001.", "Electronic access to Education\u2019s information systems can help ensure that  schools use the correct information to determine whether students should  be receiving FFELP loans.  In accessing Education\u2019s information systems,  schools can obtain Institutional Student Information Reports (ISIR), which  Education generates to help schools determine whether students are  eligible for loans. ISIRs contain summary information provided on  students\u2019 FAFSAs as well as the results of various computer matches that  Education conducts. ISIRs indicate, among other things, whether an  applicant\u2019s social security number reported on the FAFSA is valid,  whether a loan applicant has ever defaulted on a student loan, and how  much an applicant has previously borrowed. Electronic access to  Education\u2019s information systems under its existing procedures will not be  granted unless a foreign school has among its staff a person who  possesses a U.S. social security number. Few foreign schools meet this  requirement. In the absence of obtaining ISIRs, foreign school officials  must rely on and obtain from students a special eight-page version of the  Student Aid Report (SAR), which is also generated by Education and  contains information similar to that found in the ISIR. Education typically  provides students with only an abbreviated two-page SAR, which  summarizes information students submit on the FAFSA, but does not  contain all of the information foreign school officials need to determine  whether a student is eligible for a loan. Students must specifically request  the special eight-page version from Education. Rather than documenting  and determining student eligibility based on the eight-page SAR, we found  that certain foreign school officials were improperly basing their student  eligibility determinations on the two-page SAR.", "In reviewing files to determine if schools were properly determining and  documenting students\u2019 eligibility for FFELP loans, we found that the   2 schools with electronic access to Education\u2019s information systems had  copies of ISIRs for every student file we reviewed. Each of these schools  had certified in excess of $30 million in FFELP loans and together certified  about 30 percent of the total FFELP loan volume for fiscal year 2001.  However, 5 of the 6 schools without access to Education\u2019s information  systems, which collectively certified over $3 million in FFELP loans for  fiscal year 2001, did not have copies of ISIRs or eight-page SARs on file  indicating that schools may have approved loans without obtaining the  information necessary for determining student eligibility. Some school  officials, in fact, told us that they verified students\u2019 eligibility for loans  based of the two-page SAR and were unaware that without the eight-page  SAR or ISIR, students\u2019 eligibility for loans could not be properly verified  and documented.", "The inability of foreign school officials to electronically access  Education\u2019s information systems also creates the potential for delays in  schools confirming and reporting student enrollment. Schools must  confirm the enrollment of students who have borrowed FFELP funds  through the use of a SSCR. Without timely and accurate reporting of  student enrollment, detecting an individual who receives an FFELP loan  but never enrolls in a foreign school is made more difficult.  Schools that  have electronic access to Education\u2019s information systems can enter these  data directly into Education\u2019s information systems. Guaranty agencies can  then retrieve data through these information systems and monitor whether  students whose loans the agency has guaranteed are in fact enrolled in the  foreign school. Schools that do not have electronic access to Education\u2019s  information systems, however, rely on guaranty agencies to send them  SSCRs, which they then must return to guaranty agencies via postal mail.

Between March 1999 and November  2000, Education conducted six such program reviews at foreign schools  (or the U.S. administrative office of the foreign school). As a result of  these reviews, Education identified problems with how schools were  administering FFELP. For example, the reviews revealed that some  foreign school administrators had certified FFELP loans for students in  excess of allowable loan limits and certified loans without verifying  students\u2019 eligibility for FFELP loans.

For  example, Education\u2019s OIG investigated a case in which a single individual  submitted about 50 fraudulent loan applications for over $900,000 by  falsely claiming enrollment at foreign medical schools. About 26 of the  loans, totaling about $400,000 in FFELP funds, were disbursed to the  individual before the fraud was detected.

Consequently, no new foreign schools have been certified to  participate in FFELP since Education became aware of the school we  created in May 2002, even though applications have been received from   19 schools. Education is currently considering implementing a process  similar to that used when a domestic school applies for participation. This  process would entail circulating the name of the school and its owners  among a number of officials in FSA and other Education offices to  determine whether staff have any information or knowledge that would  affect a decision to certify the school\u2019s eligibility to participate in FFELP.  Education\u2019s International Affairs staff, who coordinate the agency\u2019s  various international programs, would be among those to whom such  information would circulate. If any staff were to raise concerns about the  school or its owners, Education would consider conducting an on-site  program review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Actions to Reduce Program Vulnerability Will Require Balancing Competing Goals", "paragraphs": ["Education could take additional action to address the goal of reducing the  vulnerability of FFELP to fraud, waste, and abuse, such as more strictly  enforcing school audit requirements or providing electronic access to  information systems to help school officials more easily determine  students\u2019 eligibility for FFELP loans. However, any steps that Education  takes will likely involve trade-offs that may affect access, accountability,  and burden for various participants in FFELP. For example, Education  could aggressively enforce foreign schools\u2019 audit reporting requirements,  but this may lead to unintended consequences, including limiting students\u2019  access to such institutions if foreign schools withdraw from FFELP as a  result. Other potential steps include changing disbursement procedures to  help limit the federal government\u2019s exposure to loss, but doing so may  increase burdens for schools and students. In addition, providing foreign  school officials with electronic access to information may help them  properly determine student eligibility for FFELP loans, but may increase  security risks.

FSA  officials have stated that while Education is committed to maintaining the  integrity of the FFELP program, it is also committed to providing access to  international education opportunities for U.S. resident students and does  not want to create barriers to those opportunities. As previously  discussed, a large number of foreign schools have failed to submit  required audited financial statement and compliance audit reports to  Education in a timely manner. FSA officials told us that balancing  enforcement of these statutory and regulatory provisions with providing  students access to foreign schools is challenging. In their opinion, the  current compliance audit requirements may place an undue burden and  result in excessive costs for foreign schools that enroll few U.S. residents.  Several foreign school officials we spoke to also told us that they found  such audits to be costly, considering that students receiving FFELP loans  constituted very small proportions of their student bodies. According to  these officials, these audit requirements provide a disincentive to  participate in FFELP in order to avoid what they perceive as an  administrative and financial burden. Education officials are now  considering whether to issue letters to foreign schools that certify less  than $500,000 annually in FFELP loans requesting program compliance  audit reports and whether an alternative approach to overseeing these  schools should be taken.", "In addition to requiring foreign schools to submit audited financial  statements and compliance reports, another potential step Education is  considering relates to the requirement that certain schools submit audited  financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Several school administrators and  government officials in the United Kingdom told us that they found the  requirement for schools to submit audited financial statements presented  in U.S. GAAP to be burdensome, in light of the audit requirements of their  home country. They stated that they believed that the United Kingdom\u2019s  accounting standards are sufficiently comparable to U.S. GAAP that  Education should accept their statements for purposes of meeting FFELP  statutory and regulatory requirements. Doing so, according to these  officials, would reduce the administrative and financial burden associated  with the requirement. Further, because Education\u2019s regulation requiring  that audited financial statements be presented under U.S. GAAP applies  only to foreign schools that certify $500,000 or more in FFELP loans, these  officials told us that foreign schools have an incentive to limit enrollment  of students receiving FFELP loans so that they do not exceed this  threshold.", "Education is currently considering whether to allow exemptions for  foreign schools located in Canada and the United Kingdom\u2014which  collectively accounted for 314, or about 62 percent of the total foreign  schools participating in the FFELP during academic year 2000-01\u2014to its  regulations requiring audited financial statements be presented into U.S.  GAAP. According to an FSA official, the justification for such an  exemption is based on the results of a comparison of several foreign  countries\u2019 auditing standards contained in Education\u2019s policies and  procedures manual, developed in consultation with a private accounting  firm. While the purpose of the manual is to provide a methodology for FSA  staff to use in assessing the financial health of foreign schools certifying  less than $500,000 in FFELP loans, the manual does contain a limited  analysis comparing the selected foreign countries\u2019 accounting standards  with U.S. GAAP and the potential effects of Education relying on foreign  standards on the results of its analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing Loan Disbursement Procedures Would Reduce Exposure to Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, but Decrease Lender, School, and Student Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Education could seek statutory, and consider regulatory, changes to loan  disbursement procedures to address the potential for fraud, waste, and  abuse; however, such changes could have a significant impact on schools  and students. In our discussions with FFELP lenders and school officials,  we found that disbursement methods and preferences vary among both  lenders and schools. For example, representatives of one large FFELP  lender told us that it is their standard operating procedure to disburse  student loan proceeds directly to student borrowers by sending them  checks. In contrast, a representative of another large FFELP lender, which  specializes in making FFELP loans to students attending foreign medical  schools, told us that it only (1) issues checks that are payable to both the  student borrower and the foreign school and (2) sends these checks, or  electronically transfers loan proceeds, to foreign schools, requiring  student borrowers to obtain their funds through the schools. Some foreign  school officials encourage students to receive their loan proceeds in this  manner, as it helps the school maintain control of the funds. According to  a guaranty agency official, a school official, and an FSA official some  schools do not have financial aid offices or routinely carry out such  functions at their institutions and therefore do not have the resources to  be an intermediary between lenders and students. Other school officials  told us that they are prohibited by local regulations from taking out  student fees from loan checks and remitting the difference to students.", "In addition to receiving loan proceeds directly from lenders, students  attending foreign schools may also receive loan proceeds in one lump sum  rather than in multiple disbursements. According to many of the lenders  and foreign school officials we spoke to, students frequently elect to  receive their loan proceeds in this way, particularly students who are  enrolled in 1-year graduate programs. Yet, several school officials told us  that they prefer multiple disbursements for their students as the school is  on a semester or trimester calendar and multiple disbursements provide  them more assurance that expenses will be paid. One lending official,  however, told us of an instance in which a student had trouble entering a  country because she did not have sufficient proof that she had enough  funds for the academic year. Thus, allowing students to receive loan  proceeds in one lump sum might help students in such situations.", "Education is considering taking additional steps with respect to current  disbursement procedures. As previously discussed and as documented by  prior OIG investigations, the disbursement procedures used to provide  loan proceeds to U.S. residents attending foreign schools exposes the  federal government to increased risk for potential losses. Education is  considering encouraging or requiring lenders to take steps prior to  disbursing loan funds to students attending foreign schools. These steps  could include (1) confirming that schools are eligible to participate in  FFELP, (2) verifying that students are accepted for enrollment at foreign  schools prior to disbursing funds, and (3) continuing to notify foreign  schools when loan disbursements are made to student borrowers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Schools Electronic Access to Education Data Could Improve Eligibility Determinations but Increases Information Security Risks", "paragraphs": ["Providing electronic access to Education\u2019s information systems needed to  determine student eligibility may help improve schools\u2019 administrative  capacity but may also increase information security risk. The lack of  electronic access decreases schools\u2019 administrative capacity, as foreign  school officials have difficulty obtaining the documentation necessary to  determine student eligibility and impedes the exchange of SSCRs with  guaranty agencies. Education is currently working to address these issues  and is considering providing foreign school officials with an alternative to  requiring that someone on their staff possess a U.S. social security number  to access its information systems. However, poor information security is a  high-risk area across the federal government with potentially devastating  consequences. Threats to the security of any data system may include  attempts to access private information by unauthorized users, user error,  as well as pranks and malicious acts. Potential damage arising from such  threats could include, among other things, the disclosure of sensitive  information, disruption of critical services, the interruption of services and  benefits, and the corruption of federal data and reports.

Ensuring that  foreign school officials know how to properly administer the program,  especially what steps they need to take to ensure that students are eligible  to receive federal funds, is critical to reducing the program\u2019s vulnerability  to fraud, waste, and abuse. Education has taken steps to provide school  officials with additional information concerning their responsibilities yet  as we have shown, foreign school officials may need more information.  Training that is convenient and specifically designed for foreign school  officials could help bridge this information gap.  Education is also  considering what regulatory flexibilities it might extend to some foreign  schools while also considering stricter enforcement of current statutory  and regulatory provisions. The use of a risk assessment could help ensure  that Education appropriately identifies the risks involved in the program  and how best to balance the objectives of providing U.S. residents with  access to foreign schools while protecting the taxpayers\u2019 investment  intended to help provide that access.
