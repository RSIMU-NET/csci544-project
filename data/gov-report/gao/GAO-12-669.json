For example, for the fiscal authority integration area, FHCC officials  continue to make progress implementing the provisions, although they  have experienced some challenges. Since our last review, the Joint Fund,  into which both VA and DOD contribute, has become operational.  However, the provision of the Executive Agreement in the fiscal authority  integration area that requires the FHCC to develop an operating plan by  month that includes workload data has not yet been met. Specifically, the  FHCC\u2019s operating plan does not include workload data, which officials  reported is because the current VA and DOD IT systems calculate  workload data differently. (See table 3.)", "Despite some progress, the FHCC continues to face costly delays in the  IT integration area. The Executive Agreement specified three key IT  capabilities that VA and DOD were required to have in place on opening  day, in October 2010, to facilitate interoperability of VA and DOD  electronic health record systems. In our 2011 report, we found that all  three of these IT components were delayed; some of them continue to  remain so. As a result of these delays, the FHCC has had to implement  costly workarounds to address the needs these capabilities were intended  to serve. In addition to delays in developing these specific IT capabilities,  other IT capabilities required by the Executive Agreement have not been  well defined and implementation plans for them have not been  established.", "Specifically, in our 2011 report, we noted that none of the following three  IT capabilities required by the Executive Agreement to be in operation by  October 2010 were implemented by that time: (1) medical single sign-on,  which would allow staff to use one screen to access both the VA and  DOD electronic health record systems; (2) single patient registration,  which would allow staff to register patients in both systems  simultaneously; and (3) orders portability, which would allow VA and DOD  clinicians to place, manage, and update clinical orders from either VA or  DOD electronic health records systems for radiology, laboratory, consults  (specialty referrals), and pharmacy services.", "Although none of these capabilities were in place at the time of the  FHCC\u2019s opening, FHCC officials reported that subsequently, in December  2010, medical single sign-on and single patient registration became  operational, as we noted in our 2011 report. Two orders portability  components\u2014pharmacy and consults\u2014remain delayed as of May 2012.  While orders portability for pharmacy remains delayed, VA and DOD  officials have estimated completion of the consults component by March  2013. Since our last review, orders portability for radiology became  operational in June 2011 and for laboratory in March 2012.

In March 2011, the  Secretaries of VA and Defense announced that the two departments  had committed to this broader effort, but the departments have not  determined when this single electronic health record system will be  completed. Officials reported that they have assigned a project team  to address this requirement and estimate that they will award a  contract for the pharmacy solution by November 2012. Meanwhile, the  FHCC continues to maintain the interim orders portability workaround  that we previously reported on, which includes five dedicated, full-time  pharmacists to conduct manual checks of patient records to reconcile  allergy information and identify possible interactions between drugs  prescribed in VA and DOD systems. Additionally, FHCC officials  reported that they have also hired a full-time pharmacy technician to  assist in this process. FHCC officials reported that as of March 2012,  they have spent close to $1 million to institute this workaround and  that they anticipate spending an additional $750,000 to fund this  process from April 2012 through April 2013.", "Consults component: VA and DOD officials reported that this  component, which will allow VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s electronic health record  systems to exchange information for consult orders, remains delayed  because of changes to the requirements for this component in  response to lessons learned since the FHCC opened. Officials  reported that they completed the process of documenting changes to  the requirements in February 2012 and will use that information to  develop the consults component. Until this IT component is  implemented, the FHCC staff in the specialty care clinics manage the  consult orders manually by reviewing daily all consult requests to  determine if care could be provided at the FHCC, in which case the  order is manually entered into the appropriate system.", "Radiology component: Officials told us that this area was delayed in  part because they underestimated the amount of work required to  allow VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s electronic health record systems to exchange  information for radiology orders, and they needed additional time to  resolve software defects related to the work.", "Laboratory component: Officials reported that there were delays in  delivering a capability that would allow the VA and DOD systems to  exchange information for laboratory orders because they needed to  address software differences between the VA and DOD systems,  such as how the systems detect and combine duplicate orders. In  addition, they acknowledged that they underestimated the time and  effort required to address such differences. Before the laboratory  component was implemented, the FHCC instituted a workaround that  required health care providers to review both VA and DOD systems  for notifications of laboratory results.", "Although they were unable to quantify the total cost for all the  workarounds resulting from delayed IT capabilities, FHCC officials  reported that staff time equivalent to 23 full-time employees is being used  to manage the workarounds as a result of delays in IT capabilities to  support pharmacy, consults, radiology, and laboratory as well as delays  to the other IT components not delivered on time.", "In addition to the three delayed IT capabilities that were to be in operation  by opening day, implementation of three other IT capabilities required, but  not defined, by the Executive Agreement\u2014documentation of patient care  to support medical and dental operational readiness, financial  management solutions, and outpatient appointment enhancements\u2014also  have not been implemented, and in some cases work on them has not  begun.

However, we have found that some of the integration  implementation challenges that could be solved with such a designation  remain. In particular, officials told us the FHCC has been denied access  to DOD\u2019s drug pricing arrangements for its DOD beneficiaries, which has  resulted in the FHCC paying higher prices for certain drugs for DOD  beneficiaries than would be the case if it were an MTF, although FHCC  officials were unable to quantify the added expense.

The  FHCC is unable to use DOD drug pricing arrangements for DOD  beneficiaries, which has resulted in additional costs for the FHCC, and  also cannot use personal services contracts without the need for a  workaround. Because of these ongoing problems, we continue to believe  that the Secretary of Defense should seek a legislative change to  designate the FHCC as an MTF, even if only for the period of the 5-year  demonstration.", "Delays in the implementation of key IT components required by the  Executive Agreement to be in place by October 2010 have resulted in the  FHCC establishing workarounds in an effort to maintain patient care and  safety. In some cases, these workarounds have been costly and  inefficient, necessitating the hiring of additional staff or using additional  staff time to do manually what the IT systems are intended to automate.  After spending more than $122 million on IT capabilities needed for the  FHCC, key deliverables remain delayed, resulting in additional costs to  the FHCC. For example, officials have spent more than $1 million as of  May 2012 on workarounds for the pharmacy component alone, with an  additional $750,000 of spending expected through April 2013. Having a  clear understanding of the costs associated with workarounds needed  when IT systems are not in place is essential in planning any future VA  and DOD integration efforts. In addition, the lack of clarity for time frames  and deliverables for two other IT requirements included in the Executive  Agreement may pose challenges for implementing them during the  demonstration.", "Despite the fact that the demonstration is in its second of 5 years, DOD  and VA have yet to develop and implement an overall evaluation plan.  Without such a plan, decision makers at all levels lack the information  needed to evaluate the FHCC in a transparent way that ensures  confidence in the results. Establishing an evaluation plan, including  relevant measures and standards, such as target scores for the  benchmarks, as early as possible during the demonstration also provides  FHCC officials the opportunity to make informed midcourse changes to  better ensure the delivery of high-quality and cost-effective care. It also  will better facilitate decision making about whether replicating the model  in other locations is prudent. Finally, without assessing the cost- effectiveness of the FHCC, VA and DOD decision makers, as well as  Congress, will be unable to adequately assess whether the integrated  health care delivery model of the FHCC produces sufficient benefits in  relation to its costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To clarify IT requirements within the Executive Agreement, to enable VA  and DOD to make an informed recommendation about whether the FHCC  should continue after the end of the demonstration, and to provide useful  information for other integrations that may be considered in the future, we  recommend that the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense take the  following four actions: determine the costs associated with the workarounds required  because of delayed IT capabilities at the FHCC for each year of the  demonstration, including the costs of hiring additional staff and of  managing the administrative burden caused by the workarounds; develop plans with clear definitions and specific deliverables,  including time frames for two IT capabilities\u2014documentation of patient  care to support medical and dental operational readiness and  outpatient appointment enhancements\u2014and formalize these plans,  for example, by incorporating them into the Executive Agreement; expeditiously develop and agree to an evaluation plan, including the  performance measures and standards, such as target scores, to be  used to evaluate the FHCC demonstration, and formalize the plan, for  example, by incorporating it into the Executive Agreement; and establish measures related to the cost-effectiveness of the FHCC\u2019s  care and operations to be included as a part of the evaluation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA each provided comments on a draft of this report.

VA stated the FHCC  will convene a workgroup to review these costs and to identify any  additional needs associated with IT development delays. VA  suggested changing \u201cworkaround\u201d to \u201cimpacts and changes to  business practices.\u201d We maintain that \u201cworkaround\u201d is used  appropriately in the context of this report because we use it to  describe processes that are temporarily in place for the purpose of  mitigating IT delays rather than permanent changes to business  practices.", "To develop plans with clear definitions and specific deliverables,  including time frames for two IT capabilities, both VA and DOD stated  that they are working together through their joint Interagency Program  Office to develop and formalize these plans. DOD added that the  Interagency Program Office will also consider how these plans relate  to the larger effort to implement an integrated electronic health record.  Both agencies noted that formalization of these plans does not require  incorporation into the Executive Agreement. We offered amending the  Executive Agreement as an example of how plans could be  formalized and leave it to the agencies\u2019 discretion how best to do so.", "To expeditiously develop and agree to an evaluation plan, VA and  DOD mentioned that although a methodology and framework for a  final evaluation have not been determined, they are tracking some  measures of performance through the 15 integration benchmarks. In  addition, VA stated that the JEC has directed the HEC to outline an  evaluation plan to include analysis of personnel, logistics, resources,  and regulatory issues. Again, both agencies noted that formalizing of  the evaluation plan does not require incorporation into the Executive  Agreement. As we noted above, amending the Executive Agreement  is one option for how the plan could be formalized and the agencies  may determine the most effective way to do so.", "To establish measures related to the cost-effectiveness of the FHCC\u2019s  care and operations to be included as a part of the evaluation plan,  VA stated that it will develop a process to expedite creation of an  evaluation plan.
