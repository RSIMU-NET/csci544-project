The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), states, and local water systems share responsibility for providing safe drinking water. Lead typically enters tap water as a result of the corrosion of lead in the water lines or household plumbing. EPA's lead rule establishes testing and treatment requirements.

However, EPA's database does not contain recent test results for over 30 percent of large and medium-sized community water systems and lacks data on the status of water systems' efforts to implement the lead rule for over 70 percent of all community systems, apparently because states have not met reporting requirements. In addition, EPA's data on water systems' violations of testing and treatment requirements are questionable because some states have reported few or no violations. As a result, EPA does not have sufficient data to gauge the rule's effectiveness. Implementation experiences to date have revealed weaknesses in the regulatory framework for the lead rule. For example, most states do not require their water systems to notify homeowners that volunteer for periodic lead monitoring of the test results. In addition, corrosion control can be impaired by changes to other treatment processes, and controls that would help avoid such impacts may not be adequate. Finally, because testing indicates that some \"lead-free\" products leach high levels of lead into drinking water, existing standards for plumbing materials may not be sufficiently protective. According to EPA officials, the agency is considering some changes to the lead rule. On the basis of the limited data available, it appears that few schools and child care facilities have tested their water for lead, either in response to the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 or as part of their current operating practices. In addition, no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results. Thus, the pervasiveness of lead contamination in the drinking water at schools and child care facilities--and the need for more concerted action--is unclear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["When testing in the District of Columbia during 2003 revealed that over  4,000 households had elevated levels of lead in their drinking water, the  ensuing publicity prompted questions about how well local drinking water  systems are protecting consumers from lead contamination nationwide.  The adverse health effects associated with exposure to lead can be severe,  including delays in normal physical and mental development in infants and  young children, and damage to kidneys and reproductive systems for the  population at large. Although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning, lead  in drinking water can be a significant contributor to a person\u2019s total  exposure\u2014and can account for as much as 60 percent of the exposure for  infants who drink baby formula or concentrated juices mixed with water.  Because children are most vulnerable to adverse health effects from lead  exposure, the adequacy of controls over lead in water supplies serving  schools and child care facilities is particularly important. In response to  the discovery of lead contamination in the District of Columbia, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a broad examination of  the implementation of drinking water regulations it issued in 1991\u2014known  as the Lead and Copper Rule\u2014to determine whether elevated lead levels  are a national problem. EPA issued the rule as part of its efforts in  implementing the Safe Drinking Water Act, and established testing and  treatment requirements to control lead and copper in public water  supplies.", "Responsibility for ensuring safe drinking water is shared by EPA, the states,  and, most importantly, local water systems. In general, EPA sets standards  to protect drinking water quality and to ensure the proper operation and  maintenance of public water systems. EPA also oversees state  implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act and applicable regulations  where states have assumed primary responsibility for enforcement. The  states ensure that local water systems meet EPA and state requirements,  provide technical assistance, and take enforcement action, as necessary. In  addition, the states collect information on the results of drinking water  monitoring, among other things, and report the information to EPA. At the  local level, public water systems operate and maintain their facilities in  accordance with federal and state requirements, periodically test the  drinking water to ensure that it meets quality standards, install needed  treatments, and report required information to the states.", "In contrast to most drinking water contaminants, lead is rarely found in the  source water used for public water supplies. Instead, lead enters tap water  as a result of the corrosion that takes place over time when materials  containing lead in the water distribution system or household plumbing  come into contact with water. For example, lead can leach out of service  lines, pipes, brass and bronze fixtures, solders, or other materials, and  contaminate drinking water. To address this problem, EPA established  requirements for corrosion control treatment, source water treatment, lead  service line replacement, and public education. The lead rule requires  water systems to test the tap water at a specified number of locations that  are at high risk of lead contamination. In general, if lead concentrations  exceed 15 parts per billion in more than 10 percent of the samples, a water  system has exceeded the action level and must (1) provide public  education materials to its customers and (2) conduct additional testing to  determine if treating lead contamination from the water\u2019s source may be  necessary. Water systems that exceed the action level may also be required  to install corrosion control treatment to reduce the water\u2019s corrosiveness.  When treatment is not effective in controlling lead levels, a water system  must annually replace at least 7 percent of any lead service lines it owns. To  further address the problem of lead in household plumbing, the Congress  amended the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1986 and 1996 to, among other  things, ban the use of lead solder and plumbing materials that are not \u201clead- free.\u201d", "In addition, under the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988, the  Congress required the recall of drinking water coolers with lead-lined  tanks, banned the manufacture and sale of water coolers that were not  lead-free, and required states to establish programs to assist local agencies  in testing and correcting for lead in water supplies in schools and child care  facilities. While the Consumer Product Safety Commission was  responsible for managing the recall, EPA was responsible for distributing a  list of banned coolers and publishing and distributing guidance on  detecting and remediating lead contamination in school drinking water  supplies.", "In March 2005, we issued a report that focused on the lead contamination  problem in the District of Columbia\u2019s drinking water supplies. For a  national perspective on controlling lead in drinking water, you asked us to  determine (1) the extent to which EPA has sufficient data to oversee  implementation of the lead rule, (2) what implementation of the rule to  date suggests about the need for changes to the regulatory framework, and  (3) the extent to which drinking water supplies at schools and child care  facilities are tested for lead and their users protected from elevated lead  levels. For information on the data EPA uses for oversight of lead rule  implementation, we analyzed EPA data on the results and frequency of lead  testing, the status of corrective actions, and violations. We determined that  the data on results and frequency of testing were sufficiently reliable to  show compliance trends. However, we found that other data on corrective  actions and violations were not sufficiently reliable to assess the status of  efforts to implement and enforce the lead rule. For information on  experiences in implementing the lead rule and the need for changes to the  regulatory framework, we analyzed the responses to a 2004 EPA  information request on states\u2019 implementation policies and practices, the  results of EPA-sponsored expert workshops, and relevant documents. We  also obtained test results from NSF International on lead content and lead  leaching of plumbing fittings and fixtures. To assess data reliability, we  obtained information on NSF International\u2019s procedures for data quality  control and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  illustrative purposes. For information on efforts to control lead in drinking  water at schools and child care facilities, we analyzed the results of a 2004  50-state information request by EPA, an EPA workshop that focused  specifically on schools and child care facilities, and relevant documents.", "We supplemented the information collected under each objective by  contacting state and local drinking water officials in 10 states. We selected  eight of the states\u2014California, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan,  New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington\u2014because they either had a  relatively high number of water systems with test results that exceeded or  fell just below the lead action level, or they added to the geographical  diversity of our selections. We also obtained information from Connecticut  and Florida, two states that EPA identified as particularly active in  addressing potential lead contamination in water supplies serving child  care facilities. In all 10 states, we obtained information from state drinking  water program managers, state public health or education officials, and  local school districts that have efforts under way to test for and remediate  lead contamination. (App. I contains a detailed description of our scope  and methodology.) We performed our work between June 2004 and  November 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA is responsible for regulating  contaminants that may pose a public health risk and that are likely to be  present in public water supplies. EPA may establish an enforceable  standard\u2014called a maximum contaminant level\u2014that limits the amount of  a contaminant that may be present in drinking water. However, if it is not  economically or technically feasible to ascertain the level of a contaminant,  EPA may instead establish a treatment technique to prevent known or  anticipated health effects. In the case of lead, EPA established a treatment  technique\u2014including corrosion control treatment\u2014because the agency  believed that the variability of lead levels measured at the tap, even after  treatment, makes it technologically infeasible to establish an enforceable  standard. EPA noted that lead in drinking water occurs primarily as a  byproduct of the corrosion of materials in the water distribution system or  household plumbing, some of which is outside the control of the water  systems. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution system for drinking water and  potential sources of lead contamination.", "EPA\u2019s lead rule also established a 15-parts-per-billion lead action level,  which is based on the 90th percentile level of water samples taken at the  tap. Water systems must sample tap water at locations that are at high risk  of lead contamination, generally because they are served by lead service  lines or are likely to contain lead solder in the household plumbing. The  number of samples that must be collected varies depending on the size of  the water system and the results of earlier testing. Small or medium-sized  systems whose test results are consistently below the action level may be  allowed to reduce the frequency of monitoring and the number of samples  collected.", "To determine their test results at the 90th percentile level, water systems  must multiply the number of samples taken during a monitoring period by  0.9 and identify the result at that level, after ranking the results of the  individual samples they collected in ascending order. For example, a water  system required to take 50 samples would rank the results from 1 (for the  lowest result) to 50 (for the highest result); the 90th percentile level is the  45th result, 5 below the highest test result for that monitoring period. When  the 90th percentile results for a water system are above 15 parts per billion,  the system has exceeded the lead action level and must meet requirements  for public education and source water treatment. Under the public  education requirements, water systems must inform the public about the  health effects and sources of lead contamination, along with ways to  reduce exposure. Source water responsibilities include, at a minimum,  water monitoring to determine if the lead contamination is from the water  source rather than\u2014or in addition to\u2014service lines or plumbing fixtures.", "Water systems that exceed the action level may also be required to install  corrosion control treatment, except for large systems that may qualify as  having optimized corrosion control based on other criteria. When either  corrosion control or source water treatment are not effective in controlling  lead levels, the lead rule calls for water systems with lead service lines to  begin replacing them at a rate of 7 percent annually (unless the state  requires a higher rate).", "The states play an important role in ensuring that the lead rule is  implemented and enforced at the local level. Among other things, they are  responsible for (1) ensuring that water systems conduct required  monitoring and (2) reporting the results to EPA. If the systems must take  corrective action to address elevated lead levels, the states are responsible  for approving or determining the nature of the treatment or other activities  that will be required, ensuring that they are implemented, and periodically  reporting relevant information to EPA. The Safe Drinking Water Act  authorizes the states to assume primary responsibility for enforcing the  drinking water program\u2014including the lead rule\u2014if they meet certain  requirements, such as adopting drinking water regulations at least as  stringent as EPA\u2019s and having adequate procedures to carry out and enforce  the program\u2019s requirements. All states except Wyoming have assumed  primacy for managing their drinking water programs.", "In addition to requiring the regulation of lead in public water supplies, the  Safe Drinking Water Act also contains provisions to limit the extent to  which materials in the water distribution system and household plumbing  contribute to lead levels at the tap. Specifically, the act banned the use of  solder and other materials in the installation or repair of public water  systems or plumbing that are not lead-free. In this regard, the act  established a material standard by defining \u201clead-free\u201d to mean solders and  flux containing no more than 0.2 percent lead, and pipes and pipe fittings  containing no more than 8.0 percent lead. In addition, the act called for  development of voluntary performance standards and testing protocols for  the leaching of lead from new plumbing fittings and fixtures by a qualified  third party certifier or, if necessary, promulgated by EPA. A third party  certifier set such a standard in 1997, limiting the amount of lead that the  fittings and fixtures may contribute to water to 11 parts per billion.", "To address the potential risks of lead contamination in water supplies  serving schools and child care facilities, Congress passed the Lead  Contamination Control Act of 1988. Among other things, the act banned  the manufacture and sale of drinking water coolers containing lead-lined  tanks and other water coolers that are not lead-free and required (1) EPA to  publish a list of such coolers and distribute it to the states, (2) the  Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue an order requiring  manufacturers and importers to repair or replace lead-lined coolers or  recall and provide a refund for them, and (3) the states to establish  programs to assist local agencies in addressing potential lead  contamination. In 1990, EPA identified six models of water coolers from  one manufacturer that contained lead-lined tanks, but the agency was  unable to obtain information on the number of units produced. Regarding  water coolers that were not lead-free, EPA identified three manufacturers  that produced coolers containing lead solder that could contaminate  drinking water. The manufacturers reported producing at least 1 million of  the coolers.", "Following the discovery of elevated lead levels in the District of Columbia\u2019s  drinking water, EPA undertook a year-long evaluation to gain insight into  how states and local communities are implementing the lead rule and to  determine whether the problems identified in the District of Columbia are  occurring elsewhere. EPA\u2019s activities included  a series of expert workshops on key aspects of the rule (monitoring  protocols, simultaneous compliance, lead service line replacement,  public education, and lead in plumbing fittings and fixtures),  a review of state policies and practices for implementing the lead rule,  data verification audits that covered the collection and reporting of  compliance data for the lead rule in 10 states, and   an expert workshop and a review of state efforts to monitor for lead in  drinking water at schools and child care facilities.", "Participants in EPA\u2019s expert workshops included representatives of federal  and state regulatory agencies, drinking water systems, researchers, public  interest groups, and others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Data Impair EPA\u2019s Ability to Oversee Implementation of the Lead Rule", "paragraphs": ["Although EPA\u2019s data on the results of testing indicate that the lead rule has  largely been successful in reducing lead levels, the reporting of these data  has not been timely or complete.

EPA\u2019s data on lead rule violations are  also questionable because of potential underreporting by the states.

EPA\u2019s most recent data indicate that the  number of water systems that exceed the lead action level has declined by  nearly 75 percent since the early 1990s. The systems that currently have a  problem with elevated lead levels represent about 2 percent of all water  systems and serve approximately 4.6 million people. Figure 3 shows the  results (by system size) of the initial lead monitoring, conducted from 1992  to 1994, and more recent testing from 2002 through the quarter ending in  June 2005.", "EPA, state, and water industry officials generally see the decline in the  number of systems with elevated lead levels as evidence that the lead rule  has been effective and point to corrosion control treatment as the primary  reason. Another indicator of success is the number of water systems  approved for reduced monitoring. Under the lead rule, water systems can  obtain state approval to reduce both the frequency of monitoring and the  number of samples included in the testing when test results show lead  levels consistently below the action level. According to EPA\u2019s data, nearly  90 percent of all water systems have qualified for reduced monitoring.", "After several years of experience with the lead rule, in January 2000, EPA  made significant changes to the information states were required to report  for inclusion in the agency\u2019s database. Among other things, EPA added a  requirement for states to report, for large and medium-sized systems, all  90th percentile test results, not just the results for systems that exceed the  action level. EPA said that it planned to use these test results to show how  levels of lead at the tap have changed over time for large and medium  systems and, by extrapolation, for small systems.", "Although the new reporting requirements took effect in January 2002, EPA\u2019s  database contained 90th percentile test results for only 23 percent of the  large and medium systems by January 2004. EPA officials explained that  states were still having difficulty updating their information systems to  accommodate the new reporting requirements and, for EPA, obtaining the  data was not a priority at that time. Following the detection of elevated  lead levels in the District of Columbia, however, EPA made a concerted  effort to obtain more complete information from the states, and, as of June  2004, EPA reported that it had data for nearly 89 percent of the large and  medium systems (based on an analysis of test results submitted from  January 2000 through May 2004). However, we also analyzed data on the  results of lead testing and found that EPA\u2019s database does not contain  current information for a much larger percentage of large and medium  water systems. Specifically, we found that for the period from January 2002  through June 2005, EPA\u2019s database lacks any test results for nearly 31  percent of the large and medium water systems. We could not determine  whether the data are missing because states have not reported the results  or because testing has not occurred. When asked whether states have been  updating test results in a timely manner since 2004, an official representing  EPA said that the timeliness of recent test data is unknown; the agency has  not been tracking whether states are adequately maintaining data on the  results of lead testing.", "Regarding the information required for small water systems\u2014which is  limited to test results exceeding the action level\u2014officials from both the  Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water and the Office of Enforcement  and Compliance Assurance indicated that some data are probably missing  but could not provide specific estimates. An official from the Office of  Ground Water and Drinking Water commented that EPA\u2019s database likely  includes most of the required small system data because action level  exceedances trigger follow-up activities and states are more likely to pay  attention to those cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Does Not Have Complete Information on the Status of Water Systems\u2019 Efforts to Implement Lead Rule", "paragraphs": ["As part of EPA\u2019s efforts to improve its indicators of lead rule  implementation, the agency restructured its reporting requirements and  reduced the number of \u201cmilestones\u201d that states are required to report from  11 to 3. EPA established three corrective action milestones, including (1) a  DEEM milestone, meaning that the system is deemed to have optimized  corrosion control; (2) an LSLR milestone, meaning that the system is  required to begin replacing its lead service lines; and (3) a DONE milestone,  meaning that the system has completed all applicable requirements for  corrosion control, source water treatment, and lead service line  replacement.", "EPA officials told us that the vast majority of water systems should have at  least one milestone in the database. They indicated that in most instances,  systems should have a DEEM designation because they have installed  corrosion control or qualify for meeting the milestone otherwise. However,  we found that, overall, EPA has information on corrective action  milestones for only 28 percent of the community water systems  nationwide\u2014and lacks any milestone data on the remaining 72 percent.  Table 1 summarizes the results of our analysis.", "The extent to which milestone data were reported to EPA varied from state  to state. We found that 22 states had not reported milestones for any of  their water systems and another 8 states had reported data on about 10  percent of their systems. (See app. II for a state-by-state breakdown of  reported milestone data.)", "EPA officials believe that most water systems have actually taken the steps  necessary to meet the criteria for the DEEM milestone, at a minimum, and  attribute the lack of milestone data to non-reporting by the states rather  than noncompliance by the water systems. They also suggested that some  of the 22 states we identified as having reported no milestone data, based  on our analysis of EPA\u2019s current data, may have reported corrective actions  prior to 2000, when EPA modified the number and type of milestones.  However, we reviewed archived data in EPA\u2019s database and found that 8 of  the 22 states had also not reported any milestones prior to 2000, and  another 11 states had reported data on no more than 10 percent of their  systems. Overall, the 50 states had reported milestone data for only 5.7  percent of their community water systems prior to 2000.", "Moreover, some information in EPA\u2019s database is inconsistent with other  reported data. Specifically, we found differences between the information  on lead service line replacement in EPA\u2019s database\u2014systems having an  LSLR milestone\u2014and the information states reported in the agency\u2019s 50- state review of lead rule implementation policies and practices. As table 2  shows, seven states reported requiring lead service line replacement in  response to EPA\u2019s June 2004 query but did not have any LSLR milestones in  EPA\u2019s database in the same time frame.", "In addition, after following up with state officials, we found that EPA\u2019s  database did not contain accurate data on the number of water systems  required to replace lead service lines because the states were not providing  timely updates or correcting erroneous information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data on Lead Rule Violations Are Questionable Because of Potential Underreporting by the States", "paragraphs": ["Periodic audits by EPA\u2014and our own analyses\u2014raise questions about the  completeness of EPA\u2019s data on lead rule violations. To assess the reliability  of its drinking water data, EPA regularly conducts data verification audits  that evaluate state compliance decisions and the adequacy of states\u2019  reporting to the national database. In addition, EPA prepares a national  summary evaluation of the reliability of drinking water data every 3 years.  While past data verification audits have not assessed compliance decisions  under the lead rule, to the extent that states\u2019 reporting practices are  relatively consistent across regulations, the audits may shed some light on  the types of problems likely to be found in the reporting of lead rule data.  According to the most recent national summary of data reliability, which  covered audits conducted from 1999 to 2001, the estimated error rate for  health-based violations\u2014involving maximum contaminant level or  treatment technique requirements\u2014was 35 percent, down from 60 percent  in the prior national report, which covered audits conducted from 1996 to  1998. For monitoring and reporting violations, the estimated error rate was  77 percent, down from 91 percent in the prior report. The March 2004  report said that most violation errors resulted from incorrect compliance  determinations by the states, meaning that the state should have cited a  violation but did not. Other problems included \u201cdata flow\u201d errors (when the  state correctly identified a violation but did not report it to EPA) and errors  in EPA\u2019s database (such as violations that were incorrectly reported or not  removed when rescinded).", "Another analysis from EPA\u2019s March 2004 report did include the lead rule  and the results also raise questions about the completeness of EPA\u2019s data  on lead rule violations. The report states that by means of a tool that tracks  the number of violations reported in each state over a period of several  years, EPA determined that 14 states had not reported any treatment  technique violations under the lead rule during a 6-year period from 1997 to  2002. The report noted that this potential non-reporting should be  evaluated further and recommended that EPA and the states conduct  annual evaluations of all instances of potential non-reporting. EPA\u2019s Office  of Ground Water and Drinking Water asked the regional offices to follow up  with the states regarding the potential underreporting, as recommended in  the March 2004 report on data reliability. For the most part, however, the  regions\u2019 responses did not address the lack of treatment technique  violations under the lead rule in the applicable states; two of the regional  offices did not provide written responses. Officials from EPA\u2019s Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance were not aware of the violations  analysis. The officials told us that because of limited resources, they focus  their efforts on helping to ensure that states address the worst compliance  problems\u2014water systems identified as significant noncompliers as a result  of the frequency or severity of their violations.", "A lack of violations\u2014or a relatively low number of water systems with  violations\u2014does not necessarily mean that states are not meeting reporting  requirements, or that their compliance monitoring and enforcement efforts  are inadequate. However, analyzing the violations data and following up on  the results could provide some useful insights into the reasons for  differences among the states; it could also help identify problem areas and  best practices. We updated EPA\u2019s analysis of violations and, as table 3  shows, the percentage of water systems that have had one or more  violations over the past 10 years varies from state to state, particularly in  the case of monitoring violations.", "Appendix III contains a state-by-state analysis of lead rule violations  reported from 1995 to June 2005.", "More recently, EPA conducted data verification audits during the fall of  2004, which focused exclusively on states\u2019 compliance determinations  under the lead rule in five states and included the lead rule as part of the  audit in another five states.

Regarding the 90th percentile results of lead monitoring, EPA noted that in  terms of routine reporting, these data are the only measure it has for  showing the lead rule\u2019s effectiveness and said that, without such data, the  agency would have no way to measure progress. Similarly, EPA  maintained that having information on water systems\u2019 corrective action  milestones, along with quarterly violation and follow-up information,  would provide data on the status of lead rule implementation and allow the  targeting of compliance and enforcement activities. Given the reduced  number of milestones, EPA indicated that it would be critical for states to  report the information completely and in a timely manner, and that the  agency would be following up with the states to ensure that such reporting  was occurring.", "Despite the importance of the 90th percentile results and corrective action  milestones to evaluating the lead rule\u2019s implementation, our analyses  confirmed or identified significant and longstanding gaps in the amount of  information available. Although EPA attempted to ensure that it had  complete data on the results of lead testing, following the publicity  surrounding the incidence of lead contamination in the District of  Columbia, the problems with incomplete test result data have continued  and the agency has not followed up on the missing milestone data. EPA has  also been slow to take action on the potential underreporting of violations.  As noted earlier, following its March 2004 report on data reliability, EPA did  not determine the reasons for the lack of violations reported by some  states. EPA\u2019s previous summary evaluation, which was issued in October  2000, identified similar indications of underreporting and called for  targeted attention to the applicable states and regions to address the issues  and develop action plans.", "EPA needs complete, accurate, and timely data to monitor water systems\u2019  progress in implementing the lead rule, identify potential problem areas  and best practices, and take appropriate action. In particular, not having  complete or reliable data on corrective action milestones or violations  makes it difficult to assess the adequacy of EPA and state enforcement  efforts. However, officials from EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and  Compliance Assurance told us that the amount of enforcement resources  devoted to the drinking water program\u2014including enforcement of the lead  rule\u2014has declined in recent years. They also told us that while they hold  monthly meetings with their counterparts in EPA\u2019s regional offices and  state officials to discuss the more significant violators, the officials have  not systematically evaluated state enforcement efforts with regard to the  lead rule. See appendix IV for information on EPA and state enforcement  actions, by type, from 1995 to June 2005.", "EPA and state officials attribute the problems with lead rule data to the  complicated nature of the rule, the incompatibility of EPA and state  information management systems, and resource constraints. For example,  EPA officials noted that it is difficult to ensure that the database contains  complete information\u2014and includes data on every system that is required  to test for lead in a particular period\u2014because the frequency of required  testing can vary depending on whether a system has qualified for reduced  monitoring (and maintains that status in future periods). The same  circumstances also make it difficult to develop trend data. EPA and state  officials indicated that the January 2000 minor revisions to the lead rule,  which made significant changes in states\u2019 reporting requirements,  exacerbated existing problems with the transfer of accurate and timely  data from the states to EPA. For that and other reasons, modifying the  states\u2019 data systems to incorporate the new reporting milestones has been  delayed.

Among other things, the modernization will make it easier to  transfer data between states and EPA so EPA\u2019s data will be more timely. To  improve the accuracy of the data, EPA\u2019s system will have a component  designed to validate state data before it is entered into the federal database.

In addition, some of the officials responsible for implementing the  lead rule and other drinking water experts believe that existing standards  for plumbing fixtures may be outdated.

The rule defines Tier 1 sites  as single-family structures served by lead service lines, and/or containing  lead pipes (or copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982).  According to participants in EPA\u2019s workshop on monitoring protocols and  state officials we interviewed, one problem is that EPA has never updated  its site selection criteria and at least one of the criteria is outdated.  Specifically, enough time has elapsed so that lead solder in plumbing  installed from 1983 to 1986 is no longer \u201cfresh\u201d (lead solder was banned in  1986). Experts believe that, by now, solder from that period has been  coated by a naturally occurring film that prevents lead leaching. Moving the  sampling sites to other Tier 1 locations\u2014for example, homes served by  lead service lines\u2014could be problematic. In the preamble to the lead rule,  issued in 1991, EPA cited a survey by the American Water Works  Association which estimated that only about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s  community water systems have lead service lines. Moreover, although the  lead rule required water systems to do a \u201cmaterials evaluation\u201d to identify  an adequate pool of high risk sampling sites, according to EPA the  evaluation did not assess pipe materials system-wide, and many systems do  not have a complete inventory of their service lines.", "A related problem is that sampling locations have likely changed over time  as sites are no longer available or appropriate, and states may not have  procedures in place to ensure that these locations continue to represent the  highest risk sites. In this regard, EPA requested information from the  states on how they \u201censure that site locations were correctly followed  during system sampling rounds.\u201d As table 4 shows, a significant number of  states may not be tracking changes in water systems\u2019 sampling locations.", "Another uncertainty is whether systems that are on reduced monitoring\u2014 and have been allowed to reduce the number of samples they collect\u2014are  taking samples from locations that represent the highest risk sites based on  previous testing. According to the lead rule, these water systems must  take their samples from sites included in the pool of high risk sampling  sites identified initially. Although the systems have some indication of  which sites within the pool have historically tested at higher or lower lead  levels, the rule is silent on how sites within the pool are to be selected for  reduced monitoring, except that they must be \u201crepresentative\u201d of the sites  required for standard monitoring. In addition, the rule provides that states  may specify the sampling locations. EPA requested information from the  states on what role they play in selecting the sites used for reduced  monitoring.

In addition, systems of  any size that operate within water quality control parameters reflecting  optimal corrosion control treatment, as specified by the state, may reduce  the frequency of monitoring under the same schedule. The rule also lays  out conditions under which water systems must return to standard  monitoring\u2014for example, small and medium-sized systems that have  exceeded the action level. In addition, states have the flexibility to require  systems to resume standard monitoring if the state deems it to be  appropriate. We analyzed EPA\u2019s compliance data and found some  instances that raise questions about the states\u2019 decisions to allow reduced  monitoring. Specifically, we found that 49 large and medium water systems  were exceeding the 15-parts-per-billion action level and appeared to be on  reduced monitoring schedules. In addition, our analysis indicates that 104  large and medium systems with lead levels of 13-15 parts per billion also  appear to be on reduced monitoring schedules. Although this is allowable  under EPA\u2019s regulations, according to some state officials, systems with  lead levels just below the action level should be subject to closer scrutiny  and, thus, may not be good candidates for reduced monitoring.", "To determine how states exercised their discretion with regard to  monitoring frequency, we reviewed their responses to EPA\u2019s information  request, which asked the states to describe how they determine if reduced  monitoring is appropriate. According to their responses, the states by and  large adhere to the requirements of the lead rule and allow reduced  monitoring whenever a water system\u2019s test results are at or below the  action level in consecutive monitoring periods. Specifically, 40 states  reported that they follow the federal regulation, 6 states indicated that they  may be using some additional criteria for their reduced monitoring  determinations, and 4 states did not answer or provided information that  was nonresponsive. EPA did not ask for the states\u2019 views on whether  reduced monitoring is appropriate when a water system\u2019s test results are at  or just below the action level or on circumstances in which states might  determine that previously approved reduced monitoring is no longer  appropriate\u2014and the states did not volunteer such information. None of  the states reported using other criteria, such as test results that are at or  just below the action level, to delay or rescind approval for reduced  monitoring.", "A key issue is whether water systems should be required to resume  standard monitoring following a major treatment change so that the  potential effects of the change can be evaluated. Given the circumstances  in which lead contamination became a problem in the District of Columbia,  when a change in the system\u2019s disinfection treatment impaired the  effectiveness of corrosion control, such decisions can be critical. In its  information request on state implementation policies and practices, EPA  asked the states whether they had ever required a system to conduct more  frequent monitoring to evaluate the potential effects of a treatment change.  It would have been useful to know more about the states\u2019 policies and  practices in this regard, including how often the states required additional  monitoring and the criteria they used in making such determinations.", "However, EPA\u2019s question was limited in scope and, as table 6 shows, the  states often did not elaborate.", "In our discussions with 10 states, we found a variety of policies and  practices regarding reduced monitoring. For example, officials from  California and New York told us that they do not approve reduced  monitoring\u2014or are reluctant to do so\u2014when water systems\u2019 test results  are close to the lead action level. On the other hand, Connecticut and  Massachusetts officials indicated that they have systems that are on  reduced monitoring despite test results close to the action level. Several  other states indicated that, in the case of large water systems, approval for  reduced monitoring is linked to whether the systems are meeting their  water quality parameters\u2014not the results of lead monitoring. On the issue  of monitoring following a major treatment change, some participants at  EPA\u2019s monitoring workshop stated that standard compliance monitoring  does not adequately evaluate the impact of treatment changes and that  monitoring immediately after major changes should be required. Several of  the states we contacted also favor increased monitoring under these  circumstances; Florida and New York, for example, require systems to  return to semi-annual monitoring following a treatment change.  Pennsylvania officials agree that the state and water system should revisit  the treatment approach when monitoring results indicate that a treatment  change is affecting water chemistry.

Changing the type of disinfectant a system  uses to control bacteria, for example, can impair the effectiveness of a  system\u2019s corrosion control treatment to prevent lead contamination.  Among other things, states assuming primary enforcement responsibility  must have a process for ensuring that the design and construction of new  or substantially modified water system facilities will be capable of meeting  drinking water regulations, including the lead rule. In addition, in its  minor revisions to the lead rule, EPA added a requirement that certain  water systems must notify the state no later than 60 days after making a  change in water treatment. However, the responses to EPA\u2019s information  request raise questions about the nature and extent of states\u2019 reviews of  treatment changes. On the one hand, 31 states indicated that they had some  type of proactive process to review or evaluate treatment changes, before  or after the treatment was installed, including 15 states that reported  requiring some or all of the affected water systems to provide information  on the potential effects of treatment changes on corrosion control. On the  other hand, it appears that in at least 15 states, the plan review process may  be limited, or the states may not be receiving notifications from all their  water systems. For example, some states indicated that their review  process only covers changes to a system\u2019s physical infrastructure\u2014or  specifically excludes changes in the chemicals used in a process. Other  states reported that they are not learning of some treatment changes until  they conduct comprehensive inspections of the water systems, or that  small systems in particular are not notifying the state when they change  their treatment processes.", "Some of the participants in EPA\u2019s May 2004 workshop on simultaneous  compliance cited a need for additional regulations or guidance to help  ensure that the effectiveness of corrosion control is maintained when  water systems make changes to other treatment processes. For example,  some participants suggested that the lead rule should better define or even  specify the types of treatment changes that (1) should be reported to the  state and (2) trigger additional monitoring or analysis. Along those lines,  Washington state officials told us that certain changes, such as switching  the disinfectant from chlorine to chloramines or making adjustments that  affect the water\u2019s pH or alkalinity, may warrant closer review because of  the potential impact on corrosion control. The officials also noted that  additional guidance from EPA on these matters would be helpful.

Some of the participants  in an EPA workshop on lead service line replacement and state officials we  contacted raised questions about the effectiveness of replacement  programs, in part because such programs often result in partial  replacement only. Water systems are responsible for replacing only the  portion of the service lines they own. While residential customers may, at  their option, pay the cost of replacing the rest of the service line\u2014typically,  the portion running from the curb stop or property line to the household  plumbing system\u2014some evidence suggests that customer participation in  such programs is generally low.", "According to workshop participants, little conclusive information is  available on the extent to which removing lead service lines lowers lead  levels at the tap. In a survey of water systems conducted for the American  Water Works Association, 18 of 27 respondents indicated that lead service  lines were not responsible for the highest levels of lead in drinking water,  and 20 of 29 respondents reported no observed linkage between lead  service lines and lead levels in drinking water. However, the survey did  not include information on test results before and after replacement of lead  service lines. The American Water Works Association Research Foundation  is sponsoring a study of the relative contributions of service lines and  plumbing fixtures to lead levels at the tap; the projected completion is fall  2008.", "The limited data on the extent and results of lead service line replacement  programs make it difficult to draw conclusions about the programs\u2019  effectiveness or the need for additional regulations or guidance. As noted  earlier, EPA\u2019s data on corrective action milestones\u2014including the LSLR  milestone\u2014are incomplete. Moreover, few states reported requiring  systems to replace lead service lines in response to EPA\u2019s information  request on state implementation policies and practices. Specifically, when  asked if they have any systems that have been required to do lead service  line replacement, five states answered \u201cyes\u201d without elaborating and seven  states reported a total of 27 water systems that are (or were) replacing lead  lines. In addition, although the lead rule requires testing following partial  service line replacement, it appears that neither the states nor EPA are  collecting and analyzing these test results. EPA asked states to describe the  process they use to ensure that water systems are following the  requirements for lead service line replacement. Among other things, the  lead rule requires systems to collect samples within 72 hours following  partial replacement and to notify homeowners and occupants of the  results. States may waive the requirement that these test results also be  provided to the states.

For example, Iowa drinking water officials commented that  partial replacement is not a good use of resources because it disturbs the  line, releasing lead particulate matter into the water, and still leaves half the  lead line in place. In addition, officials from the Syracuse Water  Department told us that they are planning to replace lead service lines at a  cost of $5.3 million, although they are skeptical that the effort will  significantly reduce lead levels, citing the age of the housing stock and lead  contributions from internal residential plumbing. The officials attribute the  city\u2019s problem with elevated lead levels to a simultaneous compliance  issue. Specifically, adding a phosphate-based corrosion inhibitor to further  reduce the corrosiveness of the drinking water solves one problem but  creates another: excessive phosphates in the system\u2019s discharges to a local  lake.", "Participants at EPA\u2019s workshop on lead service line replacement and some  of the state and water industry officials we contacted suggested measures  to help ensure that water systems maximize the potential benefits of  replacement efforts. For example, some workshop participants called for  EPA guidance on strategies to encourage full service line replacement and  motivate customers to have their portion of the line removed. Such  strategies might include subsidizing a portion of the replacement cost,  offering low interest loans or property tax relief, requiring disclosure of  lead service lines in property sales, or providing more information on the  health effects of exposure to lead in drinking water. Others suggested that  prioritizing the replacement of lead service lines would help ensure that  replacement activities focus on the populations most at risk from exposure  to elevated lead levels. Some utilities are already prioritizing service line  replacement using criteria such as locations with vulnerable populations,  including schools and child care facilities, locations where test results have  exceeded the action level, and lines serving 20 or more people in an 8-hour  day."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Vary in How They Apply the Lead Rule When Water Systems Sell Drinking Water to Other Systems", "paragraphs": ["We found some differences among the states in how interconnected water  systems\u2014generally comprising a system that sells drinking water along  with one or more systems that buy the water\u2014are required to monitor for  lead and report the results.

Combined distribution systems account for a large and growing  share of the nation\u2019s community water systems so differences in how they  implement the lead rule could have broad implications for public health  protection. Overall, EPA estimates that there are currently about 2,800  combined distribution systems that encompass about 13,900 individual  systems, likely accounting for a significant share of all community water  systems. Under EPA regulations that establish general requirements for  drinking water monitoring, states may modify the monitoring requirements  imposed on combined distribution systems\u2014typically by reducing the  number of samples required within the combined system\u2014\u201cto the extent  that the interconnection of the systems justifies treating them as a single  system for monitoring purposes.\u201d However, in the case of the lead rule,  EPA strongly discouraged such modifications, commenting that they would  not be appropriate because the primary source of elevated lead levels at the  tap is materials within the distribution system.", "At least four of the states we contacted\u2014Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon,  and Washington\u2014approved modified sampling arrangements at combined  distribution systems. For example, the Massachusetts Water Resources  Authority, which supplies all of the drinking water for 30 communities,  currently takes lead samples at 440 locations under its modified sampling  arrangement\u2014significantly fewer than the 1,720 samples that would be  required if each of the consecutive systems tested for lead individually. On  the other hand, if the combined distribution system represented a single  water system, only 100 samples would be required.", "EPA does not have comprehensive information on the extent to which  states are approving modified sampling arrangements at combined  distribution systems\u2014or the reporting practices used by such systems. As  table 8 shows, we found differences in how combined distribution systems  calculated and reported their 90th percentile test results.", "Not only do the reporting practices approved by the states affect the  amount of information available to the public\u2014they can also have  implications for the corrective actions that are taken to reduce lead levels.  For example, reporting one overall result for lead testing can be misleading  if the 90th percentile levels at individual consecutive systems would have  exceeded the action level. In the case of the Massachusetts Water  Resources Authority, although EPA\u2019s database contains the overall result  for the combined system, authority officials calculated the 90th percentile  results for each of the consecutive systems and determined that lead  concentrations at some of them exceeded the action level. State officials  in Massachusetts told us that until recently, none of the consecutive  systems whose individual test results exceeded the action level were  required to meet public notification or public education requirements or to  replace lead service lines\u2014as long as the result for the combined system  met the action level. Although EPA regional officials concurred with such  arrangements when they were first established, EPA is now considering  how to ensure that the lead rule requirements will be applied to each  community within a combined distribution system.

At our request, NSF compiled test results for a nonprobability  sample of water meters and valves that had been submitted for evaluation.  While all of the products in the sample were well below the 8 percent limit  on lead content, the test results showed that the amount of lead leached  from the selected water meters ranged from 0.4 parts per billion up to 39  parts per billion and, in the case of valves, ranged from a low of 4.1 parts  per billion to as much as 530 parts per billion. An NSF official commented  that although these products are representative of what is submitted to  NSF for testing, they are probably not representative of what is available in  the marketplace because some manufacturers have two product lines\u2014a  low-lead line for buyers who specify products that meet NSF Standard 61  and a higher-leaded line for other buyers.", "Another issue is that NSF\u2019s testing protocol for lead leaching may not  accurately reflect actual conditions and may need to be modified.

However, the state regulators, water industry  representatives, and other experts we interviewed generally agreed that  lowering the existing standard for lead content is feasible and would  provide an extra margin of safety.

NSF reports that most faucets sold at the retail and  wholesale level are certified to meet Standard 61, but fewer valves and  other in-line devices are certified to the standard because it is not required  in model plumbing codes.", "State efforts to implement more stringent standards for plumbing products  appear limited, based on our discussions with federal and state regulators  and representatives of the water industry and plumbing manufacturers. We  identified two states in which such activities have occurred:   In California, the Attorney General sued 16 manufacturers and  distributors of kitchen and bathroom faucets in the early 1990s, alleging  that lead leaching from brass components of their faucets violated  California law.

Although they wanted more details on how the requirements  would be revised, they believed the changes to be relatively minor. In  particular, most state officials agreed that large water systems that exceed  the action level should not be allowed to reduce the frequency of lead  monitoring based solely on their ability to meet water quality parameters.", "Regarding earlier notification of treatment changes, officials from all 10  states we contacted supported such a revision, particularly for major  treatment changes. The officials indicated that the notification requirement  would not have a significant impact on their own practices because each of  the states already had some type of process in place to permit or review  treatment changes. Five of the states questioned whether 60 days advance  notice would be sufficient to allow an adequate review. Several states  suggested that EPA should require expedited monitoring of lead levels  following major treatment changes\u2014or issue guidance on when it would be  appropriate for states to require such monitoring\u2014and that EPA should  issue guidance on what constitutes a major treatment change. In addition,  officials from two states commented that EPA should require state  approval of the treatment changes in addition to advance notification.", "On the proposed revisions involving customer awareness, all 10 states  agreed that homeowners that participate in the tap sampling program  should be informed of the test results\u2014particularly if the results for  individual homeowners exceed the lead action level\u2014whether or not the  90th percentile result for the entire system exceeds the action level.

Among other things, the act   banned the manufacture and sale of drinking water coolers containing  lead-lined tanks and other water coolers that are not lead-free,   required EPA to publish a list of such coolers and distribute it to the  states along with guidance on testing for and remedying lead  contamination in drinking water, and   required the Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue an order  requiring manufacturers and importers to (1) repair or replace the  coolers or (2) recall and provide a refund for them because coolers  containing lead-lined tanks were deemed to be imminently hazardous  consumer products.", "In addition, the LCCA required states to establish programs to assist local  agencies in addressing potential lead contamination. While the nature and  extent of state activities varied widely, the program was never funded,  according to EPA officials. In 1996, the requirement was determined to be  unconstitutional.", "To support the required recall, EPA identified six models of water coolers  containing lead-lined tanks, all produced by one company and  manufactured prior to April 1979. EPA could not obtain information on the  number of units produced. The Consumer Product Safety Commission  broadened the recall order to include all tank-type models of drinking  water coolers manufactured by the company, whether or not the models  were included on EPA\u2019s list. Under the terms of the order, the  manufacturer established a process under which qualified owners of the  affected coolers could request a refund or replacement. The manufacturer  was also required to notify appropriate officials and organizations,  including state and school officials and day care centers, about the recall  and the availability of refunds and replacements.", "Little information is available to determine the effectiveness of the recall  effort in removing lead-lined water coolers from service. Not only is the  number of coolers affected by the recall unknown, but the Consumer  Product Safety Commission did not have summary data on the results of  the recall. An agency official confirmed information in a 1991 Natural  Resources Defense Council report that, as of 1990, the Commission had  received approximately 1,200 inquiries about the recall, 1,373 coolers had  been determined to be eligible for replacement, 514 had been replaced, and  105 refunds had been mailed to customers. However, the official also said  that many more coolers were replaced after that date and that by 1993, the  manufacturer had received approximately 11,000 inquiries about the recall.  The official believed that the actual number of replacements was  potentially 10 times greater than those reported in 1991 and the refunds  four to five times greater. In addition, the recall order did not specify an end  date for filing a refund or replacement request so an unknown number of  coolers could have been taken out of service without the knowledge of the  manufacturer or the Commission subsequent to 1993.", "According to several state and school officials we interviewed, virtually all  of the water coolers affected by the recall have been replaced or removed,  either as a result of the publicity surrounding the recall or because they had  already been taken out of service. Some of the six models covered by the  recall were manufactured in the 1950s and 1960s and are likely to have  been retired because of their age or maintenance problems.", "Beyond the recall effort, little or no data are available to assess the  effectiveness of other actions taken in response to the LCCA. For example,  little information is available on the extent to which schools and child care  facilities were inspected to check potential lead contamination from water  coolers that were not lead-free. While the act did not require EPA or the  states to track or report on the results of testing, EPA was responsible for  publishing guidance and a testing protocol to assist schools in determining  the source and degree of lead contamination in school drinking water  supplies and remedying such contamination. EPA published guidance for  both schools and child care facilities in 1989 and 1994, respectively.", "We found no information indicating how pervasive lead-contaminated  drinking water in such facilities nationwide or within particular states  might be, but several studies conducted in the early 1990s contained some  limited information on testing efforts:  In 1993, we reported on the results of a survey of 57 school districts in  10 states. We found that 47 districts were able to provide data on the  results of testing, which showed that about 15 percent of the 2,272  schools tested had drinking water containing levels of lead considered  unacceptable by EPA. We also contacted child care licensing agencies in  16 states to obtain information on their activities for addressing lead  hazards and found that none of the agencies routinely inspected child  care facilities for such hazards.", "A 1990 report by EPA\u2019s Inspector General found that, of the 13 school  districts surveyed, 10 conducted some testing for lead in drinking water  and 8 detected contamination, with some results exceeding acceptable  levels by a wide margin.", "According to the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s 1991 study, 47  states reported some testing of school drinking water supplies,  including 16 states that tested in \u201ca few\u201d to 25 percent of their schools,  27 states that tested from 25 percent to 82 percent of the schools, and 4  states that tested 95 percent or more of their schools.

As part of that effort, seven states also reported on the results of  local testing following passage of the LCCA, stating that elevated lead  levels were found in at least some of the locations tested. However, the  states differed significantly in the extent of their testing and how they  summarized the results. In five of the states, the results generally ranged  from about 1 percent to 27 percent of samples, facilities, or districts with  lead levels considered unacceptable by EPA\u2014but the other two states  finding elevated lead levels used a different assessment measure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Efforts to Detect and Remediate Lead in Drinking Water at Schools and Child Care Facilities Also Appear Limited", "paragraphs": ["The extent of current testing and remediation activities for lead in school  and child care facility drinking water appears limited.

In the fifth state (Massachusetts),  the testing requirement focuses on schools. Water systems must include  two schools among their sampling sites in each round of lead testing,  although the school data are not included in the 90th percentile calculation  to determine whether lead levels exceed the action level. Massachusetts  officials told us that, although the testing requirement has been in place  since 1992, it has not received much attention until recently. The officials  acknowledged that most water systems repeatedly used the same schools  as sampling sites for the sake of convenience and said that the state has  never summarized the results of the school testing. Given the renewed  concerns about lead contamination following the detection of lead in the  District of Columbia\u2019s drinking water, Massachusetts now requires water  systems to rotate testing among schools and child care facilities and plans  to issue a summary report at the end of 2005.", "In addition to these requirements, Florida\u2019s Department of Environmental  Protection reported to EPA that it had established a voluntary program.  Specifically, the state designated child care facilities as Tier 1, high risk  sites and gave water systems the option of using the facilities as lead  sampling sites and including them in the calculation of the 90th percentile  lead level. (According to a Florida official, to be included as a sampling site,  the child care facility must meet other Tier 1 criteria, such as being served  by a lead service line.) However, when we followed up with state officials,  they said that they had no way of tracking the extent to which water  systems were actually including child care facilities as sampling sites.", "The scope of the targeted testing reported by 12 states varied widely, from  a single school district in Pennsylvania to over 1,300 homes and child care  facilities in Indiana. Several states indicated that they were focusing on  potential high risk locations. EPA regional offices helped to initiate some  limited testing in a few states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, New  York, and Pennsylvania; the testing generally focused on a few of the states\u2019  largest school districts. The state-sponsored surveys to determine the  status of testing by local agencies also varied, with some covering all  schools within the state and others focusing on a smaller subset of schools.  In Washington, the state recently set aside $750,000, including $400,000  from its drinking water state revolving fund, to partially reimburse school  districts for the cost of monitoring for lead in elementary schools\u2019 drinking  water.", "EPA officials attributed the relatively low level of state activity in recent  years to the aftereffects of a 1996 lawsuit brought by the Association of  Community Organizations for Reform Now against the state of Louisiana  for not doing enough to implement the LCCA. The case resulted in a federal  circuit court decision declaring that part of the LCCA was unconstitutional.  Specifically, the court ruled that the federal government did not have the  authority to require states to establish a remedial action program as  outlined in the LCCA.

As a result, it is difficult to get a sense of  the pervasiveness of lead contamination in the drinking water at schools  and child care facilities, and to know whether a more concerted effort to  address the issue\u2014such as mandatory testing\u2014is warranted. In addition,  remediation measures such as providing bottled water, regularly flushing  water lines, installing filters, and replacing fixtures and internal piping vary  widely in cost and complexity, among other factors.

The U.S.  Department of Education (Education) is responsible for, among other  things, providing guidance and financial assistance to state and local  education agencies for elementary and secondary schools. Education\u2019s  Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools recently signed a memorandum of  understanding with EPA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  and various water industry associations with the goal of reducing children\u2019s  exposure to lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities.  However, according to an Education official, the department does not have  legal authority to compel schools to test for lead in the drinking water.  Officials in Washington state saw a need for closer coordination between  EPA and Education. The officials believe that local education officials are  more likely to respond to guidance on lead and other environmental health  issues if Education were to be involved in developing it.", "At the state level, responsibility for the environmental health of schools  and child care facilities is usually fragmented among multiple agencies.  According to EPA, in most states, the same agency that administers the  drinking water program\u2014generally the state\u2019s department of  environmental protection or department of health\u2014is also responsible for  implementing the LCCA. However, we also learned from EPA that the state  agencies responsible for administering education programs and licensing  child care facilities are usually the ones with the regulatory or oversight  authority over environmental conditions in schools and child care facilities.  (As noted earlier, some states also have lead poisoning prevention  programs to monitor blood lead levels in children and investigate the  source of lead exposure when the levels are elevated.) According to some  of the states we contacted, the level of coordination among state agencies  needs to be improved and the lack of a centralized authority at the state  level has complicated efforts to plan and implement a testing program for  lead in water in some school districts. For example, in Pennsylvania, state  drinking water officials said that several other agencies, including the  Departments of Health, Education, and Public Welfare, have a role in  overseeing schools and child care facilities\u2014but it was unclear which  agency would be best suited to manage a testing program if one were to be  required. In contrast, Connecticut officials said that having both the  drinking water program and the child care licensing program housed within  the same department has been an advantage because it is easier for the  programs to share information and coordinate their activities.", "We also contacted several school and child care associations to find out if  they were involved in or aware of efforts to promote testing for lead in  drinking water, collect and analyze the results of testing, or set standards  for the environmental health of the facilities. According to a representative  of the National Child Care Association, until recently the association had  not been aware of any issues regarding lead in drinking water at child care  facilities or involved in any effort to promote testing. The representative  commented that one challenge to distributing information on lead in  drinking water to child care facilities is the fragmented nature of the child  care industry. While the National Head Start Association has been involved  with lead poisoning prevention in general, the organization has not done  anything specifically related to lead in drinking water. The Healthy  Schools Network, Inc. promotes the development of state and national  policies, regulations, and funding for environmentally safe and healthy  schools. Although the network has published some fact sheets that address  the potential health risks from lead exposure, lead in drinking water has  not been a priority compared with other environmental issues.

To assess the reliability of NSF\u2019s  data on lead content and lead leaching of plumbing fittings and fixtures, we  talked with foundation officials about data quality control procedures. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for illustrative purposes.", "For information on safeguards against lead-contaminated drinking water at  schools and child care facilities, we interviewed officials from the  Consumer Product Safety Commission, EPA\u2019s Office of Ground Water and  Drinking Water, the National Head Start Association, the National Child  Care Association, and the Healthy Schools Network. We also obtained  information from drinking water program offices and public health or  education departments in the 10 states we contacted for the first objective  as well as school districts in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Seattle,  and Syracuse. We reviewed the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA) of  1988 and obtained information on the recall of lead-lined water coolers. For  information on other actions taken in response to the LCCA, we  interviewed EPA, state, and local officials; reviewed relevant studies; and  analyzed information collected by EPA. We used the same information  sources to determine (1) the extent of current testing and remediation  activities for lead in school and child care facility drinking water, (2) the  extent to which various entities have responsibility for overseeing or  collecting data on such activities, and (3) the relative priorities among  environmental hazards common to schools and child care facilities. We  also analyzed states\u2019 responses to an EPA information request on state and  local efforts to monitor and protect children from lead exposure and  attended an EPA-sponsored expert workshop on lead in drinking water at  schools and child care facilities. For more detailed information on  experiences at the local level, we collected information from five school  districts on the extent of testing for lead in school drinking water, the  results, and the approaches used to address contamination.", "We performed our work between June 2004 and November 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detailed Analysis of Corrective Action Milestone Data Reported to EPA, by State, through June 2005", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Lead Rule Violations Reported to EPA Between 1995 and June 2005 (by State)", "paragraphs": ["Percent of total  systems with  Legend: TT = treatment techniue violations, including failure to install optimal corrosion control  treatment, failure to meet water uality control parameters, failure to replace lead service lines, and  failure to meet public education reuirements, among other things.", "MR = monitoring and reporting violations, including the failure to conduct reuired testing and failure to  report the results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on Selected EPA and State Enforcement Actions, by Type, from 1995 to June 2005a", "paragraphs": ["We included the most commonly used enforcement actions in this table and excluded miscellaneous  actions and activities unrelated to enforcement or the lead rule.", "EPA files a \u201ccomplaint for penalty\u201d when the terms of an administrative order are violated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Environmental Protection Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Ellen Crocker, Nancy Crothers,  Sandra Edwards, Maureen Driscoll, Benjamin Howe, Julian Klazkin, Jean  McSween, Chris Murray, and George Quinn, Jr. made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
