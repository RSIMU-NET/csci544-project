Having agreed to voluntarily implement the Common Approaches beginning in 2002, many OECD members adopted similar basic procedures for reviewing sensitive projects. However, OECD members' guidelines and practices differ in areas where the United States believes it has among the more advanced policies, including which technical standards ECAs use to review projects and the extent to which environmental impact information is publicly disclosed. Although OECD members are considering revising the Common Approaches in 2003, the United States is unlikely to achieve all of its original negotiating objectives because of the desire by some OECD members to gain more experience with the guidelines before renegotiating them and the reluctance of other members to take any steps that might be perceived as having a negative effect on the competitiveness of their exporters. There is limited evidence that the Export-Import Bank's environmental guidelines have affected U.S. exports, although the complexity of potential effects and the lack of information make identifying and quantifying impacts difficult. The evidence GAO reviewed indicates that impacts are likely to be concentrated in the energy sector. Most Export-Import Bank transactions do not require an environmental review because they are either short-term transactions, are in certain excluded sectors, or are not considered environmentally sensitive.

Since ECAs annually finance  around $60 billion in exports each year for medium- and long-term projects,  environmental organizations have been pressuring industrialized nations to  develop guidelines to review the environmental implications of export  credit-sponsored projects. In 1995, in response to language in its revised  charter, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) became  the first ECA to implement guidelines incorporating environmental  standards as part of the project review process.", "To ensure that its exporters were not disadvantaged by environmental  standards that other nations\u2019 exporters did not have to meet, the United  States began an effort to establish common environmental guidelines for  ECAs.

The United States was  concerned that the negotiators\u2019 recommendations, formally called the  Draft Recommendation on Common Approaches on Environment and  Officially Supported Export Credits (Common Approaches) did not level  the playing field for exporters. Specifically, the U.S. negotiators felt that the  Common Approaches granted ECAs too much latitude in establishing  guidelines and did not provide for sufficient public disclosure or explicit  direction regarding which technical standards to use in the review process,  such as those for allowable emissions. While the lack of consensus  prevented the OECD from formally adopting the Common Approaches,  most members nevertheless voluntarily agreed to abide by the terms of the  most recent version of the Common Approaches. They also agreed to  undertake a review of efforts to revise the Common Approaches by the end  of 2003.", "As a result of the potential impact of different ECA environmental  requirements on U.S. exports, you asked us to assess (1) the achievements  of the Common Approaches and the remaining differences among the  OECD members, (2) the prospects for further advancement on common  environmental guidelines for export credit agencies, and (3) the impact  that environmental guidelines for export credit agencies may have on U.S.  exports.", "To meet these objectives, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  knowledgeable officials from the departments of the Treasury and State  and the Ex-Im Bank, the key U.S. agencies involved in export credit  negotiations. We also traveled to Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and  the United Kingdom to interview senior government and ECA officials and  OECD officials, and met with senior officials from the Japanese ECA in  Washington. To evaluate the impact of environmental guidelines and  regulations of ECAs on U.S. exports, we analyzed financing data and  environmental assessments for 24 medium- and high-risk Ex-Im Bank  projects.

(See fig. 1.)  With the  exception of the United States, OECD members agreed in November 2001  to voluntarily implement a version of this framework, known as the Common Approaches. This process of negotiation followed a 1997  communiqu\u00e9 from the Group of Eight (G-8) that indicated a strong interest  in negotiating common environmental guidelines for ECAs. At the 1999 G-8  summit, the heads of state issued a second communiqu\u00e9 stating that they  hoped for agreement within the OECD by their 2001 summit, a deadline the  G-8 reiterated the following year.", "The United States led the effort to regularly place common ECA  environmental procedures on the G-8 agenda. The United States sought to  promote uniform standards because it was concerned about unequal  export market conditions and growing concern from nongovernmental  organizations (NGO) that ECA-funded projects had the potential to cause  significant environmental harm. However, the most current version of the  Common Approaches required neither public disclosure of project  information nor establishment of a single set of technical standards.  Because the United States believed that these provisions were essential, it  objected and said it would block the agreement if it were sent before the  OECD Council for approval. Twenty-eight of 29 OECD members of the  Working Party on Export Credits and Credit Guarantees (ECG)  subsequently opted to voluntarily adhere to the Common Approaches, thus  implementing the framework without a formal decision.

The environmental guidelines of  Ex-Im Bank, for example, were developed using World Bank standards as a  reference point.  While the environmental review policies of different  organizations within the World Bank Group vary somewhat, they generally  follow a similar screening and categorization process (see fig. 2). The  World Bank\u2019s environmental policies include evaluation and technical  standards, such as those for emissions, which are laid out in the Pollution  Prevention and Abatement Handbook. It also has a set of qualitative  environmental and social standards, known as safeguard policies. These  outline broad project and evaluation expectations, including guidelines on  involuntary movement of peoples, impacts on cultural property, and  conservation of natural habitats.", "Representatives of both the business community and the environmental  NGO community have expressed considerable interest in the issue of  environmental review procedures for ECAs, but for different reasons.  Some businesses in the United States are concerned that if Ex-Im Bank  maintains environmental standards more stringent than the standards of  some competitor ECAs, the additional project review and mitigation costs  may hurt U.S. exports. Businesses in other OECD countries are also  concerned that disclosure requirements, which the United States proposed  in OECD negotiations, will make sensitive business information public. In  contrast, environmental NGOs in numerous countries have become  interested in ECA environmental review standards as a result of actual or  proposed ECA funding of large potentially environmentally harmful  projects as the Three Gorges Dam in China, the Chad-Cameroon oil  pipeline, and the Camisea gas field development project in Peru. (See app.  III for descriptions of selected ECA projects.)  NGO representatives stated  that ECAs, as public entities, should provide members of the public with  the opportunity to provide input on projects that their governments are  supporting.

For example, most of the countries we visited  require applicants for financing to complete a questionnaire regarding the  potential environmental impacts of their proposed project, which the ECA  uses to categorize the project. Projects likely to have significant adverse  environmental impacts are placed in category A, while projects with  questionable environmental impacts are classified as category B. Most  ECAs place projects with little or no potential environmental impact in  category C. Most ECAs require applicants to complete an environmental  impact assessment if their projects are placed in category A (high risk of  environmental impact).", "ECA projects may be approved despite adverse environmental impacts.  Each ECA we visited relies on the judgment of its experts to evaluate the  overall environmental impact of projects. Moreover, several ECAs,  including Ex-Im Bank, allow their Boards to approve projects,  notwithstanding the results of the environmental review.

Canadian ECA  officials reported that they use standards of the World Bank, World Health  Organization, Canada, and regional development banks as benchmarks in  their reviews.

In addition, OECD committees  operate by consensus. Controversial topics can therefore be blocked by  any single member, as the United States did with the Common Approaches.  While such blocking is considered extreme and rare, according to OECD  officials, it ensures that OECD policies evolve gradually.", "Several specific factors make it difficult to go beyond incremental changes  to the Common Approaches, particularly in areas of interest to the United  States. First, while the United States has sought to negotiate a firm set of  technical standards that all OECD members would have to use in their  reviews, most ECA officials we spoke with prefer to apply a flexible  approach to technical standards. Another, more difficult, obstacle to  surmount is the resistance to disclosing project information. While the  United States has pushed for ex ante disclosure of project information,  other ECG members are either unable or unwilling to do this. In addition,  some other ECG members are unwilling to adopt disclosure practices that  are significantly advanced over their major ECA competitors. For example,  the Canadian ECA pulled back a proposed ex ante disclosure policy once it  was clear that the Common Approaches would not require such a policy,  out of concern that the competitiveness of Canadian exporters might be  compromised.", "A final impediment to achieving a more than incremental advance in the  Common Approaches is the effect of competing pressure on ECAs by both  public interest and business groups. OECD members\u2019 positions on  environmental standards reflect an internal balance achieved in response  to domestic pressure. While nongovernmental organizations in some OECD  countries were successful in getting their governments to push for the start  of negotiations on environmental standards for ECAs, they have been less  successful in achieving their objectives in the negotiations.  Nongovernmental organizations in all the countries we visited are  uniformly displeased with the results of the Common Approaches to date  and are pressing for a broader Common Approaches that includes human  rights, labor, and other social issues as part of the review process.  However, business groups we met with are resistant to expanding the  scope of the Common Approaches. While some ECAs, such as those of the  United Kingdom and Japan, may unilaterally take up these social issues,  most countries in our sample are not yet ready to consider adopting them.  This reluctance occurs primarily because business concerns are  considered of paramount importance to legislators at this point, according  to several experts.", "It will be difficult for the United States to fully achieve the objectives it  sought at the conclusion of the Common Approaches negotiations in 2001.  The United States no longer has the level of influence it had at the start of  the negotiations. This is because the United States did not join the  Common Approaches, which remains a source of resentment, and Ex-Im  Bank no longer has the unique environmental expertise that it once did.  Nevertheless, OECD members see benefits if the United States signs an  OECD agreement. All the ECG members we met with stated that they  would like to see the United States accept the OECD\u2019s Common  Approaches. Some of these officials believe that a formal OECD agreement  will provide ECAs with a stronger basis for improvements and  convergence.

The banks that follow the Equator Principles pledged that they  will screen and categorize projects based on environmental risk. They also  will require environmental assessments demonstrating compliance with  the World Bank guidelines for projects with high or medium environmental  or social risk. While adherence to the Equator Principles is voluntary, it  indicates a growing understanding in the commercial banking sector of the  importance of assessing environmental risk along with credit risk for these  types of projects.

Table 3 illustrates the share of authorized financing to these sectors for  periods before and after the adoption of Ex-Im Bank guidelines. The  proportion of financing to oil and gas development projects stayed about  the same after the implementation of environmental guidelines. Financing  of thermal power plants experienced a drop, and metal mining an increase.", "An additional data limitation is that formal decisions on Ex-Im Bank  projects provide only partial information regarding the impact of  environmental guidelines on projects for several reasons. First, several  companies said they use informal channels to determine whether  environmental issues are likely to be a stumbling block before they submit  final applications and that they might not do so if they anticipated  concerns. Second, projects may be withdrawn or cancelled throughout the  application process for any number of reasons that are not publicly  reported. Finally, some projects that might have been submitted to Ex-Im  Bank in the past may have been withheld because of the belief that Ex-Im  Bank may no longer be willing to approve applications for certain types of  environmentally sensitive projects, although it is impossible to determine  the extent of this phenomenon.", "The Ex-Im Bank Board of Directors reviews the environmental effects of projects on a  case-by-case basis, and may approve a project that does not meet all Ex-Im Bank  environmental guidelines, considering significant mitigating effects and circumstances.

Other  factors include various Ex-Im Bank policies such as domestic content  requirements, its application process and underwriting requirements, and  the terms of coverage its policies provide. Other competitiveness factors  are unrelated to Ex-Im Bank policies, such as foreign exchange rates and  the geographic location of projects. In addition, factors such as the  technological specifications of U.S. exports can be important to sourcing  decisions. For example, one multinational company told us that whether  the host country has 50 cycle or 60 cycle electricity technology is the  overriding factor for determining where their products are going to be  manufactured.", "The potential impacts of ECA environmental guidelines on U.S. exports  depend in part on the overall business structure of the firms seeking ECA  financing. For businesses that produce, or source, their products in the  United States, the implementation of common environmental guidelines  across ECAs should theoretically lower the threat of losing businesses to  other ECAs with lax environmental standards. Since these companies are  generally confined to doing business with Ex-Im Bank, they would  otherwise lose export business if project sponsors select another ECA  instead of Ex-Im Bank; therefore these companies have been the strongest  business advocates for common guidelines. However, multinational  companies may not be affected to the same degree. Officials from several  of the companies we met with stated that as multinational companies they  have been able to get financing from ECAs other than the U.S. Export- Import Bank. These companies are large and flexible enough that they can  seek financing from ECAs in other countries where they have a business  presence if they believe that Ex-lm Bank\u2019s policies, including its  environmental review process, would constitute a significant barrier to  winning a project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Business Groups Have Concerns, but Impacts Are Difficult to Confirm", "paragraphs": ["Business views on ECA environmental guidelines are mixed.

Ex- Im Bank often asks for additional information from the project sponsors  and suppliers to supplement the initial environmental impact assessment  submitted. In our review of 24 thermal power plant, oil and gas  development, and metal mining projects authorized by Ex-Im Bank  between 1995 and 2003, we could not determine if the environmental  assessment caused any project delays claimed by the companies. We found  delays in some instances related to the gathering and submission of  existing documentation to Ex-Im Bank for review and discussion of any  outstanding issues, but the records were insufficient for attributing delays  to environmental reasons as opposed to financial or other issues. We did  find that Ex-Im Bank, in some cases, took measures to limit delays caused  by environmental reviews and requirements. This included sending staff to  review documentation in country, and making project support contingent  on certain documents being provided at a later date.", "Business representatives also cited additional costs as an area of concern,  especially when project costs increased due to modifications necessary to  meet environmental requirements. We found that in some instances Ex-Im  Bank engineering staff did require project modifications to meet Ex-Im  Bank guidelines for the 24 projects we reviewed. For example, a coal-fired  power plant located in China met all of the air quality standards except for  particulate emissions. The Chinese-built pollution control device met local  standards but daily emissions would exceed the Ex-Im Bank guidelines.  The local operator agreed to operate the device at a slightly higher control  efficiency, which reduced emissions sufficiently to meet Ex-Im Bank\u2019s daily  emission limit. Ex-Im Bank officials noted that, as companies have become  more familiar with Ex-Im Bank guidelines, new projects are now much less  likely to require modifications upon review.", "Some businesses are also concerned about other aspects associated with  the environmental review process. Many business representatives we  spoke with believe that their products can readily meet the technical  standards of environmental guidelines. They are concerned, however,  about aspects that may result in lost business. For example, some elements  of Ex-Im Bank\u2019s environmental guidelines require a more qualitative  judgment of project impacts, such as how to mitigate socioeconomic and  sociocultural impacts (such as those associated with the dislocation of  people). However, some business representatives stated that these more  qualitative areas of environmental standards present challenges and risks  to businesses, because of the importance of other parties such as host  governments in making and carrying out commitments.", "Disclosure of project information during environmental review is another  concern for some businesses.  Some companies are concerned that  disclosure of project information may result in their losing business to  competitors if their competitors become aware of a project through the  disclosure process. Other companies were also concerned about the  potential impacts of public scrutiny. One company representative said that  part of the reason the company\u2019s sourcing has shifted to Europe was  because of Ex-Im Bank\u2019s disclosure policy, since European ECAs do not  disclose information prior to project approval, although most did not  identify differences in environmental guidelines as the determining factor  in sourcing decisions.", "We did not find specific examples where the disclosure of project  information had negative impacts. Company representatives we spoke with  did not provide us with any specific cases where they lost business because  of the publication of the environmental impact assessment; their concerns  were primarily hypothetical.
