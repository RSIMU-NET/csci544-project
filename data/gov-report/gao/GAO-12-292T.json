As GAO reported in June 2011, CMS utilizes automated systems and tools to help improve the detection of improper payments for fraudulent, wasteful, and abusive claims. To integrate claims information and improve its ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in these programs, CMS initiated two information technology system programs: the Integrated Data Repository (IDR) and One Program Integrity (One PI). GAO was asked to testify on its earlier report that examined CMS's efforts to protect the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs through the use of information technology. In that prior study, GAO assessed the extent to which IDR and One PI have been developed and implemented, and CMS's progress toward achieving its goals and objectives for using these systems to detect fraud, waste, and abuse."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO previously reported that CMS had developed and begun using both IDR and One PI, but had not incorporated into IDR all data as planned. IDR is intended to be the central repository of Medicare and Medicaid data needed to help CMS and states' program integrity staff and contractors prevent and detect improper payments. Program integrity analysts use these data to identify patterns of unusual activities or transactions that may indicate fraudulent charges or other types of improper payments. IDR has been operational and in use since September 2006 but did not include all the data that were planned to be incorporated by fiscal year 2010. For example, IDR included most types of Medicare claims data, but not the Medicaid data needed to help analysts detect improper payments of Medicaid claims. According to program officials, these data were not incorporated because of obstacles introduced by technical issues and delays in funding. Until the agency finalizes plans and develops reliable schedules for efforts to incorporate these data, CMS may face additional delays in making available all the data that are needed to support enhanced Medicare and Medicaid program integrity efforts. Additionally, CMS had not taken steps to ensure widespread use of One PI to enhance efforts to detect fraud, waste, and abuse. One PI is a web-based portal that is to provide CMS staff and contractors, and Medicaid analysts with a single source of access to data contained in IDR, as well as tools for analyzing those data. While One PI had been developed and deployed to users, no Medicaid analysts and only a few Medicare program integrity analysts were trained and using the system. Specifically, One PI program officials planned for 639 program integrity analysts, including 130 Medicaid analysts, to be using the system by the end of fiscal year 2010; however, as of October 2010, only 41--less than 7 percent--were actively using the portal and tools. According to program officials, the agency's initial training plans were insufficient and, as a result, they were not able to train the intended community of users. Until program officials finalize plans and develop reliable schedules for training users and expanding the use of One PI, the agency may continue to experience delays in reaching widespread use of the system. While CMS had made progress toward its goals to provide a single repository of data and enhanced analytical capabilities for program integrity efforts, the agency was not yet positioned to identify, measure, and track benefits realized from its efforts. As a result, it was unknown whether IDR and One PI as implemented had provided financial benefits. According to IDR officials, they did not measure benefits realized from increases in the detection rate for improper payments because they relied on business owners to do so; One PI officials stated that, because of the limited use of that system, there were not enough data to measure and gauge the program's success toward achieving the $21 billion in financial benefits that the agency projected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations at this time. GAO recommended in June 2011 that CMS take actions to finalize plans and schedules for achieving widespread use of IDR and One PI, and to define measurable benefits.

At your request, my testimony will  focus on our report earlier this year that examined the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) efforts to protect the integrity of  the Medicare and Medicaid programs through the use of information  technology. Specifically, in June 2011 we reported on CMS\u2019s utilization of  automated systems and tools to help improve the detection of fraudulent,  wasteful, and abusive claims that contribute to the billions of taxpayers\u2019  dollars lost each year to improper payments within these programs.", "Operating within the Department of Health and Human Services, CMS  conducts reviews to prevent improper payments before Medicare and  Medicaid claims are paid and to detect claims that were paid in error.  These activities are predominantly carried out by contractors who, along  with CMS personnel, use various information technology solutions to  consolidate and analyze data to help identify the improper payment of  claims. For example, these program integrity analysts may use software  tools to access data about claims and then use those data to identify  patterns of unusual activities by attempting to match services with  patients\u2019 diagnoses.", "In 2006, CMS initiated activities to centralize and make more accessible  the data needed to conduct these analyses and to improve the analytical  tools available to its own and contractor analysts. Our June 2011 report  discussed two of these initiatives\u2014the Integrated Data Repository (IDR),  which is intended to provide a single source of data related to Medicare  and Medicaid claims, and the One Program Integrity (One PI) system, a  web-based portaldata from IDR and enable complex analyses of these data. According to  CMS officials responsible for developing and implementing IDR and One  PI, the agency had spent approximately $161 million on these initiatives  by the end of fiscal year 2010.    and suite of analytical software tools used to extract  My testimony summarizes the results of our prior study, which specifically  assessed the extent to which IDR and One PI had been developed and  implemented, and CMS\u2019s progress toward achieving its goals and  objectives for using these systems to detect fraud, waste, and abuse. The  information presented is based primarily on our previous work at CMS.  Additional information on our scope and methodology is available in the  issued report. We also obtained and conducted a review of more recent  documentation pertaining to the agency\u2019s efforts to develop and  implement the systems. We conducted this work in support of our  testimony during November and December 2011 at CMS headquarters in  Baltimore, Maryland.

For more than a decade,  the agency and its contractors have used automated software tools to  analyze data from various sources to detect patterns of unusual activities  or financial transactions that indicate payments could be made for  fraudulent charges or improper payments. For example, to identify  unusual billing patterns and support investigations and referrals for  prosecutions of cases, analysts and investigators access information  about key actions taken to process claims as they are filed and the  specific details about claims already paid. This would include accessing  information on claims as they are billed, adjusted, and paid or denied;  check numbers on payments of claims; and other specific information that  could help establish provider intent.", "CMS uses many different means to store and manipulate data and, since  the establishment of the agency\u2019s program integrity initiatives in the  1990s, has built multiple disparate databases and analytical software  tools to meet individual and unique needs of various programs within the  agency. In addition, data on Medicaid claims are scattered among the  states in multiple systems and data stores, and are not readily available  to CMS. According to agency program documentation, these  geographically distributed, regional approaches to storing and analyzing  data result in duplicate data and limit the agency\u2019s ability to conduct  analyses of data on a nationwide basis.", "CMS has been working for most of the past decade to consolidate its  disparate data and analytical tools. The agency\u2019s efforts led to the IDR  and One PI programs, which are intended to provide CMS and its  program integrity contractors with a centralized source of Medicare and  Medicaid data and a web-based portal and set of analytical tools by which  these data can be accessed and analyzed to help detect cases of fraud,  waste, and abuse."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Initiative to Develop a Centralized Source of Medicare and Medicaid Data", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, CMS officials expanded the scope of a 3-year-old data  modernization strategy to not only modernize data storage technology,  but also to integrate Medicare and Medicaid data into a centralized  repository so that CMS and its partners could access the data from a  single source. They called the expanded program IDR.", "According to program officials, the agency\u2019s vision was for IDR to become  the single repository for CMS\u2019s data and enable data analysis within and  across programs. Specifically, this repository was to establish the  infrastructure for storing data related to Medicaid and Medicare Parts A,  B, and D claims processing, as well as a variety of other agency  functions, such as program management, research, analytics, and  business intelligence. CMS envisioned an incremental approach to  incorporating data into IDR. Specifically, it intended to incorporate data  related to paid claims for Medicare Part D by the end of fiscal year 2006,  and for Medicare Parts A and B by the end of fiscal year 2007. The  agency also planned to begin to incrementally add all Medicaid data for  the 50 states in fiscal year 2009 and to complete this effort by the end of  fiscal year 2012.", "Initial program plans and schedules also included the incorporation of  additional data from legacy CMS claims-processing systems that store  and process data related to the entry, correction, and adjustment of  claims as they are being processed, along with detailed financial data  related to paid claims. According to program officials, these data, called  \u201cshared systems\u201d data, are needed to support the agency\u2019s plans to  incorporate tools to conduct predictive analysis of claims as they are  being processed, helping to prevent improper payments. Shared systems  data, such as check numbers and amounts related to claims that have  been paid, are also needed by law enforcement agencies to help with  fraud investigations. CMS initially planned to have all the shared systems  data included in IDR by July 2008.", "Table 1, presented in our prior report, summarized CMS\u2019s original  planned dates and actual dates for incorporating the various types of data  into IDR as of the end of fiscal year 2010.", "Also in 2006, CMS initiated the One PI program with the intention of  developing and implementing a portal and software tools that would  enable access to and analysis of claims, provider, and beneficiary data  from a centralized source. The agency\u2019s goal for One PI was to support  the needs of a broad program integrity user community, including agency  program integrity personnel and contractors who analyze Medicare claims  data, along with state agencies that monitor Medicaid claims. To achieve  its goal, CMS officials planned to implement a tool set that would provide  a single source of information to enable consistent, reliable, and timely  analyses and improve the agency\u2019s ability to detect fraud, waste, and  abuse. These tools were to be used to gather data from IDR about  beneficiaries, providers, and procedures and, combined with other data,  find billing aberrancies or outliers. For example, an analyst could use  software tools to identify potentially fraudulent trends in ambulance  services by gathering the data about claims for ambulance services and  medical treatments, and then use other software to determine  associations between the two types of services. If the analyst found  claims for ambulance travel costs but no corresponding claims for  medical treatment, it might indicate that further investigation could prove  that the billings for those services were fraudulent.", "According to agency program planning documentation, the One PI  system was also to be developed incrementally to provide access to IDR  data, analytical tools, and portal functionality. CMS planned to implement  the One PI portal and two analytical tools for use by program integrity  analysts on a widespread basis by the end of fiscal year 2009. The  agency engaged contractors to develop the system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IDR and One PI Were in Use, but Lacked Data and Functionality Essential to CMS\u2019s Program Integrity Efforts", "paragraphs": ["IDR had been in use by CMS and its contractors who conduct Medicare  program integrity analysis since September 2006 and incorporated data  related to claims for reimbursement of services under Medicare Parts A,  B, and D. According to program officials, the integration of these data into  IDR established a centralized source of data previously accessed from  multiple disparate system files.", "However, although the agency had been incorporating data from various  data sources since 2006, our prior report noted that IDR did not include  all the data that were planned to be incorporated by the end of 2010 and  that are needed to support enhanced program integrity initiatives. For  example, IDR did not include the Medicaid data that are critical to  analysts\u2019 ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in this program. While  program officials initially planned to incorporate 20 states\u2019 Medicaid data  into IDR by the end of fiscal year 2010, the agency had not incorporated  any of these data into the repository. Program officials told us that the  original plans and schedules for obtaining Medicaid data did not account  for the lack of funding for states to provide Medicaid data to CMS, or the  variations in the types and formats of data stored in disparate state  Medicaid systems. Consequently, the officials were not able to collect the  data from the states as easily as they expected and did not complete this  activity as originally planned.", "In December 2009, CMS initiated another agencywide program intended  to, among other things, identify ways to collect Medicaid data from the  many disparate state systems and incorporate the data into a single data  store. As envisioned by CMS, this program, the Medicaid and Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program Business Information and Solutions (MACBIS)  program, was to include activities in addition to providing expedited  access to current data from state Medicaid programs. According to  agency planning documentation, as a result of efforts to be initiated under  the MACBIS program, CMS would incorporate Medicaid data for all 50  states into IDR by the end of fiscal year 2014.", "However, program officials had not defined plans and reliable schedules  for incorporating these data into IDR. Until the agency does so, it cannot  ensure that current development, implementation, and deployment efforts  will provide the data and technical capabilities needed to enhance efforts  to detect potential cases of fraud, waste, and abuse.", "In addition to the Medicaid data, initial program integrity requirements  included the incorporation of the shared systems data by July 2008;  however, all of these data had not been added to IDR. According to IDR  program officials, the shared systems data were not incorporated as  planned because funding for the development of the software and  acquisition of the hardware needed to meet this requirement was not  approved until the summer of 2010. Subsequently, IDR program officials  developed project plans and identified user requirements. In updating us  on the status of this activity, the officials told us in November 2011 that  they began incorporating shared systems data in September 2011 and  plan to make them available to program integrity analysts in spring 2012.", "Beyond the IDR initiative, CMS program integrity officials had not taken  appropriate actions to ensure the use of One PI on a widespread basis for  program integrity purposes. According to program officials, the system was  deployed to support Medicare program integrity goals in September 2009  as originally planned and consisted of a portal that provided web-based  access to software tools used by CMS and contractor analysts to retrieve  and analyze data stored in IDR. As implemented, the system provided  access to two analytical tools\u2014a commercial off-the-shelf decision support  tool that is used to perform data analysis to, for example, detect patterns of  activities that may identify or confirm suspected cases of fraud, waste, or  abuse, and another tool that provides users extended capabilities to  perform more complex analyses of data. For example, it allows the user to  customize and create ad hoc queries of claims data across the three  Medicare plans.", "However, while program officials deployed the One PI portal and two  analytical tools, the system was not being used as widely as planned  because CMS and contractor analysts had not received the necessary  training. In this regard, program planning documentation from August  2009 indicated that One PI program officials had planned for 639 analysts  to be trained and using the system by the end of fiscal year 2010,  including 130 analysts who conduct reviews of Medicaid claims.  However, CMS confirmed that by the end of October 2010, only 42  Medicare analysts who were intended to use One PI had been trained,  with 41 actively using the portal and tools. These users represented fewer  than 7 percent of the users originally intended for the program.", "Further, no Medicaid analysts had been trained to use the system. While  the use of One PI cannot be fully optimized for Medicaid integrity  purposes until the states\u2019 Medicaid claims data are incorporated into IDR,  the tools provided by the system could be used to supplement data  currently available to Medicaid program integrity analysts and to enhance  their ability to detect payments of fraudulent claims. For example, with  training, Medicaid analysts may be able to compare data from their state  systems to Medicare claims data in IDR to identify duplicate claims for the  same service.", "Program officials responsible for implementing the system acknowledged  that their initial training plans and efforts had been insufficient and that  they had consequently initiated activities and redirected resources to  redesign the One PI training plan in April 2010; they began to implement  the new training program in July of that year.", "As we reported in June, One PI officials stated that 62 additional analysts  had signed up to be trained in 2011, and that the number of training  classes for One PI had been increased from two to four per month.  Agency officials, in commenting on our report, stated that since January  2011, 58 new users had been trained; however, they did not identify an  increase in the number of actual users of the system.", "Nonetheless, while these activities indicated some progress toward  increasing the number of One PI users, the number of users reported to  be trained and using the system represented a fraction of the population  of 639 intended users. Moreover, One PI program officials had not yet  made detailed plans and developed schedules for completing training of  all the intended users. Agency officials concurred with our conclusion that  CMS needed to take more aggressive steps to ensure that its broad  community of analysts is trained, including those who conduct analyses of  Medicaid claims data. Until it does so, the use of One PI may remain  limited to a much smaller group of users than the agency intended and  CMS will continue to face obstacles in its efforts to deploy One PI for  widespread use throughout its community of program integrity analysts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Was Not Yet Positioned to Identify Financial Benefits or to Fully Meet Program Integrity Goals and Objectives through the Use of IDR and One PI", "paragraphs": ["Because IDR and One PI were not being used as planned, CMS officials  were not in a position to determine the extent to which the systems were  providing financial benefits or supporting the agency\u2019s initiatives to meet  program integrity goals and objectives. As we have reported, agencies  should forecast expected benefits and then measure actual financial  benefits accrued through the implementation of IT programs. Further, the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies to report  progress against performance measures and targets for meeting them  that reflect the goals and objectives of the programs. To do this,  performance measures should be outcome-based and developed with  stakeholder input, and program performance must be monitored,  measured, and compared to expected results so that agency officials are  able to determine the extent to which goals and objectives are being met.  In addition, industry experts describe the need for performance measures  to be developed with stakeholders\u2019 input early in a project\u2019s planning  process to provide a central management and planning tool and to  monitor the performance of the project against plans and stakeholders\u2019  needs.", "While CMS had shown some progress toward meeting the programs\u2019  goals of providing a centralized data repository and enhanced analytical  capabilities for detecting improper payments due to fraud, waste, and  abuse, the implementation of IDR and One PI did not yet position the  agency to identify, measure, and track financial benefits realized from  reductions in improper payments as a result of the implementation of  either system. For example, program officials stated that they had  developed estimates of financial benefits expected to be realized through  the use of IDR. Their projection of total financial benefits was reported to  be $187 million, based on estimates of the amount of improper payments  the agency expected to recover as a result of analyzing data provided by  IDR. With estimated life cycle program costs of $90 million through fiscal  year 2018, the resulting net benefit expected from implementing IDR was  projected to be $97 million. However, as of March 2011, program officials  had not identified actual financial benefits of implementing IDR.", "Further, program officials\u2019 projection of financial benefits expected as a  result of implementing One PI was reported to be approximately $21  billion. This estimate was increased from initial expectations based on  assumptions that accelerated plans to integrate Medicare and Medicaid  data into IDR would enable One PI users to identify increasing numbers  of improper payments sooner than previously estimated, thus allowing the  agency to recover more funds that have been lost due to payment errors.", "However, the implementation of One PI had not yet produced outcomes  that positioned the agency to identify or measure financial benefits. CMS  officials stated at the end of fiscal year 2010\u2014more than a year after  deploying One PI\u2014that it was too early to determine whether the program  had provided any financial benefits. They explained that, since the  program had not met its goal for widespread use of One PI, there were  not enough data available to quantify financial benefits attributable to the  use of the system. These officials said that as the user community  expanded, they expected to be able to begin to identify and measure  financial and other benefits of using the system.", "In addition, program officials had not developed and tracked outcome- based performance measures to help ensure that efforts to implement  One PI and IDR would meet the agency\u2019s goals and objectives for  improving the results of its program integrity initiatives. For example,  outcome-based measures for the programs would indicate improvements  to the agency\u2019s ability to recover funds lost because of improper  payments of fraudulent claims. However, while program officials defined  and reported to OMB performance targets for IDR related to some of the  program\u2019s goals, they did not reflect the goal of the program to provide a  single source of Medicare and Medicaid data that supports enhanced  program integrity efforts. Additionally, CMS officials had not developed  quantifiable measures for meeting the One PI program\u2019s goals. For  example, performance measures and targets for One PI included  increases in the detection of improper payments for Medicare Parts A and  B claims. However, the limited use of the system had not generated  enough data to quantify the amount of funds recovered from improper  payments.", "Moreover, measures of One PI\u2019s program performance did not accurately  reflect the existing state of the program. Specifically, indicators to be  measured for the program included the number of states using One PI for  Medicaid integrity purposes and decreases in the Medicaid payment error  rate; however, One PI did not have access to those data because they  were not yet incorporated into IDR.", "Because it lacked meaningful outcome-based performance measures and  sufficient data for tracking progress toward meeting performance targets,  CMS did not have the information needed to ensure that the systems  were useful to the extent that benefits realized from their implementation  could help the agency meet program integrity goals. Until the agency is  better positioned to identify and measure financial benefits and  establishes outcome-based performance measures to help gauge  progress toward meeting program integrity goals, it cannot be assured  that the systems will contribute to improvements in CMS\u2019s ability to detect  and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, and improper payments of  Medicare and Medicaid claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Needs to Take Actions to Achieve Widespread Use of IDR and One PI", "paragraphs": ["Given the critical need for CMS to reduce improper payments within the  Medicare and Medicaid programs, we included in our June 2011 report a  number of recommended actions that we consider vital to helping the  agency achieve more widespread use of IDR and One PI for program  integrity purposes.
