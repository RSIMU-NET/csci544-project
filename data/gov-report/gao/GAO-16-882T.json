The results of these undercover tests, while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the full population of enrollees.

While inconsistencies between the information provided by the applicant and by government sources are being resolved, marketplaces must determine eligibility using an applicant's attestations and ensure subsidies are provided, if the applicant is qualified to receive them. GAO's undercover testing for the 2015 and 2016 coverage years found that the federal and selected state health-care marketplace's eligibility determination and enrollment process were vulnerable to fraud.", "For the 2015 coverage year, for example, the federal and selected state marketplaces approved each of 10 fictitious applications GAO made for subsidized health-plans. Although 8 of these 10 fictitious applications failed the initial online identity-checking process, all 10 were subsequently approved. Four applications used Social Security numbers that, according to the Social Security Administration, have never been issued. Other applicants obtained duplicate enrollment or obtained coverage by claiming that their employer did not provide insurance that met minimum essential coverage.", "For the 2016 coverage year, the federal and selected state marketplaces initially approved subsidies for 15 fictitious applications. However, three fictitious applicants were unable to put their policies in force because their initial payments were not successfully processed. GAO focused its testing on the remaining 12 applications. For 4 of the 12 applications, GAO used identities from its 2014 testing that had previously obtained subsidized coverage. The 2016 coverage year was the first year in which verification was required to ensure that applicants who previously received a specific type of federal subsidy under the act had filed a federal tax return. This was a condition for these applicants to retain this benefit in 2016. None of the four fictitious applicants had filed a 2014 tax return, but all for were approved for the 2016 subsidies. Marketplace officials told GAO that they allowed applicants to attest to filing taxes if information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicated that the applicant did not file tax returns. Marketplace officials said one reason they allow attestations is the time lag between when tax returns are filed and when they are reflected in IRS's systems. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) officials said they are rechecking 2014 tax-filing status and will remove subsidies for applicants that have not filed a 2014 tax return.", "GAO's review of concentration in the private health-insurance market found that enrollment was concentrated among a small number of health insurance companies (issuers) in most states in 2014, including in the newly established exchanges. On average, in each state and the District of Columbia, 11 or more issuers participated in each of three types of markets\u2014individual, small-group, and large-group\u2014from 2011 through 2014. However, in most states, the 3 largest issuers in each market had at least an 80 percent share of the market during the period. Enrollment through the exchanges was generally more concentrated among a few issuers than was true for the overall markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss enrollment for health-care  coverage obtained through the health-insurance marketplaces, or  exchanges, established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act (PPACA). PPACA subsidies are available to those eligible to  purchase private health-insurance plans from a marketplace who meet  certain income and other requirements. With those subsidies and other  costs, the act represents a significant, long-term fiscal commitment for the  federal government. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the  estimated cost of subsidies and related spending under the act is $56  billion for fiscal year 2017, rising to $106 billion for fiscal year 2026, and  totaling $866 billion for fiscal years 2017\u20132026.", "While subsidies under PPACA are generally not paid directly to enrollees,  participants nevertheless benefit financially through reduced monthly  premiums or lower costs due at time of service, such as copayments.  Because subsidy costs are contingent on who obtains coverage,  enrollment controls that help ensure only qualified applicants are  approved for subsidized coverage are a key factor in determining federal  expenditures under the act. In addition, PPACA provided for the  expansion of the Medicaid program. Under the expansion, states may  choose to provide Medicaid coverage to nonelderly adults who meet  income limits and other criteria. The federal government is to fully  reimburse states through calendar year 2016 for the Medicaid  expenditures of \u201cnewly eligible\u201d individuals who gained Medicaid eligibility  through the expansion. According to the Office of the Actuary of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), federal expenditures  for the Medicaid expansion are estimated at $430 billion from 2014  through 2023.", "The private health-insurance market has historically been highly  concentrated\u2014that is, a small number of issuers in a market enrolled a  significant portion of the people in that market. A highly concentrated  market may indicate a less competitive market and could affect  consumers\u2019 choice of health-plans and their premiums. PPACA contained  a number of provisions that took effect in 2014 and could affect market  concentration among health issuers.", "My statement will summarize the findings of three recently issued reports   and will (1) describe the results of our undercover testing of eligibility and  enrollment controls for the federal Health Insurance Marketplace  (Marketplace) and selected state-based marketplaces for the 2015 and  2016 coverage years, and (2) discuss findings from our review of private  health-insurance market concentration in three markets: individual, small- group, and large-group.", "For our report in which we conducted undercover testing for the 2015  coverage year, we submitted, or attempted to submit, 18 fictitious  applications by telephone and online. Ten of these applications tested  controls related to obtaining subsidized coverage available through the  federal Marketplace in New Jersey and North Dakota, and through state- based marketplaces in California and Kentucky. We chose these states  based partly on range of population and whether the state had expanded  Medicaid eligibility under PPACA. The other 8 applications tested controls  for determining Medicaid eligibility.", "For our report in which we conducted undercover testing for the 2016  coverage year, we submitted 15 fictitious applications for subsidized  coverage through the federal Marketplace in Virginia and West Virginia  and through the state-based marketplace in California.

Under PPACA, states may elect to operate their own health-insurance  marketplaces, known as state-based marketplaces, or they may rely on  the federal Marketplace, known to the public as HealthCare.gov. These  marketplaces were intended to provide a single point of access for  individuals to enroll in private health-plans, apply for income-based  subsidies to offset the cost of these plans\u2014which, as noted, are paid  directly to health-insurance issuers\u2014and, as applicable, obtain an  eligibility determination or assessment of eligibility for other health- coverage programs, such as Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program.

To be eligible for Medicaid,  individuals must meet federal requirements regarding residency, U.S.  citizenship or immigration status, and income limits, as well as any  additional state-specific criteria that may apply.", "Marketplaces are required by PPACA to verify application information to  determine eligibility for enrollment and, if applicable, determine eligibility  for the income-based subsidies or Medicaid. These verification steps  include validating an applicant\u2019s Social Security number, if one is  provided; verifying citizenship, status as a U.S. national, or lawful  presence by comparison with Social Security Administration or  Department of Homeland Security records; and verifying household  income with tax-return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as  well as data on Social Security benefits from the Social Security  Administration.", "Under PPACA\u2019s eligibility verification process, \u201cinconsistencies\u201d are  generated when individual applicant information does not match federal  data sources\u2014either because information an applicant provided does not  match information contained in data sources that a marketplace uses for  eligibility verification at the time of application, or because such  information is not available. If there is an application inconsistency, the  marketplace is to determine eligibility using the applicant\u2019s attestations  and ensure that subsidies are provided on behalf of the applicant, if  qualified to receive them, while the inconsistency is being resolved. Under  the marketplace process, applicants may be asked to provide additional  information or documentation for the marketplaces to review to resolve  the inconsistencies.", "In addition to the two related reports discussed in this statement, we have  issued a body of work in which we examined enrollment and verification  controls of the federal and state marketplaces. For example, in February  2016, we issued a report addressing CMS enrollment controls and the  agency\u2019s management of enrollment fraud risk. That report included eight  recommendations to CMS to strengthen its oversight of the federal  Marketplace. CMS concurred with our recommendations, and  implementation is pending.", "In terms of concentration in the private health-insurance market, in  December 2014 we reported that, from 2010 through 2013, enrollment in  most states was concentrated among the largest issuers in each of the  three types of health-insurance markets: the large-group market (under  which individuals obtain coverage through a group plan maintained by  large employers), the small-group market (under which individuals obtain  coverage through a group plan maintained by small employers), and the  individual market (coverage sold directly to individual consumers other  than in connection with a group health-plan).", "As mentioned above, PPACA contained provisions that could affect  market concentration among health issuers. For example, the law  required the establishment of individual health-insurance exchanges, as  well as Small Business Health Options Programs (\u201cSHOPs\u201d), within each  state by 2014. These exchanges are a new type of market where  eligible individuals and small employers, respectively, can compare and  select among qualified insurance plans offered by participating issuers.", "PPACA does not require issuers to offer plans through these exchanges  but instead generally relies on market incentives to encourage their  participation. Issuers seeking to offer a health plan in an individual  exchange or SHOP must first have that plan approved by the exchange in  the state. About a third of the states chose to operate their exchanges in  2014 and approved issuers for participation. In the remaining states  electing not to establish and operate their own exchange, PPACA  required HHS to carry out these responsibilities. As reported in August  2014, most of the largest issuers holding the majority of the market in the  2012 individual and small-group markets participated in the 2014  exchanges, although most of the numerous smaller issuers in those  markets did not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Marketplaces Approved Subsidized Coverage for the 2015 Coverage Year for 17 of 18 of our Fictitious Applicants", "paragraphs": ["Our undercover testing for the 2015 coverage year found that the health- care marketplace eligibility determination and enrollment process for  qualified health-plans\u2014that is, coverage obtained from private insurers\u2014 was vulnerable to fraud.
