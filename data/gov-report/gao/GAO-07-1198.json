The U.S. interprets the Declaration as a political statement that recognizes the severity of public health crises while affirming the importance of IP protection. It maintains that the Declaration neither changes existing TRIPS obligations, nor creates new rights and does not assigns public health greater priority than IP protection. U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) says the Declaration clarifies flexibilities already in TRIPS, including the flexibility to compulsorily license patents under certain circumstances. USTR recognizes these as being allowed for WTO members, including those facing public health crises, but only in a fashion that will not unduly harm patent holders. Some developing countries assert they provide broad discretion to ensure access to medicines when IP regulations present barriers to affordable care. USTR balances respect for the Doha Declaration with TPA's other two IP negotiating objectives by actively promoting high levels of IP protection for pharmaceuticals while making targeted allowances for developing country partners. USTR believes that this longstanding U.S. pursuit of high IP protections for pharmaceuticals creates incentives for investment in research and development of new treatments, ultimately enhancing public health. With regard to the TPA objective of respecting the Doha Declaration, USTR's key policy change was to not insist upon two provisions it sees as relevant to the Declaration in FTAs with developing country trading partners. Otherwise, USTR has continued to pursue other pharmaceutical related IP protections that it does not consider related to the Doha Declaration. Reactions to USTR's record are mixed. The pharmaceutical industry considers these types of FTA provisions critical for preserving incentives for research and innovation. However, some academics, experts, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and generic producers have expressed concerns that these provisions may delay entry by cheaper generic products. In response to similar concerns in Congress, a bipartisan agreement was reached with the Administration to revise four recent FTA's prior to their submission for Congressional approval. U.S. interagency and private sector input into trade negotiations related to public health have remained limited since Congress enacted TPA. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other agencies generally endorse USTR's view that strong IP protection promotes public health and access to medicines, and interagency input has been primarily technical in nature. Within the formal private sector trade advisory system, a public health representative was recently added to 2 of the 16 private sector advisory committees, but not until USTR had concluded nine trade agreements. USTR did obtain some public health views through other formal and informal means during this period."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An international effort led by the United States in the 1980s to incorporate  An international effort led by the United States in the 1980s to incorporate  intellectual property (IP) protection into the trading system culminated  intellectual property (IP) protection into the trading system culminated  with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related  with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1995.

In addition, we examined trends and patterns found in USTR\u2019s  annual reports identifying foreign countries that deny adequate and  effective protection of IP rights.

The Federal government, primarily through the National  Institutes of Health (NIH), conducts and supports medical research,  investing annually over $28 billion. About 55 percent of NIH\u2019s budget  supports basic research. While basic research may not have an immediate  impact on drug innovation, such \u201cuntargeted\u201d research often ultimately  leads to developing new medicines and technologies.", "In principle, U.S. intellectual protection laws are designed to support  innovation. Patents are considered to be especially valuable for  innovations in pharmaceuticals. According to the pharmaceutical  industry, IP protection is crucial to its ability to offer new, innovative  medicines. Research and development of new drugs is very risky and time- consuming. The industry faces high fixed or \u201csunk\u201d costs associated with  lengthy discovery and clinical trials. Moreover, a large proportion of new  drugs never make it to market due to their lack of efficacy or inadequate  safety. Thus, drug companies seek a relatively high return on the  medicines they do bring to market. U.S. patents give companies a 20-year  period during which they have an exclusive right to make, sell, and use  their invention. They use this period when they cannot be undercut by  competitors to charge relatively higher prices, thus allowing them to  recoup their investments and earn profits. However, the effective life of a  patent is typically much shorter than this 20-year period, since the  preclinical and clinical testing phases necessary for securing FDA  marketing approvals can take more than a decade.", "Public policy has also played a role in fostering generic competition to  hold down prices. Generic drugs--copies of brand-name drugs--can enter  the market after the brand-name\u2019s patent or other market exclusivities  expire and FDA approval is granted. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act of  1984, generic manufacturers do not have to repeat expensive research and  clinical trials to obtain approval. Instead, they only need to show the FDA  that their drugs are bioequivalent to the branded medicines. Because they  do not incur the same research and clinical trial expenditures, generic  firms can enter the market more quickly once patents have expired and  sell drugs at lower prices. Generic entry may also put pressure on  innovator companies to develop more new drugs.", "Governments have also taken collective and individual steps to provide  medicines\u2014particularly since 2001. At the global level, funds for  combating HIV/AIDS through the Global Fund to Combat AIDS,  Tuberculosis and Malaria, established in 2003, and UNAIDS, established in  1994, have grown considerably since 2001. Among other things, the United  States established the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or  PEPFAR, a 5-year, $15 billion initiative run by the Office of the Global  AIDS Coordinator at State, which has supported HIV prevention activities,  antiretroviral treatment and training, and HIV-related care and training at  more than 15,000 project sites primarily in 15 focus countries, mainly in  sub-Saharan Africa. More affluent developing countries, such as Brazil  and Thailand, have themselves been taking more aggressive steps to  combat AIDS and improve access, including universal access schemes  paid for with public funds.", "Some of these government efforts have been undertaken with private  sector support. The research-based pharmaceutical industry has engaged  in private-public partnerships to address neglected diseases found in poor  countries, such as tuberculosis and malaria. Research-based  pharmaceutical companies have also instituted pricing schemes whereby  the same drug is sold at different prices, depending on the consumer\u2019s or  country\u2019s ability to pay. Ensuring that the supply remains in the intended  market, not resold elsewhere, is critical to this strategy\u2019s success, but can  be problematic.

This matters: WHO  estimates that over 10.5 million lives a year could be saved by 2015 by  scaling up access to existing interventions for infectious diseases,  maternal and child health, and noncommunicable diseases. Indeed, WHO  says unaffordable prices of medicine and the need for new medicines for  diseases that disproportionately affect lower income populations are  among the primary challenges in expanding access to medicines globally.  According to WHO, in developing countries today, medicines account for  up to 70 percent of health care expenditure.

Moreover, the United States  argued using compulsory licensing as a mechanism for directing industrial  policy or protecting domestic industries against foreign competition would  be contrary to the letter and purpose of TRIPS.", "In addition, USTR emphasizes that while the declaration is clear that  members can determine the grounds for compulsory licensing, they still  must meet certain conditions articulated in TRIPS article 31. These are  aimed at protecting the legitimate interests of the patent holder when  circumstances allow compulsory licensing and government use of a patent  without the authorization of the patent holder.

Data exclusivity grants a company the exclusive  use of its safety and efficacy test data, necessary to obtain marketing  approval, for a fixed period after the marketing launch. Data exclusivity is  one method by which the innovator company can recoup the costs  involved with conducting clinical tests necessary for marketing approval,  as well as the considerable costs associated with developing a new drug.  Industry representatives explained that they consider patent protection  and data exclusivity to be separate but complementary protections. Both  can generally provide a period of exclusivity. Consequently, data  exclusivity may effectively grant another layer of market exclusivity for  the new product. Figure 3 contains three scenarios of how the periods of  data exclusivity and patent protection can interact to create market  exclusivity under U.S. law.", "Some time after the initial drug development takes place, the company  applies for a patent and the 20-year patent term begins. During the patent  term, the company completes all of the drug trials necessary to obtain the  safety and efficacy data needed for marketing approval by the FDA. After  approval is granted, the company can begin marketing its drug, and the set  period of data exclusivity period begins. Industry representatives noted  that the data exclusivity period generally is concurrent with the patent  period and therefore does not add any additional period of effective  market exclusivity, as shown in the first scenario in figure 3. However, as  shown in the second scenario, if marketing approval is obtained further  into the patent term, the 5-year data exclusivity period, which begins when  marketing approval is granted, can extend beyond the term of the patent.  As shown in the third scenario, when no patent protection exists, data  exclusivity effectively provides the entire market exclusivity period.", "Pharmaceutical industry representatives stated that the first scenario is  the most typical, with the data exclusivity running concurrently with  patent protection. However, they noted that there are many instances in  which companies do not obtain patents on their products (particularly for  small markets), or patent protection is inadequate or poorly enforced. In  these situations, data exclusivity ensures the innovator company a 5-year  period of market exclusivity. The pharmaceutical industry believes that, in  cases in which there is no patent or very little patent life remains when the  drug first enters the market, data exclusivity is critical because without an  effective market exclusivity period, incentives to research and develop  new drugs are diminished.", "Pharmaceutical industry representatives have also advocated for patent  term extensions in FTAs. It is common for a substantial portion of the  patent life to be spent running drug trials. Therefore, the industry argues  that patent term extensions ensure that innovators get enough time to  recoup their costs and maintain the incentives for future innovation. In  addition, industry representatives noted that, in many developing  countries, the delays associated with getting a patent or obtaining  marketing approval for a new drug can be far more extensive than in the  United States. They argue that, under these circumstances, it is even more  critical that a safeguard mechanism exists to ensure that these delays do  not undermine the intentions of patent protection.", "Patent linkage is also considered important by the pharmaceutical  industry. Patent linkage provisions in the FTAs provide for delay of  marketing approval if a generic drug product is covered by an unexpired  patent. Pharmaceutical companies claim that generic companies routinely  launch patent-infringing products during the life of a patent in many  developing countries and that patent linkage would help to minimize this  problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Experts and NGOs Believe USTR\u2019s Continued Promotion of Data Exclusivity, Patent Term Extensions, and Patent Linkage Conflicts with the Principles of the Doha Declaration", "paragraphs": ["Some experts and NGOs believe that these provisions impair access to  medicines and therefore are contrary to the \u201cspirit\u201d of the Doha  Declaration and TPA guidance. These NGOs, academics, and generic  pharmaceutical producers believe that these provisions limit generic  competition, thereby maintaining high prices for pharmaceutical products,  ultimately impairing access to medicines. These concerns have been  extensively discussed and documented by academics, international  organizations, think tanks, NGOs, and public health groups. Since many  FTA partners implemented these pharmaceutical-related IP provisions for  the first time very recently, it is difficult to identify the tangible effect of  these provisions. However, these groups believe that the inclusion of these  provisions has the potential to decrease public health and therefore is  contrary to the spirit and principles and goal of the Doha Declaration.", "Many NGOs argue that the data exclusivity provisions included in U.S.  FTAs will damage access to medicines and public health and worry that  there might be instances where the data exclusivity period could extend  beyond the length of the patent term, as in figure 3, scenario 2. This data  exclusivity period effectively delays entry of generics onto the market,  thereby maintaining monopoly prices for a longer period of time. While  some NGOs recognize that it would be rare for the data exclusivity period  to extend beyond the patent term, they are worried that if this situation  occurs, generic competition will be delayed because of the presence of  data exclusivity. In addition, where the innovator of a new drug did not  obtain a patent in that country, either because it did not apply or because  the new drug was not patentable, data exclusivity will effectively give the  innovator a patent-like period of marketing exclusivity for the entire  period of data exclusivity, from the time marketing approval is granted  (see figure 3, scenario 3). NGOs are also concerned that data exclusivity  provisions might prevent the marketing of generic drugs produced under a  compulsory license. For instance, if a compulsory license is granted to a  generic producer, but that producer is not able to rely on the data  generated by the innovator company to obtain needed marketing approval,  it will not be possible to distribute the drugs under a compulsory license.", "Some experts and NGOs are also concerned that variations in the data  exclusivity periods across countries could further delay generic entry. An  FTA partner country must normally provide 5 years of data exclusivity to  the innovator once the product receives marketing approval. If the  innovator waited to apply for marketing approval in the FTA partner  country, thereby delaying the start date of its market exclusivity period, it  would effectively extend the overall market exclusivity period beyond the  intended 5 years. Some FTAs have addressed this issue by specifying that  a country may require the innovator to apply for marketing approval in its  country within a specified period of time. For instance, in the CAFTA-DR  agreement, at their request, a Party may require that the innovator seek  marketing approval in that Party within 5 years after obtaining marketing  approval in any other territory in order to receive data exclusivity. This  way, the innovator company can only delay the start date of its data  exclusivity period by a fixed period of time.", "Patent term extension provisions in FTAs have also led to questions about  their effect on access to medicines. Many NGOs and generic  pharmaceutical producers believe that the 20-year patent term in TRIPS  creates a balance between access and innovation and that extending the  patent period would have a detrimental effect on generic competition.  They are also concerned that the patent term extension provisions in U.S.  FTAs do not contain the same limits present in U.S. law. For instance,  under U.S. law, innovators cannot receive more than 14 years of patent  protection through a patent term extension after they have received  market approval, and in any case, the maximum period of extension  determined on the basis of the regulatory review period cannot exceed 5  years. This limit on patent term extensions is not present in FTAs.", "Some also assert that patent linkage might negatively affect access to  medicines. The patent linkage process in the United States involves  numerous steps and actors, designed to enable resolution of patent  disputes before marketing approval is granted for a generic drug product.  As shown in figure 4, this linkage system places the burden on the private  companies, not the regulatory authority, to monitor the patent system.", "Specifically, the U.S. patent linkage system puts the onus on the generic  company producer to provide information on the applicability of an  existing patent to the drug product for which it is seeking marketing  approval. If the generic company decides to challenge the patent, it must  notify the patent holder within a specified period of time in order to give  the patent holder the chance to sue and defend the patent in the courts.  When the patent litigation is resolved, the FDA can grant marketing  approval to the generic company if the patent is overturned, and may be  obliged to wait until the patent expires if the generic drug product is found  to infringe the patent and the patent is not found to be invalid. NGOs and  generic pharmaceutical producers are concerned that developing  countries do not have the same set of protocols laid out in the FTA  agreement or in their laws, and that this will ultimately affect access to  medicines. Generic pharmaceutical representatives argue that countries  might experience regular abuses and delays in the introduction of generic  drugs if they are unable to institute an effective linkage process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Concern over IP Provisions and Access to Medicines Addressed in Bipartisan Trade Deal", "paragraphs": ["Certain Members of Congress have expressed concern over the  pharmaceutical-related IP provisions in FTAs with developing countries,  and this concern was recently addressed through a bipartisan compromise  between Congress and the administration.

According to these officials, the selection committee also tried to ensure  that the representatives would make meaningful contributions to the  committees and have the weight necessary to challenge the committees  when necessary.

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of  America (PhRMA), the pharmaceutical industry trade group, has  submitted annual reports to USTR on industry concerns about IP rights  globally for the agency to consider in developing its Special 301 report.  Both pharmaceutical industry representatives and public health  community members have also provided input on IP rights and public  health concerns for several FTAs that have been concluded through  USTR\u2019s formal public hearings and the Federal Register comments. In  addition, USTR has received and responded to congressional  correspondence regarding members\u2019 public health concerns about the  impact of FTAs. According to USTR officials, while there are some minor  modifications to FTA texts during each negotiation, the public health  community is aware of the provisions the United States proposes to be  included in each agreement, given past FTAs implemented, and may also  provide public health input through more informal mechanisms. For  example, USTR has received and responded to some informal input on  public health in trade negotiations through correspondence with NGOs.  Moreover, USTR officials noted that they have an open door policy and  will meet with anyone who requests a meeting, including NGOs, public  health representatives, and generic industry representatives. Both USTR  and private sector representatives, including NGOs, have confirmed that  private sector representatives have provided informal input to USTR on  public health concerns, in particular FTAs, through phone calls or  requested meetings.

Other than making concessions on  compulsory licensing and parallel importation provisions, and on side  letters that state that the IP chapter does not affect a country\u2019s ability to  take necessary public health measures, USTR has not changed its  uniformly high demands with regard to IP protection in its FTAs. The  degree to which USTR\u2019s policy has achieved the right balance of IP  protection and attention to public health, and more specifically whether it  has respected the Doha Declaration as called for under TPA, depends in  part on the stakeholder asking the question. This reflects a fundamental  tension between protecting IP rights in order to allow companies to  recoup investment and encourage innovation for the long term, and  allowing competitors to sell lower cost drugs for short term public health  needs.

We also reviewed academic studies, pharmaceutical  industry reports, position papers, and media reports. Specifically, we  examined relevant WTO legal documents, including the declaration on  TRIPS and Public Health; the 2003 General Council Chairperson\u2019s  statement; the August 30, 2003, General Council Decision on the  Implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and  Public Health; the December 6, 2005, General Council Decision on the  Amendment of TRIPS; and relevant articles of the TRIPS agreement. We  reviewed WTO TRIPS Council minutes and other official documents,  reviewed USTR official documents, interviewed USTR officials in  Washington and Geneva, and interviewed WTO officials and WTO country  representatives in Geneva.", "To investigate how the United States negotiates and oversees  implementation of IP provisions related to pharmaceuticals in its trade  agreements, we interviewed USTR officials, reviewed agency documents,  and examined the text of the FTAs negotiated since the Trade Act of 2002.  We spoke to USTR officials about their views on the three IP negotiating  objectives in TPA and their overall approach for pursuing these objectives.  Specifically, we learned about the pharmaceutical provisions pursued by  USTR in the IP chapter of its FTAs, and how the pursuit of these  provisions relates to their negotiating approach. We also reviewed agency  documentation of negotiating policy, draft texts of FTAs, and other types  of documentation in order to further examine the IP negotiating policy  pursued by USTR. In order to analyze the patterns and results of USTR\u2019s  stated approach, we reviewed the text of each of the 11 FTAs negotiated  under TPA. We evaluated the pharmaceutical-related IP provisions in each  agreement and catalogued which related provisions were present in the  final text of each agreement. Using this information, we were able to  identify patterns and thereby confirm USTR\u2019s stated policy regarding the  pursuit of these provisions. We did not assess the reliability of the per  capita income data contained in figure 2 because we are providing them as  background information only.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from Department of State,  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of  Commerce, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and the U.S. Agency  for International Development (USAID) in order to obtain their  perspectives on the pharmaceutical provisions pursued in the FTAs. We  performed literature reviews of articles and studies documenting the  multiple opinions regarding these provisions pursued by USTR. From this  literature review and from agency meetings, we identified numerous  stakeholders and experts to speak with, including pharmaceutical industry  representatives, public health groups, NGOs, academics, and IP experts.  These groups include Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of  America (PhRMA), Generic Pharmaceutical Association, (GPhA), The  International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations  (IFPMA), Oxfam, Doctors without Borders (MSF), Essential Information,  Consumer Project on Technology, Health Global Access Project (GAP),  Health Action International, Center for Policy Analysis on Trade and  Health (CPATH), Access to Drugs Initiative (ADI), Third World Network,  Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), International Center  for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD), Drugs for Neglected  Diseases Initiative (DNDI), as well as three academics, two intellectual  property lawyers, and three public health experts specializing in this area.  We interviewed these stakeholders and experts in order to gather a  complete perspective on USTR\u2019s negotiating strategy and the  pharmaceutical-related IP provisions present in the FTAs. We also traveled  to Geneva, Switzerland, to meet with officials from the U.S. Mission in  Geneva; World Trade Organization (WTO); World Health Organization  (WHO); World Intellectual Property Organization; The Joint United  Nations Program on HIV/AIDS; United Nations Development Program; the  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as NGOs  from the pharmaceutical sector and public health community.", "In order to examine how USTR implements and oversees its trade  agreements, we interviewed USTR officials, reviewed agency  documentation, and analyzed USTR\u2019s annual Special 301 reports. We  spoke to USTR officials and reviewed agency documentation about their  approach to implementing and overseeing its trade agreements. In  addition, we examined trends and patterns of citations found in USTR\u2019s  annual Special 301 reports in order to analyze how USTR oversees its  trade agreements with respect to IP provisions related to pharmaceuticals.  We reviewed each Special 301 report from 2000 to 2007 in order to identify  every mention of a pharmaceutical-related issue for all countries listed on  the priority watch list, the watch list, and the Section 306 list. For each  country listed in the report in every given year, we noted whether the  report mentioned anything related to a pharmaceutical issue or concern.  We reviewed the reports using decision rules we developed to identify the  most frequently discussed pharmaceutical issues in Special 301 reports  over this period. To enhance the accuracy and soundness of our review,  two GAO staff members conducted independent reviews of the reports.  These staff members had a high degree of concurrence in the  pharmaceutical issues they identified and were able to reconcile the  instances where they differed initially. We also interviewed USTR officials  about some of the factors considered during the Special 301 process in  order to determine limitations to our analysis. Limitations to our analysis  include the inherent selection bias in the USTR reports, since the Special  301 report does not capture each IP concern in every country. Also, there  are numerous factors governing a country\u2019s inclusion, but USTR generally  focuses on countries with relatively higher levels of development. The  analysis is also limited to only pharmaceutical-related issues raised in the  Special 301 report over this period and does not capture the weight of  each concern. In addition, pharmaceutical counterfeiting may be  undercounted in this analysis due to the fact that it may be subsumed into  more general references to trademark counterfeiting and inadequate  enforcement. We also obtained and compared the input provided to USTR  by U.S. embassies and the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, we spoke  to USTR officials about the factors taken into account for the 2007 Special  301 report, specifically regarding the decision of Thailand and Brazil to  issue compulsory licenses on pharmaceutical products.", "To investigate how USTR assists other countries in implementing FTAs  and TRIPS obligations, we interviewed agencies involved in providing  technical assistance to FTA partner and nonpartner countries, including  USTR, HHS, PTO, and USAID. We spoke with agency officials about the  type of technical assistance they provide on the FTAs, Doha Declaration  flexibilities, and public health and about the audience receiving the  assistance. We also reviewed technical assistance and training-related  documents and correspondence to corroborate the testimonial evidence.", "In order to evaluate the extent of formal and informal IP and public health  input into USTR\u2019s trade agreement negotiations, we examined the formal  interagency advisory process, the formal industry advisory committee  process, and several informal means for providing input to USTR. To  examine the level of interagency consultation on trade, IP, and public  health issues between USTR and the Department of State, HHS,  Department of Commerce, PTO, and USAID, we reviewed documentation  of interagency discussions related to the TRIPS Doha Declaration and  FTAs. Limited documentation was available.  We also interviewed USTR,  Commerce, HHS, State, PTO, and USAID officials about their roles in the  interagency advisory process and the public health input they provided or  received during WTO discussions on the TRIPS and Public Health  Declaration and during FTA negotiations.", "To evaluate the type and extent of public health input USTR received  through the industry trade advisory process, we reviewed industry  advisory committee reports for the IP and chemicals committees, as well  as the trade and environment committee. We also evaluated the  membership of the IP and chemicals industry advisory committees to  determine the composition of industries and interests represented.  However, we did not make any judgments about the appropriateness of  any particular committee\u2019s composition. In addition, to better understand  the selection and appointment process for the public health  representatives on the IP and chemicals industry advisory committees, we  interviewed USTR, Commerce, and HHS officials and reviewed  documentation related to the representatives\u2019 appointments. We also  spoke with the primary NGO involved in the initial request for public  health representation on the industry advisory committees, as well as  several other NGO and academic members of the public health  community, about their views on the public health representative  appointments. Moreover, we interviewed selected members of the trade  and environment committee, to obtain perspectives on the advisory  process and public health input provided to USTR through it.  Furthermore, we reviewed records of USTR\u2019s public hearings on FTAs,  Federal Register notice comments, and congressional and private sector  correspondence with USTR on the FTAs and the issues of IP rights and  public health. We also spoke with several NGOs about public health input  they provided to USTR through meetings and phone calls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Technical Assistance on IP Rights and Public Health", "paragraphs": ["Technical assistance on IP rights and public health to FTA partner and  nonpartner governments has been limited and provided mostly upon host  country request. According to USTR officials, U.S. negotiators review each  FTA provision in the text with the signatories, at which time they may also  ask for technical assistance. Also, FTA partner countries always have the  option of requesting trade-capacity building assistance from the United  States at the conclusion of negotiations. However, USTR has never had a  request for TCB on the Doha Declaration, and only on IP matters related to  enforcement. USTR does not initiate technical assistance on FTA  provisions and the use of TRIPS flexibilities, but responds to country  requests, which it forwards to the appropriate agency. U.S. agencies tend  to provide technical advice to FTA partner governments on regulatory  issues, rather than public health issues. For example, the FDA has  provided technical assistance to partner countries in developing  implementing regulatory measures. Similarly, technical assistance  activities conducted by USAID and PTO include conferences, workshops,  capacity-building cooperation agreements, and patent program certificate  programs on topics such as international IP standards in TRIPS, drafting  trade reform legislation, and enforcement of IP rights. Specific IP issues  discussed include data exclusivity, patent extensions, and implications of  FTA IP rights commitments.", "According to USAID officials, USAID can provide technical assistance if  the host country has requested assistance in a particular area. Although  FTAs have helped promote training in the area of intellectual property and  public health, the agency has not done much work on those topics. USAID  officials said that most training occurs during FTA negotiations, but FTA  partner countries often receive the training from WTO or another third  party in order to gain a more objective training or perspective than they  believe they would receive from the United States. Similarly, according to  PTO officials, most requested PTO training is with respect to FTA  agreements and primarily focuses on the implementation and enforcement  of FTA provisions, and the audience is generally patent examiners  conducting enforcement activities. The PTO Global IP Academy,  established in 2005, is another example of PTO\u2019s technical assistance on IP  matters to other countries, whereby PTO trains foreign officials on IP  enforcement. The agency also advises countries on drafting implementing  legislation and the development of compliance regulations.", "Agencies also provide general technical assistance to countries on TRIPS  obligations. For example, Commerce\u2019s Commercial Law Development  Program, which receives some funding from USAID, has provided training  to Pakistan on TRIPS and the role of U.S. agencies in domestic patent and  data protection. However, according to USTR, most requests related to  TRIPS IP issues fall in nonpharmaceutical IP areas, such as trademark  registration, enhancing patent processing, or enforcement capacity. PTO  officials stated that they offered a course on biotechnology that covered  all aspects of patent, copyright, and trademark WTO provisions. The State  Department has also provides a standard training on IP rights to U.S.  Foreign Service Officers through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), which  includes basic information on patents, data protection, and other U.S. and  TRIPS IP provisions. The training also provides an overview of the Doha  Declaration and TRIPS flexibilities, including the use of compulsory  licenses, as well as a summary of the U.S. government\u2019s objectives for  access to medicines.", "While there has been no proactive agency effort to assist countries in using  the Doha Declaration TRIPS flexibilities, agencies have developed and  provided some information upon request. USAID has worked closely with  USTR to develop such U.S.-sponsored training that is TRIPS compliant and  has recently added discussion about the Doha Declaration and the  implementation of compulsory licensing into training on the use of TRIPS  flexibilities. For instance, USAID funded a presentation in Lebanon on  TRIPS implementation in response to requests for assistance with its WTO  accession. In addition, USAID technical assistance projects were  implemented in Egypt related to IP rights and public health, including a  conference on IP and pharmaceuticals that covered TRIPS, the Doha  Declaration, compulsory licensing, and data exclusivity, under the  auspices of the prime minister and minister of health. Similarly, USAID  presented in Uganda a workshop on Developments at Doha, including  TRIPS and public health, as part of assistance taking place in December  2001 and January - February 2002. USTR stated that Honduras also  conferred with the United States about how to use the paragraph six  waiver to issue a compulsory license, but the drug was not under patent  and training was ultimately not necessary. PTO has also conducted  training on relevant IP provisions, including on U.S. laws and regulations  related to data exclusivity and patent linkage, in response to country  requests. PTO officials emphasized, however, that it is not PTO\u2019s role to  ensure that these countries implement the provisions in the same manner  as the United States. In fact, PTO makes an effort to understand the  country\u2019s legal context and capacity so that its advice is appropriate to its  circumstances.", "In addition, U.S. agencies offer some assistance related to technology  transfer, which is referred to in paragraph seven of the Doha Declaration  on TRIPS and Public Health.  For example, HHS provides significant  assistance to developing countries though its technology transfer  activities.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed  innovative programs to improve how technologies are transferred to  developing countries, particularly by identifying those biomedical research  companies and institutions that have the interest and capacity to receive  and develop new biomedical products.  According to HHS officials, NIH  has one of the largest biomedical technology transfer offices in the world.   NIH\u2019s Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) has successfully transferred  technologies, mostly for infectious disease diagnosis, treatment and  prevention, to institutions in developing countries such as India, Mexico,  Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa and currently is working with  institutions in other developing countries.  NIH OTT has also initiated a  limited international technology transfer capacity building program to  train scientists and managers from institutions in developing countries  about intellectual property management and other technology transfer- related matters.  Similarly, USAID is involved in some technology transfer  assistance.
