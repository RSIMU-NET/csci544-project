IRS budgeted more than $2 billion for these activities in 2013. The filing season is also when IRS begins collecting delinquent taxes by, for example, approving installment agreements and checking for non-filers. GAO was asked to review the 2013 tax filing season. This report (1) assesses IRS's performance in processing tax returns and providing services to taxpayers; (2) describes the installment agreement process and assesses its efficiency; and (3) describes the process for detecting and notifying non-filers. To conduct the analyses, GAO obtained and compared IRS data from 2007 through 2013, reviewed pertinent IRS documents, observed IRS operations, and interviewed IRS officials and experts in tax administration, including tax preparation firms."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Despite efficiency gains from processing more tax returns electronically, adding website services, and shifting resources from enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was unable to keep up with demand for telephone and correspondence services. Access to IRS's telephone assistors remained at 68 percent from 2012. The percentage of overage paper correspondence (over 45 days old) increased to 47 percent from 40 percent in 2012. In the face of similar trends, last year GAO reported that a dramatic revision in IRS's taxpayer service strategy was needed and recommended IRS take steps to better balance demand for services with available resources. GAO acknowledged this may require IRS to consider difficult tradeoffs, such as limiting some services. In response, IRS has proposed eliminating or reducing some services for 2014 such as answering basic tax law questions only during the filing season. However, IRS officials told GAO the proposed cuts may not be sufficient to stop the deterioration in services. Until IRS develops a strategy, it risks not communicating expectations about the level of services it can provide based on the resources available. IRS could use the strategy to facilitate a discussion with Congress and other stakeholders about the appropriate mix of service, level of performance, and resources.", "IRS offers options for installment agreements (IAs) to taxpayers who cannot fully pay their taxes when due. Taxpayers can enter into these agreements online, by phone, and by mail. In fiscal year 2012, IRS approved about 3.2 million new agreements and collected almost $10 billion. IRS devotes about 1,800 full-time equivalent staff to the program but it is not as efficient as it could be. GAO found opportunities to standardize account entries and reduce redundancy by eliminating dual entry of the same data on paper forms and into IRS's computers. IRS officials agreed that opportunities did exist to streamline the process. More standardized and less redundant data entry could reduce resource needs.", "IRS detects non-filers by matching third party information (i.e., Form W-2s) with tax returns. The first match is done in October, well after the mid-April tax filing deadline from the previous year, because of the time it takes to receive the third party information and process it. IRS sends notices to non-filers in November and December."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS develop standardized account entries and eliminate unnecessary redundancy in the installment agreement process.

In the 2013 filing  season, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) processed over 140 million  individual income tax returns, issued more than 100 million refunds worth  over $280 billion, and received over 90 million telephone calls. In fiscal  year 2013, IRS budgeted more than $2 billion for processing such returns  and providing taxpayer services. During the filing season, IRS also begins  its efforts to verify that tax returns are in compliance with income reporting  requirements. Two examples of compliance issues that typically surface  during the filing season are (1) failure to pay a balance due on time, and  (2) failure to file a return. Taxpayers who are unable to pay a balance due  on time can make payments through an installment agreement (IA)\u2014 which allows taxpayers to pay their tax debt in scheduled (usually  monthly) payments. Since failure to file a return cannot be detected until  after the tax filing deadline and IRS determines that the taxpayer may  have a filing obligation, timely notification of taxpayers can be a  challenge.

However, IRS acknowledged that standardized account entries can  sometimes lead to increased efficiencies and lower costs, and taxpayers  and IRS can benefit by the elimination of redundancy in its processes.  IRS stated that as it continues to evaluate the Compliance Suite to  determine its full capabilities, it will (1) explore whether the introduction of  standardized account entries into the IA process will yield increased  efficiencies and lower costs; and (2) evaluate whether there are  unnecessary redundancies in its current processes that can be eliminated  without adversely affecting tax administration. GAO believes the  recommendation remains valid as discussed in the report.", "We plan to send copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking  Members of other Senate and House committees and subcommittees that  have appropriation, authorization, and oversight responsibilities for IRS.
