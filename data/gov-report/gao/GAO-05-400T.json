These weaknesses were more glaring in light of the sustained increase in mobilized Guard soldiers following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. To its credit, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) hired over 200 new personnel to address travel voucher processing backlogs and recently upgraded their training. However, Guard soldiers in our case study units reported a number of problems they and their families endured due to delayed or unpaid travel reimbursements, including debts on their personal credit cards, trouble paying their monthly bills, and inability to make child support payments. The soldier bears primary responsibility for travel voucher preparation, including obtaining paper copies of various types of authorizations. DFAS data indicate that it rejected and asked soldiers to resubmit about 18 percent of vouchers during fiscal year 2004--a churning process that added to delays and frustration. Also, existing guidance did not clearly address the sometimes complex travel situations of mobilized Army Guard soldiers, who were often housed off-post due to overcrowding on military installations. Further, DOD continued to be noncompliant with a law that requires payment of late payment interest and fees when soldiers' travel reimbursements are not timely. With respect to human capital, GAO found a lack of oversight and accountability and inadequate training. Automated systems problems, such as nonintegration of key systems involved in authorizing and paying travel expenses and failure to automate key processes, also contributed to the inefficient, error-prone process. DOD has been developing and implementing the Defense Travel System (DTS) to resolve travel-related deficiencies. However, DTS will not address some of the key systems flaws. For example, DTS is currently not able to process mobilized soldier travel authorizations and vouchers and identify and calculate late payment interest and fees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss controls over travel  reimbursement payments to mobilized Army National Guard (Army  Guard) soldiers. In October 2002, we reported that the Defense Finance  and Accounting Service (DFAS) did not have systems in place to identify  late travel reimbursements and could not identify the soldiers who were  not paid within 30 days of submission of an approved travel voucher and  who should have been paid late payment interest and fees required  pursuant to the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998 (TTRA).  This affected numerous soldiers whose vouchers were paid late. Further,  during our audits of Army Guard and Army Reserve military payroll  controls, soldiers told us about problems with delayed and inaccurate  travel cost reimbursements and meal cost authorizations and entitlements.  Because of the severity of these complaints, this Committee, as well as  other requesters, asked us to examine the effectiveness of the process  used to reimburse Army Guard soldiers for travel expenses and the effect  that travel reimbursement problems have had on soldiers and their  families. Today, I will highlight the results of our review for which our  detailed report is being released at this hearing.", "Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the operational tempo for  the military services has greatly increased, with corresponding increases  in the basic administrative tasks necessary to keep soldiers paid, fed, and  housed. Over 186,500 Army Guard soldiers were mobilized from  September 14, 2001, through September 30, 2004, to serve in Operations  Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Army Guard soldiers  called to active service are entitled to be reimbursed for authorized travel  expenses incurred. The Department of Defense (DOD) is to provide a  Guard soldier traveling on official business with transportation, lodging,  and food, or to reimburse the soldier for reasonable and necessary  authorized expenses if the soldier purchases them. In short, the soldier is  to be made whole for authorized out-of-pocket expenses, with timely and  accurate reimbursements for travel expenses.", "Within the United States, Army Guard soldiers have guarded the Pentagon,  airports, nuclear power plants, and domestic water supplies as part of the  homeland security effort. Overseas, they continue to perform highly  dangerous peacekeeping missions and force protection operations in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and other countries. When government-provided meals and  housing were not available to some Guard soldiers, they lived off the local  economy\u2014purchased food at restaurants and groceries, and housing at  hotels\u2014and later submitted requests to the Army for reimbursement of  their out-of-pocket expenses.", "Because our preliminary assessment determined that the current  authorization, request, review, and approval processes used to pay travel  reimbursements to active service Army Guard soldiers relied extensively  on paper-intensive, nonintegrated systems, and error-prone manual  transaction entry that did not provide an adequate audit trail or a reliable  population of transactions, we could not effectively statistically test  current processes and controls. Instead, we systematically assessed the  effectiveness of the overall design of controls at work in the key areas of  processes, people (human capital), and automated systems through case  studies of 10 selected units of Army Guard soldiers mobilized to active  service in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Noble Eagle, and  Enduring Freedom during the period from October 2001 through  November 2003. In addition, we audited a nonrepresentative selection of  individual travel vouchers that were paid 120 days or more from the date  the travel ended and travel vouchers selected from the unit case studies.  We used this approach to provide a more detailed perspective on the  design of controls and the nature of deficiencies in the three phases of the  travel and reimbursement process: (1) authorization; (2) travel voucher  preparation, unit review, and transmission; and (3) computation office  review and payment.

As  a result, the soldiers were housed off-post in commercial hotels or  apartments. This created a number of novel situations that were not  specifically addressed in regulations, as discussed later.", "During this time frame, DFAS CTO staffing levels were not keeping pace  with the rising volume of vouchers.

In October 2001, although the Army issued new guidance that  was intended to address travel entitlements unique to Army and Army  Guard soldiers mobilized for the war on terrorism, it was not well- understood. Furthermore, inappropriate policy and guidance on how to  identify and pay soldiers entitled to late payment interest and fees because  of late travel reimbursement meant that DOD continued to be  noncompliant with TTRA.

We found that both Army Guard soldiers and travel computation  personnel had difficulty using these sources to find the information  necessary about the rules regarding travel-related entitlements.", "Table 3 shows the sources of common problems related to meal expense  reimbursements experienced by soldiers in our case studies.", "Unclear eligibility criteria. We found that guidance did not adequately  address some significant conditions that entitled a soldier to  reimbursement of authorized meal expenses. For example, although the  JFTR entitled soldiers to reimbursement for meal expenses when  transportation was not reasonably available between government meal  facilities and place of lodging, the term \u201creasonably available\u201d was not  defined. The PPG directed the maximum use of installation facilities, and  if not feasible, then \u201cmulti-passenger vehicles should be used\u201d to transport  soldiers to installation facilities. However, the PPG is silent regarding what  constitutes adequate transportation, particularly when transportation to  government meal facilities is necessary for Army Guard soldiers who  cannot be housed in government facilities. As discussed in our companion  report, we found disagreements between the soldiers and their command  officials about the adequacy of transportation to government meal  facilities and their entitlement to get reimbursed for eating at commercial  facilities closer to their lodgings. Without clear guidance on these issues,  Army decisions will continue to appear arbitrary and unfair to soldiers.", "Lack of specific entitlements on orders. Army and Army Guard  policies and procedures do not provide for mobilization orders issued to  Army Guard soldiers to clearly state that these soldiers should not be  required to pay for meals provided to them at government dining facilities.  As a result, we noted instances in which mobilized soldiers arrived at  government mess halls carrying mobilization orders that did not  specifically state that the soldiers could eat free of charge and were  inappropriately required to pay for their meals. Consequently, many Guard  soldiers were unable to obtain reimbursement for their out-of-pocket costs  in a timely manner.", "The PPG states, \u201cTCS soldiers who are on government installations with  dining facilities are directed to use mess facilities. These soldiers are not  required to pay for their meals.\u201d In addition, the PPG states, \u201cBasic  Allowance for Subsistence will not be reduced when government mess is  used for soldiers in a contingency operation.\u201d As such, an Army Guard  soldier called to active service is entitled to eat at a government mess hall  without charge and concurrently entitled to receive BAS as part of his  military pay. However, the PPG does not provide guidance addressing the  content of mobilization orders for Army Guard soldiers with respect to  meal entitlements.", "In response to questions we posed to officials representing the Mississippi  Adjutant General\u2019s office regarding why mobilization orders did not  include adequate provisions about food entitlements, they explained that  the individual mobilization orders that are prepared by the Adjutant  General\u2019s staff are very basic and include only the travel allowances and  actions that are necessary to get the individual from the home station to  the mobilization station. The Adjutant General office received no guidance  on what should be stated in the orders with respect to soldiers eating free  of charge at government installations or any other conditions that may  entitle Army Guard soldiers to per diem to compensate them for their out- of-pocket meal costs. In addition, our companion report provides  examples where Army officials were not always aware that Army Guard  soldiers called to active duty were entitled to BAS in addition to meal  entitlements while they were serving under mobilization orders or  temporary change of station (TCS) orders.", "Confusing, nonstandard SNAs. Lack of standardization and changing  guidance has resulted in SNAs of various form and content, signed by  officials at different levels of authority. Consequently, travel computation  office reviewers were unable to consistently determine the validity of  SNAs.

The guidance states that when  government or government-contracted quarters are not available, soldiers  will be provided certificates or SNAs for both lodging and meals to  authorize per diem. However, the guidance does not specify the form and  content of the SNAs. Consequently, we found that the form of the SNA and  the content of the information on the form varied at the discretion of the  issuing command.", "For example, one installation stamped the soldiers\u2019 orders and handwrote  an SNA identification number in a block provided by the stamp. Another  location provided a written memo that stated that the meal component of  per diem was authorized because there were no food facilities at the  government installation. Another provided a single SNA with a roster  attached that listed the names of the soldiers who were authorized per  diem. The variety of SNA formats can cause confusion for the soldier, who  does not know what documentation is needed for reimbursement and  whether the travel computation office will accept it. The travel  computation office personnel can also be confused about the criteria for a  valid SNA.", "Our work found instances in which installation commands denied soldiers\u2019  requests for SNAs. In response to our inquiries, we found that commands  do not generally document their rationale for denying SNAs and there is  no requirement for them to do so. This lack of documentation can leave  soldiers even more confused and frustrated when seeking answers as to  why their requests for per diem were denied.

Late payment interest and fees are to  be paid to soldiers if their reimbursements are not paid within 30 days of  the submission of a proper voucher.", "Although DFAS issued guidance related to TTRA in April 2003,  interpretation of the guidance limited the payment of late payment  interest and fees to only the final settlement travel voucher for all travel  under a particular travel order. This practice contributed to continued  noncompliance with the law because it effectively excluded large numbers  of monthly or accrual vouchers from consideration of late payment  interest and fees.", "As a result of our work, in May 2004 DFAS clarified that all travel voucher  reimbursements are subject to late payment interest and fees. However,  subsequent to DFAS\u2019s dissemination of its May 2004 clarification guidance,  we found late vouchers for which DFAS did not pay late payment interest  and fees. For example, the final vouchers for 63 soldiers with the Georgia  Army National Guard\u2019s 190th Military Police Company were processed late  in April 2004 without payment of late payment interest or fees, even  though they were covered by DFAS guidance issued in 2003.

However, neither DOD  management officials nor we could determine the root cause of all  instances of missing information. Some soldiers told us that DFAS CTO  lost documentation that they had submitted. DFAS CTO also experienced  problems with faxed vouchers, which caused vouchers and supporting  documentation not to be printed and processed in some cases. According  to a DFAS CTO official, DFAS was unaware that faxed vouchers were not  printing until a soldier complained that DFAS was not receiving his faxes.  DFAS did not monitor incoming faxes, even though it reported that faxed  travel vouchers account for approximately 60 percent of the total  mobilized Army Guard and Reserve travel vouchers it received. These  problems obstructed the normal handling of a number of those vouchers.  In an effort to resolve this problem, DFAS CTO, in March 2004, ceased  relying on an automatic print function of the fax system software and  began manually printing vouchers.", "As shown in figure 4, our audit of a nonrepresentative selection of  139 travel vouchers (69 computed by DFAS CTO and 70 by USPFOs) found  significant delays occurred between the date of the reviewer\u2019s signature  and the date that the travel computation office accepted the voucher.  Some of these delays were caused by the time needed to correct vouchers  that were deficient and resubmit them to DFAS CTO or another USPFO  travel computation office.", "We determined that the travel computation office rejected 32 of the  72 travel vouchers delayed for more than 3 days because of missing  documentation or the lack of required signatures and sent them back to  the soldiers for corrections. A lack of documentation or other information  prevented us from determining the reason for delays of more than 3 days  for the remaining travel vouchers.", "The Army\u2019s lack of processwide oversight, including monitoring of the  rejection and return of vouchers by DFAS CTO and other travel  computation offices, resulted in undetected delays in reimbursement,  leading to unnecessary frustration with the Army\u2019s travel and  reimbursement process and potential financial difficulty for the  soldier. Further, without establishing and monitoring program metrics,  management had no assurance that it had identified where the  breakdowns were occurring and could not take the appropriate steps to  resolve any identified problems. For example, although the Army relied on  the individual unit reviewer for assurance that travel vouchers were  properly reviewed and transmitted promptly to the travel computation  offices, the Army did not establish and monitor performance metrics to  hold these reviewers accountable for their critical role in the process.", "Further, although metrics were available on the average time DFAS CTO  took to pay travel vouchers after receipt, the Army did not have statistical  data on supplemental vouchers that could help provide additional insight  into the extent and cause of processing errors or omissions by voucher  examiners, unit reviewers, or Army Guard soldiers. Several of our case  studies indicate that accuracy may be an important issue. For example,  one method DFAS CTO uses to correct a voucher error or omission is to  process a supplemental voucher. According to DFAS data, DFAS CTO  processed about 251,000 vouchers related to Army Guard soldiers  mobilized during the period October 1, 2001, through November 30, 2003,  of which over 10,600 were supplemental vouchers. However, DFAS CTO  officials could not tell us how many of these were due to errors or  omissions by DFAS examiners or other factors.

For example, if the system that created the  mobilization order, the Automated Fund Control Order System (AFCOS),  interfaced with the travel voucher computation system, a paper copy of  the mobilization order would not be necessary because it would be  electronically available. In turn, a portion of Army Guard and Army  Reserve vouchers returned by DFAS CTO to soldiers because of these  missing orders\u2014a significant problem as discussed previously\u2014could  have been eliminated.", "Further, the lack of an integrated travel system and consequent  \u201cworkarounds\u201d increase the risk of errors and create the current  inefficient process. As noted previously, several separate WINIATS  systems at DFAS and the USPFOs can process travel vouchers for  mobilized Army Guard soldiers. These databases operate on separate local  area networks that do not exchange or share data with other travel  computation offices to ensure travel reimbursements have not already  been paid. Instead, as shown in figure 6, multiple WINIATS systems  transmit data to the DFAS Operational Data Store (ODS)\u2014a separate  database that stores disbursement transactions. As a result, when a soldier  submits a voucher, voucher examiners must resort to extraction and  manual review of data from ODS. Next, voucher examiners research and  calculate previous payments\u2014advances or interim payments\u2014made by  other Army WINIATS systems. This information is then manually entered  into WINIATS for it to compute the correct travel reimbursement for the  current claim. In addition to being time consuming, this manual  workaround can also lead to mistakes. For example, a Michigan soldier  was overpaid $1,384 when two travel computation offices paid him for  travel expenses incurred during the same period in August and September  2002. This overpayment was detected by DFAS CTO when the soldier filed  his final voucher in August 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Automated Systems", "paragraphs": ["DOD lacks an automated system for preparing travel vouchers, which  hinders the travel reimbursement process. As shown in figure 6, soldiers  manually prepare their paper travel vouchers and attach many paper travel  authorizations and receipts and distribute them via mail, fax, or e-mail to  one of the travel computation offices. The lack of an integrated automated  system increases the risk of missing documents in voucher submissions,  which results in an increased number of vouchers rejected and returned  by DFAS CTO. In addition, the Army currently lacks an automated  centralized system to issue uniquely numbered and standard formatted  SNAs regarding housing and dining facilities for mobilized soldiers. The  lack of automated centralized standard data precludes electronic linking  with any voucher computation system and the reduction of paperwork for  individual soldiers, as they must obtain and accumulate various paper  authorizations to submit with their vouchers.", "Further, the Army lacks an automated system for producing TCS orders.  As illustrated at the top of figure 6, the various mobilization stations use a  word processing program to type and print each individual TCS order to  move a soldier to such places as Afghanistan and Iraq. Similar to the  process for SNAs, mobilization stations maintain separate document files  for each TCS order issued. The absence of a standard automated system  used by each of the mobilization stations prevents the Army from  electronically sharing TCS data with other systems, such as a voucher  computation system. Consequently, the process will remain vulnerable to  delays for returned voucher submissions as mobilized Army Guard  soldiers continue to receive paper SNAs and TCS orders. Finally, even if  the Army automates the TCS, SNA, and voucher preparation processes, as  discussed previously, these new automated systems would need to be  either integrated or interfaced with a voucher computation system to  decrease the amount of time from initiation of travel to final settlement of  travel expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other System Problems", "paragraphs": ["We found that many Army Guard USPFOs did not populate key data fields  in WINIATS as directed by DFAS Indianapolis.

In addition, these dates are essential in  providing management with performance information that can help DOD  improve its travel reimbursement process.
