The United States provided Italy with some security assistance, mostly in the form of crisis management and response support. To coordinate U.S. efforts, the U.S. Mission in Italy established an office in Turin as a central point for security information and logistics, and to provide consular services to U.S. citizens during the Games. The U.S. Ambassador to Italy, through the U.S. Consulate in Milan, coordinated and led U.S. efforts in-country, while the Department of State-chaired interagency working group in Washington, D.C., coordinated domestic efforts. While the interagency working group has been a useful forum for coordinating U.S. security support to overseas athletic events, State and Department of Justice (DOJ) officials have indicated that formal guidance that articulates a charter; a mission; and agencies' authorities, roles, and responsibilities would help in planning for security support to future Games. Nearly 20 entities and offices within several U.S. agencies provided more than $16 million for security support activities for the Turin Games. The roles of these agencies--which included the Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, Defense, and Energy--included providing crisis management and response support through personnel, equipment, and training and providing security advice and other assistance to U.S. athletes, spectators, and commercial investors. The U.S. Embassy in Rome initially paid for lodging and other administrative support needs, which were reimbursed by the participating agencies, although it struggled to do so. State and DOJ officials indicated that an interagency mechanism for identifying costs and addressing potential funding issues would be useful in providing U.S. security support to future Games. For the Turin Games, agencies applied key lessons learned from the 2004 Athens Games and identified additional lessons for future Games. Key lessons identified from the Turin Games included, the importance of establishing an operations center at the location of the Games, establishing clear roles and responsibilities for agencies in event planning and crisis response efforts, and planning early for several years of Olympic-related expenditures. These lessons learned were communicated by Washington, D.C.- and Italy-based personnel to their counterparts who are preparing for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The United States is currently taking steps to identify the types of security support that agencies may provide to support China's security efforts for the 2008 Summer Games and to ensure the safety of U.S. athletes, spectators, and commercial investors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, were the second Olympic Games  to take place overseas since September 11, 2001, in a climate of heightened  concerns about international terrorism.

Also, we traveled to Italy in November  2005 to observe U.S. planning efforts for providing security support to the  2006 Winter Games. While in Italy, we interviewed U.S. officials in Rome,  Milan, and Turin and met with Italian officials in Rome to obtain their  perspective on the security support provided by the United States.

In  addition, an estimated 1.5 million spectators and 10,000 media personnel  attended the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. While the stated goal of the  Olympic movement is \u201cto contribute to building a peaceful and better  world,\u201d its history includes tragedy and terror as well. At the 1972 Munich  Games, Palestinian terrorists attacked the Israeli Olympic team, resulting  in the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes. The 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games were  marred by a pipe-bomb explosion that killed 1 person and injured 110  others.", "One of the International Olympic Committee requirements for countries  bidding to host the Games is to ensure the security of the participating  athletes and spectators, which is an increasingly challenging task in  today\u2019s environment of terrorist threats. According to State documents,  Italy spent approximately $110 million on security operations for the 2006  Winter Games. In addition, the Italian government designated 15,000 law  enforcement personnel, along with military and intelligence support, to  provide for overall security for the Winter Games. Italy\u2019s Ministry of  Interior designated the Prefect of Turin as the local government authority  responsible for providing security inside the official venues of the Winter  Games.", "Italy faced the challenge of hosting an Olympics amid a heightened  terrorist threat environment. Al-Qaeda has made threats to coalition  partners in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past. Moreover, in March 2004, a  terrorist attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, killed nearly 200  people, and, in July 2005, a terrorist attack on commuter trains and a bus  in London, England, killed over 50 people and injured more than 700. In  addition, there is a known presence of Italy-based international terrorist  cells and domestic anarchist groups that actively target multinational  corporations, critical infrastructure, and government facilities. Italy has  highly advanced antiterrorism capabilities and has recently taken  additional antiterrorism measures, such as enactment of improved  antiterrorism laws and increased physical security measures. Since 2001,  several extremist plots in Milan and Rome have been detected and  prevented. In addition to these explicit terror threats, Italy has faced  difficult security challenges at other recent major events, such as the  meeting of the Group of Eight in Genoa in 2001, at which activists clashed  violently with Italian police forces, and the funeral of Pope John Paul II in  April 2005.", "In planning for the 2006 Winter Games, winter conditions presented  another set of challenges. The Winter Games were located in the remote,  northwest corner of Italy, with venues spread over an extensive land area.  Although smaller in scale than the 2004 Athens Summer Games, the 2006  Winter Olympic venues included mountain locations that were as far as 60  miles away from Turin, with limited access routes to these mountain sites.  (See fig. 1 for locations of venues for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in  Turin, Italy.) Locating suitable lodging for U.S. security and support  personnel near key venues was necessary. Furthermore, the distance from  the nearest U.S. presence\u2014the U.S. Consulate in Milan, which is located  about a 90-minute drive from Turin\u2014required the establishment of a  temporary U.S. post in Turin to support U.S. security efforts and serve as a  platform for U.S. activities.", "Although the host government has the ultimate responsibility for providing  security for the Olympics, the United States has a vested interest in  ensuring the safety of its citizens in all Olympic locations. In 2001, the  United States began planning its security assistance for the 2004 Athens  Summer Olympics, responding both to the heightened worldwide anxiety  following the September 11 attacks and to Greece\u2019s request for  international advice on its security plan. Despite widespread fears of a  potential terrorist attack on the Olympics, Greece hosted a safe and secure  event with no terrorist incidents. With the conclusion of the Athens  Games, the United States began planning for security support to the 2006  Turin Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. This security support is  provided by the United States under general executive branch policy  guidance and individual agency authorities. For example, State officials  cited the use of Presidential Decision Directive 62, which extends the U.S.  counterterrorism policy in Presidential Decision Directive 39 to the  protection of Americans overseas. State is the lead agency for ensuring the  protection of American citizens overseas. According to U.S. officials in  Italy, up to 20,000 Americans attended the 2006 Turin Olympics daily.", "The next Olympics will be the Summer Games in Beijing, China, August 8  to 24, 2008; followed by the Paralympics, September 6 to 17, 2008. Venues  for these Games will be spread out across seven cities in China, presenting  unique logistical and coordination challenges for security support efforts.  According to State officials, over 1 million spectators are expected to  attend the 2008 Beijing Games, including a large number of Americans.  The next Winter Olympic Games will be held in Vancouver, Canada,  February 12 to 28, 2010, followed by the Paralympics on March 12 to 21,  2010. The close proximity of these Games to the United States presents  distinctive challenges, such as border security issues. In 2012, the United  Kingdom will host the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.

In October 2004, the  United States held a 3-day interagency conference in Milan for Italy- and  U.S.-based officials who would be working on the 2006 Winter Games to  share lessons learned from the U.S. effort in Athens and to begin  determining U.S. security support for Turin.", "The United States largely based its security support approach on its  understanding of Italian security capabilities, gained from long-standing  counterterrorism and military relationships with Italy. In particular, the  United States and Italy have an established partnership as members of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization and, more recently, as coalition  partners in Iraq. According to U.S. officials, the Italian government\u2019s  sensitivities about formally sharing certain information limited the United  States\u2019 ability to formally assess Italy\u2019s operational plans for providing  security for the 2006 Winter Games. Agency officials noted that this made  U.S. efforts to plan security and emergency contingencies during the  Games more difficult. However, the U.S. Olympic Security Coordinator  and other key officials were able to use established relationships with  their Italian counterparts to develop a working knowledge of Italy\u2019s plans  and capabilities for providing security to the 2006 Winter Games and to  plan U.S. security efforts. For example, U.S. officials met with their Italian  security and law enforcement counterparts to receive information on  Italy\u2019s security structure and Olympic security integration plan.", "In addition, over several months in 2005, State reported that more than 20  technical meetings were held between Italian authorities and U.S.  representatives from the U.S. Mission in Italy and various federal law  enforcement and intelligence agencies to coordinate bilateral cooperation  during the Games. Moreover, Italian government representatives held  meetings in 2005 with representatives from the United States and other  interested governments to discuss Italy\u2019s security plans for the Games. For  example, in September 2005, the Italian government hosted an  international seminar on security concepts for the management of major  sporting events, with law enforcement representatives from 11 countries.  Furthermore, in October 2005, U.S. representatives were invited by the  Italian government to observe its antiterrorism drills testing the efficiency  and response capability of the local law enforcement, emergency, and  rescue systems in four Italian cities.", "On the basis of its understanding of Italy\u2019s security capabilities, the United  States identified specific training and security support that could be  provided to support Italy\u2019s security efforts. In March 2005, the Italian  government requested a consolidated list of the offers of U.S. security  assistance, and the interagency working group in Washington identified  the available sources and capabilities among the represented agencies to  prevent duplication of efforts. In the spring of 2005, this interagency  working group provided a comprehensive offer of security support for the  2006 Winter Games, comprising a variety of specific offers from several  U.S. agencies. Italy accepted a number of these offers, including crisis  management expertise, an assessment of Turin\u2019s international airport, and  mapping assistance.", "In addition to direct security assistance to Italy, the United States  conducted several exercises to test its own strategies for supporting Italy\u2019s  security efforts and ensuring the protection of U.S. citizens during the 2006  Winter Games. In November and December 2005, the United States  conducted several tabletop exercises to test strategies for ensuring the  protection of U.S. citizens, including a joint crisis management exercise  that focused on a theoretical terrorist attack in Italy and a crisis  management exercise held over several days in Rome, Milan, and Turin to  test U.S. crisis planning and execution in preparation for the Games.

This confusion has impacted the efforts of some subgroups  formed, in late 2004, by the interagency working group to provide  guidance in several key areas. For example, of the subgroups that focus on  logistics, transportation security, law enforcement, and intelligence  support, only the intelligence support subgroup meets on a regular basis.  The subgroup for law enforcement support met only a few times, in part  due to the lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities of participating  members. According to a State official from DS, the interagency working  group relied on U.S. officials in Italy to inform the group of what support  was needed. The same official indicated that clearly defined authorities  and responsibilities for the group\u2019s participating agencies may support the  implementation of effective subgroups in the future. In addition, DS  established a major events coordination unit after the 2004 Athens  Summer Games, in part to coordinate U.S. security support for major  sporting events overseas, according to a State official. However, this unit  does not have written guidance for implementing coordination  responsibilities for future Olympic events and other major sporting  events. Without formal guidance, planning for future Olympic events  could be complicated, as roles and responsibilities will have to be  redefined on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, given the regular turnover of  key staff, such written guidance could facilitate the continuity of future  planning efforts.", "To plan and coordinate U.S. security support operations, State and DOJ  officials in Turin worked closely with representatives from the interagency  working group. However, these officials in Turin experienced difficulties  in planning for interagency operations, in part due to problems in  obtaining timely information and decisions from the agencies. For  example, State and DOJ officials had difficulty identifying requirements for  operations, such as space and classification requirements, due to  communication challenges with the interagency community in  Washington. According to State officials in Italy and Washington, the lack  of proper communication capabilities in the U.S. Olympic Coordination  Office in Turin made it difficult to obtain timely information from the  agencies. The interagency working group worked to coordinate responses  to these officials in Turin. However, State and FBI officials in Turin  indicated that many of the agencies did not fully understand the  communication infrastructure and logistical requirements until they sent  representatives to Turin in the fall of 2005. FBI officials have stated that  although the interagency working group works to support the needs of the  U.S. effort overseas, it has no authority to task agencies to meet deadlines,  which leads to confusion over what direction and guidance should be  followed or given by this group."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several U.S. Agencies Contributed to Security Support for 2006 Winter Games; United States Spent Millions on Security Support Activities, but Lacks Formal Mechanism for Coordinating Financial Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Several U.S. agencies contributed to the U.S. security support effort in  Turin, identifying more than $16 million in costs\u2014over fiscal years 2005  and 2006\u2014to arrange and provide for this support.

In Athens, the U.S. Embassy had designated individuals  to be responsible for political, security, and logistics arrangements, which  helped to avoid separate requests for assistance from U.S. agencies and  minimized overlap among and overreach by participating U.S. agencies.  Athens- and Washington-based officials recommended this strategy for  future use. In September 2004, the U.S. Ambassador to Italy delegated  organizational responsibility and overall coordination authority for U.S.  efforts in Turin to the U.S. Consul General in Milan. In November 2004,  State appointed an U.S. Olympic Security Coordinator to serve in Turin as  a U.S. focal point for contacts with the host government and to work with  the Consul General to develop and communicate a coordinated U.S.  message, specifically on matters related to security support. This  individual was tasked with crafting and ensuring a consistent message and  setting consistent expectations for the host country and multilateral  community regarding planned U.S. security support efforts. In addition, in  January 2005, an FBI liaison arrived in Italy to serve as the FBI\u2019s point of  contact for its security support efforts in Turin. According to State and FBI  officials, the U.S. Olympic Security Coordinator and FBI liaison worked  closely together in Turin to plan for and coordinate U.S. security support  operations in Turin.", "To coordinate the logistical arrangements and needs for U.S. operations in  Turin, State appointed a U.S. Olympic Coordinator who arrived in April  2005. This individual served as a U.S. focal point for contacts with the host  government, the Turin Olympic Organizing Committee, and the U.S.  Olympic Committee and worked with the U.S. Consul General in Milan to  develop and communicate interagency information in a coordinated and  understandable way. In addition, a dedicated Web site was developed as a  ready source of information for Americans on security matters, while also  offering helpful advice on other matters, such as how to replace lost  passports and locate English-speaking pharmacies.", "This lesson is being applied to the 2008 Beijing Games through State\u2019s  appointment of an Olympic Coordinator in June 2005, a Minister  Counselor for Olympic Coordination in December 2005, a Deputy Olympic  Security Coordinator in January 2006, and the U.S. Ambassador\u2019s  designation of an Olympic Coordination Office at the U.S. Mission in  Beijing to coordinate all arrangements\u2014including political, security, and  logistical\u2014for U.S. security support to the 2008 Summer Games.  According to U.S. officials involved in planning for the 2008 Summer  Games, providing consistent, clear, and targeted information for Beijing is  needed to avert possible confusion within the Chinese government  regarding which U.S. agency to speak with to obtain specific assistance.
