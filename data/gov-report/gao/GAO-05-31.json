In 1998, the Congress designated FSA as a performance-based organization. In so doing, it specified purposes for the agency, such as to reduce program costs and increase accountability of its officials, and provided flexibilities such as allowing FSA to pay bonuses. Also FSA is required to annually prepare a performance plan and report and have performance agreements for its senior officials. Past reviews revealed serious problems and concerns about FSA's management. In January 2003, GAO reported that FSA had made progress but had not sufficiently addressed some key management issues. Also, GAO noted that FSA, like other agencies needed to address human capital issues. GAO assessed FSA's progress in (1) addressing key management issues and meeting requirements for planning and reporting, and (2) developing a human capital strategy and increasing the accountability of its officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FSA has made progress addressing its key management issues; however, its plans and reports do not contain all the required information needed by the Congress and the public to assess FSA's progress in achieving its goals and purposes. FSA's significant improvements in its financial management and internal control are reflected in its receiving an unqualified or \"clean\" opinion on its financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. In addition, FSA's fiscal year 2003 financial audit did not identify any material internal control weaknesses. FSA has also made progress in other areas, but to a lesser extent. FSA completed several critical systems integration tasks, but full systems integration is several years away. In addition, FSA has addressed many program integrity issues--factors that could affect the vulnerability of student aid programs to fraud, waste, and abuse--but has not developed guidance to ensure that its comprehensive compliance reviews are being performed as expected. Furthermore, FSA has developed a cost model that has the potential to identify the full cost of its activities and changes in costs over time, but as of July 2004, the model was not fully operational. As a result, FSA has not been able to demonstrate that it has reduced the cost of administering its programs. Also, FSA issued a 5-year performance plan and annual performance reports, but neither included specific measures needed to determine whether FSA has made progress toward meeting its longer-term strategic objectives. FSA has developed a comprehensive human capital strategy and has taken steps to increase the accountability of most of its officials, but some of the human capital strategy's components and the accountability system have weaknesses. FSA's human capital plan describes the agency's human capital strategy and the strategy's components. For example, FSA has a draft succession plan to prepare for the retirement of key staff. However, this plan has weaknesses. The draft succession plan shows that the agency will redistribute the duties of most retiring staff but does not discuss how the agency will develop the skills of remaining staff to take over new responsibilities. To increase the accountability of its officials, FSA changed from a pass-fail to multilevel performance appraisal systems for its senior officials and included job-specific goals in their performance agreements based on their areas of responsibility. FSA also changed the way it awards performance bonuses, but the criteria were not clear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Office of Federal Student Aid  (FSA) administered over $60 billion in new federal student aid to  approximately 9 million students in 2003. FSA describes its mission as  helping to put America through school by providing access to higher  education through effective and efficient delivery of student aid. However,  past audits and reviews revealed that the agency has encountered some  problems accomplishing this mission. Consequently, we designated  student financial aid programs as high-risk in 1990 because of concerns  about fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of the billions of dollars in  student financial aid.", "In 1998, when the Congress amended the Higher Education Act (HEA), it  designated FSA as a performance-based organization (PBO) and  authorized the agency to operate without the constraints of certain rules  and regulations for the purpose of achieving specific measurable goals and  objectives. This flexibility was intended to allow FSA to better address  long-standing management weaknesses and enhance its delivery of student  financial aid. The Congress designated several purposes for FSA, including  reducing costs of administering the program and increasing accountability  of officials. In addition, the Congress required that FSA annually issue   (1) a 5-year performance plan that establishes measurable goals and  objectives for the organization and (2) performance reports showing  progress toward achieving its measurable goals and objectives in  accordance with applicable requirements under the Chief Financial Officer  (CFO) Act and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).  While FSA had developed new management strategies and had made some  progress improving its operations, Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General  (OIG) and we found that FSA had not sufficiently addressed management  weaknesses, identified reductions in cost, prepared 5-year performance  plans, or submitted useful and timely reports. Specifically, we reported in  January 2003 that FSA needed to take further actions in several key  management areas, and we identified human capital management as one  of the key challenges facing FSA and agencies governmentwide.", "Since we completed the work for our January 2003 report, FSA has further  attempted to address our concerns. We have undertaken this effort to  examine the extent to which FSA has made progress (1) addressing key  management issues related to financial management and internal control,  systems integration, program integrity, the costs of administering its  programs, and fulfilling its planning and reporting responsibilities, and   (2) establishing a comprehensive human capital strategy and increasing  the accountability of its officials.", "To assess FSA\u2019s progress in these areas, we reviewed and analyzed several  documents such as auditors\u2019 reports on FSA\u2019s financial statements and  internal control for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, annual performance plans  and reports, and its 5-year performance plan. We also analyzed FSA\u2019s  systems plans and related documentation, as well as the performance  agreements and evaluations of its senior managers. We interviewed  officials from FSA, Education\u2019s OIG, and Education\u2019s Management  Improvement Team (MIT), as well as union officials. We conducted our  work between November 2003 and August 2004 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. For more details about  our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FSA manages and administers student financial aid programs authorized  under Title IV of the HEA, as amended. These programs include the  William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loans), the Federal  Family Education Loan Program (FFEL), the Federal Pell Grant Program  (Pell Grants), and campus-based programs. The student aid environment  is complex and involves a large number of parties. In 2003, about 6,600  schools, 3,700 lenders, and 36 guaranty agencies participated in the Title IV  student aid programs. Additionally, there are numerous information  systems, federal financial requirements, programmatic regulations, and  human capital issues that also affect the delivery of student financial aid.", "For many years, the Department of Education designed technology  systems and processes to accommodate each financial aid program as it  was developed. As the demand for the programs grew, so did the number  of systems needed to support institutional participation, student eligibility  determination, aid disbursement, operational accounting, and financial  record keeping for the many disparate programs involved. After 30 years  of such practices, the department was left with stand-alone information  systems and separate delivery processes that were not integrated with one  another. Consequently, student aid delivery became replete with  redundant data, rising costs, complex rules, and inefficiency for everyone  involved. The process to gain access to student financial aid programs  required users, such as an educational institution\u2019s financial aid or  accounting staff, to continually log in and out of different systems for  related aid information on students for each program. Accessing the  student information for each FSA program often required the use of  different school identifiers and passwords, and users often did not have  the ability to retrieve necessary information when they did gain access. We  previously reported that the problem of not having access to current,  accurate information sometimes led to loans and grants being improperly  awarded. In 1999 FSA began implementing a strategy to integrate its many  disparate systems.", "In response to the growing complexity, increasing demand, and the  likelihood for fraud, waste, and abuse associated with the student aid  programs, the Congress established FSA as the government\u2019s first PBO in  October 1998. As defined in the legislation, the specific purposes of the  PBO are to  improve service in the student financial assistance programs;  reduce costs of administering the programs;  increase accountability of officials;    provide greater flexibility in management;  integrate information systems;  implement an open, common, integrated delivery system; and    develop and maintain a financial aid system containing complete,  accurate, and timely data to ensure program integrity.", "FSA\u2019s enabling legislation also established several requirements and  provided certain flexibilities. These requirements included the  appointment of a chief operating officer (COO), the establishment of a fair  and equitable system for measuring staff performance, and the  development of annual performance agreements for the COO and other  senior managers. In exchange for increased accountability, the legislation  allows for the payment of performance bonuses to the COO and senior  managers hired under the excepted service hiring authority, and the law  allows FSA to hire an unlimited number of Senior Executive Service (SES)  personnel and a limited number of excepted service technical/professional  staff.", "Additionally, the law established several annual reporting requirements to  inform the Congress and the public of the progress that FSA was making  toward achieving its intended purposes and goals. Specifically, among  other things, FSA must (1) develop and publicly release each year a 5-year  performance plan that includes measurable goals and objectives as well as  the action steps necessary to achieve a modernized student financial  assistance delivery system and (2) provide an annual report to the  Congress that describes the results achieved relative to its goals and  objectives. The annual performance report must include (1) a copy of the  current year\u2019s independent financial audit report; (2) a discussion of  financial and performance requirements applicable to the PBO under the  CFO Act and GPRA, (3) results achieved in the previous year; (4)  evaluation ratings of the COO and senior managers, including the amounts  of bonus compensation awarded to these individuals; (5)  recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes; and (6) other  such information required by the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB). The planning and reporting requirements are  consistent with federal reform laws, such as the CFO Act, GPRA, Federal  Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), Federal Financial Management  Improvement Act (FFMIA), and others intended to reshape the way  government conducts its business.", "FSA\u2019s budget supports its staff, contractors, and day-to-day operations. In  fiscal year 2004, FSA\u2019s operating budget was $621 million. FSA worked  with about 3,800 contractors and employed about 1,100 staff. As of June  2004, FSA had 10 organizational units at its headquarters in Washington,  D.C., and some of these units also have regional offices in 10 states  nationwide. Figure 1 illustrates the organizational structure of its  headquarters office.", "Federal agencies, including FSA, face human capital challenges.  Recognizing this, in 2001 GAO designated strategic human capital  management as a governmentwide high-risk area. With respect to FSA, we  reported in 2002 that almost 40 percent of the agency\u2019s workforce was  eligible for retirement. We also reported that the agency had experienced  difficulty in reaching agreement with its union on a past human capital  initiative.

In addition, although the auditors identified two reportable  conditions, they did not identify any material internal control  weaknesses in FSA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 audit. The two reportable  conditions the auditors identified concern management controls  surrounding the calculation and reporting of the loan liability activity and  subsidy estimates and information systems controls. FSA has developed a  corrective action plan to address these findings and is working to  implement it. Also, FSA prepared its financial statements earlier than  required in 2003.", "We determined that FSA has established processes to address several  internal control weaknesses. Since we previously reported that internal  control weaknesses made FSA vulnerable to improper payments in its  grant and loan programs, FSA has taken steps to better ensure that Pell  Grants are not issued to ineligible students. In fiscal year 2002, FSA  implemented a process for verifying an applicant\u2019s age when the  information indicated that the applicant was 75 or older and another  process for identifying and investigating schools with high percentages of  students with certain characteristics, such as older, noncitizen Pell Grant  recipients. These reviews are used to identify problems such as eligibility- related violations or indications of possible fraudulent activities, which are  referred to the OIG. In addition, since our finding that FSA did not correct  Social Security numbers and dates of birth in all records, FSA has  implemented its new loan origination and disbursement system, which  automatically makes such changes to records in all systems.", "Independent auditors also reported in 2003 that Education\u2019s systems did  not substantially comply with the Federal Financial Management  Improvement Act\u2019s requirements. Because FSA\u2019s financial reporting relies  on the department\u2019s systems, computer security weaknesses identified at  Education also affect FSA. The auditors found that while the department  had made progress in strengthening controls over information technology  processes, computer security weaknesses still existed. However, the  auditors also reported that these weaknesses were not material."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Integration", "paragraphs": ["FSA is continuing to take actions toward better integrating systems  supporting its student financial aid programs.

The strategy  involves consolidating FSA\u2019s existing legacy systems, in which the  functionality of certain systems would be incorporated into new or  modernized systems and, in the long term, integrating systems and using  electronic interfaces to facilitate data exchanges across systems.", "Consistent with OMB guidelines, FSA has made progress toward  establishing an enterprise architecture needed to guide its systems  integration. An enterprise architecture provides a framework for  developing and maintaining integrated information systems and  establishes the rules and standards required for interrelated systems to  work together efficiently and effectively. FSA has completed many of the  required elements of its architecture, including the baseline and target  architectures that, respectively, describe the agency\u2019s current and future  information systems environments. In addition, FSA has named a  permanent chief architect, with responsibility for overseeing its systems  integration efforts.", "FSA has also begun consolidating certain information systems, thus  reducing the overall number of systems that it must rely on to administer  its student financial aid programs. Over the past several years, the agency  has retired 6 of 18 systems and incorporated their functionality into  certain other systems. (Definitions for these systems are in app. III.) From  2002 to 2004, FSA retired 3 systems and incorporated their functionality  into the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System. COD  supports a single process for delivering Direct Loan and Pell Grant aid to  students and relies on middleware as a solution for exchanging data  between incompatible systems while the agency works toward full  integration. According to FSA, the consolidation of the three systems\u2019  functions into COD has improved the delivery of student aid by simplifying  the process by which schools request, report, and reconcile federal Pell  Grant and Direct Loan funds and by facilitating schools\u2019 submissions of  student aid data through the use of a common student record. FSA also  retired 3 systems that supported its financial activities, such as collecting  on defaulted student loans, and incorporated these functions into its  Financial Management System\u2014creating a repository for the agency\u2019s  financial information. FSA reported that these actions have helped  improve financial decision-making and the ability to create financial  reports for FSA, lenders, and guaranty agencies.", "Nonetheless, FSA remains several years from operating in a fully  integrated information systems environment. While it has reduced the  number of systems supporting its programs, FSA plans further actions to  reengineer the agency\u2019s information processing environment. In this  regard, FSA has begun three major systems integration initiatives, which it  plans to complete by 2008:    Front-End Business Integration is planned to simplify and improve the  front-end processes (for example, grant and loan originations) associated  with FSA\u2019s student aid delivery services by integrating the information,  processes, and supporting systems that applicants, their parents, and  others rely on in seeking financial aid.", "Integrated Partner Management is planned to improve FSA\u2019s ability to  reduce fraud and errors in its student aid programs by incorporating  improved controls, such as common identifiers, system access  information, and a single point of enrollment. The initiative is expected to  reengineer or replace FSA\u2019s current database of entities, such as schools  and lenders that participate in the student aid programs.", "Common Services for Borrowers is planned to improve and simplify back- end services related to the management of student aid obligations (for  example, loan repayments) by combining the borrower-related functions  of existing loan servicing systems into an integrated process.", "FSA officials explained that, overall, the three integration initiatives are  expected to streamline systems and operations through further  consolidating common processing functions and interfacing systems that  receive and process loan applications, monitor program participation, and  track loan obligations. As an essential first step for sharing common  financial aid data in the integrated environment, FSA is in the process of  completing data standardization across its systems. In addition, the agency  has begun hiring contractors to support the three integration initiatives.  However, the agency has not yet fully defined the technological solutions  for the initiatives\u2014a step that is necessary to know what specific  technology will be used to integrate the systems. FSA officials stated that  the agency would rely on the supporting contractors to perform this  crucial task.", "The agency also plans to define integration strategies that would enable  existing financial management and other systems to share data with its  integrated components. However, the technological solutions for  accomplishing this have not been defined. FSA\u2019s approach for integrating  its systems is depicted in figure 2.", "Until FSA achieves a fully integrated environment, it lacks assurance that  it will realize greater efficiencies in sharing student financial aid  information across its programs.

To improve the oversight of and assistance to foreign schools,  FSA (1) added controls to verify the existence of foreign schools and their  students, (2) hired a consultant to help determine how best to ensure  accountability of foreign schools, and (3) started developing an online  training program to help foreign school officials properly administer the  program. Also, FSA has taken steps to help address concerns raised  about students who have underreported family income on their student  aid applications. FSA conducted studies with the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) to compare student and parent income on student aid  applications with reported income on tax forms to determine the extent of  over- and under-reporting of income in student applications. FSA also  worked with OMB and the Department of the Treasury to draft legislation  that would permit the IRS to disclose taxpayer information to Education.  Such legislation, if passed, would enable FSA to compare the income data  on the financial aid applications with tax records to better ensure that only  eligible students receive financial aid. According to agency officials, FSA  has developed several approaches for implementing the comparison  process in anticipation of passage of the legislation.", "Moreover, FSA has taken steps to enhance its student loan default  management efforts. In 2003, FSA created a work group that identified  over 60 default prevention and management initiatives and a new  organizational unit, Portfolio Risk Management, that focuses on mitigating  and reducing the risk of loss to the taxpayer from student aid obligations.

FSA officials stated that these reviews could result in a decision  to perform a more in-depth on-site review. FSA officials explained that  during comprehensive compliance reviews, regional teams are to review  all available data about that school in addition to addressing the triggering  event.

During the test of the model using fiscal year 2002  data, FSA identified costs of more than $24.8 million that could not be  assigned to a specific activity because insufficient information was known  about these costs. Further, FSA had not fully reconciled the fiscal year  2002 costs used to test the model to total cost amounts reported in its  audited financial statements. In March 2004 FSA staff advised us that they  plan to address both of these issues. In July 2004 FSA officials updated us  on the status of their implementation efforts.

Also, FSA\u2019s realignment plan may be delayed because the agency has not  reached agreement on its implementation with union officials. Table 1 lists  and briefly describes the five key components of FSA\u2019s human capital  strategy.", "Furthermore, FSA does not maintain an information system to track staff  development\u2014a critical piece in strategic workforce planning. According  to agency officials, FSA staff members have access to a number of stand- alone human capital information systems, including one housed at the  department that contains data on training courses taken by staff. However,  an official described this system as outdated and said that it did not allow  staff to create individual development plans or provide data that managers  needed for other agency planning efforts, such as its succession plan. Our  previous studies indicate that information systems play a critical role in  workforce planning. Valid and reliable data on knowledge and skills of  staff are critical to assessing an agency\u2019s current and future workforce  gaps. With such data, agencies can minimize these gaps and better manage  risk by allowing managers to spotlight areas for attention and take  appropriate actions before crises develop. A senior official agreed that the  agency does not have systems that allow the agency to track staff  development but also said that an independent system was not a good  investment because of the ongoing efforts by Education to procure a  departmentwide human capital management system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Succession Plan", "paragraphs": ["FSA prepared a draft succession plan that addresses, in part, the concerns  we raised in 2002 about the pending retirement of senior employees in key  positions across the agency. This draft plan identified almost 250  employees from across the agency that are likely to retire between 2003  and 2006, about 22 percent of the agency\u2019s workforce. Also, the plan  designated 167 of the positions as critical positions that help FSA achieve  its organizational goals and identified 31 positions as \u201chard to fill\u201d because  specific skills and program knowledge are required to perform the duties  related to these positions. When these hard-to-fill positions become  vacant, FSA plans to fill one-third of the positions through internal hiring;  one vacancy will be filled through a mentoring opportunity.", "However, the succession plan did not include information about all  positions and relied on short-term solutions. The plan did not include any  information for 12 positions, 10 of which are in regional offices and  include responsibility for oversight of lenders, banks, and guaranty  agencies. Moreover, according to the plan, FSA will redistribute the  workload to existing staff for 140 of the 247 positions but the strategy\u2019s  components do not discuss how the agency will use developmental  projects or training to prepare these staff to assume these duties. We  previously reported that training and developing new and current staff to  fill new roles and work in different ways would be a crucial part of the  federal government\u2019s endeavors to meet future challenges. Agency  officials acknowledge that this is a short-term approach but stated that it  will allow them time to consider the full range of options to best position  its resources while getting the job done. Our work and guidance in this  area indicates that leading organizations develop succession plans that  strategically focus on both the organization\u2019s current and future capacity.  Leading organizations are shifting from a short-term replacement  approach that identifies individuals for a specific vacancy to a strategic  approach that identifies and develops high-potential individuals. Using  certain approaches, such as shifting duties from retired staff to those who  remain\u2014even in the short term\u2014may put the agency at risk because staff  may not be prepared to adequately fulfill new duties. As a result, essential  functions of the agency may suffer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Realignment and Early Out Proposals", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s human capital strategy includes proposals to realign its workforce  and offer early out packages to staff, but as of August 2004, the union had  not agreed to either proposal. The realignment proposal would affect the  Application, School Eligibility, and Delivery Unit (ASEDS), which has  more than 530 employees\u2014nearly half of the agency. This proposal states,  among other things, that FSA would eliminate the office responsible for  providing specific, program-related training for schools participating in the  Direct Loan program because it has decided to adopt an approach that  supports all schools and all student aid programs. As a result of the  realignment, some staff from this office will be reassigned to other units,  as needed. For other staff, the proposal states that because they have skills  that no longer align with the agency\u2019s needs, it would be more cost- effective for the organization to offer \u201cearly out packages\u201d than to engage  in an extensive retraining effort. FSA\u2019s second proposal, which is related  to but not dependent on the implementation of the realignment proposal,  would allow some employees to retire early or receive voluntary  separation payments. The early out packages are intended to provide the  agency with greater flexibility in managing its workforce and recruiting  workers with needed skills. This proposal states that using this approach,  vacancies will be created that will allow FSA to hire individuals that  possess the requisite skills.", "However, FSA and union officials had not reached agreement on the  realignment proposal and had yet to begin discussions on its early out  proposal. According to an agency official, the realignment proposal was  developed over a 6-month period. At the end of May 2004, after the  Secretary of Education gave his approval, FSA submitted the realignment  proposal to the union. The collective bargaining agreement between FSA  and its union states that the union should have the opportunity to review  actions affecting any aspect of employee working conditions, including  those related to training, development, and appraisals. This agreement  requires FSA to share proposals with the union after receiving approval by  the department\u2014which it did. An agency official told us that FSA had not  received input from labor union officials on the agency\u2019s proposed  realignment and that union officials had requested additional information  before agreeing to meet with FSA officials to discuss the proposal. As of  August 2004, FSA had informed the union that it had met its collective  bargaining obligations and would proceed with the implementation of the  realignment proposal during September 2004. As for the early out  proposal, FSA officials told us that it received approval from the Secretary  in early June, and by the month\u2019s close he requested authority from Office  of Personnel Management (OPM) to offer early out packages (i.e., early  retirement options and voluntary separation buyouts). FSA has informed  the union of this proposal and indicated that it would wait until OPM  granted approval before entering into collective bargaining with the union.  As of August 2004, FSA had not received approval from OPM for the early  out packages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Skills Catalog", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to identify the skills and competencies required to perform at  all levels of the agency, FSA revised its Skills Catalog, which should enable  staff to independently plan their professional development. The catalog  was originally created in 2000 and was revised based on a series of  interviews with senior managers and subject matter experts throughout  the agency. Its purposes are to (1) provide a common tool for management  and staff to set expectations, (2) help employees identify opportunities for  development through courses offered externally or by FSA, and (3) assist  managers in future workforce planning efforts. FSA\u2019s 5-year plan indicates  that one potential use of the Skills Catalog would be to identify gaps in  critical competencies and provide employees with information on when  and where additional training and development are needed. We previously  reported that effective training and development programs are an integral  part of a learning environment that can enhance the federal government\u2019s  ability to attract and retain employees with the skills and competencies  needed to achieve results. FSA encouraged its employees to think of the  catalog as a restaurant menu through which they would place an order to  address their individual development needs and contribute to the agency\u2019s  objectives. In addition to listing a set of core competencies that every FSA  employee is expected to demonstrate, the catalog defines three  competency areas for each organizational unit consisting of functions,  skills, and knowledge. FSA has developed draft competencies for all units.  For example, selected competencies listed in the Skills Catalog for staff in  the office of the Chief Financial Officer are summarized in Figure 5.", "FSA introduced online learning tools as an added resource for some staff  who are responsible for providing oversight and determining eligibility of  schools. FSA developed unit-specific online tools, called learning tracks,  designed to improve the skills needed to perform everyday tasks. FSA  created five online tools in fiscal year 2003, and agency officials told us  that they plan to introduce more online tools by fiscal year 2005 that  further address organizational needs, such as tools to enhance  communication and supervisory skills. An FSA official said that the  development of these online tools would be a key part in the agency\u2019s  efforts to strengthen program integrity. According to a draft document on  the tools, the development of learning tracks would shift the agency away  from developing an entire agencywide curriculum based on particular  position descriptions and toward developing resources for specific on-the- job skills. Officials told us that learning tracks have been introduced to  divisions in ASEDS that perform case management and oversight and  determine school eligibility. These learning tracks target the development  of skills, such as data analysis and comprehension, leadership, and critical  thinking.", "Also, FSA continued to support internal and external training  opportunities. FSA offered a wide variety of courses internally through its  Career Zone. In 2003 FSA expanded this office, and contracted services  from two full-time career counselors who began providing individualized  career counseling sessions and career development courses. FSA also  continued to offer its staff a $500 learning coupon, to pay for technical and  work-related external training courses. Officials told us that the coupon  was part of an effort to enable employees to take a proactive approach to  planning their professional development. Around 40 percent of FSA\u2019s staff  used the learning coupon during fiscal years 2003 and 2004, although the  agency had allocated sufficient funds to provide this benefit for up to 50  percent of the staff. While the agency has surveyed staff that used the  learning coupon, officials told us that they were not certain why more staff  did not use it. Our work in this area shows that evaluation is an integral  part of planning that allows agencies to build upon lessons learned and  improve performance. Because the agency has surveyed only coupon  users, officials cannot be assured that the learning coupon is an effective  tool for helping staff develop their skills or that these funds are being  budgeted for likely needs. Officials indicated that they had plans to  broaden their efforts to survey all staff to better understand perceptions  about the coupon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recruitment", "paragraphs": ["To fill vacancies, FSA plans to use a variety of techniques and to recruit  nationwide, governmentwide, and internally.

FSA modified its performance  measurement system, emphasized individual achievement of goals, and  provided bonuses based on individual performance. However, we found  that the criteria for awarding bonuses to senior officials were not clear.", "Beginning in 2001, as a result of a departmentwide initiative, FSA adopted  new performance appraisal systems for all of its employees, including its  SES members and senior managers, to provide the agency with the ability  to make greater distinctions in performance. Before the new systems  were adopted, all department employees were evaluated on a pass-fail  basis. The new system for SES uses three performance levels, while the  new system for senior managers and others uses five performance levels.  Our body of work in this area suggests that effective performance  management systems allow organizations to make meaningful distinctions  in performance. By utilizing multiple performance categories, FSA has  improved its ability to make distinctions in performance among its senior  officials and increase accountability.", "The 2003 performance agreements we reviewed for both types of senior  officials\u2014SES and senior managers\u2014emphasized individual achievement  of goals. Prior to 2003, performance agreements specified (1) how a senior  official\u2019s performance would be evaluated; (2) individual projects and  activities to be performed by the official; and (3) six organizational, or  \u201ccross-cutting,\u201d goals to which all senior officials were expected to  contribute. For the 2003 performance period, SES agreements for senior  officials included three performance element groups: (1) leadership,  management, and coaching; (2) work quality, productivity, and customer  service; and (3) organizational priorities/job specifics. For each senior  official at FSA, the organizational priorities/job specifics performance  element primarily consisted of unique individual goals for which the  official has responsibility and for which he or she is held accountable.  However, FSA\u2019s emphasis on individual goals still included the use of  organizational, or cross-cutting, goals\u2014only to a lesser extent. But we also  found that the use of such goals has become more strategic. FSA\u2019s fiscal  year 2003 annual plan contained at least four such cross-cutting goals,  including goals to implement a data strategy and enhance program  monitoring and oversight. Having performance agreements that consist of  both job-specific individual and cross-cutting organizational goals  reinforces accountability for both individual and organizational success.  We view the use of collaborative efforts as a key practice in achieving  results. Figure 6 illustrates the change from organizational goals used in  the fiscal year 2002 performance agreements to individual goals in FSA\u2019s  2003 performance agreements.", "The HEA specifies that performance agreements should reflect the  organization\u2019s measurable performance goals. However, not all individual  goals in the performance agreements we reviewed were aligned with FSA\u2019s  annual plan. We were provided the 2003 performance agreements for 11  senior officials and found that 6 of them had goals that were not included  in FSA\u2019s 2003 annual plan. According to FSA officials, some of these  individuals were serving in acting capacities and would not have  performance agreements that directly conformed to the organization\u2019s  annual plan until they assumed the jobs permanently. Additionally, FSA  officials stated that many of the goals for these 6 senior officials were not  included in the fiscal year 2003 annual plan because the plan did not  include daily operational activities. For instance, the duties of the  Ombudsman were not included in the fiscal year 2003 annual plan. The  Ombudsman\u2019s agreement required that official to identify regulatory  limitations that may serve as the basis for borrower complaints and to  meet statutory mandates for distributing public information, among other  things. Other senior officials had daily operational activities included in  their performance agreements, such as (1) ensure that all FSA contracts  support the core operation and support functions required to implement  the agency\u2019s organizational strategy, and (2) acquire knowledge of all  collection group activities, including information systems and staff duties.  According to agency officials, FSA has changed its approach for  constructing its annual plan and included daily operational activities as  well as the top organizational priorities in its fiscal year 2004 plan.", "FSA also changed the way bonuses are awarded to senior officials to  emphasize individual performance, but the criteria used to make these  decisions are not readily apparent. In previous years, bonuses were  awarded to senior officials based in equal parts on a manager\u2019s overall  contributions to the organization and achievement of the organizational  goals. Beginning in fiscal year 2003, FSA\u2019s COO took steps to modify this  practice by basing performance awards on the achievement of goals  related to each official\u2019s area of responsibility. According to the COO, this  approach better ensures that only officials who have achieved goals  important to the organization receive bonuses. Under the previous system,  a manager that accomplished some, but not all, of his or her goals could  still receive a bonus if the organization as a whole was successful. The  COO told us that this arrangement had a crippling effect on accountability  in the organization. By making officials accountable for individual goals,  FSA can reward individuals that are successful even when the  organization as a whole is not. We were also told that under the new  system for awarding bonuses, the COO could make distinctions based on  the level of responsibility carried by managers\u2014those who accomplish  tasks that diminish the risks and challenges faced by FSA could receive  bigger bonuses than those who perform equally well but are in jobs that  are considered less demanding. For example, it is possible for a manager  who is responsible for systems integration to receive a larger bonus than a  manager of an area deemed less critical, even if both received the same  rating.", "However, FSA has not established or communicated its criteria for  awarding bonuses, which has the potential to undermine its other efforts  to increase accountability of officials. Under the previous system, the  criteria were articulated in managers\u2019 performance agreements.  Specifically, the agreements stated that 50 percent of the bonuses would  be determined based on a manger\u2019s overall contributions to the  organization and the other 50 percent would be determined based on  whether the agency as a whole was successful. The new agreements do  not include such information. When we asked some senior officials to  explain the criteria to us or provide related documentation, we were  referred to the COO. The COO discussed the criteria and noted that the  process for awarding bonuses was still under review. However, we were  told that every manager was familiar with the process. The COO also  stated that the final determination of whether or not a manager received a  bonus was at the COO\u2019s discretion. Furthermore, responsible agency  officials provided us with inconsistent information as to which senior  officials received bonuses. Although the agency has taken additional steps  to increase the accountability of its officials, the lack of clear criteria and  transparency in the process for awarding performance bonuses could  undermine the other efforts to increase accountability, such as using a  system with three performance levels to evaluate and distinguish  performance. Part of fostering a results-oriented culture requires having a  process for making awards for contributions to the organization in a way  that is consistent, reliable, and transparent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FSA has devoted substantial time and resources to addressing  management weaknesses and has made significant progress in some areas.

Without such information in the  performance report, FSA has not clearly informed the Congress or the  public about its progress toward achieving its purposes established by law.", "FSA has also made progress in addressing its human capital management  challenges, but weaknesses remain. The succession plan did not identify  developmental projects or training for staff that would assume the duties  of those who retired. These staff may not be able to perform their new  duties, and the agency may not have staff with needed skills in all  positions. As a result, the agency\u2019s ability to continue to make progress  and fulfill its mission in an effective and efficient way may be hindered.  Further, although FSA has devoted funds for the use of learning coupons  to support external training, it does not know why these coupons are  underutilized because the agency has not surveyed all of its employees to  ascertain their views about their usefulness. Systematic evaluation of  human capital initiatives is an integral part of planning that allows  agencies to improve and invest wisely. Without such evaluation, FSA may  not be investing its resources wisely. If FSA has excess funds budgeted for  its learning coupons, funds may not be available to support other  programs or agency projects.", "Further, although FSA has taken several steps to increase the  accountability of its senior officials, the agency has not clearly  communicated its criteria for awarding bonuses to senior officials.
