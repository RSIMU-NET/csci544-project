For the draft report on which this testimony is based, GAO analyzed documentation, administered a questionnaire, and interviewed officials from the 24 CFO Act agencies that led or participated in SSN elimination efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its draft report, GAO noted that several governmentwide initiatives aimed at eliminating the unnecessary collection, use, and display of Social Security numbers (SSN) have been underway in response to recommendations that the presidentially appointed Identity Theft Task Force made in 2007 to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Social Security Administration (SSA). However, these initiatives have had limited success. In 2008, OPM proposed a new regulation requiring the use of an alternate federal employee identifier but withdrew its proposed regulation because no such identifier was available. OMB required agencies to develop SSN reduction plans and continues to require annual reporting on SSN reduction efforts. SSA developed an online clearinghouse of best practices associated with the reduction of SSN use; however, the clearinghouse is no longer available online.", "All 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act developed SSN reduction plans and reported taking actions to curtail the use and display of the numbers. Nevertheless, in their responses to GAO's questionnaire and follow-up discussions, the agencies cited impediments to further reductions, including (1) statutes and regulations mandating the collection of SSNs, (2) the use of SSNs in necessary interactions with other federal entities, and (3) technological constraints of agency systems and processes.", "Further, poor planning by agencies and ineffective monitoring by OMB have limited efforts to reduce SSN use. Lacking direction from OMB, many agencies' reduction plans did not include key elements, such as time frames and performance indicators, calling into question their utility. In addition, OMB has not required agencies to maintain up-to-date inventories of their SSN holdings or provided criteria for determining \u201cunnecessary use and display,\u201d limiting agencies' ability to gauge progress. In addition, OMB has not ensured that agencies update their annual progress nor has it established performance metrics to monitor agency efforts to reduce SSN use. Until OMB adopts more effective practices for guiding agency SSN reduction efforts, overall governmentwide reduction will likely remain limited and difficult to measure, and the risk of SSNs being exposed and used to commit identity theft will remain greater than it need be."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's draft report contains five recommendations to OMB to require agencies to submit complete plans for ongoing reductions in the collection, use, and display of SSNs; require inventories of systems containing SSNs; provide criteria for determining \u201cunnecessary\u201d use and display of SSNs; ensure agencies update their progress in reducing the collection, use, and display of the numbers in annual reports; and monitor agency progress based on clearly defined performance measures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me to testify at today\u2019s hearing on executive branch  efforts to reduce the unnecessary use of Social Security numbers (SSN).

Originally, the SSN was not intended  to serve as a personal identifier but, due to its universality and  uniqueness, government agencies and private sector entities now use it  as a convenient means of identifying people. The number uniquely links  identities across a very broad array of public and private sector  information systems. As of September 2016, SSA had issued  approximately 496 million unique SSNs to eligible individuals.", "In 2006, the President issued an Executive Order establishing the Identity  Theft Task Force to strengthen efforts to protect against identity theft.  Because the unauthorized use of SSNs was recognized as a key element  of identity theft, the task force assessed the actions the government could  take to reduce the exposure of SSNs to potential compromise. In April  2007, the task force issued a strategic plan, which advocated a unified  federal approach, or standard, for using and displaying SSNs. The plan  proposed that OPM, OMB, and SSA play key roles in restricting the  unnecessary use of the numbers, offering guidance on substitutes that  are less valuable to identity thieves, and promoting consistency when the  use of SSNs was found to be necessary or unavoidable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM, OMB, and SSA Have Had Limited Success in Assisting With Governmentwide Reduction in the Collection, Use, and Display of SSNs", "paragraphs": ["In response to the recommendations of the Identity Theft Task Force,  OPM, OMB, and SSA undertook several actions aimed at reducing or  eliminating the unnecessary collection, use, and display of SSNs.

In addition, in 2007, OPM issued  guidance to other federal agencies on actions they should take to protect  federal employee SSNs and combat identity theft. The guidance  reminded agencies of existing federal regulations that restricted the  collection and use of SSNs and also specified additional measures.", "In addition to issuing this guidance, in January 2008, OPM proposed a  new regulation regarding the collection, use, and display of SSNs that  would have codified the practices outlined in its 2007 guidance and that  also required the use of an alternate identifier. However, in January  2010, after reviewing comments it had received, OPM withdrew the  notice of proposed rulemaking because the agency determined that it  would be impractical to issue the rule without an alternate  governmentwide employee identifier in place.", "In 2015, OPM briefly began exploring the concept of developing and  using multiple alternate identifiers for different programs and agencies. As  envisioned, an SSN would be collected only once, at the start of an  employee\u2019s service, after which unique identifiers specific to relevant  programs, such as healthcare benefits or training, would be assigned as  needed.

Until guidance for agencies is developed in the form of criteria for making  decisions about what types of collections and uses of SSNs are  unnecessary, agency efforts to reduce the unnecessary use of SSNs  likely will continue to vary, and, as a result, the risk of unnecessarily  exposing SSNs to identity theft may not be thoroughly mitigated.", "Agencies have not always submitted up-to-date status reports, and  OMB has not set performance measures to monitor agency efforts  In its Fiscal Year 2008 Report to Congress on Implementation of the  Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, OMB recognized  that agencies\u2019 SSN reduction plans needed to be monitored. OMB  reported that the reduction plans that agencies submitted for fiscal year  2008 displayed varying levels of detail and comprehensiveness and  stated that agency reduction efforts would require ongoing oversight.  Subsequently, OMB required agencies to report on the progress of their  SSN reduction efforts through their annual FISMA reports.", "However, preliminary findings in our draft report show that annual  updates submitted by the 24 CFO Act agencies as part of their FISMA  reports from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015 did not always  include updated information about specific agency efforts and results achieved, making it difficult to determine the status of activities that had  been undertaken. Further, the annual updates did not include  performance metrics. OMB did not establish specific performance metrics  to monitor implementation of planned reduction efforts. Its guidance  asked agencies to submit their most current documentation on their plans  and progress, but it did not establish performance metrics or ask for  updates on achieving the performances metrics or targets that agencies  had defined in their plans.", "Although in 2016, OMB began requesting additional status information  related to agency SSN reduction programs, it did not establish metrics for  measuring agency progress in reducing the unnecessary collection and  use of SSNs. Without performance metrics, it will remain difficult for OMB  to determine whether agencies have achieved their goals in eliminating  the unnecessary collection and use of SSNs or whether corrective actions  are needed.", "In conclusion, based on preliminary information from our study of federal  SSN reduction efforts, the initiatives that the 24 CFO Act agencies have  undertaken show that it is possible to identify and eliminate the  unnecessary use and display of SSNs. However, it is difficult to determine  what overall progress has been made in achieving this goal across the  government. Not all agencies developed effective SSN reduction plans,  maintained up-to-date inventories of their SSN collection and use, or  applied consistent definitions of \u201cunnecessary\u201d collection, use, and  display of SSNs. Further, agencies have not always submitted up-to-date  status reports to OMB, and OMB has not established performance  measures to monitor agency efforts. Until OMB and agencies adopt better  and more consistent practices for managing their SSN reduction  processes, overall governmentwide reduction efforts will likely remain  limited and difficult to measure; moreover, the risk of SSNs being  exposed and used to commit identity theft will remain greater than it need  be.", "Accordingly, our draft report contains five recommendations to OMB to  improve the consistency and effectiveness of governmentwide efforts to  reduce the unnecessary use of SSNs and thereby mitigate the risk of  identity theft. Specifically, the report recommends that OMB:  specify elements that agency plans for reducing the unnecessary  collection, use, and display of SSNs should contain and require all  agencies to develop and maintain complete plans;  require agencies to modify their inventories of systems containing PII  to indicate which systems contain SSNs and use the inventories to  monitor their reduction of unnecessary collection and use of SSNs; provide criteria to agencies on how to determine unnecessary use of  SSNs to facilitate consistent application across the federal  government;  take steps to ensure that agencies provide up-to-date status reports  on their progress in eliminating unnecessary SSN collection, use, and  display in their annual FISMA reports; and establish performance measures to monitor agency progress in  consistently and effectively implementing planned reduction efforts.", "Chairman Johnson and Hurd, Ranking Members Larson and Kelly, and  Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared statement.
