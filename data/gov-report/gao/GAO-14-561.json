Until recently, CTP has not had performance measures for making final decisions on new tobacco product submissions by which to assess its progress, as GAO previously recommended. FDA has announced performance measures for two of its new tobacco product review processes (to take effect in October 2014), but not for the type of new tobacco product submission that comprises the bulk of FDA's review backlog. The agency has indicated that it intends to establish such performance measures, but until it does so, the agency's ability to assess its efforts will be limited.

As of  March 31, 2014, FDA published four import alerts, including one for  flavored cigarettes; one for regulated tobacco products using \u201clight,\u201d  \u201cmild,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d in advertising or labeling; one for smokeless tobacco  products without the required warning label; and one for tobacco products  found to be not substantially equivalent\u2014and refused the entry of two  tobacco product imports.", "OCE also assists OS in the tobacco product review process by  determining if the tobacco product to which the new tobacco product is  being compared in an SE submission meets the statutory requirements  for a predicate tobacco product. In fiscal years 2011 through 2013, OCE  completed over 1,350 predicate eligibility determinations. In addition,  OCE is responsible for ensuring that the tobacco products in provisional  SE submissions found to be not substantially equivalent are no longer  sold or distributed in the United States as of the date on the FDA-issued  not substantially equivalent order.", "Promotion, Advertising, and Labeling Surveillance  FDA also conducts surveillance activities for the promotion, advertising,  and labeling of tobacco products. CTP\u2019s OCE conducts routine monitoring  and surveillance of websites and social media, publications, and tobacco  industry promotion and sponsorship of events that sell, distribute,  promote, or advertise regulated tobacco products; and reviews and  evaluates regulatory submissions of tobacco product labeling, advertising,  and consumer information materials. Additionally, CTP\u2019s OCE is  responsible for ensuring that warning statements on smokeless tobacco  product labeling and advertising are in compliance with requirements in  the Tobacco Control Act, such as the packaging and advertising bearing  the warning statement. From fiscal year 2010 through March 31, 2014,  OCE officials reported monitoring over 3,000 websites and over 68,000  issues of publications, resulting in 155 warning letters to manufacturers,  distributors, and online retailers for violations. For example, warning  letters were issued to (1) a website for selling clove cigarettes, a  regulated tobacco product containing a characterizing flavor which is  prohibited under the Tobacco Control Act; (2) a tobacco manufacturer for  promoting the sale of cigarette tobacco (a regulated tobacco product)  labeled as pipe tobacco (an unregulated tobacco product) on its website;  and (3) a manufacturer for offering its tobacco products online as \u201clight\u201d  and \u201cmild\u201d without an FDA order to market a modified risk tobacco  product.", "Outreach and Small Business Assistance  In addition to the three key compliance and enforcement activities  mentioned above, CTP also conducts outreach and small business  assistance activities to help ensure compliance with the Tobacco Control  Act and regulations. OCE and its Office of Small Business Assistance are  responsible for outreach and small business assistance. According to  FDA officials, these activities include responding to inquiries from small  manufacturers and retailers and providing information on relevant tobacco  guidance and regulations, primarily through webinars that addressed  certain topics, such as common issues identified during FDA\u2019s scientific  evaluation of substantial equivalence reports and regulations regarding  distribution of free samples of smokeless tobacco."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FDA Encountered Challenges As It Established CTP, Including Setting Review Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["FDA faced challenges related to starting up a new center, which affected  CTP\u2019s efforts to educate the public, build the regulatory science base, and  enforce the new law and regulations. While FDA officials indicated that  the agency has taken steps to address some of the challenges it faced\u2014 such as those related to contracting and staffing\u2014challenges related to  building the scientific basis for regulating a previously unregulated  product and setting review time frames remain. Despite these challenges,  neither FDA officials nor public health and tobacco industry stakeholders  identified any limitations in FDA\u2019s authority to carry out its responsibilities  under the Tobacco Control Act.", "According to CTP officials, one challenge FDA encountered, but which  they believe the agency has addressed, was a lack of an acquisitions  infrastructure that would allow it to quickly award contracts for public  education activities. According to these officials, FDA had to develop a  contracting mechanism of a sufficient size and scope to allow FDA to  solicit and award large public education campaign contracts, which had  never been done by the agency before. This process also included  determining the type of contracts to award. The officials said that it took  about 2 years before two pools of contractors were established, from  which FDA could draw for future public education campaigns, delaying  public education campaigns that were originally slated to launch in fiscal  year 2012. CTP officials reported it was important to build an FDA  contracting infrastructure for these campaigns, because public education  activities are FDA\u2019s continuing responsibility. CTP officials stated that to  decrease the toll of tobacco use on public health, public education  activities must be managed by FDA, with a sustained fiscal and personnel  commitment. While doing so delayed efforts to launch its public education  campaigns, CTP officials told us they do not expect similar delays in the  future.", "Additionally, according to CTP officials, CTP\u2019s OCE faced initial  challenges in getting up and running\u2014in particular in setting up the  retailer inspection program, including the contracts for the program.  According to CTP officials, in a very short period of time and with limited  staff in place, CTP\u2019s OCE had to draft an initial request for proposals to  award contracts to states and help them navigate through the contracting  process, commission state and territorial officials to conduct retail  compliance inspections, develop and implement training programs for  inspectors, coordinators, and retailers, and develop a new information  technology system to collect and report retailer compliance inspection  data. However, these officials reported that since the early stages of the  tobacco program, the center has built a strong FDA tobacco compliance  and enforcement infrastructure, and noted that if additional tobacco  products are deemed to fall under the authority of CTP, they should be  able to expand and cover them relatively easily."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In the 5 years since the Tobacco Control Act was enacted, FDA has set  up a new center and undertaken numerous activities to regulate a  previously unregulated product using a public health standard, and the  agency remains in the process of conducting research and setting up its  regulatory structure. FDA has taken some steps to address our previous  recommendation to institute performance measures for its review of new  tobacco products by establishing time frames for regular SE and  Exemption from SE submissions, as well as for MRTP submissions, and  by planning to monitor its progress towards meeting those time frames.  However, we remain concerned that the agency has not yet established  any performance measures for the more than 3,000 provisional SE  submissions, representing tobacco products that can stay on the market  unless and until FDA finds them not substantially equivalent. It is  important that the agency move forward on reviewing these  submissions\u2014particularly, those that FDA has identified as having the  greatest potential to have a public health impact\u2014to ensure that only  products that meet the act\u2019s requirements are permitted to be on the  market. The agency has indicated that it intends to identify and implement  performance measures for these provisional SE submissions as it gains  more experience reviewing them. We continue to believe that until FDA  establishes performance measures including time frames for completing  reviews of the large backlog of provisional SE submissions, the agency\u2019s  ability to operate efficiently, achieve effective results, and plan  appropriately will be hampered. This will be particularly pressing as FDA  moves forward with plans to deem additional types of tobacco products to  be subject to its regulatory authority, which has the potential to generate a  substantial number of new submissions requiring review. Similarly, it will  be important for the agency to establish time frames for submissions for  any newly deemed products, as FDA has indicated that the just-released  time frames will not apply to submissions for newly-deemed products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment, and its comments  are reproduced in appendix IV. HHS agreed with the need for  performance measures related to its new tobacco product review  process. In its comments, the department noted several reasons why it  has been difficult for FDA to set performance measures for provisional SE  submissions. According to HHS, FDA received a large number of  provisional SE submissions in a short period of time, which required the  agency to prioritize the review process based on the complexity of the  public health concerns likely to be raised by the products under review.  As a result, HHS noted that the initial reviews are more complicated, with  unpredictable time frames. Additionally, because provisional SE  submissions were received early in CTP\u2019s SE review process, HHS  commented that many submissions have deficiencies that require  corrections from manufacturers and further slows the review and approval  process. However, HHS noted that the knowledge gained during the  review of provisional SE submissions will inform the process in the future  and allow FDA to eventually set performance goals for these  submissions.", "While we acknowledge there are complexities to the provisional SE  review process, we believe that it is critical that FDA set performance  measures for managing the review process of provisional SE  submissions, including establishing time frames for review and monitoring  progress toward meeting those time frames.
