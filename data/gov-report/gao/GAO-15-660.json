For example, in 2014, the Corps issued guidance on how to evaluate the effects of projected future sea level change on its projects and what to consider when adapting projects to this projected change. In addition, Corps districts prepare water control manuals, guidance outlining project operations. The Corps can approve deviations from the manuals to alleviate critical situations, such as extreme weather events. For example, in December 2014, the Corps approved a deviation from operations at a southern California dam, which allowed the Corps to retain rainwater to help respond to the state's extreme drought conditions.", "The Corps has assessed certain water resources infrastructure projects to determine whether they are designed to withstand extreme weather events.

Unlike the requirements for dams and levees, the Corps is not required to perform systematic, national risk assessments on other types of existing infrastructure, such as hurricane barriers and floodwalls and has not done so (see table). However, the Corps has been required to assess such infrastructure after an extreme weather event in response to statutory requirements, as it did in November 2013 and in January 2015, after Hurricane Sandy. Also, the Corps has performed initial vulnerability assessments for sea level rise on its coastal projects and has begun conducting such assessments at inland watersheds.", "Unlike federal agencies that have budgets established for broad program activities, most Corps civil works funds are appropriated for specific projects.

For example, CWMS allows the  districts to simulate different operational scenarios to determine which  one will more likely result in higher downstream water levels due to a  large storm. According to Corps documentation, information from the  simulation is intended to help the districts assess the economic,  environmental, life safety, and other consequences, such as those from  an extreme weather event, of different operational scenarios and lead to  better-informed operational decisions. For example, Los Angeles district  officials told us that CWMS models are being calibrated for expected  maximum flood conditions which can allow them to better forecast runoff  volumes in areas prone to extreme weather events. According to Corps  documents, CWMS also will support rapid flood forecasting by the district  and help reduce the potential for flooding in the basin. CWMS has been  deployed to 35 of 38 districts since 2009 but has not yet been fully  integrated into all Corps districts, and the watershed and channel models  have not been fully implemented as of June 2015. The Corps plans to  complete integrating CWMS into all districts by the end of 2015, and an  effort is under way to have the watershed and channel models fully  integrated by 2023 or earlier, depending on funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Collaborates with Key Stakeholders to Plan and Operate Water Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has taken steps to prepare for extreme weather through its  participation in various collaboration efforts with federal agencies and  other stakeholders at both the regional and national levels.", "At the regional level, Corps district officials told us that their collaboration  with federal agencies and local stakeholders is sufficient for effective  planning and operation of water infrastructure. Corps officials told us they  regularly collaborate with federal agencies and local stakeholders to help  ensure that they have the weather and climate data needed to plan and  operate water infrastructure and to address extreme weather in a  coordinated manner. For example, Alaska district officials told us their  district has a long history of collaborating with NWS and USGS to monitor  data across the remote areas of Alaska and now collaborates with these  agencies using a geostationary satellite. Little Rock district officials told us  they participate with agency officials from USGS and NOAA, as well as  other stakeholders, at Tri-Agency Fusion Team meetings to discuss ways  to improve the accuracy of the data generated by the agencies and  improve the accuracy and utility of rainfall observations and river  forecasts. Savannah district officials told us they regularly communicate  with NWS officials in advance of and during extreme weather events.  Within certain regions, Corps district officials told us they regularly interact  with state and federal officials through the Silver Jackets program to,  among other things, identify gaps among agency programs, leverage  information and resources, and provide access to national programs such  as the Corps Levee Inventory and Assessment Initiative. The Corps is  also conducting regional pilot studies nationwide to test different methods  and frameworks for adapting to climate change in which they involve  numerous stakeholders. For example, four Corps districts completed an  Ohio River Basin pilot study in 2013 in which the districts worked with  more than 70 stakeholders, including federal and state agencies,  academia, and private entities. The pilot study considered the potential  effects of climate change on future management of water resources,  including 83 Corps dams, 131 levees and floodwalls, and 63 navigational  locks in the 204,000 square miles of the basin. As a result of this pilot  study, a consortium of basin interests convened the Ohio River Basin  Alliance to address common interests in water resources and basin-wide  climate change issues.", "Corps district officials told us that they may also interact with state  agencies, universities, and private industry to collect data that may not be  collected by federal agencies. For example, Little Rock district officials  told us they have used the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and  Snow Network, in which precipitation data are collected by volunteer  citizens and published daily on the Internet by Colorado State University.  Walla Walla district officials have been participating with the University of  Washington since 2012 in support of the Columbia River Treaty analysis  that involves information on data collection, modeling, and trends on  future weather and climate changes predicted for the region. Some  districts told us they also have gained valuable and up-to-date technical  information on engineering and design techniques from private industry  associations and made key contacts at industry conferences. However,  all the districts we spoke with told us they face challenges in attending  weather-related conferences sponsored by entities other than the federal  government due to changes in Department of Defense conference  policies.", "Corps officials also collaborate with other federal agencies and  stakeholders at the national level to identify data gaps that may exist and  disseminate critical water resource information and data. For example,  Corps headquarters officials have participated in the Climate Change and  Water Working Group, a working-level forum established to share  information and accelerate the application of climate information in water  management, among other things. Through this group, the Corps along  with local, state, and federal water management agencies, have  examined water user needs for climate and weather information for long-  and short-term water resources planning and management and have   We have previously reported the  issued two reports on their findings.

However, Corps officials said  they have been required to assess such infrastructure after an extreme  weather event in response to statutory requirements. The Corps has also  performed some preliminary vulnerability assessments for sea level rise  on its coastal projects and is beginning to conduct vulnerability  assessments of inland watersheds to determine how a changing climate  is affecting those projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Corps Performs Risk Assessments on Dams and Levees but Does Not Assess Other Types of Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["The Corps performs risk assessments of its dams and levees through two  national programs\u2014the Dam Safety Program and the Levee Safety  Program\u2014but does not have similar programs in place for other types of  infrastructure. As part of its Dam Safety Program, from 2005 to 2009,  the Corps performed a screening of 706 of its 707 dams to determine  which of its five risk classifications those dams fell under\u2014very high urgency, high urgency, moderate urgency, low urgency, and normal.This risk classification addresses the probability of failure and resulting  potential consequences due to failure. Part of the assessment determines  whether the dams are designed and operated in such a way that, during a  potential flood event, the downstream flooding would not be more severe  than flooding if the dam did not exist. The risk assessment also takes into  account the likelihood of an extreme weather event. According to Corps  officials, all Corps-operated dams will undergo periodic assessments  every 10 years because the risk at any given dam may change over time.  The Corps has also established the Risk Management Center as a  resource to manage and assess risks to dams and levee systems, and  the Dam Safety Modification Mandatory Center of Expertise to provide  technical advice, oversight, review, and production capability to districts  performing any dam modifications in response to the risk assessment.  The Dam Safety Modification Mandatory Center of Expertise also  maintains a list of subject matter experts in the field of dam safety whose  names are accessible via the Internet.", "The Corps assesses the risk of its dams through the Dam Safety  Program, but not all dam safety modification projects have been funded.  More specifically, the Corps\u2019 initial screening of dams, completed in 2009,  found that 18 dams fell under the very high urgency classification, 83  dams fell under the high urgency classification, 219 dams fell under the  moderate urgency classification, and the remaining 386 dams fell under  the low urgency classification. For those dams in the very high urgency,  high urgency, and moderate urgency classifications, the Corps guidance  directs that an Interim Risk Reduction Measures Plan be developed,  which is a temporary approach to reduce dam safety risks while long-term  solutions are being pursued. The Corps found that completing dam safety  modifications on its dams in the three most urgent classifications would  cost more than $23 billion. The cost for dam safety modifications for the  very high urgency classification was about $4.2 billion; the high urgency  classification cost was about $7 billion, and the moderate urgency  classification cost was about $12 billion. According to Corps officials, from  fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2014, the Corps received about $2.5  billion in appropriations to begin dam safety modification studies and  construction on 15 very high urgency dams. As of June 2015, dam safety  modification construction has been completed on seven very high  urgency dams, and the Corps was working on the other eight. Corps  officials we spoke with in two districts said that they recognize that dams  in other districts may fall into the very high urgency classification for  modifications, but the dams in their own district, which are in the high  urgency classification, are also at a high risk of failure should an extreme  weather event occur.", "The Corps also operates the Levee Safety Program, which began in  2006. According to the Corps, although the Dam and Levee Safety  Programs are similar in their approach to risk assessments, the Levee  Safety Program has not progressed as quickly, largely because the Corps  owns and operates less than 20 percent of the 14,700 miles of levees that  fall under the program. Until 2009, the Corps collected information on  14,700 miles of levees for inclusion in the National Levee Database.  Since that time, the Corps has been conducting risk assessments of the  14,700 miles of levees that are included in the Levee Safety Program.  The 14,700 miles of levees are divided into 2,887 segments, and risk  assessments have been completed for about 43 percent of those  segments as of April 2015. The Levee Safety Program risk assessments  are to take into account the likelihood of an extreme weather event and  how a levee will perform during that event. Based on the risk  assessments that have been completed as of April 2015, 1 percent of  those levees are classified as very high urgency, 8 percent are classified  as high urgency, 27 percent are classified as moderate urgency, and 64  percent are classified as low urgency. Based on the risk assessments  completed, as of June 2015, the Corps has not begun making  improvements to any of the levees it owns and operates because it is still  conducting the risk assessments and will prioritize any improvements  once those assessments are complete. Improvements made to the non- Corps levees based on the results of the risk assessment are at the  discretion of the local sponsor, with advice from the Corps on risk  reduction measures.", "Unlike the requirements for the Dam Safety and Levee Safety Programs,  the agency is not required to perform risk assessments on other types of  existing infrastructure, such as hurricane barriers and floodwalls, and it  has not yet conducted an inventory of other types of infrastructure.  According to Corps officials, the agency has not performed systematic,  national risk assessments on other types of existing infrastructure given  funding limitations (see table 2). However, the Corps has received  appropriations for and has been required to assess such infrastructure  after an extreme weather event, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane  Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.", "Subsequent to Hurricane Sandy, for example, the Corps released, in  November 2013, an assessment of the performance of specific projects  and, in January 2015, a more general assessment of the North Atlantic  coastline. The project-specific performance assessment evaluated 75  constructed coastal storm risk management projects in the Corps\u2019 North  Atlantic Division, which extends from Maine to Virginia, 31 projects in the  Great Lakes and Ohio River Division, and 9 projects in the South Atlantic  Division. For the more general assessment, the Corps looked at the risk  along 31,000 miles of Atlantic Ocean shoreline from Virginia to New  Hampshire as a system. The Corps divided the area into multiple areas  of coastline that were hydraulically separate from one another, studying  the risk of flood, as well as the exposure of the populations, exposure by  population density, infrastructure density, vulnerability by socioeconomic  factors, and vulnerability of environmental resources and cultural  resources. This risk assessment identified, among other things, nine high- risk areas of the North Atlantic Coast that warrant additional analyses to  address coastal flood risk. As of June 2015, the Corps has made no  improvements to its projects based on the general risk assessment in the  Corps\u2019 study of Hurricane Sandy, which was made final in January 2015.  However, according to Corps officials, many projects identified in the  project-specific assessment received funding for and received repair and  restoration through the Corps\u2019 Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies  Program.", "The Corps conducted these risk assessments following Hurricanes  Katrina and Sandy after receiving an appropriation for and being required  by law to conduct them, as the Corps does not generally receive funding  for broad program activities, such as risk assessments on infrastructure  other than dams and levees. However, the Corps has not worked with  Congress to develop a more stable funding approach, as we  recommended in September 2010, which could facilitate such risk  assessments. That report found that a more stable funding approach could improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Civil Works  program. The department partially concurred with our recommendation,  stating that it would promote efficient funding.

In one pilot, through a vulnerability  assessment of a hurricane barrier in New England that was designed in  1962 to provide navigation and flood risk reduction benefits for the area  surrounding a harbor, the Corps found the project had experienced a 6- inch loss from its design elevation due to sea level rise. The hurricane  barrier was listed as having potentially high impact from sea level rise in  the screening assessment. The more detailed pilot assessment identified  a potential future loss of elevation of between 6 inches and 2 feet 3  inches by 2065. Based on Corps data, the change in sea level has  resulted in a reduction in the distance between the top of the water and  the top of the hurricane barrier from 17 feet at its design to 16.5 feet  currently, and potentially down to 14.25 feet within 50 years (see fig. 2).  According to Corps officials, these future changes in distance between  the top of the sea and the top of the hurricane barrier can result in a  greater risk of floods and more operations of the navigation gate, which in  turn reduces navigation reliability and increases maintenance costs. The  Corps had initially planned to release a draft report on the initial coastal  vulnerability assessment in December 2014 but, as of June 2015, the  final report had not been released.
