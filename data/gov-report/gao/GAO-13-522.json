This report (1) describes these contractors and (2) assesses the extent to which requirements for postpayment claims reviews differ across the contractors and whether differences, if any, could impede effective and efficient claims reviews.

These contractors include (1) Medicare Administrative Contractors that process and pay claims and are responsible for taking actions to reduce payment errors in their jurisdictions; (2) Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC) that investigate potential fraud, which can result in referrals to law enforcement or administrative actions; (3) Recovery Auditors (RA) tasked to identify improper payments on a postpayment basis; and (4) the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) contractor that reviews a sample of claims nationwide and related documentation to determine a national Medicare FFS improper payment rate. All four types of contractors conduct complex reviews, in which the contractor examines medical records and other documentation sent by providers to determine if the claims meet Medicare coverage and payment requirements. RAs are paid fees contingent on the amount of the claims that are found improper and recouped or adjusted, whereas the other contractors' reimbursement is not dependent on the amount of their claims reviews. The RAs conducted almost five times as many reviews as the other three contractors combined. Overall, compared to over one 1 billion claims processed in 2012, all four types of contractors combined reviewed less than one 1 percent of claims, about 1.4 million reviews, for which providers might be contacted to send in medical records or other documentation.", "Although postpayment claims reviews involve the same general process regardless of which type of contractor conducts them, CMS has different requirements for many aspects of the process across these four contractor types. Some of these differences may impede efficiency and effectiveness of claims reviews by increasing administrative burden for providers. There are differences in oversight of claims selection, time frames for providers to send in documentation, communications to providers about the reviews, reviewer staffing, and processes to ensure the quality of claims reviews. For example, while the CERT contractor must give a provider 75 days to respond to a request for documentation before it can find the claim improper due to lack of documentation, the ZPIC is only required to give the provider 30 days. CMS places more limits on the RAs in its requirements for reviews conducted by them than by other contractors. For example, RAs must submit the criteria that they will use to determine if a service is paid improperly to CMS for approval. The additional requirements for RAs are due in part to CMS's experience during an initial demonstration testing the use of RAs. CMS officials indicated that other requirement differences across contractors generally developed due to setting requirements at different times by staff in different parts of the agency. Providers indicated that some differences hindered their understanding of and compliance with the claims review process. Having inefficient processes that complicate compliance can reduce effectiveness of claims reviews, and is inconsistent with executive-agency guidelines to streamline service delivery and with having a strong internal control environment. CMS has begun to examine differences in requirements across contractors, but did not provide information on any specific changes being considered or a time frame for action."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) examine all contractor postpayment review requirements to determine those that could be made more consistent, (2) communicate its findings and time frame for taking action, and (3) reduce differences where it can be done without impeding efforts to reduce improper payments.

Improper Medicare payments include payments made for  treatments or services that were not covered by program rules, that were  not medically necessary, or that were not provided to beneficiaries in the  way that they were billed to Medicare. In fiscal year 2012, the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimated the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers  the Medicare program\u2014made improper payments of $32.4 billion in the  Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program.", "CMS has a goal to reduce improper payments in the Medicare program  and conducts a number of activities in order to protect the integrity of the  program\u2014that is, to ensure that payments are made correctly the first  time and to identify, investigate, and recoup payments made in error. One  such activity, reviewing claims to ensure that claims are paid properly,  can be done before payment (prepayment claims reviews) or after  payment (postpayment claims reviews). Claims reviews may be  automated, relying on computer programming logic, or they may involve  manually examining claims and related documentation, including medical  records, to determine if the claim was billed and paid properly. Currently,  CMS uses several different types of contractors to conduct claims  reviews. Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC), the contractors  that process and pay claims, also conduct pre- and postpayment claims  reviews and recoup overpayments or remediate underpayments. Zone  Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC) perform pre- and postpayment  claims reviews as a part of investigating potential fraud. The  Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) contractors estimate the  Medicare FFS improper payment rate in part by conducting postpayment  claims reviews on a random sample of claims processed by the MACs.

Complex reviews  involve manual examinations of each claim and any related  documentation requested and received from the provider, including  paper files, to determine whether the service was billed properly, and  was covered, reasonable, and necessary. Licensed clinical  professionals, such as licensed practical nurses, and certified coders  typically perform the reviews. Contractors have physician medical  directors on staff who provide guidance about making payment  determinations on the basis of medical records and other  documentation and who may discuss such determinations with  providers.", "The postpayment claims review process involves selection of the claims  to be reviewed, the review itself, communicating with providers during and  about the review, and a process for assuring quality of the contractor\u2019s  reviews and decisions. Each contractor establishes its own claims  selection criteria. A contractor may use data analyses, knowledge of  Medicare billing requirements, and clinical expertise to develop its claims  selection criteria to focus on claims with a high likelihood of being  improper. As a part of the review, the contractor may notify the provider  that a claim is under review, or ask for medical records or other  documentation to substantiate the claim. The latter is called an additional  documentation request (ADR). If the contractor requires additional  documentation, the provider must submit the requested documents within  a specified time frame. If the review has determined that the Medicare  payment amount was improper, either the contractor or the MAC for that  jurisdiction will notify the provider that an overpayment was made and will  need to be recouped, or an underpayment was made and the remainder  of the remittance will be paid to the provider. Providers may appeal any  of the contractors\u2019 decisions. The contractors\u2019 quality assurance (QA)  processes may include various steps to assure consistency, reliability,  and quality in claims reviews. The QA process may include some type of  examination of the work that has been done and may be performed  internally, by the contractors themselves, or externally, by CMS or an  independent third party. A contractor\u2019s QA process may include  comparing multiple reviewers\u2019 decisions about the same claim to  determine the extent of their agreement (known as interrater reliability  testing) or reviews to validate the claims review decisions by others who  are either internal or external to the reviewer\u2019s organization.

For example, while  reviewing a claim for an X-ray, the contractor might want to review  additional documentation from the referring physician, in order to  determine the medical necessity of the X-ray service. The MACs, ZPICs,  and RAs have the discretion to send a separate ADR to a third-party  provider (in the example above, the referring physician) for additional  documentation to support the medical necessity of the service or supply.  If the service provider cannot obtain the necessary third-party  documentation or if the contractor decides that the documentation is  insufficient to support the claim, the claim will be denied, but not the third- party\u2019s claim. The CERT contractor is the only one that is required to  directly contact the third party for an ADR if the provider being reviewed  requests it and the claim exceeds $40. Four provider associations we  interviewed indicated that it can sometimes be difficult for the providers  whose claims were being reviewed to obtain the needed documentation  from third parties in a timely manner. There is no financial incentive for  the third parties to forward requested documentation to the service  providers because the third parties\u2019 claims are not denied as improper if  the documents are not submitted to the contractor. In the view of four  provider associations, requiring providers to obtain documentation not  directly under their own control can hinder their compliance with the ADR,  because they are sometimes unable to provide the documentation.", "Providers have 30 days to respond to an ADR sent by a ZPIC, 45 days to  respond to an ADR sent by a MAC or RA, and 75 days to respond to an  ADR sent by the CERT contractor. If the provider does not respond within  the required time frame, the contractor may find the payment improper  and refer the claim for recovery. MACs, ZPICs, and the CERT contractor  also have discretion in setting the number of extensions, if any, whereas   All of the  CMS requires RAs to give providers one extension. contractors have discretion on setting the length of extensions.  Representatives from two provider associations stated that having  different timeframes makes responding to ADRs more challenging. In  addition, ensuring consistency in common processes is consistent with  OMB guidance on streamlining service delivery and a strong control  environment.", "CMS officials told us that, in practice, RAs give providers as much time as they need  and the CERT contractor may also extend the time period so as not to unnecessarily deny  the claim for lack of documentation. However, the CERT contractor is constrained by its  schedule to estimate the annual Medicare improper payment rate.", "Submission Requirements. Different types of contractors are subject to  different requirements regarding the formats in which they will accept  providers\u2019 documentation, whether paper, fax, or electronic submission  (see table 6). While RAs and the CERT contractor are required to accept  submission of files stored electronically on compact discs or digital video  discs (DVD), the other contractors are not. CMS has developed a system  called electronic submission of medical documentation (esMD) for  providers to transmit medical documentation electronically, which began  to be adopted by contractors in 2011. Though its use is discretionary,  most of the MACs, all of the RAs, the CERT contractor, and about one- third of ZPICs accept electronic submissions through esMD.provider association indicated that having all contractors accept electronic  submissions, such as submissions of e-documents on compact discs and  DVDs could reduce the administrative burden on providers. Further,  making electronic submission acceptable across all contractors would be  consistent with OMB guidance on streamlining service delivery.", "Staffing requirements. CMS requirements for staffing, including claims  reviewers\u2019 qualifications, vary depending on the type of contractor (see  table 7). CMS specifies the minimum number of physicians serving as  medical directors that each contractor must have on staff. The minimum  number of medical directors and their responsibilities vary for each of the  four types of contractors. CMS requires that medical directors serve as a  readily available source of medical expertise to provide guidance on  claims reviews for all of the contactors, but their scopes of responsibility  vary across contractors. This could lead to differences in the number of  medical directors needed. For example, the MAC medical directors are  also responsible for oversight of prepayment review, providing provider  outreach and education, developing local coverage policy, and  representing the contractor in appeals. In contrast, while the RA medical  directors do not have some of the other responsibilities of the MAC  medical directors, they have much larger geographic jurisdictions than  MACs. Requirements for the minimum number of medical directors  include the following:", "A/B MACs must have at least three full-time equivalent (FTE) medical", "RAs are required to have one FTE medical director on staff,", "ZPICs are required to have at least one part-time medical director,  the CERT contractor is required to have two FTE medical directors.", "Given the variability of the medical directors\u2019 responsibilities and the  differing sizes of their jurisdictions, direct comparisons cannot be made  across the contractors to determine the number of medical directors  needed. CMS officials acknowledged differences in staffing requirements  across contractor types, and differences in expectations for the roles of  medical directors. CMS officials also indicated that they have not required  similar numbers of medical directors or required a certain number of  medical directors to be responsible for oversight of a specific number of  claims reviews because of cost issues.differences, CMS officials indicated that they do not want to incur  additional costs that could be involved in establishing consistent minimum  staffing requirements for conducting claims reviews, if that would increase  the number of medical directors that contractors would have to hire.", "Requirements for other staff conducting claims reviews also differ across  contractors. Specifically, CMS requires RAs to use registered nurses or  therapists in making determinations of medical necessity, but the others  may use licensed practical nurses. CMS also requires RAs and the  CERT contractor to employ certified coders to determine compliance with  Medicare coding requirements, but does not require MACs or ZPICs to do  so. CMS has a requirement for ZPICs, that when Medicare policy for a  given service is not clearly articulated, the ZPICs must involve a medical  specialist trained and experienced in providing the type of service being  reviewed. There is no similar requirement for the other contractors.  CMS officials indicated that making claims reviewers\u2019 staffing  requirements more consistent could increase the cost of claims reviews\u2014 for example that requiring A/B MACs and ZPICs to hire RNs instead of  LPNs to conduct claims reviews would likely increase the contract costs.  Representatives from six provider associations indicated that on the basis  of some of the claims review results, their members had questioned  whether some reviewers were qualified to review claims, and several  associations indicated that erroneous claims reviews led to appeals that  would not have been needed had the determination been correct.", "Quality assurance requirements. While CMS requires QA processes to  ensure the quality of claims reviews, the requirements differ by contractor  type (see table 8). GAO\u2019s Internal Control Management and Evaluation  Tool states that monitoring (such as the monitoring carried out with QA  processes) should be conducted to assess performance and determine  whether controls (such as claims reviews) continue to be effective.", "Providers have questioned the quality of contractors\u2019 decision making\u2014 specifically that the contractors are not consistently making proper  determinations that appropriately apply Medicare coverage, coding, and  payment rules in evaluating the claims. Having effective QA processes  can help ensure that claims determinations are made properly and  consistently\u2014which is part of having strong internal controls. When asked  about the reason for differences among specific requirements for QA  processes for different contractors, CMS officials responded that different  offices in CMS were responsible for the contract specifications and  contractor management and the contracts were written at different times  and therefore vary.", "With regard to internal QA processes, CMS requires that the MACs,  ZPICs, and CERT contractor conduct interrater reliability testing and  participate in annual clinical judgment training in support of postpayment  claims review determinations. CMS also requires that the CERT  contractor\u2019s QA process include internal secondary reviews of any claim  that was determined improper and internal interrater reliability testing.  CMS does not require the RAs to conduct interrater reliability testing or  participate in clinical judgment training. Each contractor type is also  required to have an internal QA plan, but CMS does not require any  specific QA steps regarding consistency and quality of postpayment  claims reviews\u2019 determinations in any of the contractors\u2019 plans.", "The different types of contractors also have different requirements for  external QA review processes. While the RAs are not required to have  some of the internal QA processes, CMS has established an external  validation process conducted by a different contractor for the RAs\u2019  postpayment claims reviews. To validate the claims review  determinations for each RA on a monthly basis, the RA validation  contractor reviews a random sample of 400 claims proportional to the  provider types that each RA determined had been paid improperly. Unlike  the RAs, the MACs, ZPICs, and CERT contractor are not subject to  external validation reviews of their postpayment claims reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Begun an Effort to Examine Whether Its Activities Add Administrative Burden for Providers", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, CMS established an internal work group known as the Provider  Burden Reduction Work Group to inventory CMS and contractor activities  that may create administrative burden for providers, to assess providers\u2019  complaints, and identify areas for improving efficiency of processes. As  part of this effort, CMS officials indicated that they found differences in  contractor requirements related to claims reviews. As an example, they  indicated that contractors\u2019 form letters were not standardized; instead  different types of contractors were required to include different information  in their form letters. Representatives of two provider associations had  indicated that having different contractors send out different versions of  the same type of form letters seemed to be confusing to providers. As of  November 2012, CMS officials told us that the work group had briefed  CMS senior management about its work, but this effort was still in  progress. CMS has not publicly announced the results of the work group\u2019s  efforts, whether it would make any requirements more consistent, or a  time frame for any changes. Having less variation in requirements for  providers would be consistent with OMB guidance on streamlining service  delivery. Further, internal control standards indicate the importance of  deciding on corrective actions when needed and setting time frames for  completing them.", "CMS officials told us that they have taken steps to increase provider  awareness and reduce confusion about the different review contractors  and their review processes to help providers in complying with review  efforts. These steps include the following:  In July 2012, CMS published a 15-page booklet about Medicare claim  review programs, including claims reviews by MACs, ZPICs, RAs, and  the CERT review contractor on CMS\u2019s website, and the booklet was  announced in an e-newsletter that providers can sign up to receive.", "In August 2012, CMS published an interactive map on its website that  allows the public and providers to identify the MACs, ZPICs, and RAs  that perform claims reviews in each state.", "In September 2012, CMS published an update to a chart, the original  of which was first published in July 2011, to educate providers about  the definitions and responsibilities of contractors and other entities  involved in various aspects of Medicare and Medicaid claims  determinations. The chart explains why providers may need to  communicate with multiple entities as well as why multiple entities  may contact the same provider.", "In January 2013, CMS published a three-page description about the  Medicare FFS Recovery Audit Program process that includes  references to other information, such as appeals.", "In addition, CMS officials reported that they are developing web-based  training about the audits done by its contractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Differences in CMS\u2019s postpayment claims review requirements for the  four types of contractors may reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of  claims reviews by complicating providers\u2019 compliance with the  requirements. Some of these differences may be appropriate given the  different functions and responsibilities of the contractors. However, CMS  officials explained that differences in some requirements came about  because the contractors\u2019 requirements were developed at different times  or the contractors\u2019 activities have changed over time. In addition, some of  these differences could have come about because different types of  contractors and associated requirements are managed by different parts  of CMS.", "Greater consistency in the claims review requirements across contractors  may improve the efficiency of postpayment reviews by strengthening the  control environment, lessening providers\u2019 confusion, and reducing  administrative burdens. In addition, improving consistency across the  contractors would be consistent with the Executive Order 13571 on  Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Services and  OMB guidelines for implementing it. Greater consistency could make it  easier for providers to comply with ADR requests and claims  requirements. It could also help reduce claims payment error  determinations based on providers\u2019 inability or failure to provide  documentation in a timely manner. It might also reduce any  inconsistencies in making determinations, which can lead to unneeded  appeals, and might increase providers\u2019 confidence that reviews will also  be consistent and correct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Medicare program  integrity efforts and simplify compliance for providers, we are making  three recommendations.
