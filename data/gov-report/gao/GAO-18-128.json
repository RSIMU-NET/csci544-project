With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations.

Officials told us that, as a result, this  construction project was identified as a lesser priority in EUCOM\u2019s fiscal  year 2018 request for funding. A senior Army officer told us that  completion of a facility in Poland was critical to its plans in Europe.  Officials from the U.S. Mission to NATO told us that as of July 2016  NATO had approved funding to complete preliminary architectural and  engineering design for this project. Officials expect additional funding will  be made available in July 2017 to complete final design and site  preparation and the full cost of the project will be approved in early 2019.  However, these officials noted that additional funding beyond what has  been approved by NATO may be required to meet U.S.-specific  requirements. Similarly, EUCOM officials said that they are working to  identify opportunities to defray future costs through host nation   contributions, but it is unclear how much funding\u2014if any\u2014host nations  will provide moving forward.", "Congress has expressed interest in knowing the future costs of enduring  activities being funded through DOD\u2019s OCO budget. The Senate  Appropriations Committee\u2019s report accompanying a bill for DOD\u2019s fiscal  year 2015 appropriations stated that the committee does not have an  understanding of enduring activities funded by the OCO budget. The  committee further noted that there is a potential for risk in continuing to  fund non-contingency-related activities through the OCO budget. Both  GAO\u2019s and other federal standards emphasize that agencies should  provide complete and reliable information on the costs of programs  externally, so that decision makers can make informed decisions when  allocating resources.", "DOD has not provided Congress projections of future costs for posture  initiatives funded under ERI because it is reviewing those requirements  outside of its budget and programming processes, and DOD officials said  that the department is not required to provide this information. As a result,  DOD is limiting congressional visibility into the resources needed to  achieve ERI\u2019s objectives. If DOD does not provide Congress with  projections of the future costs of posture initiatives funded under ERI and  information on its assumptions pertaining to host nation support and  burden sharing, it will continue to impede congressional visibility into the  resources that are needed to fully implement these initiatives."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the subsequent threat of further  aggression led DOD to establish and later expand ERI\u2019s objectives and  enhance posture in Europe to support a new U.S. strategy toward Russia.  DOD has requested funding for these enhancements using its OCO  budget; however, the processes DOD uses to develop its OCO budget  were not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives  such as ERI. By following a separate planning process when funding ERI  with OCO, DOD is taking on risk by not reviewing and prioritizing ERI  posture plans against other posture initiatives, estimating the costs for  sustaining ERI initiatives, and providing Congress with estimates of ERI\u2019s  future costs. DOD risks making decisions that lack a strategic vision in  comparison to other DOD priorities and may fund initiatives that cannot  be sustained over the long term. Furthermore, Congress is likely to face  challenges in assessing DOD\u2019s estimated costs for ERI and the  affordability of initiatives funded under ERI over the long term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that DOD can target resources to its most critical  initiatives and establish priorities across its base budget and overseas  contingency operations budget, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in  its base budget as part of its established posture-planning processes.  (Recommendation 1)", "To better enable decision makers to evaluate the full long-term costs of  posture initiatives under ERI, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct EUCOM and the military services to develop estimates for  the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure  projects under ERI and ensure that the services plan for these long-term  costs in future budgets. (Recommendation 2)", "To support congressional decision making, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense provide to Congress, along with the department\u2019s  annual budget submission, estimates of the future costs for posture  initiatives funded under ERI and other enduring costs that include  assumptions such as those pertaining to the level of host nation support  and burden sharing.

DOD partially concurred with all three of our recommendations,  and we have reproduced DOD\u2019s comments on the classified report in  appendix II. DOD also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation to use its  established posture-planning processes to prioritize ERI\u2019s posture  initiatives relative to those funded in DOD\u2019s base budget. In its comments,  DOD stated that it will continue to prioritize the negotiation of international  agreements supporting ERI through the Global Posture Executive  Council, and that an on-going Strategic Review will inform ERI and guide  both EUCOM and the services in their program planning efforts. These  are positive steps. DOD also stated it will adjudicate its ERI-funded force  requirements through its global force management process, adding that it  will continue to resource OCO funds for ERI requirements until there is a  sufficient increase in DOD\u2019s base budget to do so. However, we continue  to believe, as noted in our report, that DOD could improve its planning for  posture initiatives funded under ERI, whether or not they are funded  through OCO, by using DOD\u2019s established posture planning processes.  Although DOD\u2019s global force management process directly affects  overseas military posture in the near term, this process is not designed to  evaluate long-term posture priorities. If DOD does not prioritize the forces  and infrastructure projects funded under ERI against those funded using  the military services\u2019 base budgets, it will continue to lack an  understanding of the relative importance of the posture initiatives funded  under ERI. Without such an understanding, DOD increases the risk that  the services will need to make critical and potentially costly decisions  without a clear idea of which posture initiatives are most critical to the  department.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that EUCOM  and the military services develop estimates for future sustainment costs  and plan for these costs in future budgets. In its comments, DOD stated  that its components will continue to estimate the sustainment costs for  prepositioned stocks and other infrastructure projects during DOD\u2019s  annual program and budget review process. DOD also commented that  without additional topline base budget funding, some portion of the  associated sustainment costs will need to be financed with OCO funds.  However, as we noted in our report, neither the Army nor the Air Force  has fully estimated these potentially significant future costs, nor had either  service incorporated them into their future budgets. Using OCO funds  would mark a departure from DOD leadership\u2019s emphasis that the  services would need to fund ERI posture sustainment costs through their  respective base budgets. Additionally, not developing robust estimates for  sustaining these initiatives could increase long-term fiscal risk for the  department if DOD shifts more ERI-associated enduring costs into its  OCO budget. In the absence of robust cost estimates and deliberate  planning to address those costs in future budgets, DOD will continue to  be limited in its ability to evaluate the affordability of posture initiatives  funded under ERI, and the military services may not plan adequate  funding to sustain posture investments in Europe.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation, to provide  Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded  under ERI and information on any underlying assumptions, such as those  pertaining to the level of host nation support and burden sharing. In its  comments, DOD stated that it does not currently prepare a formal 5-year  Future Years Defense Program for OCO-related costs. Moreover, DOD  commented that it factors in host nation support and burden sharing when  preparing budget estimates for Congress. However, DOD does not state  whether it will begin to provide Congress future estimates and any  underlying assumptions with its budget submission. It is critical that DOD  increase congressional visibility into ERI\u2019s future costs and its underlying  assumptions to facilitate congressional oversight and reasonably ensure  that initiatives can be sustained over the long-term.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Commander, U.S.  European Command.
