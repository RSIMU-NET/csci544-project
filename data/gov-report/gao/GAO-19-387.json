These flexibilities allow MDA to diverge from DOD\u2019s traditional acquisition  life cycle and defer the application of certain acquisition policies and laws  designed to facilitate oversight and accountability until a mature capability  is ready to be handed over to a military service for production and  operation. Some of the laws and policies include such things as: obtaining the approval of a higher-level acquisition executive before  making changes to an approved baseline,  reporting certain increases in unit cost measured from the original or  current baseline, obtaining an independent life-cycle cost estimate prior to beginning  system development and/or production and deployment, and   regularly providing detailed program status information to Congress,  including specific costs, in Selected Acquisition Reports.", "In response to concerns related to oversight, Congress and DOD have  taken a number of actions.

Following a  failure investigation, and developmental work, MDA rectified the Aegis  BMD SM-3 Block IIA design flaws and successfully demonstrated them  against a medium-range ballistic missile target in October 2018, during  FTM-45. MDA decided to use a medium range target in this test and  concluded that it was sufficient to assess Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA  fixes. However, according to MDA documentation, the test against a  medium range target does not provide the same challenges as an  intermediate range target. In December 2018, it successfully  demonstrated for the first time an intercept of an IRBM during a test  called FTI-03, previously called FTO-03 Event 1. While this test was  successful, its scope was reduced from an attempt against a raid of two  targets to instead a single intercept, in part, due to a test range safety  asset malfunction.

Although the delivery has been  delayed 18 months, in part due to the delay in construction at the Aegis  Ashore site in Poland, the current plan significantly reduces the amount of  data needed to support the EPAA Phase 3 capability and limitation  assertions. As we previously reported, test and evaluation activities are  an integral part of developing and producing weapon systems, as they  provide knowledge of a system\u2019s capabilities and limitations as it matures  and is eventually delivered for use by the warfighter. Consequently, the 18-month delay provides an opportunity to add in additional tests and an ability to provide further data to the warfighter or to make any design changes discovered during testing.

The acceleration of several programs following a  budget increase in December 2017 introduced concurrency, which  indicates a familiar risk: accounting for insufficient margin in an effort to  meet schedule-driven milestones, rather than pursuing a knowledge- based approach. Construction delays related to another integrated  capability, EPAA Phase 3, may, in fact, present an opportunity to build  more knowledge in that area. EPAA Phase 3 intends to provide a robust  defense against IRBM and raids of multiple targets, but tests to  demonstrate that capability have been reduced from five to one with the  test against the raid scenario not occurring before the capability is  delivered.

When fired in this manner, quality issues with the AFD that  would not have any material impact in a simultaneous firing can cause the  AFD to malfunction when firing one after the other. The FRB concluded  that the most likely cause of the AFD\u2019s failure was a missing explosive  charge in the first explosive chain.

At the time  of our review, the program projected that it would conduct a critical design  review for RKV in early fiscal year 2021 followed by a non-intercept flight  test in fiscal year 2022, an intercept test in fiscal year 2023, and  deployment starting a few months later. The extended design period  provided the program additional time to source or design new  components before moving forward with testing and production.  Production decision gates also remained aligned to the critical design  review and subsequent flight tests.

The GMD program discovered some software  issues with its system during pre-test planning that had to be resolved  prior to moving forward with flight test FTG-11, which will use the  intercontinental-range ballistic missile. According to Targets program  officials, the Targets program requested that the contractor delay the  delivery of the intercontinental-range ballistic missile to avoid dealing with  sensitive aspects of the target, such as fueling, that would necessitate  special storage of the target. The two intermediate-range ballistic missiles  for the BMDS-level operational test FTO-03 E1 were delayed from the  second quarter of fiscal year 2018 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to  accommodate a new test for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)  Standard Missile-3 Block IIA program following the failure of one of its  interceptors during flight test FTM-29.

The risk of a target malfunction or failure was lower in fiscal  year 2018 than it has been in previous years, because all of the targets  had flown in flight tests previously (i.e., none of the targets were new).  However, the Targets program is currently planning to fly two new  medium-range targets in fiscal year 2019, and the flight tests with these  targets either precede or are adjacent to other important tests in MDA\u2019  test plan. We have previously reported that, new, untested targets  introduce higher risk for malfunction or failure that can mean costly and  time-consuming retests. Accordingly, we recommended that MDA add a  non-intercept flight test for each new target type to verify its performance  and reduce risks for future flight tests. MDA has not implemented this  recommendation and has continued to use new targets during flight tests.", "The Targets program conducted one of two critical design reviews in  fiscal year 2018. A critical design review assesses the final design of a  target to ensure that it can proceed into production and testing and can  meet its stated performance requirements within cost, schedule, and risk.  The Targets program conducted a critical design review for the medium- range ballistic missile type 3 configuration two (MRBM T3c2) target in the  third quarter of fiscal year 2018. The MRBM T3c2 is a new target that  Targets program officials said involves minimal design because it  leverages flight-proven hardware and a significant amount of heritage  software from the intermediate- and intercontinental-range targets  currently in production. However, the Targets program plans to conduct  another critical design review for the MRBM T3c2 target in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the addition of hit detection software  which will enable real-time feedback on the target\u2019s impact points. The  Targets program did not complete the critical design review for the short- range ballistic missile type four G (SRBM T4-G) in the third quarter of  fiscal year 2018, after it had been delayed a year, from the third quarter of  fiscal year 2017. The Targets program subsequently delayed the critical  design review for the SRBM T4-G target another year, to the third quarter  of fiscal year 2019. According to the Targets program, the delay in the  critical design review for the SRBM T4-G is due to some technical  challenges associated with developing the target and the contractor\u2019s  limited staffing and workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Target availability will be a risk for MDA\u2019s aggressive test schedule through 2021", "paragraphs": ["The Targets program may face challenges providing some targets to  support MDA\u2019s test schedule due the aggressiveness and volatility of the  test schedule. We have previously found that MDA\u2019s test schedule is  aggressive, in that it includes too many tests and little to no margin  between tests to ensure executability. Thus, when setbacks occur, such  as target or system malfunctions, the margin between tests erodes. MDA  relieves pressure in its test schedule by delaying and canceling tests  instead of including sufficient schedule margin to ensure executability, as  we previously recommended. When the schedule slips for one test, there  are often reverberating impacts to other tests. Consequently, MDA\u2019s test  plan has continued to be volatile, with frequent delays, cancellations and  other changes, which make it challenging for the Targets program to  manage all of the resources and schedules for its various targets to  ensure successful, on-time availability and execution. When targets are  not available for testing as planned, the tests either receive substitute  targets which can mean trade-offs in the performance aspects  demonstrated during the test or the test is delayed, which prolongs the  demonstration of systems for the warfighter.", "One way that the Targets program has tried to ensure the availability of  targets for MDA\u2019s aggressive test schedule is through the use of  concurrency\u2014overlap between development, testing, and production\u2014for  some targets. We have previously reported that some concurrency is  understandable, but committing to production before development and  testing is complete is a high-risk strategy that often results in performance  shortfalls, unexpected cost increases, schedule delays, and test  problems. The Targets program is using concurrency for the MRBM  T3c2 target. According to the Targets program, it is using concurrency for  the MRBM T3c2 target due to the urgent need to support essential testing  within MDA\u2019s test schedule. The first flight test with the MRBM T3c2  target is FTM-31, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2019. Qualification testing and production are ongoing and scheduled to be completed in April 2019 (third quarter of fiscal year 2019). The target  must be delivered in advance of the planned test date to complete final  preparations for transport to the test site. Thus, the Targets program has  very little to no time to resolve any issues prior to delivering it for FTM-31,  as shown in figure 6. According to the Targets program, late completion  of qualification testing or failures that result in major redesigns may delay  FTM-31, as well as significantly impact the cost and schedule for this  target.", "Another way that the Targets program tries to ensure availability of  targets for MDA\u2019s aggressive test schedule is to maintain aggressive  delivery schedules for some targets. For example, the Targets program  has an aggressive delivery schedule for its intermediate- and  intercontinental-range targets through fiscal year 2021. According to the  contractor for the intermediate- and intercontinental-range targets, there  are specific time-spacing requirements that the contractor needs in order  to produce and configure targets for a test in relation to the production  and configuration of targets for other tests. The contractor said that these  specific time-spacing requirements are needed due to limitations with the  testing, storage, movement, and transport of these targets. Specifically,  we observed that the facility where these targets go through final  assembly prior to use in a flight test can currently hold two fully  assembled intermediate-range targets and the component for one  intercontinental-range target which is assembled at the launch site due to  its size.", "As shown in figure 7, almost all of the tests through fiscal year 2021 are  at risk of the target not being available as planned. One of the most  severe risks to target availability is in fiscal year 2020 when an  intermediate-range target is scheduled for a test in the third quarter,  followed by a test using dual (i.e., two) intermediate-range targets in the  following quarter. According the contractor\u2019s specific time-spacing  requirements, it needs five months, but the approximate amount of time  between these tests is three months. According to the Defense Contract  Management Agency (DCMA), if MDA includes multiple intermediate- and  intercontinental-range missions in the test plan within close proximity  without accounting for the contractor\u2019s specific time-spacing  requirements, it will be, at best, very challenging for the contractor, and at  worst, unachievable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MRBM T1/T2 target\u2019s continued cost growth and schedule delays have led to limited testing", "paragraphs": ["The Targets program has a target\u2014the medium-range ballistic missile  type one/type two (MRBM T1/T2)\u2014that continues to have cost growth  and schedule delays, which we have previously reported.

Figure  8 below shows the cost growth from 2014 through 2018. In 2017, the  Targets program conducted a review of the MRBM T1/T2 target to  address significant cost growth and set new projections. Again, in 2018,  the Targets program and the contractor planned to conduct another  review to address additional cost growth since the prior year\u2019s rebaseline.  Despite relatively steady periods of performance following a rebaseline,  DCMA officials believe that this contractor will continue to have cost  growth. The DCMA established that some of the root causes for the cost  growth are incomplete contract requirements and program requirements  changes. Additionally, MDA and DCMA officials have acknowledged that  the contractor did not adequately account for the costs associated with  this target at the outset. How much cost growth there will be moving  forward is unknown.", "In addition to cost growth, the MRBM T1/T2 target has continued to have  schedule delays due to technical failures, which has led to the decision to  forego some testing as a cost-cutting and time-saving measure. For  example, the contractor\u2019s first flight of this target has been delayed  approximately 5 years beyond the original plan, from third quarter fiscal  year 2014 to fourth quarter fiscal year 2019. The primary reason for this  delay has been an unusually high number of failures during pre-test  qualification testing, according to the DCMA. The DCMA believes that the  test failures are due to the elimination of sub-section testing, which it  understands the program and contractor initiated as a cost-cutting and  time-saving measure. According to DCMA, sub-section testing involves  piecing together different components of the target and then testing that  sub-section before the target is fully assembled. This type of testing can  help the contractor isolate any integration issues between components in  a specific area of the target. However, DCMA said that the contractor is  testing the components and then fully assembling the target. Once fully  assembled, they are conducting testing and experiencing the unusually  high number of failures. When these types of failures occur, according to  DCMA, the contractor conducts root cause analysis to make corrections  and resolve the issue; however, DCMA officials noted that there is no  commonality in the root causes. Thus, the contractor may not understand  what steps to take to resolve the issue and ensure that the target  performs as expected during a flight test.", "It is currently unclear how the MRBM T1/T2 target will perform during  upcoming tests, because of the Targets program\u2019s decision to forego  some qualification testing and not confirming the target\u2019s performance  through a non-intercept test, as we have previously recommended.  However, the Targets program stated it considers the MRBM T1/T2  performance a minimal risk because the MRBM T1/T2 is largely based on  a prior target\u2019s design which, according to the program, was successfully  flown twice. The MRBM T1/T2 is currently scheduled to fly in two critical  tests in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The first is an intercept flight test for  the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program in the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2019, which supports the delivery of an urgent  capability to the warfighter.

This test is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2020.

Consequently, the schedule margin between each test has decreased  from more than a year to three to six months. According to our best  practices for scheduling, a practical amount of schedule margin is needed  to account for risks and uncertainties. In addition, schedule margin can  provide time to analyze the results from the preceding test and correct  any identified issues before moving forward with further testing which may  be reliant on the results of the preceding test. We have previously  reported that MDA leaves little to no schedule margin in its flight test  schedule to ensure executability and the test schedule is success- oriented, in that it does not plan for failures which makes it difficult to  absorb test failures when they occur.", "In addition to the reduced schedule margin between THAAD\u2019s tests,  some of its tests in this timeframe are higher risk. For example, one test  will be flying a new, untested target which increases the risks for that test,  and another test will be the largest and most complex operational test to- date, flying five targets simultaneously. Therefore, the test schedule is  aggressive, complex, and is at risk of not being completed as planned.  However, THAAD has not identified its flight test schedule as a risk. Also,  THAAD officials and an official from DOD\u2019s Director of Operational Test  and Evaluation have asserted that the flight test schedule is doable, if  everything goes according to plan, and that the biggest risk is fatigue  among the personnel supporting the tests. While THAAD has a generally  successful record for conducting flight tests, its current flight test schedule  includes almost as many flight tests in 3 fiscal years as it did for the prior  9 fiscal years. Figure 10 below details the changes in THAAD\u2019s flight  testing from its previous plan to its current plan.", "In addition to the increase in testing and lack of margin between tests,  another risk to THAAD\u2019s flight test schedule is that some tests have not  yet been funded, as shown in figure 10 above. Funding is essential to  enable the planning and execution of each flight test. While THAAD is  tracking the lack of funding for these tests as a risk, there is no mitigation  strategy if all testing to support USFK JEON remains unfunded. If a single  test is not funded or executed, the Army will perform a risk-based  assessment using the available data to decide whether or not to deploy  the capability for use by the warfighter. If THAAD does not conduct the  testing as planned, it will forego the demonstration and confirmation of  capability performance which leaves the warfighter with the decision to  either not use the capability or use it with an increased risk that it may not  perform as intended.
