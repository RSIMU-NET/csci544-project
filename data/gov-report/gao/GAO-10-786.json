Therefore, only a very small proportion of the thousands of individuals potentially eligible for adaptive housing assistance have used TRA. Half of these grantees were under the age of 40 and half were over the age of 40. The average age of those under 40 was 26 years. Among those over 40, seven were over the age of 60. Of the 11 TRA grantees we interviewed, all had lost the use of both legs, and most also had other disabilities, such as brain trauma. Three of the grantees we interviewed were injured abroad while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, four grantees were injured domestically in a vehicle or sporting accident, and four grantees suffered an illness, such as multiple sclerosis. Of the 18 TRA grants that had been awarded, 11 were for the maximum allowable amount of $14,000, and 3 others were near that maximum. In some cases, the cost of adaptations exceeded the amount of the TRA grant and was supplemented by donations, other grants, or the grantee's own funds. Interviews we conducted with 50 service members and veterans eligible for adaptive housing benefits suggest that awareness of TRA may be low and that the program may not be reaching all of the individuals who could benefit from it. While most of the 50 interviewees were familiar with adaptive housing benefits in general, 38 were not familiar with the TRA program in particular and did not know that adaptive housing grants can be used to modify a home owned by a family member. In addition, while TRA was not applicable for the personal circumstances of many of the interviewees, in seven cases individuals described personal circumstances well suited for use of TRA and said they likely would have used the TRA program had they previously been aware of it. An additional seven said they would have at least considered using the program had they been aware of it. The extent to which TRA is addressed in VA's information sources about adaptive housing benefits is limited--for example, VA does not have a separate fact sheet for TRA, and it is unclear how consistently VA representatives publicize the opportunity to use TRA when conducting outreach to and interviews with service members and veterans. One of the stated core values of the VA office that administers TRA is to communicate to veterans in a timely, thorough, and accurate manner. A better understanding is needed of potential information gaps that may be occurring when severely disabled service members transition to civilian life and when veterans are informed about adaptive housing benefits. Additional efforts to make eligible individuals better aware of the TRA grant program could help ensure that the program more fully serves its intended beneficiaries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA evaluate current methods of communicating information about TRA grants to eligible individuals and take appropriate measures to improve awareness of the program among such individuals.

In general, eligible  individuals may receive up to three SAH grants totaling no more than 50  percent of the cost of constructing or acquiring a specially adapted house  or remodeling an existing house with adaptations. As shown in table 1, the  maximum aggregate grant amount was $63,780 for fiscal year 2010 and is  adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index. Grants may be  used to construct a house or remodel an existing house, or they may be  applied against the unpaid principal mortgage balance of a specially  adapted house. The SHA grant program is similar to SAH but is for  individuals with slightly less severe disabilities and may be used for  slightly different purposes; for fiscal year 2010, the maximum amount was  $12,756, which also is adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction  index. SAH and SHA are administered by VA\u2019s Veterans Benefits  Administration.", "In 2006 Congress created the TRA benefit, which allows veterans to apply  for a grant to adapt a home owned by a family member with whom they  are temporarily residing. The benefit was further extended to active-duty  service members with the passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery  Act of 2008. The TRA grant program enables service members and  veterans eligible under the SAH and SHA programs to use up to $14,000  and $2,000, respectively, to modify a family member\u2019s home. As shown in  table 1, a TRA grant can only be used once and counts as one of the three  grants allowed under either SAH or SHA. TRA grants also count toward  the maximum allowable amount, $63,780 under SAH and $12,756 under  SHA.

Some of these  grantees suffered from a spinal cord injury, and one was paralyzed from  the neck down. In addition, three grantees suffered from brain trauma and  one from a hearing impairment.

Five caregivers told us the grantee was unable to care for himself or  herself and would likely require long-term live-in assistance. Four other  grantees told us that they lived independently or planned to do so in the  future.

Our review of VA\u2019s case files found  that in 8 of 18 cases, the cost to adapt the relative\u2019s home, as recorded in  the file, exceeded $14,000. For example, in one case, the cost to adapt a  bedroom and bathroom was $62,115. According to the file, the TRA grant  was supplemented by a grant of $23,865 from a nonprofit organization, and  the grantee paid the remaining uncovered cost of $24,250. In another case,  the cost of adapting a bathroom, replacing a sliding door, building a  platform in the sun porch, and adding a ramp to the exterior door was  $24,500.

However, VA\u2019s 2004 Report to Congress: Assessment of the Adequacy of  VA Authorities to Provide Specially Adaptive Housing provided some  information on typical costs for making certain home adaptations. The  report cited the typical cost for adapting a bathroom to make it  handicapped accessible as $22,000, which included installing a bidet that  washes and dries, a toilet or urinal with an automatic flush sensor, and a  shower or bathtub with automatic soap and shampoo dispensers. The  typical cost to adapt a kitchen was cited as $8,000, which included  installing an automatic shut-off stove, raising a dishwasher, lowering  countertops, and installing a side-by-side refrigerator. The report also  noted that the cost of widening four doorways, which a typical home  might require, was $2,400.

We determined that the data  were reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We also reviewed VA\u2019s case file, which included construction contracts  and invoices describing work performed, for each of the 18 individuals  who had received a TRA grant as of April 4, 2010. In addition, we  interviewed 11 of the 18 TRA grantees, or their caregivers, to obtain  information on their use of the grant, the nature of their disabilities, their  living circumstances, and any barriers they may have faced in using the  grant. Five of the interviews were with the grantee and six were with the  grantee\u2019s caregiver. In addition to the grantees we interviewed, three  grantees were deceased and four others declined to speak with us. We  obtained information on those seven grantees, as available, from their VA  case files and VA data.", "To determine what accounts for service members\u2019 and veterans\u2019 low  utilization of the TRA grant program and what, if anything, could be done  to ensure that the program serves its intended recipients, we conducted  telephone interviews with 50 service members and veterans who had  qualified for adaptive housing benefits but had not applied for TRA. These  interviews were comprised of (1) a nonprobability sample of 25  individuals who had applied for adaptive housing between July 1, 2006  (after the creation of TRA) and October 31, 2009, and (2) a nonprobability  sample of 25 individuals who became eligible for adaptive housing  between July 1, 2006, and October 31, 2009, but had not applied for the  benefit. We limited our selection to individuals who were under the age of  35 because we believed that younger veterans would be more likely to  potentially live temporarily with a family member, as required to receive a  TRA grant.", "Applying these criteria resulted in 516 individuals who had applied for  adaptive housing benefits and 97 who had not. From each of these two  categories, we randomly selected 50 individuals and began contacting  these individuals (up to 3 attempts per individual to reach them and  conduct an interview) until we completed our target of 25 interviews from  each list, resulting in a total of 50 interviews. Forty-three of our  interviewees were veterans, 5 were service members, and 2 were service  members on the Temporary Disability Retired List.", "In addition to our interviews, we reviewed documentation from VA,  including the agency\u2019s policies and procedures on use of adaptive housing  benefits, examples of outreach and informational documents, and its  annual surveys of the Specially Adapted Housing Grant Program. In  addition, we reviewed documentation on the Department of Defense\u2019s  Recovery Care Coordinator and Wounded Warrior programs, as well as the  Federal Recovery Coordination Program. Finally, we conducted interviews  with staff from VA, a veterans service organization, and the Federal  Recovery Coordination Program.", "We conducted this performance audit between August 2009 and July 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jason Bromberg (Assistant  Director), Rudy Chatlos, Tarek Mahmassani, Cory Marzullo, John McGrail,  Josephine Perez, and Jennifer Schwartz made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
