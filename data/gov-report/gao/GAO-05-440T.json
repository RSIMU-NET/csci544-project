GAO has reported (GAO-04-690) that although the system had a number of performance problems during the first year that its use was required, several SEVIS performance indicators were positive at that time (June 2004). Nonetheless, some problems were still being reported by educational organizations. In addition, concerns have been raised that the number of international students and exchange visitors coming to the United States has been negatively affected by the U.S. visa process. Accordingly, the Congress asked GAO to testify on its work on SEVIS and related issues. This testimony is based on its June 2004 report, augmented by more recent GAO work, reports that we issued in February 2004 and 2005 on student and visiting scholar visa processing, and related recent research by others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Indications are that SEVIS performance has improved and continues to improve. In June 2004, GAO reported improvement based on several indicators, including reports showing that certain key system performance requirements were being met, trends showing a decline in new requests for system corrections, and the views of officials representing 10 educational organizations. DHS attributed this performance improvement to a number of actions, such as installation of a series of new software releases and increased Help Desk staffing and training. However, GAO also reported that several key system performance requirements were not being formally measured, so that DHS might not be able to identify serious system problems in time to address them before they could affect the successful accomplishment of SEVIS objectives. Further, some educational organizations were still experiencing problems, particularly with regard to Help Desk support. GAO also reported that educational organizations were concerned about proposed options for collecting SEVIS fees. Accordingly, it made recommendations aimed at improving system performance measurement and resolving educational organizations' Help Desk and fee concerns. Since June 2004, DHS reports that it has taken steps to address GAO recommendations, and in particular it has taken a number of actions to strengthen Help Desk support. Moreover, educational organizations generally agree that SEVIS performance has continued to improve, and that their past fee collection concerns have been alleviated. However, these educational organizations still cite residual Help Desk problems, which they believe create hardships for students and exchange visitors. Most of these organizations, however, do not believe that SEVIS is the reason for the declining number of international students and exchange visitors coming to the United States. These declining numbers were cited in a recent report by the Council of Graduate Schools, which describes declines in foreign graduate student applications, admissions, and enrollments between 2003 and 2004, and further declines in these applications between 2004 and 2005. The report attributes the decline to increased global competition and changed visa policies. In this regard, GAO recently reported on the State Department's efforts to address its prior recommendations for improving the Visas Mantis program (under which interagency security checks are performed to identify applicants who may pose a threat to national security by illegally transferring sensitive technology). According to this report, a combination of federal agency steps resulted in a significant decline in Visas Mantis processing times and in the number of cases pending more than 60 days. The Council of Graduate Schools' report also recognizes the recent Visas Mantis program changes as positive steps."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittees\u2019  hearing on the federal government\u2019s progress in tracking  international students in higher education.

For example,  reports used to measure system availability measured the time that  the system infrastructure was successfully connected to the  network. While these reports can be used to identify problems that  could affect the system availability, they do not fully measure SEVIS  availability. Instead, they measure the availability of the  communications software on the application servers. This means  that the SEVIS application could still be unavailable even though the  communications software is available.", "Similarly, program officials stated that they used a central  processing unit activity report to measure resource usage. However,  this report focuses on the shared infrastructure environment, which  supports SEVIS and two other applications, and does not  specifically measure SEVIS-related central processing performance.  Program officials did not provide any reports that measured  performance against other resource usage requirements, such as  random access memory and network usage.", "Program officials acknowledged that some key performance  requirements were not formally measured and stated that they  augmented these formal performance measurement reports with  other, less formal measures, such as browsing the daily Help Desk  logs to determine if there were serious performance problems  requiring system changes or modifications, as well as using the  system themselves on a continuous basis. According to these  officials, a combination of formal performance reports and less  formal performance monitoring efforts gave them a sufficient  picture of how well SEVIS was performing. Further, program  officials stated that they were exploring additional tools to monitor  system performance.

Table 6 shows the problems and the  number of organizations that identified them.", "At the time of our report, DHS had taken a number of steps to  identify and solve system problems, including problems identified  by educational organizations. In particular, DHS steps to identify  problems included  \u25cf  holding biweekly internal performance meetings and weekly  technical meetings,  \u25cf  holding biweekly conference calls with representatives from  \u25cf  establishing special e-mail accounts to report user problems, and  \u25cf  having user groups test new releases.", "Further, DHS cited actions intended to address six of the seven  types of problems identified by the educational organizations. These  included releases of new versions of SEVIS and increases in Help  Desk training and staffing. These officials also stated that they were  evaluating potential solutions to the remaining problem.", "Table 7 shows the problem types, the number of organizations that  identified them, and DHS\u2019s actions taken to address each.", "Despite DHS actions, educational organizations told us that some  problems persisted. For example:  \u25cf  Although the program office increased Help Desk staffing in March  2003, representatives from seven organizations stated that slow Tier  2 and 3 Help Desk responses were still a problem. In response,  program officials stated that the majority of calls handled by Tiers 2  and 3 involve data fixes that are a direct result of end-user error, and  that fixing them is sometimes delayed until end-users submit  documentation reflecting the nature of the data fix needed and the  basis for the change.   \u25cf  Although the program office began in June 2002 providing training  to Help Desk staff each time a new SEVIS release was implemented,  representatives from 5 of the 10 organizations stated that the quality  of the Help Desk\u2019s response to technical and policy questions  remained a problem. According to program officials, Help Desk  response is complicated by variations in user platforms and end- user knowledge of computers. The officials added that the program  office is working to educate SEVIS users on the distinction between  platform problems and problems resulting from SEVIS. Further,  they said that Help Desk responses may be complicated by the  caller\u2019s failure to provide complete information regarding the  problem.

For example, program officials stated that they have established a  working group to assess the relevance of the requirements in the  SEVIS requirements document. The working group is expected to  provide its recommendations for changing this document by the end  of March 2005. The changed requirements will then form the basis  for measuring system performance.", "Program officials also stated that they are in the process of selecting  tools for monitoring system performance and have established a  working group to define ways to measure SEVIS\u2019s satisfaction of its  two main objectives, relating to oversight and enforcement of  relevant laws and regulations and to improvement in port of entry  processing of students and visitors. In this regard, they said that  they have begun to monitor the number of false positives between  SEVIS and the Arrival Departure Information System to target  improvements for future system releases.", "Program officials also reported that they are taking steps to address  Help Desk concerns. For example, they said that they continue to  hold bi-weekly meetings with educational organizations and directly  monitor select Help Desk calls. They also said that Tier 1 Help Desk  staffing recently increased by five staff, and the knowledge-based  tool used by the Help Desk representatives to respond to caller  inquiries had been updated, including ensuring that the tool\u2019s  response scripts are consistent with SEVP policy. Additionally,  these officials stated that they are reaching out to the Department of  State to more quickly resolve certain system data errors (commonly  referred to as data fixes), and said that a process has been  established to ensure that high-priority change requests are  examined to ensure correct priority designation and timely  resolution. As of January 1, 2005, SEVP also established new  performance level agreements with its Help Desk contractor, and it  has been receiving weekly Help Desk reports to monitor  performance against these agreements.", "DHS also began collecting the SEVIS fee in September 2004.  Additionally, it introduced another payment option, effective  November 1, 2004, whereby students can pay the fee using Western  Union. This method allows foreign students to pay in local currency,  rather than U.S. dollars. Program officials also stated that DHS has  developed a direct interface between the payment systems and  SEVIS and the State Department\u2019s Consolidated Consular Database  (CCD).

In  addition, five of the organizations stated that there were no new  system performance problems. All of the organizations stated that  they did not have any concerns with the SEVIS fee implementation.", "However, most representatives stated that some previously reported  problems still exist. For example, representatives from five of the  six organizations stated that slow Tier 2 and 3 Help Desk responses  in correcting errors in student and exchange visitor records were  still a problem. Three representatives stated that these corrections  can take months, and in some cases even years, to fix. Two of the  three stated that this has a major impact on the individuals involved.  One organization reported that some exchange visitors\u2019 records  have been erroneously terminated, and as a result, the visitors\u2019  families are unable to join them in the United States until a data fix  occurs. According to the representative, this creates a very difficult  situation for the individuals and makes it difficult to retain them in  their academic programs. A representative for another organization  reported that two participants\u2019 records erroneously indicate that  they have violated their status as exchange visitors. Were these  individuals to leave the country to visit their families before a data  fix is made, they would be denied re-entry.", "In addition, representatives from three organizations stated that  they were still experiencing problems with downloading and  manipulating data from SEVIS. For example, one representative  reported an inability to pull reports on the exact number of  exchange visitors in its program and their status. This person  expressed concern because DHS holds schools and programs  accountable for tracking exchange visitors, but then does not give  them the tools necessary to do so. Further, representatives from two  organizations stated that they were still experiencing problems with  incorrect Help Desk responses. For example, one representative  reported that he was erroneously told by a Help Desk employee that  there was no need to correct an individual\u2019s record of training, yet  another Help Desk employee correctly stated that a fix was needed  and gave detailed instructions on how to make the correction.", "Last, representatives from all six organizations stated that there  have been declines in international students and exchange visitors  coming to the United States. However, representatives from four of  the six stated that SEVIS was not a factor, while representatives  from the remaining two stated that SEVIS was just one of many  factors. Other factors cited as contributing to this decline, which are  discussed in the following section, were a lengthy visa application  process and increased competition by other countries for students  and exchange visitors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Report Cites U.S. Decline in International Graduate Students, While Recognizing Recent Efforts to Improve Visa Processing for Science Students and Scholars", "paragraphs": ["A recent Council of Graduate Schools report indicates that foreign  graduate student applications, admissions, and enrollments are  declining.

In addition, while  2005 data on admissions and enrollments were not yet available, the  report cited a 5 percent decline in applications between 2004 and  2005. According to the report, the declines in 2004 and in 2005 were  most prominent for students from China and India. It also noted that  between 2004 and 2005 applications were unchanged from Korea  and up 6 percent from the Middle East.", "The report attributes this decline to two factors: increasing capacity  abroad and visa restrictions at home. According to the report,  countries in Europe and Asia are expanding their capacity at the  graduate level through government policy changes and recruitment  of international students. At the same time, the report says that the  U.S. government has tightened the visa process since September 11,  2001, inadvertently discouraging international graduate students  through new security procedures and visa delays.", "The Council of Graduate Schools also recognized recent federal  actions to improve the student visa process. These actions are  directly related to our work on the State Department\u2019s Visas Mantis  program\u2014an interagency security check aimed at identifying those  visa applicants who may pose a threat to our national security by  illegally transferring sensitive technology. The program often affects  foreign science students and visiting scholars whose background or  proposed activity in the United States could involve exposure to  technologies that, if used against the United States, could potentially  be harmful. In February 2004, we reported and testified that there  were delays in the Visas Mantis program and interoperability  problems between the State Department and the FBI that  contributed to these delays and allowed Mantis cases to get lost. We  determined that it took an average of 67 days for Mantis checks to  be processed and for State to notify consular posts that the visa  could be issued, and that many Visas Mantis cases had been  pending 60 days or more. We also determined that consular staff at  posts we visited were unsure whether they were contributing to  waits because they lacked clear program guidance. Accordingly, we  recommended that the State Department, in coordination with DHS  and the FBI, develop and implement a plan to improve the Visas  Mantis process.", "In February 2005, we reported that Visas Mantis processing times  had declined significantly. For example, in November 2004, the  average time was about 15 days, far lower than the average of 67  days that we reported previously. We also found that the number of  Mantis cases pending more than 60 days has dropped significantly.  Our report recognized a number of actions that contributed to these  improvements and addressed other issues that science students and  scholars face in traveling to the United States. These actions  included adding staff to process Mantis cases; defining a procedure  to expedite certain cases; providing additional guidance and  feedback to consular posts; developing an electronic tracking  system for Mantis cases; clarifying the roles and responsibilities of  agencies involved in the Mantis process; reiterating State\u2019s policy of  giving students and scholars priority scheduling for interview  appointments; and extending the validity of Mantis clearances.", "Although we also identified opportunities for further refinements to  the Visas Mantis program, we believe that the actions outlined above  should allow foreign science students and scholars to obtain visas  more quickly and to travel more freely. We did not determine the  effect of these actions on the overall volume of international  students traveling to the United States. However, representatives  from the academic and international scientific community have  indicated that they also believe the actions will have a positive  impact. For example, the Association of American Universities  identified the extension of Mantis clearances as \u201ca common-sense  reform that removes an unnecessary burden that caused enormous  inconvenience for thousands of international students and  discouraged many more from coming here to study.\u201d", "In closing, indications are that SEVIS performance has improved  and continues to improve, as has visa processing for foreign science  students and scholars. Moreover, recent SEVIS-related initiatives  demonstrate program officials\u2019 commitment to future  improvements. This commitment is important because educational  organizations continue to report some persistent system problems,  primarily with respect to Help Desk responsiveness in making  certain \u201cdata fixes.\u201d These problems can create hardships for  foreign students and exchange visitors that can potentially have  unintended consequences relative to these foreign students and  exchange visitors applying to and enrolling in U.S. learning  institutions. Therefore, it is important for DHS to effectively manage  SEVIS performance against mission objectives and outcomes, as  well as against system requirements. To this end, we have made  several recommendations to DHS concerning SEVIS performance  management.", "Messrs. Chairmen, this concludes our statement.
