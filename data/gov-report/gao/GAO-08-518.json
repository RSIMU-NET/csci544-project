These factors led to a June 2006 decision to restructure the program by reducing the number of satellites and sensors, increasing estimated costs to $12.5 billion, and delaying the first two satellites by 3 to 5 years. Among other objectives, GAO was asked to evaluate progress in restructuring the acquisition, assess the status of key program components and risks, and assess NASA's, NOAA's, and DOD's plans for obtaining the data originally planned to be collected by NPOESS sensors, but eliminated by the restructuring. To do so, GAO analyzed program and contractor data, attended program reviews, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The program office has completed most of the major activities associated with restructuring the NPOESS acquisition, but key activities remain to be completed. In the past year, the program redefined the program's deliverables, costs, and schedules, and renegotiated the NPOESS contract. However, agency executives have not yet finalized selected acquisition documents (including the tri-agency memorandum of agreement). Without the executive approval of key acquisition documents, the program lacks the underlying commitment needed to effectively manage a tri-agency program. Over the past year, the NPOESS program has continued to make progress in completing development activities, but key milestones have been delayed and multiple risks remain. Specifically, poor workmanship and testing delays caused an 8-month slip in the expected delivery of a technologically complex imaging sensor that is critical to weather and climate observations. This later delivery caused a corresponding 8-month delay in the expected launch date of a demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP). This demonstration satellite is intended to provide on-orbit experiences that can be used to reduce risks on NPOESS satellites and to provide interim weather and climate observations should predecessor weather and climate satellites begin to degrade or fail. Moving forward, risks remain in completing the testing of key sensors, integrating them on the NPP spacecraft, and ensuring sufficient system security. The program office is aware of these risks and is working to mitigate them, but continued problems could affect the program's overall schedule and cost. When the NPOESS restructuring decision removed four climate and space environment sensors from the program and reduced the functionality of four others, the program was directed to restore a limited version of one sensor and to restore the seven others if funded by entities outside the program office. NOAA, NASA, and DOD have taken preliminary steps to restore the capabilities of selected sensors by prioritizing the sensors, assessing options for restoring them, and making decisions to mitigate near-term data gaps by adding two sensors to the NPP satellite. However, the agencies have not yet developed plans to mitigate the loss of these and other sensors on a long-term basis. Until such a plan is developed, the agencies may lose windows of opportunity for selecting cost effective options or they may resort to an ad hoc approach to restoring these sensors. Almost 2 years have passed since key sensors were removed from the NPOESS program; further delays in establishing a plan could result in gaps in the continuity of climate and space environment data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The planned National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite  System (NPOESS) program is expected to be a state-of-the-art,  environment-monitoring satellite system that will replace two existing  polar-orbiting environmental satellite systems.

These satellites obtain environmental data  that are processed to provide graphical weather images and specialized  weather products. These satellite data are also the predominant input to  numerical weather prediction models, which are a primary tool for  forecasting weather 3 or more days in all advance\u2014including forecasting  the path and intensity of hurricanes. The weather products and models are  used to predict the potential impact of severe weather so that  communities and emergency managers can help prevent and mitigate their  effects. Polar satellites also provide data used to monitor environmental  phenomena, such as ozone depletion and drought conditions, as well as  data sets that are used by researchers for a variety of studies such as  climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position relative to  the earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth in an almost  north-south orbit, providing global coverage of conditions that affect the  weather and climate. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the  earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. Currently, there are two operational POES satellites and two  operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they can observe  the earth in early morning, midmorning, and early afternoon polar orbits.  Together, they ensure that, for any region of the earth, the data provided  to users are generally no more than 6 hours old. Figure 1 illustrates the  current operational polar satellite configuration. Besides the four  operational satellites, six older satellites are in orbit that still collect some  data and are available to provide limited backup to the operational  satellites should they degrade or fail. In the future, the Air Force plans to  continue to launch an additional DMSP satellite every few years; the last is  currently expected to launch in 2012. NOAA plans to launch the final  remaining POES satellite in 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Polar Satellite Data and Products", "paragraphs": ["Polar satellites gather a broad range of data that are transformed into a  variety of products. Satellite sensors observe different bands of radiation  wavelengths, called channels, which are used for remotely determining  information about the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land surface, oceans, and the  space environment. When first received, satellite data are considered raw  data. To make them usable, the processing centers format the data so that  they are time-sequenced and include earth location and calibration  information. After formatting, these data are called raw data records. The  centers further process these raw data records into channel-specific data  sets, called sensor data records and temperature data records. These data  records are then used to derive weather and climate products called  environmental data records (EDR). EDRs include a wide range of  atmospheric products detailing cloud coverage, temperature, humidity,  and ozone distribution; land surface products showing snow cover,  vegetation, and land use; ocean products depicting sea surface  temperatures, sea ice, and wave height; and characterizations of the space  environment. Combinations of these data records (raw, sensor,  temperature, and environmental data records) are also used to derive  more sophisticated products, including outputs from numerical weather  models and assessments of climate trends. Figure 2 is a simplified  depiction of the various stages of satellite data processing, and figures 3  and 4 depict examples of EDR weather products. Specifically, figure 3  depicts a product used in weather forecasting, and figure 4 depicts a  product used in climate monitoring. Figure 5 depicts a derived product  that demonstrates how climate measurements can be aggregated over time  to identify long-term trends. In commenting on a draft of this report,  NOAA officials noted that while EDRs can be a valuable source of climate  data, the scientific community also needs climate data records.

To manage this program, DOD, NOAA,  and NASA formed the tri-agency Integrated Program Office, located within  NOAA.", "Within the program office, each agency has the lead on certain activities:  NOAA has overall program management responsibility for the converged  system and for satellite operations; DOD\u2019s Air Force has the lead on the  acquisition; and NASA has primary responsibility for facilitating the  development and incorporation of new technologies into the converged  system. NOAA and DOD share the costs of funding NPOESS, while NASA  funds specific technology projects and studies.

The program is to provide satellite  development, satellite launch and operation, and ground-based satellite  data processing. These deliverables are grouped into four main categories:  (1) the space segment, which includes the satellites and sensors; (2) the  integrated data processing segment, which is the system for transforming  raw data into EDRs and is to be located at the four processing centers; (3)  the command, control, and communications segment, which includes the  equipment and services needed to support satellite operations; and (4) the  launch segment, which includes the launch vehicle services.", "When the NPOESS engineering, manufacturing, and development contract  was awarded in August 2002, the cost estimate was adjusted to $7 billion.  Acquisition plans called for the procurement and launch of six satellites  over the life of the program, as well as the integration of 13 instruments\u2014 consisting of 10 environmental sensors and 3 subsystems. Together, the  sensors were to receive and transmit data on atmospheric, cloud cover,  environmental, climatic, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical  observations. The subsystems were to support nonenvironmental search  and rescue efforts, sensor survivability, and environmental data collection  activities. The program office considered 4 of the sensors to be critical  because they provide data for key weather products; these sensors are in  bold in table 1, which describes each of the expected NPOESS  instruments.", "In addition, a demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS Preparatory  Project (NPP), was planned to be launched several years before the first  NPOESS satellite in order to reduce the risk associated with launching  new sensor technologies and to ensure continuity of climate data with  NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System satellites.

These issues ultimately required difficult decisions to be made about the  program\u2019s direction and capabilities.", "The Nunn-McCurdy law requires DOD to take specific actions when a  major defense acquisition program growth exceeds certain cost  thresholds. Key provisions of the law require the Secretary of Defense to  notify Congress when a major defense acquisition is expected to overrun  its baseline by 15 percent or more and to certify the program to Congress  when it is expected to overrun its baseline by 25 percent or more. In  November 2005, NPOESS exceeded the 25 percent threshold, and DOD  was required to certify the program. Certifying a program entails providing  a determination that (1) the program is essential to national security, (2)  there are no alternatives to the program that will provide equal or greater  military capability at less cost, (3) the new estimates of the program\u2019s cost  are reasonable, and (4) the management structure for the program is  adequate to manage and control costs.

The new program also entailed reducing  the number of satellites to be produced and launched from 6 to 4, and  reducing the number of instruments on the satellites from 13 to 9\u2014 consisting of 7 environmental sensors and 2 subsystems.

These revised milestones deviated from prior plans to have the first  NPOESS satellite available to back up the final POES satellite should  anything go wrong during that launch.

However, they  stated that the planned configuration of the first satellite (C1) cannot  change without increasing the risk that the launch would be delayed.", "The changes in NPOESS sensors affected the number and quality of the  resulting weather and environmental products, called EDRs. In selecting  sensors for the restructured program during the Nunn-McCurdy process,  decision makers placed the highest priority on continuing current  operational weather capabilities and a lower priority on obtaining selected  environmental and climate measuring capabilities. As a result, the revised  NPOESS system has significantly less capability for providing global  climate measures than was originally planned. Specifically, the number of  EDRs was decreased from 55 to 39, of which 6 are of a reduced quality.  The 39 EDRs that remain include cloud base height, land surface  temperature, precipitation type and rate, and sea surface winds. The 16  EDRs that were removed include cloud particle size and distribution, sea  surface height, net solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere, and  products to depict the electric fields in the space environment.
