GAO was asked to assess agencies' compliance with the reporting structure and identify the functions OSDBUs performed. GAO reviewed compliance with section 15(k)(3) at 16 agencies--the 7 agencies that each procured more than $15 billion in goods and services in 2009 and 9 that it had previously reported were not complying with this requirement. GAO also surveyed the OSDBU directors at 25 agencies that represented more than 98 percent of civilian obligations and 90 percent of DOD obligations in 2009."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nine of the 16 federal agencies that GAO reviewed were in compliance with section 15(k)(3) of the Small Business Act, which requires OSDBU directors to be responsible only to and report directly to the agency or deputy agency head. The remaining seven agencies were not in compliance with the provision, and their OSDBU directors reported to lower-level officials or had delegated OSDBU responsibilities to officials who did not meet the reporting requirement. These agencies were not in compliance when GAO last examined them in 2003. During GAO's current review, directors who reported to agency heads cited benefits to the relationship, while those who did not had mixed views. GAO concluded that the views expressed by the directors at noncompliant agencies did not justify noncompliance and that these agencies should comply or provide support to Congress of their need, if any, for statutory flexibilities. Ongoing noncompliance with section 15(k)(3) undermines the intent of the act and may prevent some OSDBU directors from having direct access to top agency management. Consistent with its 2004 report, GAO's current work found that the 25 OSDBU directors surveyed focused their procurement activities on certain functions listed in section 15(k). At least 19 directors listed the five functions related to contract bundling, maintaining supervisory authority over staff, and helping small businesses obtain payments from agencies as among their duties. Fewer directors viewed the remaining three functions, such as reviewing acquisitions for small business set-asides and assisting small businesses to obtain payments from prime contractors, as duties. Directors who did not view these functions as their responsibility generally noted that contracting or program staff performed them.

To help ensure that small  businesses receive a share of federal procurement contract dollars,  Congress has set an annual governmentwide goal of awarding not less  than 23 percent of prime contract dollars to small businesses. Congress  has also mandated that the Small Business Administration (SBA) negotiate  annual procurement goals with each federal agency. In fiscal year 2009,  small businesses accounted for almost $100 billion in federal contracts\u2014 about 22 percent of all federal prime contracts awarded.", "To increase small businesses\u2019 visibility within federal agencies, in 1978  Congress amended the Small Business Act to require that all federal  agencies with procurement powers establish an Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), which would advocate for  small businesses within the agencies. The OSDBU is managed by a  director who is responsible for implementing and executing the agency\u2019s  functions and duties related to the award of contracts and subcontracts to  small and disadvantaged businesses. Section 15(k)(3) of the act requires  that OSDBU directors be responsible only to and report directly to agency  heads or their deputies. The purpose of this provision is to help ensure  that OSDBU directors have direct access to their agencies\u2019 top decision  makers in order to advocate effectively. Section 15(k), as amended, also  lists a number of functions that OSDBU directors are responsible for in  carrying out their roles as advocates for small businesses.", "In two earlier reports, we reviewed federal agencies\u2019 compliance with the  Small Business Act and the extent to which OSDBU directors viewed the  functions listed in section 15(k) as duties of their offices. In September  2003, we reported on the OSDBUs at 24 federal agencies and found that 11  of these offices did not comply with the law\u2019s requirement that the OSDBU  director report directly to and be responsible only to the agency head or  deputy head. We recommended that 10 agency heads take steps, as  necessary, to comply with the requirement. However, 8 of the 10  disagreed with our recommendation. In a follow-on March 2004 report, we  noted that almost all of the 24 OSDBU directors surveyed reported that  they viewed most of the functions outlined in the Small Business Act as  current duties of their offices. Most of the OSDBU directors we surveyed  reported that their offices faced few challenges to carrying out their  responsibilities, but some reported challenges in three areas\u2014lack of  influence in the procurement process, limited budgetary resources, and  lack of adequate staff.", "For this report, you asked us to review OSDBU practices for carrying out  the requirements of the Small Business Act at federal agencies with major  contracting activity. Specifically, we (1) assessed whether the director  reported directly to the agency head or the deputy head, (2) determined  the functions conducted by the OSDBUs, and (3) examined the actions  taken by the OSDBUs and other officials at the various agencies to further  small business contracting opportunities and the effects of funding and  staff levels on these efforts.", "To address these objectives, we focused our review on the seven agencies  that procured more than $15 billion in goods and services in fiscal year  2009: the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA); the Departments of the Air  Force, the Army, Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS), and the  Navy; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). To  assess whether the directors were responsible only to and reported  directly to the agency head or the deputy head as required by section  15(k)(3) of the Small Business Act, we included an additional nine  agencies that we reported in September 2003 were not complying with this  requirement. We determined that agencies were in compliance if the  designated OSDBU directors both exercised OSDBU responsibilities and  reported directly to and were responsible only to the agency head or the  agency head\u2019s deputy as the act requires. To determine whether OSDBU  directors were in compliance with section 15(k)(3), we interviewed the  designated directors to identify the official(s) they had reported to in fiscal  year 2010 and asked them to provide information characterizing the  reporting relationship, such as the extent to which small business issues  were discussed. In addition, we reviewed documentary evidence, including  organization charts and OSDBU directors\u2019 performance appraisals and  position descriptions.", "To determine the functions conducted by the OSDBUs, we surveyed the  OSDBU directors at 25 agencies on their offices\u2019 duties and functions.

We received responses from all 25  OSDBU directors, for a response rate of 100 percent. The survey was  similar to one we administered in 2003 and asked the directors about their  functions in three areas: (1) participation in the agency procurement  process, (2) facilitation of small business participation in agency  contracting, and (3) interaction with SBA. The three areas covered OSDBU  functions listed in the Small Business Act as well as additional functions  that OSDBUs might perform. The purpose of the survey was to obtain the  views of OSDBU directors on their roles and responsibilities. In addition,  the survey asked the directors what challenges they faced in carrying out  their responsibilities. In certain instances, we conducted follow-up  interviews to clarify responses.", "To examine the actions taken by the OSDBU and other agency officials to  further small business contracting opportunities and determine how funding  and staff levels affected these efforts, we reviewed the survey responses  from the 25 OSDBU directors. To determine actions taken by top  management to further small business contracting, we reviewed documents,  including policy statements, at the seven agencies with major contracting  activity. We also interviewed the OSDBU directors at these agencies on the  actions they and other agency officials had taken to further small business  contracting; methods used by the agency and SBA to hold officials  accountable for furthering small business contracting; and challenges that  may have affected these efforts, such as funding and staffing levels.

Twenty-three of the 25 OSDBU directors  surveyed viewed involvement in acquisition planning as a role or function  of their OSDBUs. Of this number, 15 directors reported they carried out  this function to a great or very great extent. For instance, OSDBU  directors reported acquisition planning activities such as preparing annual  forecasts of contracting opportunities, being a voting member of the  agency\u2019s senior procurement council, participating in contracting  agreement and review board meetings, and reviewing and providing  feedback on draft acquisition plans.", "Further, the OSDBU directors we interviewed at the seven agencies with  major contracting activity all viewed relationships with acquisition staff as  important in promoting small business contracting. For example, the  OSDBU director at DLA told us that establishing relationships with  acquisition management was the most important part of promoting small  business contracting. In addition, the OSDBU director at HHS described  small business contracting as a \u201cthree-legged stool,\u201d with acquisition staff,  program staff, and OSDBU staff working together to support it. Four of the  seven OSDBU directors stressed the importance of working with  acquisition officials from the start of a project rather than trying to  integrate them after a project was under way. For instance, the director at  HHS stated that the OSDBU spent a great deal of time on early acquisition  planning to help ensure that small businesses received consideration  throughout the decision-making process. Officials at the Air Force OSDBU  also stated that early involvement gave the office time to review  acquisitions and discuss small business involvement. These officials noted  that reviewing proposed actions late in the process placed the OSDBU in a  defensive position.", "Six of the seven directors we interviewed also told us they participated in  acquisition teams as advocates for small business. For instance, Energy  has established a monthly Advanced Planning Acquisition Team  comprising OSDBU, procurement, acquisition, and SBA officials. The  purpose of the team is to review proposed strategies for new and existing  acquisitions to identify prime and subcontracting opportunities for small  businesses. The OSDBU directors at both Army and DLA are members of  acquisition review boards for contracts of more than $500 million and $20  million, respectively. The seven OSDBU directors we interviewed also  stated that small business staff in the field, often referred to as small  business specialists, reviewed proposed acquisitions for opportunities. For  example, the Army OSDBU director told us that the OSDBU reviewed all  acquisitions of more than $500 million but that these specialists reviewed  all acquisitions over $150,000 that were not set-aside for small businesses  and worked with acquisition staff to ensure that small businesses were  considered.", "In addition, the OSDBU directors we interviewed collaborated with other  federal agencies to maximize small business contracting. All seven  participate in the Federal OSDBU Directors Interagency Council, an  informal organization that meets to exchange information on initiatives  and processes related to small businesses and outreach events that  promote small business contracting.

For instance, 23 of the 25  OSDBU directors viewed hosting conferences for small businesses as one  of their responsibilities, and 23 had hosted such an event in the last 2  years. More specifically, these 23 agencies had hosted an average of 20  conferences in the past 24 months. For instance, one OSDBU director  reported the agency had sponsored conferences of varying sizes to address  contractual requirements that program offices noticed or forecasted. The  same director noted the conferences were typically conducted in a  networking or \u201cbusiness fair\u201d format, allowing vendors to engage program  and contracting officials. In addition, most of the OSDBU directors  surveyed (20 of 25) saw sponsoring training programs for small businesses  as one of their responsibilities, and 18 had hosted such an event in the last  2 years.

For example, the OSDBU  director at DLA said the OSDBU worked closely with the American Legion  to promote contracting to small businesses owned by service-disabled  veterans. According to the NASA OSDBU director, small business staff  held over 100 outreach events in fiscal year 2010. Other OSDBU officials  described their efforts to disseminate information to small businesses  through Web sites. For instance, Navy\u2019s OSDBU director stated the agency  was working to standardize the Web site formats used by its various units  for outreach to small businesses. He explained that OSDBU staff had  reviewed the Web sites to determine whether a small business could  access information easily, and found retrieving information on small  businesses difficult because each of the sites was set up differently. The  Air Force maintains a small business Web site that provides small  businesses with information on the agency\u2019s contracting opportunities.

Offices are rated using a color-coded system\u2014green for reaching  95 percent of small business goals and yellow or red for lower  percentages. The NASA OSDBU produces monthly reports on the agency\u2019s  individual space and research centers\u2019 progress in meeting small business  goals and collects data on the centers\u2019 outreach and training efforts.

During PMRs, officials review a sample of existing  contracts to determine whether proper procedures and internal controls,  including those related to small business, have been followed. The OSDBU  directors at four agencies (Army, DLA, HHS, and NASA) reported that  OSDBU and acquisition officials jointly conducted these reviews. At the  Air Force, small business staff in field offices conducted the PMRs, and at  Energy, procurement staff conducted them. The Navy OSDBU had  replaced PMRs with procurement performance management assessments,  which review contracting offices and commands on 11 categories,  including involvement of small business in acquisition planning and  procurement planning, marketing strategies and approaches, number of  set-asides, and inclusion of small business clauses in all contracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Top Agency Officials Generally Provided Support for Small Business Efforts", "paragraphs": ["OSDBU officials at the seven agencies we contacted told us that top  agency leaders supported small business contracting by participating in  outreach events and issuing policy statements.

SBA produces an annual \u201cgoaling\u201d report showing the percentage of  contracting dollars awarded to small businesses. SBA\u2019s goaling report for  fiscal year 2009 shows that 22 percent of eligible contract dollars  governmentwide were awarded to small businesses, an amount that was  just short of the statutory requirement of 23 percent. As shown in table 3,  the percentage awarded to small businesses by the agencies we surveyed  ranged from 6 percent to 56 percent of eligible contract dollars.", "SBA sets annual goals for small business contracting at each agency,  basing these goals on the agencies\u2019 past performance, total spending, and  purchases of goods and services from small businesses. These goals are  set for the agency as a whole, not just for the OSDBU. As we reported in  2009, OSDBU officials at some agencies reported challenges with the goal- setting process, including limitations in negotiating and appealing their  goals. At that time, agencies told GAO the goal-setting process was not a  negotiation and that SBA did not factor in changes to agencies\u2019 contracting  priorities in setting the goals. Two of the seven agencies that we  interviewed (Energy and HHS) said that meeting small business goals was  difficult because the goods and services the agency purchased were not  well suited for small business contracts. For example, 85 percent of  Energy\u2019s contracts are facility management contracts that have  traditionally been awarded to large businesses and universities to manage  operations at sites such as Los Alamos National Laboratory. According to  SBA officials, the agency has revised the goal-setting process to make it  more collaborative.", "SBA also assessed all of the agencies we surveyed using its annual small  business scorecard to ensure greater accountability. According to SBA, the  scorecard fulfills its statutory requirement to report to the President and  Congress on achievements by federal agencies against their annual goals.  The SBA scorecard evaluates factors such as goals met, progress shown,  agency small business strategies, and top-level commitment to meeting  goals for 24 agencies and offices and the government as a whole. In fiscal  year 2009, SBA updated the scorecard and now assigns a letter grade to  each agency. Eighty percent of an agency\u2019s grade is based on its progress  in meeting its prime contracting goal, 10 percent on its progress in meeting  its subcontracting goal, and 10 percent on a performance rating assigned  to the agency by a panel of OSDBU directors. The agencies submit reports  on small business achievements that the panel uses to determine  performance ratings. The scorecard does not specifically consider the  performance of the OSDBU or its director, although the OSDBU director  may be involved in some of the activities evaluated.", "All seven of the OSDBU directors we interviewed are held accountable for  promoting small business contracting primarily through internal  performance standards and appraisals. Performance standards identify  goals and set objectives that are used as key indicators of achievement  during annual or midpoint performance appraisals. For example, the  NASA OSDBU director explained that, as part of his performance  appraisal process, he was reviewed against measurable and achievable  goals. These included developing a small business improvement plan for  the agency with specific initiatives to meet its small business goals and  implementing a training course for agency staff on a standard method to  evaluate proposals submitted to the agency.", "To help OSDBUs improve their capabilities, SBA and others have initiated  efforts to identify promising practices that OSDBUs can use to facilitate  small business contracting. A White House Interagency Task Force on  Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses, which was  established April 2010, identified the need for best practices. The task  force issued a report that identified challenges to small businesses such as  inadequate training for agency staff. Among other things, it recommended  that the executive branch facilitate the identification and rapid adoption of  successful practices for increasing opportunities for small businesses. To  implement this recommendation, the task force suggested that SBA (1)  develop a Web site to share best practices and (2) organize an event for  OSDBUs to present best practices for ensuring greater small business  participation and catalog and publicize the results. According to SBA  officials, they have taken steps to plan these efforts. SBA had already  begun to highlight on its Web site best practices for making opportunities  available to small businesses and has identified three to date.

Seventeen agencies reported that  limited budgetary resources were a challenge to at least some extent in  2010 and in 2003.", "Six agencies reported that inadequate staffing levels were a challenge to a  great or very great extent, and seven agencies reported that limited  budgetary resources were a challenge to a great or very great extent. In a  follow-up interview, OSDBU officials at one agency explained that while  they were able to perform their mission, inadequate staffing levels had  resulted in increased staff workloads, longer work days, and the need to  cross-train staff. They noted that in addition to the functions listed in 15(k)  of the Small Business Act, they were also responsible for reviewing grant  programs for small business opportunities. The OSDBU director at another  agency indicated that because she had only one staff person, her office  was unable to review the majority of procurement actions, including those  involving contract bundling. She also noted that limited budgetary  resources restricted the hiring of additional staff. Additionally, in follow- up interviews, four OSDBU directors noted that limited budgetary  resources hindered their efforts to reach out to small businesses.", "Almost half of the OSDBU directors surveyed also reported that their lack  of influence in the procurement process was a challenge to carrying out  their responsibilities to at least some extent. Three agencies indicated that  this issue represented a challenge to a great or very great extent. In a  follow-up interview, OSDBU officials at one agency told us that better  coordination was needed between the OSDBU and acquisition officials on  issues related to small businesses. While the OSDBU participated in  acquisition planning, the officials noted that their role in acquisition  decisions was not clear. Another OSDBU director stated that as part of the  acquisition approval process, he could disagree with a contract  recommendation. However, the director noted that his decision could also  be appealed and overruled by an acquisition executive, thus limiting the  OSDBU\u2019s influence.", "At the seven agencies with major contracting activity, trends in staffing  and funding levels varied over the past 5 years. From fiscal year 2006 to  2010, OSDBU staffing generally decreased at Energy, increased slightly at  DLA, the Navy, and NASA, and stayed the same at the Army and HHS (see  table 5). At the Air Force, staffing fluctuated in the interim, but was the  same in fiscal year 2010 as it was in fiscal year 2006.", "Additionally, from fiscal year 2006 to 2010 OSDBU funding generally  decreased at the Air Force, the Army, and Energy and increased at DLA,  HHS, the Navy, and NASA (see table 6).", "The OSDBU directors at the seven agencies we interviewed noted a  relationship between changes in staffing and funding levels. For example,  recent decreases in the Air Force and Energy ODSBU budgets were due to  decreases in staffing. Air Force officials told us that the OSDBU had  streamlined operations by eliminating some redundant contractor  positions and converting some contractors into civilian positions. They  noted that these changes had resulted in greater efficiencies and increased  quality. Energy officials stated that since the change in administrations in  2008, three political appointees working at the Energy ODSBU had left,  halving the number of staff responsible for the same workload. However,  they noted that hiring interns and contractors had mitigated staffing  constraints and the agency anticipated hiring additional OSDBU staff in  the future. Recent increases in the ODSBU funding for Navy and DLA had  resulted in increases in staffing. The Navy ODSBU director explained that  in addition to funding training and outreach programs, the recent  increases in funding were used to create an OSDBU industry analyst  position, and two additional positions were being developed. The DLA  OSDBU director noted that recent budget increases provided for an  increase in staffing but funding for other expenses such as travel had not  increased, causing her to have to turn down speaking and outreach events  due to lack of funds.", "Six of the seven OSDBU directors we interviewed told us they would  increase the breadth of the activities they currently performed if more  resources were available. For example, the OSDBU directors at the Army  and Air Force stated they would increase their outreach activities.  Additionally, a few OSDBU directors noted that if more resources were  available, they would perform additional analysis and offer more training.  For example, the DLA OSDBU director stated she would analyze DLA  commodity purchases and research trends, assist with more market  research, provide more training to small business and other staff, and fill  skill gaps within the office. With additional resources, the HHS OSDBU  director stated she would increase internal training opportunities for  acquisition program staff and provide online training for small businesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 15(k)(3) of the Small Business Act seeks to help ensure that small  business advocates within federal agencies have direct access to the  highest levels of the agency. However, 7 of the 16 federal agencies that we  reviewed were not in compliance with the act. Moreover, all of the  agencies that are currently not in compliance were not in compliance in  2003 and have maintained the same or a similar reporting structure, even  though at the time we recommended changing them. The OSDBU directors  at the nine agencies that were in compliance with section 15(k)(3) cited  positive benefits to the reporting relationship, while the OSDBU directors  at the seven noncompliant agencies differed on the importance of  reporting to the agency head or deputy head. Two thought that not  reporting to the agency head or deputy head was a problem, while the  other five asserted that the lack of a direct reporting relationship with the  agency head had not adversely affected their efforts to advocate for small  business contracting. However, we did not find that these arguments  justified noncompliance with section 15(k)(3). Continued noncompliance  with the requirement undermines the intent of the provision. If the  agencies believe their reporting structures are sufficient to ensure that  small business contracting receives attention from top management at  federal agencies, at a minimum they have the obligation to explain their  noncompliance to Congress and provide support for their views, including  requesting any statutory flexibilities to permit exceptions as appropriate.  One potential mechanism for making this information available to  Congress would be through SBA\u2019s annual scorecard process.

Of the six agencies that  provided written comments, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State,  and the Treasury disagreed with our conclusion that their reporting  relationships did not comply with section 15(k)(3) of the Small Business  Act. The Social Security Administration agreed to revise its reporting  structure, while the Department of the Interior stated it planned to  evaluate our recommendation and options to resolve the issue. None of  the agencies\u2019 comments caused us to revise our conclusions or  recommendations. The six agencies\u2019 specific comments and our responses  are summarized below.", "The Department of Commerce stated that the agency was in compliance  with section 15(k)(3) because the OSDBU director reported directly to the  Deputy Secretary on all legislative and policy issues and to the Chief  Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration on  administrative matters such as personnel and budget. The comment letter  also cited the agency\u2019s small business achievements, such as exceeding  small business goals. As noted in the draft report, the OSDBU director  stated that she reported to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Administration for all small business matters and to the Assistant  Secretary for Administration for administrative matters such as budget  and personnel. Agency documents, such as the organization chart and the  OSDBU director\u2019s two most recent performance appraisals, confirmed this  reporting relationship. Further, the OSDBU director stated she had never  met the Secretary or previous Deputy Secretary. She met the new Acting  Deputy Secretary in December 2010, but did not have a reporting  relationship with her. Therefore, we did not revise our conclusion or  recommendation.", "The Department of the Interior stated that it did not have comments on the  draft report, but would be evaluating our recommendation and options to  resolve the issue. The letter also indicated that the agency would report  back to GAO once it had finalized its plans.", "The Department of Justice agreed that its OSDBU was located within the  Justice Management Division. However, its comment letter stated that this  arrangement was in place for administrative purposes, and that the  OSDBU director reported directly to the Deputy Attorney General on  matters of substance. The letter stated that through this organizational  structure, the Deputy Attorney General ensured that small businesses  were provided the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in  contracting opportunities throughout the agency. The letter also  commented that the current placement of the OSDBU allowed for the  efficient management and implementation of the small business  contracting programs that were vital to the agency in satisfying its mission.  As we noted in the draft report, agency documentation such as the OSDBU  director\u2019s position description and performance appraisals indicated that  the director reported to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Policy,  Management and Planning. Further, the OSDBU director told us during  our review that he had never met the Deputy Attorney General. Therefore,  we did not revise our conclusion or recommendation.", "The Department of State disagreed with the report\u2019s conclusions. The  letter pointed out that the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration,  who is the designated OSDBU director, reports to the Deputy Secretary  concerning small business activities. This information was included in the  draft report. However, we concluded that the agency was not in  compliance with section 15(k)(3) because the Assistant Secretary had  delegated his OSDBU responsibilities to a lower-level official who did not  report to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. Regarding this conclusion,  State commented that section 15(k)(3) permitted the delegation of  functions from the Assistant Secretary to the OSDBU Operations Director  and stated that while OSDBU directors were responsible for implementing  and executing the specific functions and duties assigned under sections 8  and 15 of the Small Business Act, section 15(k)(3) contained no  requirement that the director personally perform any specific functions.  The letter further commented that executive branch authority was  typically exercised through delegation, with an agency\u2019s basic authority  being vested in the agency head and subsequently redelegated. It cited the  case of Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking & Lumber Co., 331 U.S. 121 (1947)  as an example in which the authority to redelegate is implied. However, as  we stated in our 2003 report, the Fleming case recognizes that the  delegation of authority may be withheld by implication, and we believe  section 15(k)(3) does exactly that. As explained in this report, to ensure  that the OSDBU responsibilities are effectively implemented, the statute  mandates that the OSDBU director (i.e., the person carrying out the  responsibilities) have immediate access and be responsible only to the  agency head or deputy. The legislative history reveals that the reason for  this requirement is that Congress believed that agency officials responsible  for promoting procurements for small and disadvantaged businesses were  often too far down the chain of command to be effective. The reporting  requirement of section 15(k)(3) was intended to remedy this situation. The  Department of State\u2019s letter also highlighted its small and disadvantaged  business goal achievements and commented that reorganizing the OSDBU  so that its Operations Director reported directly to the Secretary or her  Deputy would decrease efficiency. The letter concluded by stating that the  OSDBU Operations Director currently had direct access whenever  necessary to decision makers in the Department programs that utilize  small and disadvantaged businesses. As indicated in the recommendation,  agencies that believe that they should have greater flexibility should  pursue this with Congress.", "The Department of the Treasury disagreed with the report\u2019s conclusion  and commented that the statute did not require that the OSDBU director  be an official assigned to small business issues full time. The letter stated  that the Assistant Secretary for Management, in the capacity of OSDBU  director, had a direct reporting relationship to the Deputy Secretary of the  Treasury and provided oversight and direction to the Office of Small  Business Programs as well as to bureau heads and their procurement  officials in executing the agency\u2019s responsibilities under the Small  Business Act. The letter noted that the Assistant Secretary exerted  considerable influence over acquisition and budget officials at all levels in  regards to attaining small business goals. Finally, the letter commented  that the OSDBU director assigning day-to-day operations pertaining to  small business functions to subordinate officials did not establish any such  other officials as the \u201cde facto OSDBU director.\u201d As previously discussed,  we believe that section 15(k)(3) includes an implied prohibition against  delegating the OSDBU director\u2019s authority. As a result, we did not revise  our conclusion or recommendation.", "The Social Security Administration\u2019s letter did not provide comments on  the draft report but indicated that the agency had reevaluated the  reporting relationship in light of our draft.
