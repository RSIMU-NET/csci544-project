American Samoa's minimum wage increased by $.50 three times, and the CNMI's four times before legislation delayed the increases, providing for no increase in American Samoa in 2010 or 2011 and none in the CNMI in 2011. As scheduled, American Samoa's minimum wage will equal the current U.S. minimum wage of $7.25 in 2018, and the CNMI's will reach it in 2016. Recent economic declines in both areas reflect the closure of one of two tuna canneries in American Samoa and the departure of the garment industry in the CNMI. GAO is required to report in 2010, 2011, 2013, and biennially thereafter on the impact of the minimum wage increases. This report updates GAO's 2010 report and describes, since the increases began, (1) employment and earnings, and (2) the status of key industries. GAO reviewed federal and local information; collected data from employers through a questionnaire and from employers and workers through discussion groups; and conducted interviews during visits to each area."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In American Samoa, employment fell 19 percent from 2008 to 2009 and 14 percent from 2006 to 2009. Data for 2010 total employment are not available. GAO questionnaire responses show that tuna canning employment fell 55 percent from 2009 to 2010, reflecting the closure of one cannery and layoffs in the remaining cannery. Average inflation-adjusted earnings fell by 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 and by 11 percent from 2006 to 2009; however, the hourly wage of minimum wage workers who remained employed increased by significantly more than inflation. Private sector officials said the minimum wage was one of a number of factors making business difficult. In the tuna canning industry, future minimum wage increases would affect the wages of 99 percent of hourly-wage workers employed by the two employers included in GAO's questionnaire. The employers reported taking cost-cutting actions from June 2009 to June 2010, including laying off workers and freezing hiring. The employers attributed most of these actions largely to the minimum wage increases. Cannery officials expressed concern in interviews about American Samoa's dwindling global competitive advantage. Available data suggest that relocating tuna canning operations to a tariff-free country with lower labor costs would significantly reduce operating costs but reduce American Samoa jobs; however, maintaining some operations in American Samoa would allow continued competition for U.S. government contracts. Some workers said they were disappointed by the 2010 minimum wage increase delay; however, more workers expressed concern over job security than favored a wage increase with potential for layoffs. In the CNMI, employment fell 13 percent from 2008 to 2009 and 35 percent from 2006 to 2009. Average inflation-adjusted earnings rose by 3 percent from 2008 to 2009 and remained largely unchanged from 2006 to 2009. Over the same periods, the hourly wage of minimum wage workers who remained employed increased by significantly more than inflation. In discussion groups, private sector employers said minimum wage increases imposed additional costs during a time in which multiple factors made it difficult to operate. In the tourism industry, scheduled minimum wage increases through 2016 would affect 95 percent of workers employed by questionnaire respondents. Tourism employers reported that they took cost-cutting actions from June 2009 to June 2010 and planned to take additional actions, including laying off workers. Few of these tourism employers attributed past actions largely to the minimum wage increases, and one half or less did so for each of the planned actions. Available data suggest that hotels generally absorbed minimum wage costs rather than raise room rates. Hotel payroll will represent an increasing share of total operating costs due to the minimum wage increases. In discussion groups, some tourism employers expressed concern about the minimum wage increases, but others said the increases were needed and manageable and that the primary difficulty was the CNMI tourism industry's decline. Workers participating in GAO's CNMI discussion groups expressed mixed views regarding the minimum wage increases and said they would like pay increases but were concerned about losing jobs and work hours. GAO shared the report with relevant federal agencies and the governments of American Samoa and the CNMI. While generally agreeing with the findings, they raised a number of technical concerns that have been incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, the United States enacted legislation that incrementally applies  the U.S. minimum wage to the U.S. insular areas of American Samoa and  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The  legislation raised the federal minimum wage in the U.S. 50 states from  $5.15 to $7.25 per hour over 3 years and, for the first time, also mandated a  series of $.50 per hour increases to the minimum wages in both American  Samoa and CNMI, beginning in July 2007, that would bring them to parity  with the federal minimum wage. In 2010, the United States enacted a law  delaying the scheduled minimum wage increases in both areas, providing  for no increase in American Samoa in 2010 or 2011, and no increase in the  CNMI in 2011. To date since 2007, the minimum wages in American  Samoa have increased by $.50 three times, with the minimum wage of the  lowest paid workers now set at $4.18 and the minimum wage of workers in  the tuna canning industry set at $4.76. Over the same period, the CNMI  minimum wage has increased by $.50 four times, to $5.05. Under current  law, the minimum wage for American Samoa\u2019s lowest paid workers will  reach the federal minimum wage of $7.25 in 2018; in the CNMI, this is set  to occur in 2016.", "The United States first adopted a federal minimum wage with passage of  the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). The FLSA states that its goal  is to eliminate labor conditions that hurt workers\u2019 health, efficiency, and  general well-being, noting that this should be achieved both as rapidly as  feasible and without substantially curtailing employment or earning  power. The 2007 legislation changed decades of federal law that had  allowed both American Samoa and the CNMI to apply minimum wage  rates significantly lower than the minimum wage for the U.S. 50 states.  American Samoa\u2019s minimum wage was set for each of 18 industries by the  U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) under biennial reviews, and its minimum  wages in 2006 ranged from $2.68 to $4.09. The CNMI had authority to set  its own minimum wage under its 1976 Covenant with the United States,  and its minimum wage in 2006 was $3.05. Public and private sector  officials and workers in both areas have expressed concern about the  impact of the federal minimum wage increases on the local economies.", "Since our last report in April 2010, the economies of both American  Samoa and the CNMI have continued to face major challenges, and  economic indicators show decline. Both governments face budget  shortfalls, with local spending exceeding revenues in most recent years,  and they have reduced the work hours of government employees and  taken other steps to reduce the shortfalls. Studies funded by the U.S.  Department of the Interior (DOI) have projected major additional  contraction of the two economies. American Samoa\u2019s private sector  economy is largely based on the tuna canning industry, and the closure of  one of its two tuna canneries in September 2009 significantly affected the  labor market and economy. The recent purchase of the closed facility by  another company may provide additional jobs, but operations planned in  the short-term are more limited than those before the facility closed.", "Before the first minimum wage increase in 2007, about one-third of  workers in American Samoa were employed by the two canneries, and  more than three-quarters of cannery employees were foreign workers from  neighboring Samoa, an independent country. The CNMI\u2019s economy has  been strongly affected by the departure of its garment industry and decline  in its tourism industry. Until recently, the garment industry was central to  the CNMI economy and employed close to a third of all workers; however,  by early 2009, the last garment factory had closed. Both American Samoa  and the CNMI have tried to develop new industries, including through  initiatives funded by the U.S. government, but they have had difficulty  attracting additional investment. The CNMI also faces uncertainty due to  the application of U.S. immigration law to the commonwealth, ending  decades of the CNMI\u2019s control over its own immigration system. U.S. law  established federal control of CNMI immigration on November 28, 2009,  with provisions affecting employers\u2019 access to foreign workers. In 2005,  foreign workers represented a majority of the CNMI labor force and  outnumbered U.S. citizens in most industries.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 required that GAO  report annually on the impact of minimum wage increases in American  Samoa and the CNMI. In 2010, Congress changed the GAO reporting  requirement to 2011, 2013, and every 2 years thereafter until the minimum  wage in the respective territory meets the federal minimum wage.", "In our April 2010 report, we found that before the first minimum wage  increase in July 2007, 37 percent of all workers and about three-quarters of  private sector workers employed by American Samoa questionnaire  respondents earned wages close enough to the minimum wage to be  directly affected by the first increase. In the CNMI, 18 percent of all  workers and about a third of private sector workers were directly affected  by the first increase. For both areas, we found that most private sector  workers would be directly affected by the increases once the minimum  wage reached $7.25. In contrast, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics  estimates, in 2006 approximately 2.2 percent of all hourly workers in the  U.S. states earned the federal minimum wage of $5.15 or less. Among other  findings, we also found that employment had very likely declined in both  areas, largely due to the loss of one of two tuna canneries in American  Samoa and of the entire garment industry in the CNMI.", "This report updates our 2010 report with an additional year of information  and describes, since the minimum wage increases began, (1) employment  and earnings, and (2) the status of key industries.", "In preparing this report, we reviewed and analyzed existing information  from federal sources and from the American Samoa and CNMI local  governments. In addition, because key federal sources of data on the U.S.  labor market do not cover the insular areas, we collected our own data in  each area. See table 1 for the methods we used and the scope and  limitations of our work.", "Our review had certain limitations in addition to those already noted. In  particular, although our approach yielded information on trends in  employment, wages, and earnings in both areas, it is difficult to distinguish  between the effects of minimum wage increases and the effects of other  factors, including the global recession beginning in 2009, fluctuations in  energy prices, global trade liberalization, and the application of U.S.  immigration law to the CNMI. We conducted our work from September  2010 to June 2011 in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality  Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework  requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and  appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any  limitations in our work.

Data from 2010 on total  employment are not yet available. Questionnaire responses from the  tuna canning industry show that employment of their workers\u2014most  of whom are foreign workers from independent Samoa\u2014dropped by 55  percent from 2009 to 2010, reflecting the September 2009 closure of  one cannery and layoffs in the remaining cannery. In addition, we  estimated that from 2,000 to 3,000 temporary federal jobs funded  beginning in June 2009 will end when federal funding is no longer  available. Private sector officials said minimum wage was one of a  number of factors, including the high cost of goods and utilities,  making it difficult to do business in American Samoa. American Samoa  government data show the minimum wage increases would raise  government payroll costs for its employees by about 1 percent (about  $9 million) over 7 years, and the American Samoa governor and other  public officials said they supported a return to biennial reviews of  minimum wage in American Samoa or other alternatives to the  scheduled increases.", "Inflation-adjusted earnings of those employed.

They reported plans to take the  same types of cost-cutting actions by early 2012, including laying off  additional employees. They attributed most of their past and planned  actions largely to the minimum wage increases and did so more often  than they attributed their actions largely to some other factors, such as  transportation and shipping costs and changes in business taxes and  fees. However, they said a decrease in the number of customers, such  as wholesale customers, was another important factor affecting their  actions.", "Tuna canning industry analysis. In addition to the minimum wage  increases, cannery officials also expressed concern about American  Samoa\u2019s dwindling competitive advantage in the global tuna canning  industry and said that current operations in American Samoa were not  competitive with other models. Analysis of alternate models available  to the industry suggests that moving tuna cannery operations\u2014 including unloading, loining (cleaning, cooking, and cutting), and  canning fish\u2014from American Samoa to another tariff-free country  with lower labor costs would significantly reduce cannery operating  costs. However, given that tuna facilities in American Samoa are  among few in the United States that can meet the requirements of U.S.  government contracts, many of which require U.S.-sourced and  processed fish, maintaining some operations in American Samoa  would allow the facility to continue to compete for these contracts.  Despite the advantages of moving some operations to other countries,  the remaining cannery\u2019s lease obligation through 2013 and the cost of  building new facilities elsewhere may pose obstacles to near-term  relocation. In addition, a new tuna facility operator has hired a small  number of workers formerly employed by the cannery that closed, but  it is unclear how many additional workers they will hire.", "Tuna canning and other worker views.

In its written comments, the American Samoa  government generally agreed with our findings. However, it stated that  employment losses and other aspects of economic decline in American  Samoa are greater than the report suggests and constitute an economic  depression. It stated that application of the U.S. minimum wage to  American Samoa, pursuant to the scheduled increases mandated by  Congress, continues to have devastating effects on American Samoa\u2019s  economy and labor market. The American Samoa government also  compared the economy and minimum wage increases in American  Samoa to those in the U.S. states and concluded that the minimum  wage increases caused severe employment decline in American  Samoa.

The government provided several  alternative methods for consideration. While we considered these  suggestions and summarized them in the report, our research  objectives and methodology were developed in response to the  legislative mandate and in discussions with congressional requesters.  These objectives and methodology were designed to provide sufficient  information and analysis to support congressional deliberation on  minimum wage in American Samoa and the CNMI. In its written  comments, the American Samoa government asked GAO or other  federal entities to consider the following recommendations: terminate  increases in the minimum wage immediately in American Samoa;  conduct a thorough analysis of why adverse economic effects of the  minimum wage increases were greater in American Samoa than in the  United States; and determine procedures for addressing minimum  wage in American Samoa in a way that avoids future economic  disasters. Appendix VII provides our more detailed evaluation of the  American Samoa government\u2019s letter.", "CNMI. In its written comments, the CNMI government said the draft  report fairly characterized current conditions in the CNMI and stated  that the findings were similar to those in our last report. It noted that  CNMI businesses were struggling to survive as they faced multiple  factors, including the contracting economy, uncertainties surrounding  the application of U.S. immigration law, rising energy costs, and the  global recession. It raised several questions and concerns regarding  the report methodology. First, the CNMI government questioned that  for some key past and future actions, such as reducing regular work  hours and freezing hiring, no CNMI employers attributed the actions to  the minimum wage increases. We note that, as stated in the report, we  present the weighted percentage of employers who attributed each  action to the minimum wage increases \u201cto a large extent\u201d (not those  who attributed the action to the minimum wage increases \u201cto a small  extent\u201d or \u201cto a moderate extent\u201d). The CNMI government cited several  of the limitations of the tourism industry questionnaire, as described in  this report, and recommended that the reporting method be improved  to gather a clearer picture regarding minimum wage increases and to  improve data integrity. However, for any questionnaire based on self- reported data, we cannot eliminate the possibility that some  employers\u2019 views of the minimum wage increases may have influenced  their responses. In addition, the CNMI government stated that the  analyses of CNMI residents\u2019 living standards should be strengthened,  as required by congressional mandate. Although the original mandate  (2009) specifically required us to study minimum wage effects on living  standards, the current mandate (2010) does not. However, the report  includes qualitative findings related to living standards based on  discussion groups with employers and with workers, as well as  quantitative findings on the inflation-adjusted earnings of average and  minimum wage workers. Last, the CNMI government stated that it  appreciated the delay in the minimum wage but was concerned about  other factors.

The employers selected to  receive the 2009 questionnaire comprised for-profit, not-for-profit, and  public sector employers.

As a result, the responses of larger  employers affect our findings more than those of smaller employers. We  determined the number of employees at each employer by summing the  number of hourly and salaried workers that employers reported in  questionnaire responses. In addition to asking a direct question about  number of employees, the questionnaire asked respondents to complete a  separate table listing the number of employees at each wage or salary  level. Separate tables were required for hourly wage and salaried workers.  To apply the weights, we cross-multiplied the number of employees by the  employer response, then divided by the total number of employees in the  sample. For example, if three of five employers attributed an action to the  minimum wage to a moderate extent, the unweighted response would be  60 percent. However, if those three employers represented 300 of 400  employees, the weighted response that we report would be 75 percent.", "For our analyses of the effect of minimum wage increases, we obtained  information on earnings and employment for both hourly wage and  salaried workers during the pay periods that included June 12, 2010, from  our questionnaire.

For salaried workers, respondents were asked the  number of full-time and part-time workers paid at each salary level.  However, we focused on the effect of minimum wage increases on hourly  wage workers. Hourly wage workers represented about 98 percent of  American Samoan workers and 90 percent of workers in the CNMI. One  employer, which represented fewer than 20 employees, did not provide  complete information on the distribution of hourly wage employees and so  was excluded from analyses requiring that information. To determine the  number of workers affected by each minimum wage increase, we assumed  that all workers employed by questionnaire respondents were legally  required to receive the minimum wage. If some are not covered or are  exempt, the minimum wage increases would affect fewer workers.", "After recording the questionnaire data, we verified all keypunched records  by comparing them with the corresponding questionnaires and corrected  the errors we found.

First, because the lists of employers  that received the questionnaire were intended to include only those in the  American Samoa tuna canning and CNMI tourism industries who had  responded to our 2009 questionnaire (with more than 50 employees), the  lists were not representative of all employers or of all employers in those  industries. Second, we were unable to survey employers that had closed  between 2007 and our questionnaire date, including those in the CNMI  garment industry. Third, some nonresponse bias may exist in some of the  questionnaire responses, since characteristics of questionnaire  respondents may differ from those of nonrespondents and nonrecipients  in ways that affect the responses (e.g., if those that employ a larger  number of workers would have provided different responses than those  that employ a smaller number). Last, it is possible that some employers\u2019  views of the minimum wage increases may have influenced their  responses.", "In addition, the one tuna cannery in American Samoa employed a large  percentage of workers employed by the two questionnaire respondents; as  a result, this employer\u2019s responses substantially affected our reported  questionnaire data.

For this and other analyses in this  report, we excluded nonwage labor costs due to the minimum wage  increases, such as increases in employer payroll tax contributions under  FICA.

For example, various fishery management organizations and other  parties have increased restrictions on fishing some tuna target species,  including tuna used for canning, in the western and central Pacific Ocean.  Additionally, experts and industry officials said price dynamics are a major  constraint to the industry; as the industry becomes increasingly  competitive, profit margins decrease. The highly competitive global  market for tuna products makes it increasingly difficult to pass along  higher labor and operating costs to consumers by raising prices. For  example, industry officials note that it is difficult for companies to raise  prices when supermarket brands offer consumers very low prices.  Growing supermarket and consumer demand for assurances of social and  environmental responsibility also contributes to changing industry  dynamics.", "Comparison of Four Tuna Canning Business Models  Although American Samoa is located near rich fishing grounds, its labor  costs are significantly higher than those in competing countries, both  before and after the minimum wage increases.

The remaining 50  percent of production moves to a country that exports canned tuna  tariff-free to the United States. For this model, we assume that the  workforce remaining in American Samoa will be 50 percent of the  current total workforce, and the other 50 percent will be in a tariff-free  country.

The American Samoa government developed its own estimates of  employment loss based on the information included in our report. It  concluded that American Samoa employment fell by 3,737 in 2009 and  by 7,993 in 2010-2011. Our report does not include an estimate of total  employment losses in 2009 because the data come from multiple  sources that cannot be combined. Specifically, it is unclear the extent  to which the SSA data reflect some losses of cannery jobs in addition  to other job losses, so these cannot be added to cannery job losses  from our industry questionnaire. In addition, the SSA data count the  number of employed people, while the questionnaires count the  number of jobs held at each firm. It is possible that the same person  could hold positions at multiple firms. Moreover, the SSA data include  workers who had earnings in American Samoa at any point in the year,  while the questionnaire reflects the number of jobs in the tuna canning  industry as of June of each year. Furthermore, because many of the  temporary federal jobs began after our SSA counts of employment in  American Samoa, and because workers can hold multiple jobs, it is  unclear how the temporary federal jobs will affect employment counts  based on SSA data. 2.  The American Samoa government recommended in its written  comments and in a January 2011 letter that GAO explore alternative  methods for setting minimum wage levels in American Samoa. The  government provided several alternative methods for consideration.  While we considered these suggestions and summarized them in the  report, our research objectives and methodology were developed in  response to the legislative mandate and in discussions with  Congressional requesters. These objectives and methodology were  designed to provide sufficient information and analysis to support  congressional deliberation on minimum wage in American Samoa and  the CNMI. 3.  The American Samoa government provided statements comparing the  economy and minimum wage increases in American Samoa to those in  the U.S. states. We agree that the minimum wage applies to a much  larger proportion of American Samoa (and CNMI) workers than of  workers in the U.S. states. Our report states, \u201cIn our April 2010 report,  we found that before the first minimum wage increase in July 2007, 37  percent of all workers and about three-quarters of private sector  workers employed by American Samoa questionnaire respondents  earned wages close enough to the minimum wage to be directly  affected by the first increase. In the CNMI, 18 percent of all workers  and about a third of private sector workers were directly affected by  the first increase. For both areas, we found that most private sector  workers would be directly affected by the increases once the minimum  wage reached $7.25. In contrast, according to Bureau of Labor  Statistics estimates, in 2006 approximately 2.2 percent of all hourly  workers in the U.S. states earned the federal minimum wage of $5.15  or less.\u201d The report also states, \u201cCurrent federal data on income and  poverty levels in American Samoa do not exist; however, the most  recent available data show that American Samoa had lower income  and higher poverty rates than the mainland United States.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Government", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The CNMI government provided information on decreases in CNMI  visitor arrivals from Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan. We have added this information to the existing statements on  this topic in our report. 2.  The CNMI government questioned that for some key past and future  actions, such as reducing regular work hours and freezing hiring, no  CNMI employers attributed the actions to the minimum wage  increases. We note that, as stated in the report, we present the  weighted percentage of employers who attributed each action to the  minimum wage increases \u201cto a large extent\u201d (not those who attributed  the action to the minimum wage increases \u201cto a small extent\u201d or \u201cto a  moderate extent\u201d). 3.  The CNMI government cited several limitations of the tourism industry  questionnaire, as we described in this report, and recommended that  the reporting method be improved to gather a clearer picture regarding  minimum wage increases and to improve data integrity. However, for  any questionnaire based on self-reported data, we cannot eliminate the  possibility that some employers\u2019 views of the minimum wage increases  may have influenced their responses. 4.  The CNMI government stated that the analyses of CNMI residents\u2019  living standards should be strengthened, as required by congressional  mandate. Although the original mandate (Pub. L.
