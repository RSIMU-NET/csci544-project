The implications for U.S. national security of eliminating the Visa Waiver Program are difficult to determine. It is clear, however, that eliminating the program could affect U.S. relations with other countries, U.S. tourism, and State Department resources abroad.

To assess the implications of eliminating the  program as regards U.S. national security and U.S. foreign relations, we  visited U.S. embassies in Argentina, Belgium, Italy, Slovenia, Spain, and  Uruguay, and we met with officials of the Departments of State and Justice,  including the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI). We selected five of these countries because  they were the first countries whose participation in the program was being  evaluated by the Departments of Justice and State. We selected the sixth  country, Spain, to provide a perspective on countries that had not been  evaluated. To assess the economic importance and implications of  international tourism, we reviewed official travel data for 1991\u20132001 and a  2002 report commissioned by the Department of Commerce.

It was also  intended to facilitate international travel, without posing a threat to the  welfare or security of the United States, and thereby to increase the  number of foreign travelers to the United States. In addition, according to a  statement by President Clinton, the program allowed the State Department  to reallocate scarce department resources from the issuing of visas in low- risk countries to higher priority needs such as visa screening in high-fraud  areas. The law that created the Visa Waiver Pilot Program required that  before implementing the program, the Attorney General establish an  automated arrival and departure tracking system (see page 15 for a  discussion of this system). The law also required that the Attorney General  produce a special arrival and departure form for travelers seeking to enter  the United States under the program, which was made permanent in 2000.  Persons traveling to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program must  have a valid passport issued by the participating country and be a  national of that country;  be seeking entry for 90 days or less as a temporary visitor;   have their identity checked at the U.S. port of entry against an  automated electronic database containing information about the  inadmissibility of aliens, to uncover any grounds on which the alien may  be inadmissible to the United States, with no such ground found;   have been determined by the Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS) at the U.S. port of entry to represent no threat to the welfare,  health, safety, or security of the United States;   have complied with conditions of any previous admission under the  program (e.g., stayed in the United States for 90 days or less);   if entering by air or sea, possess a round-trip transportation ticket issued  by a carrier that has signed an agreement with the U.S. government to  participate in the program and must have arrived in the United States  aboard such a carrier; and   if entering by land, have proof of financial solvency and a domicile  abroad to which he or she intends to return.", "In addition, the applicant must present a completed and signed visa waiver  arrival and departure form on which he or she waives the right to a hearing,  other than on the basis of an application for asylum, if INS denies the  applicant entry into the United States. All foreign visitors, whether they  have visas or are seeking to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver  Program, undergo inspections conducted by INS inspectors at U.S. airports  and seaports. These inspections are intended to ensure that only  admissible persons enter the United States. The INS inspectors observe the  applicant, examine his or her passport, and check his or her name against  an automated database that contains information regarding the  admissibility of aliens.", "Table 1 lists the visa waiver countries, the year each country entered the  program, and the numbers of arrivals to the United States under the  program in 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Legislative Requirements Could Affect Countries\u2019 Participation in the Visa Waiver Program", "paragraphs": ["The Visa Waiver Program Act includes criteria that a country must fulfill to  be eligible for nomination for, and continued participation in, the program.

The procedures are comprehensive and cover a variety of  security concerns, including patterns of passport and visa fraud,  assessments of terrorism within the country, and assessments of law  enforcement practices. An Interagency Working Group comprising  representatives from Justice, including the INS, and from State, including  the Bureau of Consular Affairs, developed the protocol.

State may nominate a country only after it has  determined that the country   has a low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate for its citizens who apply for  U.S. nonimmigrant visitor visas (ranging from less than 2 percent to less  than 3 percent depending on the years assessed),  has the ability to supply machine-readable passports to its citizens or is  in the process of developing such passports, and  offers visa-free travel for U.S. citizens and nationals.", "The protocol requires State to provide Justice with information on the  nominated country, including  patterns of passport fraud, visa fraud, and visa abuse over the past 5   assessments of terrorism within or outside the country by the country\u2019s   evaluations of the impact of the country\u2019s participation on U.S. national  security and law enforcement.", "Various Justice components\u2014including the law enforcement agencies (for  example, INS and the FBI), Criminal Division, and Office of Intelligence  Policy and Review\u2014review the nomination, focusing on the effect that the  country\u2019s inclusion would have on U.S. law enforcement and national  security. If no clearly disqualifying objections are raised during this review,  the Secretary of State submits a formal written nomination to the Attorney  General. After a country\u2019s formal nomination, INS leads a team of  representatives from interested agencies to visit the nominated country.

For example, INS examines the security of processes for  issuing passports but uses no quantitative criteria in assessing the process.  However, the protocol does allow the Attorney General, in determining a  country\u2019s risk level, to consider quantifiable data.

The assessment of Uruguay is still pending.  INS selected the countries for assessment on the basis of specific security  concerns. For example, INS selected Argentina because of the economic  crisis and political instability in the country; the Attorney General  subsequently removed Argentina from the program because of those  problems. INS selected Belgium because of repeated thefts of blank  Belgian passports. INS accelerated the scheduling of the evaluations after  the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. However, although INS  completed the field visits to the countries in December 2001, it did not send  the finalized reports with recommendations to Justice until September  2002.

However, it is unclear whether Justice and State will fully  implement these requirements by the deadlines called for under U.S. law.", "First, regarding passports, the October 2001 USA PATRIOT Act advanced to  October 1, 2003, the deadline for the requirement that travelers from  participating countries wishing to enter the United States under the Visa  Waiver Program must submit a machine-readable passport. Subsequently,  the May 2002 Enhanced Border Security Act stated that to remain in the  program, a visa waiver country must certify, by October 26, 2004, that it has  a program to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable passports that  contain biometric and document authentication identifiers. With the  exception of Switzerland and San Marino, all participating countries are  issuing machine-readable passports, but none issue passports that have  biometric identifiers, according to State. Some State and law enforcement  officials in Europe and the United States questioned whether countries  participating in the Visa Waiver Program would be able to certify by  October 2004 that they can issue passports with acceptable biometric  identifiers\u2014particularly since there is not yet an international standard for  biometric identifiers. The Act required that the biometric identifiers  comply with standards established by the International Civil Aviation  Organization. Representatives of several countries, including the United  States, Visa Waiver Program participating countries, and members of the  European Union (EU), have met to work toward developing  recommendations on minimum standards for the application of biometrics  in procedures and documents by the spring of 2003. However, responding  to a State inquiry to visa waiver countries about their plans to issue  passports with biometric identifiers, only 3 of 17 countries had said as of  October 2002 that they would meet the deadline. State plans to incorporate  this information into a report to the Congress on the status of countries\u2019  efforts to include biometric identifiers in their passports. State officials  also told us that in response to the U.S. requirement, European countries  might require U.S. passports to have biometric identifiers. For the system  to be effective in increasing U.S. national security, INS will need to install  machines capable of reading the biometric identifiers at each U.S. port of  entry, of which there are about 390. However, until countries decide which  biometrics they will include in their passport, INS may have a difficult time  ensuring that all ports will have machines that can read the various  biometric identifiers by October 2004.", "Additionally, the Enhanced Border Security Act conditioned participation  in the Visa Waiver Program on a country\u2019s timely reporting of its stolen  blank passports to the United States. INS has described problems with  countries\u2019 timely reporting of stolen blank passports, and the Justice  Inspector General concluded that INS does not have a mechanism to  provide systematic, consistent, and timely information about missing  passports to its inspectors. A State official testified that although this  requirement probably will not apply to countries until they are certified for continued participation in the program, State is discussing this requirement  with all countries.", "Finally, INS has not yet developed an automated nonimmigrant entry\u2013exit  control system to screen and monitor the arrival and departure of foreign  visitors entering the United States as temporary visitors. Congress has  passed several laws requiring the Attorney General to implement such a  system and has extended the implementation deadline several times. For  example, the 1986 law creating the Visa Waiver Pilot Program required, as a  condition of implementing the program, that an automated nonimmigrant  entry\u2013exit control system to monitor aliens using the program be  established.   The Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act reiterated the  requirement, directing that the system be implemented no later than 2001.    INS decided to use an existing automated border inspections system in  conjunction with its arrival\u2013departure system to meet this requirement.  The arrival\u2013departure system includes passenger information  electronically transmitted by air and sea carriers that have an agreement  with INS to transport aliens to the United States. INS began using this  system on October 1, 2002. An INS official recently testified that this new  initiative implements the requirements that had been set forth in the Visa  Waiver Permanent Program Act of 2000.", "Also, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of  1996 required an entry\u2013exit system that covered all nonimmigrant visitors,  not solely those traveling under the Visa Waiver Program. This act  required the Attorney General to develop an automated entry\u2013exit system  within 2 years of the law\u2019s enactment to collect a record of departure for  every alien departing the United States and match the record of departure  with the record of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States. Subsequently,  Congress extended the deadline to implement the system at all U.S. ports of  entry to December 31, 2005. After the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, the effectiveness of monitoring nonimmigrant visitors came under  additional scrutiny, as authorities considered how to identify and locate  terrorists who might be in the United States. As a result, new laws have  again directed the Attorney General to establish an integrated entry\u2013exit  system. INS and other agencies, including the U.S. Customs Service, State,  and the Transportation Security Agency, are working together to develop  the system. According to Justice, INS has established a multiagency task  force to coordinate all activity associated with the establishment of the  entry\u2013exit system. The systems established as part of the Visa Waiver  Program, as well as a system launched on September 11, 2002, to collect  fingerprints and a photograph from a specific population, are the first step  in the development of the entry\u2013exit system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implications of Eliminating the Visa Waiver Program Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The implications for U.S. national security of eliminating the program are  uncertain; however, eliminating the program could negatively affect U.S.  relations with participating country governments, impede tourism to the  United States, and increase the need for State personnel and facilities  overseas.

Some INS and other law enforcement  agency officials said that the Visa Waiver Program can facilitate illegal  entry into the United States by inadmissible aliens, including terrorists and  other criminals, because under the program such individuals avoid the  screening that consular officers usually perform on visa applicants abroad.  The lack of consular screening makes the program attractive to  inadmissible aliens, according to INS officials. Aliens traveling to the  United States under the Visa Waiver Program are first screened when INS  inspectors interview them for admission at the U.S. port of entry. These  inspectors have little time to screen each person entering the United States,  according to a report by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector  General. INS inspectors reported that terrorists and criminals who were  intercepted had attempted to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver  Program\u2014rather than applying for a U.S. visa abroad\u2014because they  believed it would give them a greater chance of entering the country.  Some officials in Washington, D.C., and at the U.S. embassies in Argentina  and Uruguay said that eliminating the Visa Waiver Program would increase  national security, because the visa-screening process is an additional tool  to deter terrorists from entering the United States. One Justice official  stated that the Visa Waiver Program is clearly a vulnerability and that  eliminating the program would increase national security, but at a high cost  in terms of the effect on State resources and U.S. tourism.", "Other law enforcement and State officials in Washington, D.C., and at the  U.S. embassies in Belgium, Italy, and Spain questioned whether eliminating  the Visa Waiver Program and requiring visas would increase national  security. They agreed that the visa-screening process could serve as an  additional tool to screen out terrorists but only to the extent that State had  the necessary overseas resources, including relevant information on  potential terrorists and sufficient staff and facilities to interview all or most  visa applicants. They said that if current visa waiver travelers were  required to apply for visas and State\u2019s current resource levels were not  increased, consular officers would be inundated with paperwork for  routine and low-risk cases and would become less effective and alert in  dealing with cases needing additional scrutiny.

From 1991 to 2000, in terms of both the number of travelers and dollars  spent, tourism from visa waiver countries accounted for more than half of  the overseas visitor market. Visa waiver travelers generally spend more  than other international travelers, and their spending helps to balance the  U.S. trade accounts. Because of direct and indirect economic contributions  from visa waiver travel, elimination of the Visa Waiver Program is a  concern for the travel and tourism industry.

The association also  estimates that in 2001, U.S. spending generated from international tourism  contributed $16 billion in tax revenues.", "The Department of Commerce commissioned a study in 2002 on the  economic effect of the Visa Waiver Program and estimated that, over a 5-year period, eliminating the program could result in a loss of 3 million  visitors, $28 billion in tourism exports, and 475,000 jobs. The estimates of  this study, together with anecdotal information, support the likelihood of a  negative effect on tourism. According to the Travel Industry Association of  America, the Visa Waiver Program enhances the competitiveness of the  U.S. market as an international destination and elimination of the program  could divert tourists to other destinations that do not require a visa for  entry. Foreign Commercial Service Officers in Belgium and Spain reported  visas to be a significant impediment to travel demand. State officials agreed  that visas are an impediment to both tourist and business travel and added  that any additional requirements, such as the collection of biometric  indicators, could further discourage travel to the United States. The World  Travel and Tourism Council and the World Tourism Organization also view  visa requirements as an important factor in determining levels of tourism."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Eliminating the Program Would Increase the Need for State Department Resources", "paragraphs": ["Should the Congress decide to require visas from current visa waiver  travelers, State would require more resources, such as personnel and  facilities overseas, to handle the resulting increased visa processing and  biometric collection workload. State estimates that if the individuals now  traveling under the Visa Waiver Program were required to obtain visas, the  number of applications would rise by 14 million. We estimated that State\u2019s  initial costs to process the additional workload would likely range between  $739 million and $1.28 billion, and annual recurring costs would likely  range between $522 million and $810 million. The ranges of our cost  estimates are large because they reflect the uncertainty of key variables in  our cost estimating model, such as costs for consular personnel, space, and supplies; the percentage of visa applicants that State interviews; and the  method by which State collects biometrics. Given this uncertainty, actual  costs could vary significantly.", "To estimate the costs of eliminating the Visa Waiver Program, we created a  cost model that included information on a number of variables such as  workload and staffing data (e.g., personnel and facility costs) from State\u2019s  Bureau of Consular Affairs and the time and costs involved in collecting  biometrics. We used our model to forecast a range for both additional  initial and recurring costs. Consistent with State assumptions, we assumed  a \u201clow\u201d interview rate of 10 percent (about 1.4 million applicants) and a  \u201chigh\u201d interview rate of 95 percent (about 13.3 million applicants). (See  app. I for more details of our methodology and assumptions.)", "Figure 3 shows estimated initial costs to State if the Visa Waiver Program  were eliminated. These costs include elements such as hiring, training, and  moving new consular personnel; installing additional equipment to collect  and store biometrics; and building or renovating facilities in all visa waiver  posts.", "We estimated that if State were to interview 10 percent of all visa  applicants, initial costs would likely range from $739 million to $821  million. If State were to interview 95 percent of all visa applicants, initial  costs would likely range from $1.12 billion to $1.28 billion.", "Figure 4 shows annual recurring costs, which include elements such as  consular personnel salaries, biometric hardware and software  maintenance, facility leasing and maintenance, and supplies.", "If State were to interview 10 percent of all visa applicants, recurring costs  would likely range from $522 million to $587 million. If State were to  interview 95 percent of all visa applicants, recurring costs would likely  range from $723 million to $810 million. For fiscal year 2003, State  requested $3.36 billion for ongoing operations related to diplomatic and  consular programs, including the operation of all overseas facilities.", "It could take at least 2 to 4 years to put the necessary people and facilities  in place to handle the increased workload, according to State officials.  Using State\u2019s staffing and workload assumptions, we estimated that the  department would need, in addition to the approximately 840 Foreign  Service officers who are currently overseas, more than 350 additional  Foreign Service officers to handle the extra nonimmigrant visa workload if  required to interview 10 percent of all applicants and more than 800  additional officers if required to interview 95 percent of all applicants.  According to consular officials, hiring Foreign Service officers and training  them for general Foreign Service and languages could take a year or more.  It could take several months to hire Foreign Service nationals, depending  on the availability of qualified candidates and their ability to pass the  security background check. In cases where a significant number of new  consular staff were added and new facilities were acquired, posts might  also need to employ administrative staff such as human resource  managers, post security guards, and additional facilities management and  maintenance staff.", "A portion of the initial and recurring costs shown in figures 3 and 4 would  be used for new or renovated facilities that the post would need in order to  process an increased number of nonimmigrant visa applications. In some  countries, including but not limited to Belgium, France, Italy, Slovenia,  Spain, and the United Kingdom, State would need additional work and  waiting room space to process applications; this could involve acquiring  new facilities or reopening and renovating additional posts for the  nonimmigrant visa workload. For example, in Italy, State officials said  that they would need to renovate or reopen facilities in Naples, Sicily,  Rome, Milan, and Florence. In some U.S. embassies, such as those in  Slovenia and Uruguay, available space would have to be adapted for  processing the additional workload. Identifying, procuring, and fitting out  lease space can take 24 to 48 months, on average, according to State  officials.", "State officials in most countries we visited and analysts in Washington said  that until they acquired additional space for handling nonimmigrant visas,  there would be long lines of visa applicants waiting outside the current  posts, posing a potential security threat for both the applicants and U.S.  embassy officials. Also, if additional space was acquired in unsecured  buildings separate from the embassy, personnel working in such buildings  would be put at risk until the space was upgraded for security. A U.S.  ambassador pointed out that acquiring additional space for visas would  conflict with the department\u2019s efforts to consolidate Americans into joint  space to improve their security and protect them.", "Although revenues from the surcharge for machine-readable visas would  not cover the additional initial costs related to the elimination of the Visa  Waiver Program, State could cover additional recurring costs over time.  To pay for the costs associated with the processing and issuing of machine- readable visas and with State\u2019s Border Security Program, State currently  charges applicants a $65 fee each time they apply for a machine-readable  visa. On November 1, 2002, State increased the fee to $100 to compensate  for increases in the actual cost of providing visa service. State officials have  not determined how they will fund the costs of collecting biometrics. The  options they have discussed include requesting an appropriation from the  Congress, passing the cost to the visa applicant, or a combination of the  two."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Justice Department and the State Department provided written  comments on a draft of our report.

To determine the contribution of travel from visa waiver  countries to the U.S. economy, we reviewed official travel data for 1991\u2013 2001 from Commerce, a 2002 study from Commerce, and data from the  Travel Industry Association of America and the World Travel and Tourism  Council.", "To determine the potential effects that requiring visas and biometrics from  current visa waiver travelers would have on State\u2019s resources, we created a  cost estimating model using workload and staffing data from State\u2019s Bureau  of Consular Affairs and information on the time and costs involved in  collecting biometrics. Such information included analogies to the  Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, averages of  biometric vendor costs, expert opinions from the field of biometrics, and  cost estimates developed by the International Biometrics Group. We  conducted a simulation that varied the cost estimating model  approximately 1,000 times with information on variables such as personnel  and facility costs to forecast a range for both initial and recurring costs.  During our simulation, costs fell below the top of the shaded areas in  Figures 3 and 4 in the report 90 percent of the time, while costs fell below  the bottom of the shaded areas only 10 percent of the time. In other words,  80 percent of the times we varied our simulation, costs fell within our  reported ranges.
