To facilitate prompt approval of new devices and clearance of devices that are substantially equivalent to those legally on the market, the Congress passed the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA). The act authorizes FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers and, in return, requires FDA to meet performance goals tied to the agency's review process. These goals are linked to certain actions FDA may take during the application review process. The goals specify lengths of time for taking these actions and the percentage of actions the agency is to take within specified time frames. MDUFMA requires GAO to report on whether FDA is meeting performance goals established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for fiscal year 2005 and whether FDA is likely to meet the goals established for fiscal year 2006. GAO analyzed data provided by FDA that are based on actions taken on applications FDA received from October 1, 2002, through March 31, 2005. GAO used FDA's performance on applications received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 as an indicator of the agency's likely performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Limited available data indicate that FDA has been meeting some MDUFMA performance goals established for fiscal year 2005. It is uncertain, however, whether FDA will meet all of the goals. FDA met most of the MDUFMA 2005 performance goals for which data were sufficiently complete to measure the agency's performance. As of March 31, 2005, FDA had sufficiently complete data from applications received in fiscal year 2003 to measure performance against 11 of the 20 goals established for fiscal year 2005. FDA met 9 of those 11 goals. For applications received in fiscal year 2004, FDA had sufficiently complete data to measure performance against 10 goals and met 9 of them. When FDA did not have sufficiently complete data to evaluate performance, GAO reviewed preliminary data from applications received in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005. These data suggest that FDA has taken actions tied to many of the fiscal year 2005 goals within specified time frames. These data are preliminary because some applications from each year were pending within the review process and FDA could receive and act on additional applications or amendments to applications. For example, as of March 31, 2005, about half of the applications FDA had received in fiscal year 2005 were pending action by FDA or responses from manufacturers. Because FDA's performance against the MDUFMA performance goals is based on the percentages of actions the agency takes on applications within required time frames, FDA's performance results could change as the agency completes actions on all applications and amendments for which the performance goals apply. The limited data available on FDA's performance suggest that FDA is likely to meet some fiscal year 2006 performance goals. GAO's analysis of FDA's past performance shows that FDA met most of the MDUFMA 2006 performance goals for which it had sufficiently complete data to evaluate its performance. As of March 31, 2005, FDA has sufficiently complete data from applications received in fiscal year 2003 to measure performance against 14 of 26 goals established for fiscal year 2006. FDA met 12 of those 14 goals. FDA also had sufficiently complete data from applications received in fiscal year 2004 to measure performance against 12 performance goals and met 9 of those 12 goals. GAO also reviewed preliminary data from applications FDA received in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005 and found that FDA took actions tied to many of the fiscal year 2006 goals within specified time frames. Most of these results are preliminary, however, and FDA's performance could change as the agency completes actions for applications received in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005 and receives applications in fiscal year 2006. FDA concurred with GAO's findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating  medical devices\u2014such as tongue depressors, pacemakers, and artificial  hearts\u2014to provide reasonable assurance that they are safe and effective  for human use. As part of its regulatory responsibilities, FDA reviews  applications from manufacturers that wish to market their medical devices  in the United States, including new devices and devices that may be  substantially equivalent to those already on the market. When required,  FDA also inspects manufacturers\u2019 establishments prior to making a  decision. Each year FDA receives approximately 10,000 medical device  applications. Members of the Congress, representatives of the medical  device industry, and others have expressed concern that the length of time  it takes FDA to review applications for marketing medical devices could  delay patients\u2019 access to useful, and possibly life-saving, medical devices.", "In October 2002, the Congress passed the Medical Device User Fee and  Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) to provide FDA with additional  resources to ensure prompt approval or clearance of applications for  marketing medical devices and licensing biological products. MDUFMA  authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers that submit  several types of applications to FDA for marketing medical devices. In  return, MDUFMA requires FDA to meet performance goals tied to the  review of certain medical device and biological license applications, at  least to the extent practicable. MDUFMA also required the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to develop the specific goals FDA must meet.  The Secretary developed performance goals for fiscal years 2003 through  2007. To help FDA meet the MDUFMA performance goals, the Secretary  also identified several goal-related activities for FDA to undertake, such as  hiring additional review staff.", "MDUFMA performance goals are linked to certain actions FDA may take  during the application review process and specify lengths of time for  taking these actions. Data to measure FDA\u2019s performance against the  MDUFMA performance goals are based on the percentages of actions the  agency takes on applications within specified time frames. For example,  one of the performance goals is linked to the time it takes FDA to review  and make a decision about certain applications to market devices that may  be substantially equivalent to devices that are already on the market. To  meet the performance goal established for fiscal year 2005, FDA must  reach a decision about substantial equivalence within 90 days for   75 percent of such applications received in the fiscal year. In general, the  time frames established by MDUFMA performance goals do not hold FDA  accountable for the time it takes manufacturers to respond to the agency if  the agency determines that substantial additional information is needed  before a decision can be reached.", "The number of MDUFMA performance goals that FDA must meet  increases over time, and the percentage of actions taken within the  specified time frame for some goals also increases over time. For fiscal  years 2003 and 2004, FDA was to meet the same 2 performance goals for  each year. For fiscal year 2005, FDA was to meet those 2 goals and an  additional 18 performance goals, for a total of 20. For fiscal year 2006, FDA  is to meet these 20 goals and an additional 6 performance goals, for a total  of 26. The goals established for fiscal year 2006 are tied to more types of  applications than the goals established for fiscal year 2005. In addition, 16  of the performance goals established for fiscal year 2006 require that  review actions be taken within the specified time frames on a higher  percentage of applications\u2014for example, on 80 percent rather than   75 percent of the applications\u2014than was required for similar goals  established for fiscal year 2005.", "MDUFMA requires us to report on FDA\u2019s performance as measured  against these performance goals. Our first report, issued in August, 2004,  indicated that FDA had limited data that could be used to measure the  agency\u2019s performance. As a result, it was uncertain whether FDA would  meet the MDUFMA performance goals for fiscal years 2003, 2004, or 2005.  As we reported, FDA\u2019s performance data were preliminary, in part because  many of the applications received in fiscal year 2003 and the first 6 months  of fiscal year 2004 were pending within the review process, that is,  awaiting action by FDA or responses from manufacturers. Because FDA  measures its progress in meeting the MDUFMA performance goals by the  percentage of actions the agency takes within specified time frames, we  noted that performance results could change as FDA completes its actions  on these applications.", "This report responds to the MDUFMA requirement that we report on  whether FDA is meeting the MDUFMA performance goals established for  fiscal year 2005 and whether FDA is likely to meet the goals established  for fiscal year 2006. To assess FDA\u2019s performance against the 20  MDUFMA performance goals that were established for fiscal year 2005, we  analyzed performance data from applications the agency received during  the first 6 months of fiscal year 2005. To supplement the data from the first  6 months of fiscal year 2005, we also compared FDA\u2019s actions on  applications received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 against the 20  MDUFMA performance goals established for fiscal year 2005, a  comparison FDA also conducts. We used FDA\u2019s performance on  applications received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 as an indicator of the  agency\u2019s experience in meeting the fiscal year 2005 goals and therefore its  likely performance in fiscal year 2005. Similarly, to determine the  likelihood of FDA meeting its fiscal year 2006 MDUFMA performance  goals, we compared performance data from applications the agency  received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first 6 months of fiscal year  2005 with the 26 MDUFMA performance goals that will be effective in  fiscal year 2006. In other words, we analyzed performance data collected  by FDA for actions taken on all applications that were tied to performance  goals established for fiscal years 2005 or 2006 that the agency received  from fiscal year 2003 through the first 6 months of fiscal year 2005 (Oct. 1,  2004, through Mar. 31, 2005).", "In conducting our work, we made a distinction between data that were  sufficiently complete to evaluate FDA\u2019s performance and preliminary data  that were not sufficiently complete for that purpose. FDA\u2019s data for some  MDUFMA performance goals were not complete because applications  were pending within the review process or because manufacturers can  submit additional applications or amendments to their applications. We  defined the data as sufficiently complete to evaluate performance when  we could determine whether FDA would or would not meet the  performance goal. For example, FDA had data on eight of nine  applications tied to one performance goal and took action within the  specified time frame for each of those eight applications. These data were  sufficiently complete to evaluate FDA\u2019s performance because the action  was taken within the specified time frame for at least 75 percent of  applications\u2014the percentage established for this performance goal. In  contrast, when FDA\u2019s data were not sufficiently complete to evaluate  performance, we considered data on FDA\u2019s performance to be  preliminary.", "To conduct our work and to determine what steps FDA has taken to help  meet its MDUFMA goals, we also reviewed our previous work on FDA\u2019s  performance as measured by MDUFMA performance goals, reviewed  relevant documents, and interviewed officials from FDA\u2019s Center for  Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Center for Biologics  Evaluation and Research (CBER). In addition, we reviewed FDA\u2019s  procedures for verifying the accuracy and consistency of reported  performance data.

After an initial screening of an application and  determination that the review should proceed, FDA multidisciplinary  staff conduct a scientific review of the application. (See fig. 1.) If FDA  determines that it needs significant additional information to complete its  scientific review, FDA issues a \u201cmajor deficiency letter\u201d to the  manufacturer identifying the information that is required. The  manufacturer can respond to FDA\u2019s request by submitting an amendment  to the original application. FDA then proceeds with its review of the  amended application. FDA can issue additional major deficiency letters  and review additional amendments until FDA determines that it has  sufficient information to make a decision.

These data were from applications that FDA  received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and were used to measure the  agency\u2019s performance against about half of the performance goals  established for fiscal year 2005. As of March 31, 2005, FDA had sufficiently  complete data from applications received in fiscal year 2003 to measure  performance against 11 of the 20 goals established for fiscal year 2005.  FDA met 9 of those 11 goals and did not meet 2 of them. For applications  received in fiscal year 2004, FDA had sufficiently complete data to  measure performance against 10 of the 20 goals. It met 9 and did not meet  1 of these goals. For example, one of FDA\u2019s 2005 performance goals  requires the agency to issue a first major deficiency letter within 150 days  for 75 percent of PMAs, Panel-Track Supplements, and Premarket Reports  that the agency received during the fiscal year and found to be incomplete.  For applications in the fiscal year 2003 and 2004 cohorts, respectively,  FDA issued 22 of 26 (85 percent) and 23 of 28 (82 percent) first major  deficiency letters within 150 days, thus meeting the goal.

The preliminary data available on these goals suggest that  when FDA took actions tied to fiscal year 2005 performance goals, it  generally did so within specified time frames. As of March 31, 2005, FDA  had preliminary data from applications received in fiscal year 2003 on 7 of  the 9 performance goals for fiscal year 2005 for which data were not  sufficiently complete to evaluate performance. FDA took actions tied to 5  of the 7 goals within the specified time frames.

FDA took actions tied to  these 11 goals within the specified time frames. These preliminary results  could change as FDA completes its review of pending applications and  additional applications or amendments. For example, one of FDA\u2019s 2005  performance goals for expedited PMAs was to take action within 170 days  for 70 percent of amendments containing complete responses to a major  deficiency or not approvable letter.

These preliminary performance  results could change, however, if manufacturers submit additional  amendments to applications in any of the three cohorts.", "Based on the limited data that were available as of March 31, 2005, it is  unclear whether or to what extent FDA will meet the fiscal year 2005  MDUFMA performance goals because the agency\u2019s performance could  change as the agency completes its review of applications. For example,  some applications are pending review because FDA has not reached a  decision about the application or because the manufacturer has not  responded to a letter from FDA indicating that the application included  insufficient information for FDA to complete its review.

(See table 2, which also shows the number of pending  applications from the fiscal year 2003 and 2004 cohorts.) The percentage  of pending applications varied by application type.

For example, FDA received 1,703 510(k) applications during the  first 6 months of fiscal year 2005, about half the number it received in each  of the 2 preceding full fiscal years (3,805 and 3,432 for fiscal years 2003  and 2004, respectively). These data suggest that as of March 31, 2005, FDA  had received about half of the 510(k) applications that it may receive in  fiscal year 2005. Similarly, performance results for applications FDA  received in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005 could change as  manufacturers respond to requests for additional information or submit  amendments to their applications. For example, as of March 31, 2005, FDA  had issued letters requesting additional information for 659 of the 510(k)  applications it received during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2005.

We also  reviewed FDA\u2019s preliminary data from applications received in fiscal years  2003 and 2004 and the first 6 months of fiscal year 2005, and found that  FDA took actions tied to most of the remaining fiscal year 2006 goals  within specified time frames. Preliminary performance results could  change as the agency completes actions for applications received in fiscal  years 2003, 2004, and 2005 and FDA\u2019s performance could change as it  receives applications in fiscal year 2006. FDA has taken several steps to  help meet the MDUFMA performance goals.", "Our analysis of FDA\u2019s past performance shows that FDA met most, but not  all, of the MDUFMA 2006 performance goals for which it had sufficiently  complete data. (See fig. 5.) As of March 31, 2005, FDA had sufficiently  complete data from applications received in fiscal year 2003 to measure  performance against 14 of 26 goals established for fiscal year 2006. FDA  met 12 of those 14 goals. FDA also had sufficiently complete data from  applications received in fiscal year 2004 to measure performance against  12 performance goals and met 9 of those 12 goals. Figure 5 also shows that  FDA had sufficiently complete data from both fiscal years 2003 and 2004  on 2 performance goals established for fiscal year 2006 that are tied to  510(k) applications, the type of MDUFMA-related medical device  application that FDA receives most frequently. These data indicate that  FDA met 1 of the 2 goals for applications received in both fiscal years 2003  and 2004. Sufficiently complete data were available for applications  received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to evaluate performance on 3 of the  2006 performance goals tied to 180-Day PMA Supplements, the type of  MDUFMA-related application that FDA receives second most frequently.  FDA met 2 of these 3 goals on applications received in both fiscal years.", "Figure 5 also shows that preliminary performance data from applications  received in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first 6 months of fiscal year  2005 indicate that FDA took actions tied to most of the remaining fiscal  year 2006 performance goals within specified time frames. Of 12  performance goals for which data on applications received in fiscal year  2003 were not sufficiently complete to evaluate performance, FDA had  preliminary data on 7. FDA took actions tied to 5 of these 7 goals within  the specified time frames. Of 14 performance goals for which FDA did not  have sufficiently complete data from applications received in fiscal year  2004, FDA had preliminary data for 8 and took actions tied to these 8 goals  within the specified time frames. FDA had preliminary data from  applications received in the first 6 months of fiscal year 2005 for 13 of the  26 goals established for fiscal year 2006. FDA took actions tied to these 13  goals within the established time frames. These performance results could  change as the agency completes actions for applications received in fiscal  years 2003, 2004, and 2005 and FDA\u2019s performance could change as it  receives applications in fiscal year 2006.", "In general, when sufficient data indicated that FDA\u2019s performance results  for applications received in a fiscal year met the performance goal  established for fiscal year 2005, then the agency also met the performance  goal established for fiscal year 2006, even when the 2006 goal required  FDA to take action within specified time frames on a greater percentage of  applications. There were two exceptions that involved issuing not  approvable letters as a first action on 180-Day PMA Supplements received  in fiscal year 2004 and issuing additional information letters as a first  action for 510(k)s received in fiscal year 2004. In each of these cases, FDA  met the performance goal established for fiscal year 2005, but did not meet  the goal established for fiscal year 2006.", "To help meet its MDUFMA performance goals, FDA has taken several  steps consistent with those outlined by the Secretary of Health and Human  Services in his November 2002 letter establishing those goals. For  example, FDA issued additional guidance to manufacturers on topics  related to medical device applications in fiscal year 2004 and 2005. To help  implement MDUFMA, CDRH hired 55 new staff (such as medical officers,  scientists, and engineers) in fiscal year 2004 and 44 new staff in fiscal year  2005. According to FDA, prior to the enactment of the Medical Device User  Fee Stabilization Act of 2005, there was uncertainty about the  continuation of the MDUFMA program, and as a result, most of these new  employees were hired on a temporary basis. Moreover, CDRH instituted a  hiring freeze for MDUFMA-related positions in May 2005. FDA also said  that as a consequence of hiring fewer personnel than planned to perform  tasks associated with the MDUFMA program, implementation of  improvements FDA intended to make was constrained. For example,  fewer new guidance documents were drafted, fewer existing guidance  documents were updated, and the modernization of data systems  proceeded at a slower pace than FDA intended. An FDA spokesman told  us that CDRH may lift its freeze on hiring new staff by the start of fiscal  year 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, FDA concurred with our  findings.
