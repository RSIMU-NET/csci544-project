In fiscal year 1995, the number of cases rose to about 20 million and collections of child support reached a record high of nearly $11 billion. While faced with this unprecedented workload, child support programs continue to confront state budgetary constraints and increasing federal requirements for mandated services under a series of child support reforms. For example, the recent welfare reform legislation\u2014the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193, Aug. 22, 1996)\u2014requires states to establish automated registries of child support orders and directories of newly hired employees to track and locate parents owing support. To meet these growing demands, many states are moving to privatize child support enforcement services that have traditionally been delivered by the public sector. In some places, states have contracted with private sector firms to assume all local child support services, which we refer to as full-service privatization.", "This report responds to your request for information on states\u2019 efforts to fully privatize local offices. Specifically, it addresses (1) states\u2019 rationale for full-service privatization; (2) how the performance and cost- effectiveness of full-service privatization efforts compare with publicly managed child support enforcement; and (3) what, if any, issues could affect future full-service privatization contracts.", "To determine states\u2019 rationale for privatization, we interviewed child support officials in the 12 states with 21 local full-service privatization contracts identified in our November 1995 report. To analyze the performance and cost-effectiveness of full-service privatization, we reviewed four fully privatized local offices in three states\u2014Arizona, Tennessee, and Virginia. Specifically, we examined the cost-effectiveness of each of the offices and for a set of new cases we reviewed the degree of success each had in locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity and support orders, and collecting support. In each state, we compared a privatized office with a similar public office; additionally, we compared pre- and postprivatization outcomes at one other office. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness in all four office comparisons, but because of data limitations, we analyzed performance in only three of the office comparisons. Appendix I provides a more detailed explanation of our methodology, analysis methods, and results. Finally, to identify what, if any, issues affect full-service privatization, we interviewed federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials, as well as state and contractor officials in the three states reviewed.", "Our results represent the performance of these offices on a small set of cases for an abbreviated time period and do not necessarily represent long-term public and private performance overall within these states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1975, the Congress created the federal child support enforcement program as title IV-D of the Social Security Act. The program\u2019s purpose is to strengthen state and local child support enforcement efforts for obtaining child support for families who receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits and for any non-AFDC individuals who apply for services. Services provided to these clients include locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity and child support orders, and collecting support owed. Appendix II contains a glossary of child support enforcement services.", "Child support enforcement is a joint federal and state responsibility. Within the federal government, OCSE, in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for providing leadership, technical assistance, and standards for effective state programs. States or local offices under state supervision deliver child support services to families. The federal government and the states share program costs, including contract costs, at the rate of 66 percent and 34 percent, respectively. In 1995, administrative costs for the program were $3.1 billion and collections totaled $10.8 billion. About 19 percent of the cases in the child support program nationwide received a payment in 1995.", "To help meet the demands of growing caseloads in an environment of resource constraints and increasing federal requirements, some states have turned to privatization. In our November 1995 report to you, we provided information on states\u2019 privatization of child support enforcement services and identified 37 states that had privatized or planned to privatize portions of their child support caseloads. Some of these states chose to augment their public programs by privatizing particular services, such as locating noncustodial parents or collecting support owed, while 12 others looked to private sector contractors to assume all local child support services. Under full-service privatization, states contract out all or most of the services traditionally performed by a local public entity, usually a county or judicial district. Additionally, since our November 1995 report, Ohio, South Carolina, and West Virginia have initiated full-service privatization efforts. Figure 1 shows the states in which we have identified fully privatized local offices as of September 1996. Appendix III provides further information on each of these fully privatized offices, including the local jurisdictions they serve, the contractor, and the contract length and its payment terms.", "Most contracts for full-service privatization provide for the contractor to be paid an amount equal to a percentage of the collections generated. Therefore, as a contractor\u2019s collections increase or decrease, the contractor\u2019s payment\u2014or the administrative costs paid to operate the office\u2014rises or falls proportionately. In our November 1995 report, we noted payment rates in effect ranging from about 10 percent to 32 percent of collections. Some contracts provide for variable rates that decline over the life of the contract. In these cases, a higher initial payment rate is intended to help the contractor defray start-up costs. Most contracts provide for 2 to 5 years of service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Privatize to Improve Child Support Services, Handle Growing Caseloads, and Obtain Additional Resources", "paragraphs": ["Overall, officials in the states with full-service privatization efforts most frequently cited a desire to improve the child support services offered, the need to serve their soaring caseloads, and the ability to deploy additional child support staff as reasons why they fully privatized local offices. At two offices, state officials estimated that caseloads had reached about 1,000 per worker, and they could not get the authority to hire additional public staff. Other major reasons cited by officials include the local child support offices\u2019 difficulties in meeting increasing federal program requirements; legislative or executive directives mandating privatization as a way to improve state performance; and local public entities, such as the district attorney, ceasing to provide child support services when faced with rising caseloads, staffing constraints, and additional federal requirements.", "State officials in the three states we reviewed cited similar rationales for privatizing the four offices we reviewed within their states. In Virginia and Arizona, officials cited the need to serve growing caseloads. Arizona officials also wanted to provide better service to areas previously considered underserved. At both the offices we examined in Tennessee, state officials eventually turned to privatization after the local district attorneys no longer wanted to operate the local child support offices. State officials had been encouraging the district attorney at one office to improve office performance. Both district attorneys believed that, without additional staff, their offices could no longer meet the federal performance standards and, consequently, both terminated their child support services. Faced with the loss of the governmental service providers, the state contracted out the operation of both child support offices.", "Some states have implemented full-service privatization in a way that minimizes displacement of public employees. In Virginia and Arizona, existing districts were subdivided to create new offices in February and March 1994, respectively. Creating new privatized offices in an existing district is considered easier than replacing an established office because no public workers are displaced, according to state officials. At both Tennessee offices, which were privatized in July 1992 and July 1993, the public workers lost their jobs, but according to state officials, most were offered positions with the private contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outcomes Are Comparable, but Cost-Effectiveness Varied", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis suggests that fully privatized offices can produce performance outcomes comparable to those of public child support programs.

These offices serve similar client populations in suburban and rural areas in the same part of the Tidewater area of Virginia. As table 1 illustrates, the Hampton office established paternity and support orders and made collections for higher percentages of the selected cases than did the Portsmouth office during our 18-month review period. The difference for collections was statistically significant after controlling for differences in caseload characteristics between the offices, such as the percentage of AFDC cases and the services that cases needed, while the differences for establishing paternity and support orders approached statistical significance. The difference in location rates was not statistically significant.", "With regard to the cost-effectiveness of the two offices, Hampton\u2019s cost to collect $1 of support was 60 percent lower than that for Portsmouth during the period reviewed.

In Virginia, the privatized office\u2019s administrative costs did not increase dramatically after privatization. In state fiscal year 1994, the first year of privatization, the privatized office\u2019s administrative costs grew by less than 1 percent over the previous year\u2019s imputed costs.

However, we were able to compare the offices\u2019 collections and administrative costs for the review period. At this office, our comparison of collections and administrative costs showed that the public Fifth Judicial District office provided services at a lower cost per $1 collected during the 18-month review period (see table 5).

Five years of data are presented to show data fluctuations from year to year.Comparing the data over the 5-year period shows that while the percentage of cases receiving needed services from the privatized office remained about the same or declined in certain years, the actual numbers of cases receiving most services rose dramatically.

Factors generally believed to benefit contractors include the increased flexibility contractors have in acquiring resources, managing staff, and having greater access to technology. For example, in Virginia, the contractor was able to obtain computer and other equipment for the new office in Hampton within 90 days of signing the contract. In contrast, state officials described a situation in an unrelated office where delivery of needed equipment was expected to take 7 months under an expedited state acquisition process. Likewise, in Arizona, the contractor had the flexibility to open two privatized offices within 2 months of signing the contract and to replace two managers within the first year of operation. Arizona state officials told us that the removal of state managers could not be accomplished as quickly. Officials in all three states also cited contractors\u2019 advantages in technology, such as automated systems for case management, as a possible factor affecting performance differences. Furthermore, in Virginia, the contractor provided additional technologies including extensive databases for locating noncustodial parents, bar-coded files for data management, and the use of videos during intake for consistent and complete orientation of both custodial and noncustodial parents.", "In addition to the state officials\u2019 beliefs, contractor officials also suggested factors that they believed favorably affected performance outcomes, such as their emphasis on timely and efficient processing of new cases, the co-location of child support workers in AFDC offices for case intake, and expanded evening and weekend office hours. Contractor officials in Arizona, however, believe that their performance was negatively affected by unexpectedly high staff turnover during our review period.", "In addition to factors affecting performance outcomes, the major factor affecting the cost-effectiveness of full-service privatization is how much a state has to spend to acquire these services. We identified contract payment rates ranging from about 10 percent to 32 percent of collections. These contract rates are affected by the level of contractor competition and the volume, composition, and collection potential of the caseload. For example, because AFDC cases are considered more labor-intensive to work, state officials said that an office with a high percentage of AFDC cases may require a higher payment rate than one with fewer AFDC cases. Finally, all payment rates are subject to the vagaries of the marketplace. Payment rates that are initially beneficial to a state could change when the service is rebid or reawarded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Welfare Reform Partially Resolves the Issue of Access to IRS Data", "paragraphs": ["One major issue that could have impeded future full-service privatization\u2014contractors\u2019 access to IRS tax information\u2014has been partially resolved by the recent enactment of welfare reform legislation. The issue focuses on whether full-service child support enforcement contractors have the same authority to access IRS data for locating noncustodial parents and enforcing child support orders as public offices have under the law. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 partially resolves this issue by authorizing contractors access to certain tax information.", "Currently, IRS, through OCSE, provides states and local child support offices a number of valuable location and collection services. For example, OCSE\u2019s Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) can request from IRS the social security number and address from a noncustodial parent\u2019s most recent tax return. In addition, IRS\u2019 Project 1099 program offers child support programs information on sources of earned and unearned income, such as banks and mutual funds, that are reported on IRS Form 1099 and can be used to locate noncustodial parents and their assets. Also, IRS\u2019 income tax refund offset program has been the second largest source of collections for the child support program. In 1995, it offset over $828 million of delinquent child support payments from about 1.2 million delinquent noncustodial parents\u2019 tax refunds, in addition to providing offices with filers\u2019 addresses. OCSE and the states have granted full-service contractors access to these IRS services and information in the belief that these contractors act in the same capacity as public child support offices; that is, as a designated local child support agency of the state.", "Before enactment of the welfare reform legislation, however, IRS officials took the position that section 6103(l) of the Internal Revenue Code did not authorize child support contractors access to this information. In reports it issued in January 1995 and March 1996, IRS found Nebraska and Tennessee out of compliance with the Internal Revenue Code during tax data safeguard reviews because the states had granted contractors access to IRS data. IRS officials are concerned about their ability to safeguard tax information and oppose further disclosure of IRS information for nontax administrative purposes. Federal, state, and contractor officials told us that prohibiting access to IRS data would affect the expansion and continuing operation of privatized full-service child support offices.", "At the same time that OCSE and IRS have been working on this issue, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 has partially resolved this access issue. Section 316(g)(4) of the act amends section 6103(l) of the Internal Revenue Code to permit state child support agencies to disclose to contractors the addresses and social security numbers of noncustodial parents and the amount of tax refunds withheld for past-due child support. OCSE officials said that this permits contractors access to FPLS and tax refund offset data, but denies contractors access to unearned income information currently received under the Project 1099 program.", "OCSE officials believe that the act partially addresses the issue of access to data, but does not address contractors\u2019 access to the Form 1099 information that states and contractors believe serves as a valuable enforcement tool. One possible solution to this continuing problem, according to IRS, is to have a state child support entity verify this information with its original source. Once the data are verified, the information is not subject to nondisclosure requirements. Therefore, in order for the contractor to gain access to Project 1099 program information, a state entity would have to verify it with its source (for example, a financial institution), thus entailing a separate process. However, according to state officials, requiring this additional level of verification by public employees may negate some of the perceived benefits of full-service privatization. Alternatively, under the new law, contractors may have another avenue to obtain unearned income data. Section 372 of the act requires states to match data quarterly with in-state financial institutions. However, HHS noted that it will be some time before data from these matches are available in all states.", "While welfare reform legislation provides contractors limited access to restricted tax data, it is too early to assess what effect these changes will have on contractors\u2019 use of the full range of enforcement tools currently available to public offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As child support programs continue to face resource constraints, full-service privatization appears to offer states the opportunity to supplement their child support enforcement services.
