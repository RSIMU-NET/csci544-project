As such, it provides a high-level perspective of the agency\u0092s goals and objectives, enabling the agency to prioritize how it allocates resources; proactively respond to changes; and communicate its vision and goals to management, oversight bodies, and external parties. The enterprise architecture helps to implement the strategic vision by providing a focused \u0093blueprint\u0094 of the organization\u0092s business processes and technology that supports them. It includes descriptions of how the organization operates today, how it intends to operate in the future, and a plan for transitioning to the target state. It further helps coordinate the concurrent development of IT systems to limit unnecessary duplication and increase the likelihood that these systems will inter-operate.", "SSA developed an IT strategic plan in 2007 to guide its modernization efforts; however, the plan is outdated and may not be aligned with the agency\u0092s overall strategic plan.

Specifically, many of SSA\u2019s  existing systems software were developed in the 1960s and 1970s and  are written in older computer programming languages or are past their  designed life cycle. While the agency has made technical and functional  upgrades throughout the years, it continues to face challenges because  of the need to store, process, and share increasing amounts of data and  to transition to Web-based, online access for SSA data and services,  among other factors.", "Accordingly, in its most recent Agency Strategic Plan, SSA has identified  IT as a key foundational element to achieving success in meeting its  goals. Recognizing the challenges facing its IT environment, the agency  has stated that it plans to, among other things, develop and implement a  common system for processing disability cases, increase its use of online  services for access to benefits and information, and automate its  processes for reporting information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Systems Oversees SSA\u2019s IT Systems and Investments", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s Office of Systems is responsible for developing, overseeing, and  maintaining the agency\u2019s IT systems.

These include  planning for system changes within a single fiscal year budget cycle, a  practice that limits the agency\u2019s ability to make long-term modernization  plans; devoting significant resources to the maintenance of existing  legacy systems because of large quantities of legacy code; and diverting  resources from long-term projects to shorter-term immediate  requirements, such as those arising from legislative changes.", "Compounding these challenges, we found that SSA has not fully  established performance measures or a post-implementation review  process that would allow it to determine the progress it is making in its  modernization efforts. Federal law requires agencies to identify  performance measures for their IT investments, and we have previously  reported that comprehensive measures are essential for gauging the  progress and benefits of IT investments. However, while SSA developed  performance measures for most of its 17 major modernization  investments for fiscal year 2010, it did not identify any measures in one of  four management areas identified by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) for 3 of these investments. Moreover, the measures SSA  developed did not always allow for assessments of each project\u2019s  effectiveness in meeting agency goals. For example, these measures did  not always (1) identify how each project is to contribute to expected  benefits; (2) include measures of investments\u2019 effectiveness in meeting  goals, requirements, or mission results; or (3) provide the means for  measuring progress toward specific modernization goals.", "In addition, SSA has not conducted post-implementation reviews of its IT  projects or systems, as called for by OMB guidance. Such a review  should confirm the extent to which planned benefits were achieved,  determine the cost-effectiveness of the project, and identify lessons  learned and opportunities for improvement. While SSA conducts  assessments of completed initiatives, these assessments lack key  elements called for by OMB that would provide assurance that  modernization and other IT projects are delivering expected benefits at  acceptable costs and that SSA is making progress in meeting its goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modernization Approach Is Not Guided by Key Practices", "paragraphs": ["Comprehensive strategic planning is essential for successfully carrying  out large-scale efforts such as SSA\u2019s IT modernizations.

Specifically, because it has not been  updated since 2007, the plan contains elements that are no longer  relevant to SSA\u2019s ongoing modernization efforts.

Further, it does not reflect the way in which modernization  decisions are driven by the agency\u2019s Strategic Information Technology  Assessment and Review board.", "The currency of the IT strategic plan is further called into question by the  fact that the agency updated its overall Agency Strategic Plan in 2008  and again in 2012. Thus, the IT strategic plan may no longer be aligned  with the agency\u2019s broader goals. In the absence of an updated IT  strategic plan, SSA has relied on a number of program activities to guide  its modernization efforts, such as identifying and prioritizing IT  modernization investments during its annual investment review process  and developing high-level descriptions of projects in each of the agency\u2019s  portfolios. However, these activities are based on short-term budget  cycles and do not provide a long-term strategic vision with detailed steps  and milestones. SSA officials stated that they are updating the IT  strategic plan; however, it has yet to be finalized or approved.", "In addition, SSA has developed an enterprise architecture, but it is  missing key components. Specifically, the architecture captures certain  foundational information about the current and target states of the  organization, such as current business processes and business  outcomes, to assist in evolving existing information systems and  developing new ones. Nevertheless, the architecture lacks important  content called for by federal CIO Council and OMB guidance that would  allow the agency to more effectively plan its investments and achieve its  vision of modernized systems and operations. Specifically, the  architecture lacks key elements that would establish the specific steps  and direction to reach its vision of modernized systems by 2016. In  particular, the agency has not developed a service-oriented architecture  road map that would, among other things, articulate the changes and  growth in IT capabilities over time and provide a conceptual plan that  establishes a basis for developing more detailed project plans. Further,  SSA has not conducted an enterprise gap analysis to identify the  differences between its current and target states to enable the  development of a plan for transitioning from the current to the target state.  SSA also has not developed quantitative performance expectations for  the target state or analyzed the flows of information among the agency\u2019s  business processes.

Specifically, SSA did not  develop a management plan that would describe the challenges  associated with the realignment or strategies for addressing them, along  with time frames, resources, performance measures, and accountability  structures. Further, SSA did not analyze the roles and responsibilities  needed to support the allocation of functions under the realignment.  Without such an analysis, it cannot be determined whether the  reassignment of staff that occurred as a result of the realignment  represents an optimal allocation of resources.", "In addition, SSA has not updated its capital planning and investment  control guidance to reflect the realignment.

However, the agency provided responses to  each of the recommendations, as well as more general comments on our  report\u2019s findings. SSA described steps it is taking that would address  elements of the recommendations related to planning, enterprise  architecture, and IT oversight, while it took issue with other elements of  the recommendations, including the level of detail that an IT strategic plan  should contain and the need for more comprehensive measures.
