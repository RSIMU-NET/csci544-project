To finance these efforts, they will rely heavily on low-interest loans from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program to supplement their own funds. Through fiscal year 2005, states have used their CWSRFs to provide communities over $52 billion for a variety of water quality projects. The Clean Water Act allows states to use their CWSRFs to (1) construct or improve conventional wastewater infrastructure, (2) control diffuse (nonpoint) sources of pollution such as agricultural runoff and leaking septic systems, and (3) protect federally-designated estuaries. Given the states' flexibility in determining how to spend CWSRF dollars, GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which states use their CWSRF dollars to support conventional wastewater treatment infrastructure versus other qualifying expenses, (2) the strategies states use to allocate their CWSRF dollars among qualifying expenses, and (3) the measures states use to ensure that their allocation strategies result in the most efficient and effective use of CWSRF dollars. EPA reviewed a report draft, providing technical comments that were incorporated."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 1987, states have used 96 percent (about $50 billion) of their CWSRF dollars to build, upgrade, or enlarge conventional wastewater treatment facilities and conveyances. Projects to build or improve wastewater treatment plants alone account for over 60 percent of this amount, with the remainder supporting the construction or rehabilitation of sewer and storm water collection systems. CWSRF assistance for nonpoint source activities represents only 4 percent (about $2 billion) of CWSRF dollars, although it accounts for over a quarter of all CWSRF projects financed. To date, 37 states report using some portion of their CWSRF funds to directly support nonpoint source activities. Nationwide, 23 percent of CWSRF funds (64 percent of all CWSRF loan agreements) were devoted to water quality projects in communities with populations of less than 10,000 people. The 50 states (and Puerto Rico) have used a variety of strategies to allocate CWSRF funds to meet their individual needs. For example, the state of Washington sets aside 20 percent of its CWSRF dollars to support nonpoint source projects, while Alabama state law defines only traditional public wastewater treatment facilities as appropriate projects under its CWSRF program. Other states have designed their programs to target selected types of borrowers. Pennsylvania, for example, has targeted borrowers in small or rural communities during the allocation process. According to EPA and state officials, states' allocation strategies may change as certain states' priorities and clean water needs shift. Among the reasons are (1) aging wastewater infrastructure in need of rehabilitation or replacement; (2) population growth and redistribution; (3) changes in EPA enforcement priorities; and (4) stricter EPA and state water quality standards for temperature, nutrients, and sediments. EPA and the states use a uniform set of financial and environmental measures to help determine efficient and effective use of CWSRF resources. Financial measures include, among others, return on federal investment, the pace at which available funds are loaned, and the sustainability of the fund. EPA regional officials conduct annual reviews of each state program to help ensure the fiscal integrity of the state programs. All programs are also subject annually to independent financial audits. To measure environmental outcomes of CWSRF-funded projects, in fiscal year 2005, EPA developed an electronic benefits reporting system that all 51 programs have agreed to use. Currently, the system collects data only on anticipated environmental benefits associated with CWSRF-funded projects. However, to varying degrees, some states such as Oklahoma and Washington are attempting to gather data on actual environmental benefits from their CWSRF-funded projects, including nonpoint source projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the  Congressional Budget Office suggest that, over the next 15 years, local  communities will need hundreds of billions of dollars to construct and  upgrade aging wastewater treatment facilities, sewer systems, and other  projects that improve water quality and help safeguard public health and  the environment. These communities will rely on EPA\u2019s Clean Water State  Revolving Fund (CWSRF) to supplement the funds they obtain from their  ratepayers to finance these efforts. The Water Quality Act of 1987  amended the Clean Water Act and created the CWSRF program to provide  an independent, permanent, low-cost source of financing for a wide range  of efforts to protect or improve water quality. Through the CWSRF, EPA  provides annual grants to the states to capitalize state-level CWSRFs.  States must match these EPA grants with a minimum of 20 percent of their  own contributions. States loan their CWSRF dollars to local governments  and other entities for various water quality projects, and loan repayments  are cycled back into the state-level programs to fund additional projects.  According to the EPA, all 50 states and Puerto Rico currently maintain  revolving loan funds that have provided an average of over $4 billion in  total annual assistance since 2000.

Although the CWSRF is primarily a low- interest loan program, states can also use it to refinance, purchase, or  guarantee local debt and purchase bond insurance. States may customize  their loan terms, including interest rates (from 0 percent to market rates)  and repayment periods (up to 20 years), depending on the financial and  environmental needs of potential borrowers.

Local ratepayers have long been relied  upon to fund both construction costs and operating and maintenance  costs associated with facilities serving their communities. However, the  federal government has provided financial assistance for these wastewater  treatment facilities since the enactment of the Water Pollution Control Act  Amendments of 1956, which established the federal Construction Grants  program. Through this program, the federal government provided grants  directly to local governments for constructing treatment facilities but  limited the federal contribution to the lesser of 30 percent of eligible  construction costs or $250,000. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act  Amendments of 1972, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, increased  the federal share of costs to 75 percent. According to the Congressional  Budget Office, federal outlays for wastewater treatment grants rose  tenfold during the 1970s, reaching a high of $8.4 billion in 1980.  Subsequent amendments in 1981 and 1987 reduced and then phased out  the construction grant program, replacing it with the CWSRF. Instead of  providing grants directly to localities, the CWSRF provides federal grants  to the states, which in turn provide loans to communities and other  entities to finance wastewater treatment and other water quality projects.  The 1987 law established a system in which the states would use the loan  repayments to finance future CWSRF loans, thereby allowing the state  revolving funds to operate without sustained federal support. Congress  authorized appropriations through 1994 but has continued to appropriate  funds to the CWSRF each year since.", "The transfer of federal funds to state-level CWSRFs begins when Congress  appropriates funds annually to the EPA. EPA then allots capitalization  grants to the individual states. The Clean Water Act also requires states to  provide state funds to match 20 percent of the total federal CWSRF  capitalization grants. To receive its allotment, a state must provide an  Intended Use Plan that lists potential projects to solve water quality  problems and solicit public comments on that list. After completing the  plan and receiving its capitalization grant, a state has up to 1 year to enter  binding commitments (later converted into loan agreements) with  potential borrowers to fund specific water quality projects. The majority of  CWSRF borrowers are municipalities and other local units of government,  although in some states nonprofit organizations, businesses, farmers,  homeowners, and watershed groups are eligible to seek nonpoint source  funding through the CWSRF.", "According to an EPA headquarters official, a single CWSRF loan may  support multiple clean water projects. State CWSRF administrators set  loan terms, interest rates, and repayment periods. Loan repayments are  cycled back into the state-level fund and used for additional water quality  projects.

For example, the legislation that created Alabama\u2019s  CWSRF limits the scope of the program by defining projects that receive  CWSRF funds as traditional public wastewater facilities.

However, EPA reports that one-third of the nation\u2019s assessed  waters still do not meet water quality standards. Recognizing the  considerable role of nonpoint source pollution in these standards  violations, the majority of states have decided to focus at least some  attention on addressing these problems with their CWSRF resources.", "EPA has encouraged all states to use a watershed management approach  to solving water quality problems, which according to state and EPA  officials, has increased the number of states addressing nonpoint source  pollution with their CWSRFs.

For example, in an effort to  ensure that CWSRFs address nonpoint source problems, some states have  passed legislation setting aside a portion of their CWSRFs to be used  exclusively for nonpoint source projects. For example, Washington state  regulations require that CWSRF administrators reserve up to 20 percent of  available funds for nonpoint source pollution control and comprehensive  estuary conservation and management projects.", "Other states have developed innovative lending approaches to overcome  some of the barriers to funding nonpoint source projects with CWSRF  resources. To increase the number of nonpoint source borrowers while  minimizing loan transaction costs, some states pass CWSRF loan risks and  loan servicing responsibilities onto third parties. These states have  established pass-through lending or linked-deposit programs, whereby  loans are passed through state agencies, municipalities, or local banks  before reaching the borrower. Minnesota\u2019s CWSRF program, for example,  works with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to allocate a portion  of its funds to counties, soil and water conservation districts, and others to  help establish minirevolving loan accounts. These local units of  government work with local financial institutions to provide low interest  loans for projects proposed by farmers, rural landowners, and agriculture  supply businesses for projects to implement, among other things,  agricultural best management practices. The local units of government  approve eligible projects and refer borrowers to the local financial  institutions. Using CWSRF funds from the minirevolving loan account, the  bank provides low-interest loans to qualified borrowers. The lending  institution assumes the risk and management responsibility for the loan.  Other states\u2014such as Massachusetts and Missouri\u2014have set up similar  pass-through loan programs to address nonpoint sources of pollution with  CWSRF funds.", "To overcome the challenge of finding a dedicated source of repayment for  nonpoint source projects, Ohio\u2019s Water Resource Restoration Sponsor  Program integrates CWSRF support for nonpoint source projects into  loans for wastewater treatment plants. According to Ohio CWSRF  officials, communities seeking a CWSRF loan for a wastewater treatment  facility can receive a discount to the interest payments that would  otherwise be due on their wastewater project loans. After the wastewater  facility loan has been awarded, the amount of the interest discount is  advanced to the community, which then assumes responsibility for  financing the implementation of the associated nonpoint source project. In  return, the community receives a reduction to its wastewater facility loan\u2019s  interest rate of up to 0.2 percent. A community that participates in this  program does not typically implement the nonpoint source project itself.  Rather, it enters into an agreement with an implementing partner, such as  a land trust or a park district. Using the interest discount funds, this  partner develops and implements a nonpoint source project (such as a  plan to restore and permanently protect a waterbody\u2019s aquatic habitat  resources) but does not repay the CWSRF. Instead, the sponsoring  community covers the cost as part if its repayment of its wastewater  facility loan.", "According to Ohio officials, the benefit of the state\u2019s program is that water  restoration projects that may not normally receive CWSRF funding are  completed with the help of the wastewater treatment plants. Based in part  on the program\u2019s success, Ohio officials have decided to set aside $15  million of CWSRF resources each year for their Water Resource  Restoration Sponsor Program.

Smaller  communities may struggle more to raise capital for water quality  infrastructure than larger communities with broader tax and rate bases. In  1992, Congress directed EPA to establish a Small Town Environmental  Planning Task Force to, among other things, advise EPA on how to work  better with small communities. The task force found that technical and  administrative capacity is often severely limited in small towns, which  often lack full-time officials and professional staff. Moreover, the task  force found that small communities tend to have severely limited tax bases  and budgets and, therefore, may not have the necessary credit ratings to  attract capital to finance their wastewater infrastructure. In addition,  infrastructure costs fall disproportionately on small towns because entry- level costs must be distributed over a smaller base.", "Recognizing these challenges, some states\u2014such as Montana,  Pennsylvania, and West Virginia\u2014use their CWSRFs to help rural, low- income communities meet required sewage and water quality standards. In  Pennsylvania, almost 90 percent of all CWSRF loan agreements and 75  percent of total funding is directed to projects in small communities.  Several states have set aside a portion of their funds for CWSRF-funded  projects in small or economically disadvantaged communities. For  example, Oregon reserves up to 15 percent of its CWSRF to support  projects in communities with populations of 5,000 or less that are facing  severe water quality problems. According to EPA and state officials, some  CWSRF programs have rules to protect the ability of small communities to  access CWSRF funds. For example, some states such as New York and  Minnesota have placed limits on the amount of CWSRF support any one  borrower\u2014such as a major metropolitan area\u2014can receive in a given  year.", "A number of states offer small or economically disadvantaged  communities special assistance when applying for CWSRF loans. For  example, Ohio offers CWSRF loans with (1) a zero percent interest rate to  communities with populations of less than 2,500 and a median household  income of less than $45,000 and (2) a 1 percent interest rate to those with  populations between 2,500 and 10,000 and a median household income of  less than $38,000. West Virginia CWSRF administrators are able to extend  repayment terms up to 40 years to qualified disadvantaged communities to  help make projects more affordable. Kentucky offers special state-funded,  short-term loans to small communities to help them cover expenses  related to obtaining a CWSRF loan. Montana has developed special  outreach and technical assistance programs to help small communities  take advantage of the CWSRF program. Montana officials explained that  many small communities lack the necessary administrative structures to  receive a CWSRF loan or lack the technical expertise to develop  competitive applications for CWSRF loans. The state has contracted with  the Rural Community Assistance Partnership, a nonprofit organization, to  provide technical assistance to rural and small communities to guide them  through the process of developing a competitive application and set up the  necessary administrative structures to receive a CWSRF loan. Officials in  several small Montana communities told us that, without this technical  assistance, they would not have been able to receive the CWSRF loans that  were critical to the financing of their wastewater infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future State Allocation Strategies Will Likely Reflect Shifting Priorities", "paragraphs": ["According to the EPA and state officials we interviewed, demand for  CWSRF support for both point and nonpoint source projects will grow  considerably in the future, and states will likely alter their CWSRF  allocation strategies in response to shifting clean water needs and  priorities. Among the factors these officials cite in predicting changes in  states\u2019 allocation strategies are (1) aging wastewater infrastructure  needing rehabilitation or replacement; (2) population growth and  redistribution; (3) changes in EPA enforcement priorities, particularly with  regard to limiting sewage discharges during wet weather conditions; (4)  pressure to implement EPA\u2019s TMDL program; and (5) stricter EPA and  state water quality standards for temperature, nutrients, and sediments.", "Officials in all 10 EPA regional offices and a number of state officials told  us that the need to repair or replace aging wastewater infrastructure will  be a major driver of future demand for CWSRF resources. These officials  point out that many of the wastewater treatment plants and conveyances  built with federal support in the early 1970s in response to the passage of  the Clean Water Act are now reaching the end of their useful lives. EPA  data indicate that wastewater treatment plants typically have an expected  useful life of 20 to 50 years before they require expansion or rehabilitation.  Wastewater conveyances such as pipes and sewers have life cycles that  can range from 15 to over 100 years. In addition, some wastewater systems  on the East Coast still rely on pipes that are almost 200 years old. Taking  into account the need to repair or replace these aging systems, a 2002  Congressional Budget Office analysis estimated that between 2000 and  2019, $260 to $418 billion will be needed for wastewater infrastructure,  while current spending is approximately $10 billion per year. CBO\u2019s  analysis suggests that the gap between current and needed spending could  be as high as $11 billion per year.", "In addition to repairing or replacing existing infrastructure, EPA officials  predict that some states will face increased demand for new wastewater  treatment systems in response to population growth. In addition to overall  population growth, EPA also indicates that the existing U.S. population is  shifting geographically, requiring rapid increases in wastewater treatment  capacity in certain areas. EPA officials indicated that some states in the  West\u2014such as Utah and Nevada\u2014and the South\u2014such as Georgia and  Florida\u2014are already experiencing rapid population growth and  considerable pressure to expand existing treatment capacity. In addition,  EPA officials point out that in the near-term, some states along the Gulf  Coast will have to balance the need for new growth with demand to  replace or repair wastewater infrastructure that was damaged by recent  hurricanes.", "In response to recent EPA wet weather policies and enforcement actions,  some state and EPA officials predict that a number of states will  experience increased demand for CWSRF assistance to address combined  sewer overflows (CSO), which are discharges of untreated wastewater  from a combined sewer system. Combined sewer systems collect and  transport both sanitary sewage and storm water runoff in a single-pipe  system to a wastewater treatment facility. Constructed prior to the 1950s,  combined sewer systems exist in primarily older, urban communities in  the Northeast, Middle Atlantic, Midwest, and Northwest. An overflow  typically occurs when the total wastewater and storm water flow exceeds  the capacity of the system and, by design, discharges directly into a  receiving water body. Pollutants in CSOs have been shown to be a major  contributor to nonattainment of water quality standards and may pose  significant public health and pollution threats. As such, EPA has selected  these problems as national enforcement priorities. Sixty percent of the  more than 9,000 combined sewer systems nationwide serve communities  of fewer than 10,000 people\u2014-the very communities that face some of the  most difficulty in raising capital to address environmental infrastructure.  States have already used almost $5 billion of CWSRF funds to correct  CSOs, and EPA recently reported to Congress that an additional $50 billion  is required nationwide. Officials in some Midwestern states\u2014such as  Michigan and Minnesota\u2014predict that addressing CSOs will be one of the  biggest drivers of demand and that funding these projects will become a  higher priority in the future. According to officials in EPA\u2019s Chicago and  Atlanta Regional Offices, some states facing major CSO problems\u2014such  as Indiana and Kentucky\u2014have indicated that the CWSRF will be a  primary source of funding for their long-term CSO management plans.", "State and EPA officials also point out that demand for CWSRF support for  nonpoint source pollution control projects is likely to grow as states begin  projects to bring impaired waters into compliance with EPA\u2019s TMDL  program. A TMDL is a calculation of the total maximum amount of a  pollutant that a body of water can receive each day and still meet water  quality standards. Water quality standards are set by states, territories,  and tribes and identify the uses for each body of water such as drinking  water supply, contact recreation (swimming), and aquatic life support  (fishing). States generally determine if a body of water is meeting  standards by comparing monitoring data with applicable state water  quality criteria. If the body of water fails to meet applicable federal, state,  or local water quality, then the state is required to list that water as  impaired. EPA guidance provides that the state should then develop a  TMDL implementation plan that specifies reductions necessary to achieve  the standard and then eventually implement a cleanup plan. According to  EPA guidance, the state implementation plan should specify which  pollution sources will be restricted to meet water quality standards. State  and EPA officials indicate that a majority of standards violations relate to  nonpoint sources of pollution and, subsequently, a number of TMDL  projects address nonpoint sources of water pollution. For example,  Minnesota CWSRF officials told us that they believe 86 percent of the  pollution in their impaired waters emanates from nonpoint sources of  pollution. According to some state and EPA officials, many states are  considering the CWSRF as a major source of funding, given the amount of  resources and the overall costs of implementing the plans.", "In a similar vein, EPA and state officials also pointed out that stricter  federal, state, and local water quality standards will continue to drive up  demand for CWSRF loans for both point and nonpoint source projects. For  example, according to officials in EPA\u2019s Philadelphia Regional Office,  stricter biological and nutrient standards in the recent Chesapeake Bay  Agreement will drive demand for CWSRF loans in Mid-Atlantic states.  Officials in Minnesota told us they are experiencing a surge in demand for  CWSRF loans to repair or replace individual failing septic systems due to  greater attention and more stringent enforcement by state and county  regulators. EPA officials in EPA\u2019s Seattle Regional Office point out that  efforts to protect the region\u2019s endangered salmon and bull head trout  through the Endangered Species Act may force wastewater treatment  plants to upgrade their treatment efforts and local municipalities to  address nonpoint sources of pollution. These officials predict that tougher  temperature and sediment standards in waters receiving effluent will drive  demand, especially for nonpoint source projects, in states such as  Washington, Idaho, and Oregon."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA and the States Use Specific Financial and Environmental Measures to Evaluate Efficient and Effective Use of CWSRF Resources", "paragraphs": ["EPA and the states use a uniform set of financial and environmental  measures to help determine efficient and effective use of CWSRF  resources.

According to a  senior EPA headquarters official, CWSRF project-summary information,  reported by the states in the National Information Management System, is  used to calculate the indicators on a state by state and national level. The  indicators include the following:    Return on Federal Investment estimates how many dollars in  environmental investment have been generated for every federal dollar  spent through the program.", "Ratio of Executed Loans to Funds Available for Loans (often referred to  as the \u201cpace\u201d at which loans are made) measures the cumulative dollar  amount of executed loan agreements relative to the cumulative dollar  amount of funds available for loans. It is one indicator of how quickly  funds are made available to finance CWSRF eligible projects.", "Ratio of CWSRF Loan Disbursement to Executed Loans measures the  speed at which projects are proceeding toward completion by comparing  the cumulative dollar amount of CWSRF loan disbursements with the  cumulative dollar amount of executed loan agreements and expressing  this as a percentage.", "Estimated Additional CWSRF Loans Made Due to Leveraging estimates  the dollar amount of additional projects that have been funded, that  otherwise might not have been, had leveraged bonds not been issued. This  is done by comparing the cumulative amount of CWSRF executed loans  with the cumulative amount of funds available after subtracting the net  funds provided by issuing bonds.", "Sustainability of the Fund gauges how well the CWSRFs are maintaining  their invested or contributed capital, without making adjustments for loss  of purchasing power due to inflation.", "EPA\u2019s second measure to evaluate effective and efficient use of CWSRF  dollars is its annual review and accompanying written PERs conducted by  EPA\u2019s regional offices of each state program. According to the EPA\u2019s  annual review guidance, the review is intended to, among other things (1)  evaluate the success of the state\u2019s performance in achieving goals and  objectives identified in its Intended Use Plan (which identifies the  intended uses of the amounts available to its CWSRF) and the state\u2019s  Annual Report (which describes how the state has met the goals and  objectives of the previous fiscal year as identified by the Intended Use  Plan), (2) determine how the CWSRF is achieving the intent of the Clean  Water Act, (3) assess the financial status and performance of the fund, and  (4) evaluate progress in identifying the environmental and public health  benefits of the program. The review, based on the information collection  and evaluation process, ends with the issuance of the PER.", "EPA\u2019s third measure is the annual financial audit. The Clean Water Act  requires the 51 state-level CWSRF programs to undergo these audits to  determine whether the CWSRF financial statements are presented fairly in  all material respects in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles (GAAP) and whether the state has complied with the laws,  regulations, and the provisions of CWSRF capitalization grants. The  audit, conducted under the Single Audit Act, focuses on the state\u2019s overall  CWSRF program, rather than individual capitalization grants awarded to  states by EPA.

This task force, comprised of  federal and state officials, identified obstacles to measuring benefits and  shared ideas for solutions. It attempted to develop key environmental  indicators, such as the number of pounds of pollutants removed from  wastewater treatment plant effluent. However, a number of obstacles  prevented collection of comprehensive environmental benefits  measurements\u2014most notably (1) a lack of baseline environmental data  and (2) technical difficulties in attributing benefits specifically to the  CWSRF.

Moreover, according to EPA headquarters officials, recent  reviews by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and EPA\u2019s Office  of Inspector General provided further impetus to quantify environmental  outcomes of the CWSRF. In particular, a 2004 EPA Office of Inspector  General report criticized the program for not developing a comprehensive  plan for measuring results and recommended that such a plan be  developed.

This system strives to capture anticipated  environmental benefits that are expected to result from CWSRF-funded  projects. The system does not require any environmental monitoring,  focusing instead on anticipated environmental benefits. According to EPA  headquarters officials, all 51 programs have agreed to use the system to  report the environmental benefits of their CWSRF-funded projects and  must report on all loans made from capitalization grants received after  January 1, 2005.", "By July 2005, states were able to enter data about anticipated  environmental improvements to bodies of water resulting from CWSRF- funded projects. Unlike the National Information Management System  data, which is submitted by the states each year in the aggregate, the  environmental benefits data is submitted on a per-project basis, at the time  of loan execution.

Washington State, for example,  recently required applicants to monitor the environmental impact of all of  its CWSRF projects 3 to 5 years after project completion. Between 2001  and 2003, Oklahoma conducted water quality monitoring on 19 receiving  streams, both upstream and downstream of CWSRF-funded improvements  to remove pollutants and increase dissolved oxygen in effluent entering  the streams. However, the study could not determine the extent to which  these particular projects improved overall water quality in the streams,  largely because baseline environmental data were unavailable.", "Other states are going beyond the minimal requirements of the EPA  system by estimating the degree to which pollution is prevented by  specific CWSRF-funded projects. Delaware CWSRF officials, for example,  explained that since 2000, they have used estimates of the amount of  pollutants a proposed CWSRF project would remove from the waste  stream to develop the state\u2019s Project Priority List.

Moreover, CWSRF programs must comply with the Single Audit  Act and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and undergo  independent financial audits. However, we determined that data about the  number of CWSRF loan agreements were of less certain reliability to  identify the exact percentage of loan agreements between qualifying  expenses, given that states vary in the way that they account for the  number of loan agreements.
