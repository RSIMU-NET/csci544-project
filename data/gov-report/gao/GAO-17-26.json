State implemented three steps in the process for which it was responsible, such as preparing justification packages for planned drawdowns. DOD implemented some parts of its stated process. For example, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which is the lead DOD entity for drawdowns, worked with the military departments to identify resources for the drawdowns from fiscal years 2011 through 2015. However, the Army and Air Force\u2014which together delivered about 96 percent of the dollar amount of drawdown aid during that time\u2014did not conduct required impact assessments. Specifically, the two military departments had not assessed the potential impact of drawdowns on military readiness and budgets during drawdown planning, as required by DOD guidance. Neither of the military departments has assigned responsibility for conducting the assessments, and DSCA did not determine whether the assessments had been completed.

This aid could include providing security assistance and building foreign  partner capacity. An interagency process involving executive branch  agencies, including the Department of State (State) and DOD, guides the  planning and decision making for drawdowns. Drawdowns of defense  articles may include items such as vehicles, spare parts, clothing, food,  and medical equipment.

When a crisis occurs, the  agencies work together to determine that a drawdown is required. The  interagency process also determines which articles and services should  be provided, depending on need and availability, and the maximum value  of the drawdown that will be authorized within the statutory limits.

DSCA officials said that this  requirement was added after DSCA surveyed members of the DOD  security cooperation community about what changes they would like to  see in the 2003 update to the SAMM.

State officials said that the determination as required by these  drawdown authorities is documented in a Memorandum of Justification  and in the Presidential Determination, which is signed by the President  and published in the Federal Register. State provided Memoranda of  Justification, Presidential Determination letters, and other related  documents for each of the 13 drawdowns for fiscal years 2011 through  2015.", "State officials said that when they are considering whether to use a  drawdown authority, they perform a review of various authorities and  funding sources to determine whether the use of a drawdown authority is  appropriate. State officials noted that there are many foreign assistance  authorities intended for various purposes. Drawdown authorities in  particular can allow State to provide assistance in emergency situations  outside of the regular 3-year budget cycle. The officials noted that the  drawdown authorities were particularly useful for providing airlift support  in Africa, as there are not many other authorities that can be used for this  purpose. The officials also noted that there are other authorities available  in emergency situations, and these authorities have been used instead of  drawdowns. For example, during the Ebola crisis in West Africa in 2014,  State requested over $2 billion in emergency funds but did not use  drawdown authority. In addition, State provided signed congressional  notifications to us for all of the drawdowns, showing it had completed this  step in the process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Implemented Drawdowns, but the Army and Air Force Did Not Assess the Impact of Drawdowns on Readiness and Budgets", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the drawdown process identified in the SAMM and DSCA  Handbook, DSCA worked with the military departments to implement  drawdowns. The guidance calls for DSCA to work with the military  departments to identify available resources for drawdowns, develop an  EXORD that guides the drawdown, and maintain data on the execution of  the drawdown. We found that DSCA fulfilled these steps. For example,  DSCA officials said they work with the military departments and other  DOD entities to determine what specific assistance the military  departments will provide and which military department will provide it.  According to officials, this coordination occurs by e-mail and phone.  Based on those determinations, the appropriate DSCA Country Program  Director develops an EXORD\u2014which may be subsequently updated with  additional guidance\u2014that provides direction to the various DOD  components involved. We found that DSCA had developed EXORDs for  the 12 drawdowns authorized from fiscal years 2011 through 2015 for  which DOD provided articles and services. Finally, DSCA tracks the  execution of the drawdown by maintaining data on articles and services,  along with their value, in an automated database, the DSCA 1000  System. The military departments provide execution data to DSCA, and  DSCA enters the data into its 1000 System. We found DSCA maintained  execution data on the 12 drawdowns for which it provided articles and  services, as discussed earlier in this report. As we noted in our April 2016  report, DSCA has not reported to Congress on any of the instances in  which drawdown authorities have been used since 2011. In its comments  on that report, DOD agreed that it should report more frequently on  drawdowns.", "However, during the planning process and prior to implementing  drawdowns, the Army and Air Force did not assess the potential impact of  drawdowns to readiness and budgets as required by the SAMM and  DSCA Handbook. The SAMM and DSCA Handbook state that the military  departments are to review the potential impact of each planned  drawdown on operational readiness and O&M budgets prior to  authorization and execution. The SAMM and DSCA Handbook direct  DSCA to coordinate any readiness impacts that are identified by the  military departments with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and, if  required, refer questions regarding readiness impacts to the Secretary of  Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense. With respect to budget impacts,  drawdown costs are to be balanced among the military departments as  much as possible, and DSCA is to serve as an \u201chonest broker\u201d for the  equitable distribution of requirements.", "Army and Air Force officials we spoke with told us they had not conducted  readiness and budget impact assessments prior to drawdowns. Although  officials from both military departments stated that they use the SAMM  and DSCA Handbook as guidance for planning and executing  drawdowns, no officials we spoke with said they were familiar with the  requirement to conduct impact assessments. Officials from Army and Air  Force organizations that plan and implement drawdowns were not aware  of any impact assessments and told us that, if these assessments were to  be done, they would be done by readiness officials. Army and Air Force  readiness officials told us they were not aware of the drawdowns until we  shared information on these drawdowns with them, and they stated that  they have not been tasked with assessing their readiness impacts. They  added that the traditional readiness reporting they oversee is not suited to  capturing such assessments.", "The impact assessments were not conducted, in part, because neither  the Army nor the Air Force has issued department-specific guidance that  assigns responsibility and identifies the steps to be taken for conducting  impact assessments. According to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, management should design control activities to  achieve objectives and respond to risk. Examples of control activities  include reviews of performance by management at the functional or  activity level and appropriate documentation of internal control. In  addition, management should establish and operate monitoring activities  to assess the quality of performance over time. By not following DOD  guidance for conducting readiness and budget impact assessments, the  Army and Air Force are not in a position to identify and mitigate potential  negative impacts that could result from providing the defense articles and  services under consideration for inclusion in a drawdown package.", "Another contributing factor is that DSCA does not determine whether the  military departments have completed the required impact assessments.  DSCA officials told us they do not ask for or review impact assessments  from the military departments before proceeding with the drawdowns.  According to the officials, assessing operational readiness and managing  budgets are the responsibility of the military departments, and they do not  consider oversight of such activities part of their role when planning for  drawdowns. In addition, the officials said they were not aware of any  readiness impacts within recent years that had been raised to the level of  the Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense for  consideration. However, the DSCA Handbook states that one of the key  roles of the DCSA Country Program Directors is to ensure that impacts of  the drawdown are balanced among the services as much as possible. In  addition, as noted earlier, federal internal control standards state that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risk. Examples of common categories of control activities  include reviews by management at the functional or activity level,  establishment and review of performance measures and indicators, and  appropriate documentation of internal control. DSCA does not have an  internal control mechanism for determining whether the required impact  statements have been completed before moving forward with drawdown  planning and execution.", "Some military department organizations involved in drawdown execution  have standard operating procedures they follow that are designed to  facilitate drawdown execution, but none include impact assessments for  the planning stage. Some of the officials who facilitate drawdown  execution told us that since they do not work on drawdown execution on a  regular basis, it helps to have standard operating procedures that they  can refer to when a drawdown occurs. The standard operating  procedures that we reviewed included the steps for ensuring that all  articles and services were delivered to the drawdown recipient and how to  report delivery status and costs to DSCA. According to officials, some  mechanisms are built in to executing organizations\u2019 existing processes  and procedures that help mitigate a potential readiness impact or inability  to implement a drawdown.
