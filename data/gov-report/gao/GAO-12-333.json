CMS attempts to recover Medicare payments made that were the responsibility of NGHPs, but CMS has not always been aware of these MSP situations. In 2007, legislation added mandatory reporting requirements for NGHPs that should enable CMS to be aware of these situations. NGHPs reported concerns about the MSP process, and CMS delayed the start of mandatory reporting by NGHPs, in part because of these concerns. This report examines (1) how the initial implementation of mandatory reporting for NGHPs has affected the workload of and payments to MSP contractors, and Medicare savings, and (2) key challenges within the process for MSP situations involving NGHPs and the steps CMS is taking to address those challenges.

While Medicare  typically has primary payment responsibility for a Medicare beneficiary\u2019s  medical expenses that are covered and otherwise reimbursable by  Medicare, in some situations another insurer or insurers have the primary  payment responsibility. In these situations, referred to as Medicare  Secondary Payer (MSP) situations, Medicare is the secondary payer and  is only responsible for paying for a beneficiary\u2019s Medicare-related health  care costs that are not the responsibility of the primary insurer or insurers.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency  within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for  administering the Medicare program, including protecting its fiscal  integrity. To safeguard funds, CMS must take steps to ensure that it pays  only for those services that are the responsibility of the Medicare  program.", "Workers\u2019 compensation is a law or plan of the United States, or any state, that  compensates employees who get sick because of their jobs or are injured on the job. insurance, no-fault insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation plans.

Since 1982, Medicare has been a secondary payer to group  health plans (GHP) in certain situations.", "When MSP situations have occurred, CMS has not always been notified  that beneficiaries had other insurance that should be the primary payer.  As a result, Medicare has paid for services that were the financial  responsibility of another payer. Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid,  and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 added reporting requirements\u2014 referred to throughout this report as mandatory reporting\u2014for NGHPs  and GHPs with respect to MSP situations that should enable CMS to be  aware of MSP situations. Specifically, with mandatory reporting, CMS  should be able to identify which payments made by Medicare should be  recovered because another payer had primary payment responsibility and  situations in which CMS should avoid making payments when another  payer should be primary. Section 111 also included penalties for  noncompliance with mandatory reporting ($1,000 fine per day of  noncompliance per claimant). The Congressional Budget Office estimated  that these provisions for NGHPs and GHPs would save Medicare   $1.1 billion over 10 years in payments that could be recovered or avoided  by Medicare.", "Section 111 added mandatory reporting but did not eliminate or change  any existing MSP laws or regulations. Prior to mandatory reporting,  NGHPs and GHPs involved in MSP situations already had an obligation  to notify and repay Medicare when they determined that Medicare should  not have paid first. Likewise, Medicare beneficiaries had an obligation to  take whatever actions were necessary to obtain any payment that could  be reasonably expected from an NGHP or GHP and to cooperate with  CMS in any action CMS took to recover payments Medicare had made.  These obligations remain, although prior to mandatory reporting the  parties involved in MSP situations may not have always complied with  them. For example, prior to mandatory reporting, absent CMS being  notified about an MSP situation and any specific correspondence from  CMS to the beneficiary about MSP obligations, a beneficiary might not  have been aware of any responsibility to repay Medicare for the related  medical expenses.", "MSP mandatory reporting has not been fully implemented. GHPs were  required to begin reporting in January 2009.

One way to accomplish this is through a Medicare  set-aside arrangement (MSA)\u2014a voluntary arrangement where a portion  of the proceeds from a settlement are set aside to pay for all related  future medical expenses that would otherwise be reimbursable by  Medicare if Medicare were the primary payer.payments for medical expenses related to the MSP situation until the  MSA funds are exhausted.

CMS is also  working to develop a web-based MSPRC portal, which will enable  beneficiaires and beneficiaries\u2019 representatives to, among other things,  obtain information about their Medicare claim payments. Table 5 presents  the steps CMS is taking to address MSPRC performance challenges and  the anticipated results of taking these steps. Most of these steps were  either implemented only recently or have not yet been implemented,  therefore it is too soon to tell to what extent these functions currently  performed by the MSPRC will improve as a result of these actions.", "The average processing time for the WCRC to review WCMSA proposals  has increased significantly over the past year and a half, resulting in  delays in the resolution of MSP cases, and several actions have been  taken or are under way by CMS that are intended to reduce processing  time. According to WCRC data, the average processing time for all cases  increased from 22 days in April 2010 to 95 days in September 2011 (see  fig. 5). While the current WCRC contract does not include a  performance standard related to the length of time for the WCRC to  review submitted WCMSA proposals, WCRC officials told us they would  like WCMSA reviews to be completed within 45 days. CMS and WCRC  officials report that a number of factors contributed to the WCRC\u2019s review  process taking longer, including increased workload. For example, while  in fiscal year 2011 the WCRC contract estimated that the WCRC would  review 1,700 WCMSA proposals each month, the WCRC received an  average of about 2,400 WCMSA proposals per month and was able to  review an average of about 2,100 per month. As a result, a backlog grew.  According to WCRC data, over the past several years, an increasing  number of submitted WCMSA proposals were determined by the WCRC  to be ineligible for review, meaning that more of the WCRC\u2019s time has  been spent responding to ineligible proposals. Also, CMS reported that a  change made to the data system used by the WCRC to process  WCMSAs resulted in a decrease in system performance, which  significantly increased review time from September 2010 through January  2011, adding to the backlog of WCMSA proposals to be reviewed.", "Several actions have been taken or are under way by CMS to reduce the  average processing time for WCMSA proposal review. For example, in  fiscal year 2011 CMS provided the WCRC with additional funding that  enabled the WCRC to authorize overtime for its employees to attempt to  decrease the existing backlog of submitted WCMSA proposals. CMS is  also currently in the process of awarding a new WCRC contract.  According to CMS officials, the new contract provides for an increased  estimated number of monthly WCMSA proposal reviews\u2014increasing the  number from 1,700 a month to from 2,000 to 2,500 a month. Additionally,  CMS implemented a web-based portal\u2014the WCMSA Portal  (WCMSAP)\u2014which is intended to improve the efficiency of the WCMSA  submission process. The WCMSAP allows registered users, such as  beneficiaries, attorneys, and insurance companies, to directly enter  WCMSA case information electronically, upload documentation, and  receive up-to-date case status information electronically. CMS conducted  a pilot test with 10 WCMSA submitters that according to COBC officials,  collectively represented 80 percent of all WCMSA submissions. We  contacted the 10 WCMSA submitters that participated in the WCMSAP  pilot, and they told us that the WCMSAP could improve the overall   The WCMSAP became  WCMSA submission and review process.available for use by all WCMSA submitters on November 29, 2011.  Finally, CMS hired a contractor to conduct an assessment of its WCMSA  process, which could result in recommendations to address related  policies and procedures, such as the average processing time. CMS  officials told us that they expected to receive a draft of the contractor\u2019s  report in March 2012, with a final report in June 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Is Taking Steps to Address Some of the Key Demand and Recovery Challenges We Identified", "paragraphs": ["We identified three key challenges related to demand and recovery of  MSP amounts.

CMS is taking several steps to address this challenge.  NGHP stakeholders reported that it would be helpful if CMS could  calculate a final demand amount that can be provided to concerned  parties prior to settlement, rather than after settlement. CMS officials  stated, however, that they do not know what the final demand amount will  be because Medicare continues to make conditional payments up to the  settlement date.negotiations, beneficiaries can view all their claims paid to date by  Medicare on the MyMedicare.gov website.", "CMS officials also noted that during settlement  CMS is taking steps that may improve NGHP stakeholders\u2019 ability to  obtain or estimate Medicare\u2019s demand amount prior to settlement. For  example, as of September 30, 2011, beneficiaries can obtain the latest  issued Medicare conditional payment amounts through an automated,  self-service feature of the MSPRC phone line. In November 2011, CMS  implemented an option for beneficiaries to pay Medicare a fixed 25  percent of their settlement amount for certain liability situations involving a    physical-trauma-based injury with settlement amounts of $5,000 or less. In December 2011, CMS announced an option for beneficiaries,  beginning in February 2012, to self-calculate conditional payment  amounts for liability insurance MSP situations with settlement amounts of  $25,000 or less that involve physical-trauma-based injuries.MSPRC will review the proposed self-calculated conditional payment  amount and, if it finds the amount accurate, will respond with Medicare\u2019s  final conditional payment amount within 60 days.", "CMS has sometimes spent more in administrative costs attempting to  recover certain conditional payment amounts than the demands are  actually worth, but has recently implemented two initial recovery  thresholds and may consider additional thresholds once it has had an  opportunity to review 2012 data. NGHP stakeholders provided an  example of a demand letter issued by the MSPRC for an amount of  $1.59; one NGHP stakeholder noted seeing numerous examples of  demand letters for amounts less than $5.00. MSPRC officials confirmed  that they have traditionally pursued any recoveries the MSPRC was made  aware of, regardless of the administrative costs to recover them. In 2004  we noted the importance of improving the cost-effectiveness of the MSP  recovery process, and CMS concurred with our recommendations. The  cost-effectiveness of recovery has improved greatly. In 2004, we reported  that CMS recovered only 38 cents for every dollar spent on recovery  activities in fiscal year 2003, but in June 2011 CMS reported that MSP  activities have provided an average rate of return on recoveries of   $9.32 for each dollar spent since fiscal year 2008. NGHP stakeholders  suggested that CMS should take an additional step to improve cost- effectiveness by setting a recovery threshold based on the settlement  amount that would likely yield a recovery amount at or above CMS\u2019s cost  to recover that money.", "Among other things, the Federal Claims Collection Act permits the Secretary of Health  and Human Services to end collection actions on certain claims when the cost of  collecting such claims is likely to be more than the amount recovered. 31 U.S.C.   \u00a7 3711(a)(3).

The concept of proportionality in liability settlement amounts is  relevant in situations when individuals and liability insurers agree to settle  for less than the full amount of incurred expenses associated with the  alleged incident, and therefore the amount of medical expenses to be  reimbursed to an individual\u2019s health plan is proportionally reduced. NGHP  stakeholders said that CMS does not recognize this concept for MSP  situations and instead wants 100 percent reimbursement of claims it paid.  They assert that CMS should recognize proportionality in these situations  and likewise proportionally reduce Medicare\u2019s demand amount in these  cases. NGHP stakeholders stated that if CMS does not proportionally  reduce Medicare\u2019s demand amount in these situations, it could leave  beneficiaries without any compensation for issues such as pain and  suffering or lost wages. However, CMS officials said that the concept of  proportionality is in conflict with MSP provisions granting CMS a priority  right of recovery, which entitles Medicare to full recovery for the expenses  it paid up to the settlement amount. Nonetheless, CMS officials said that  Medicare beneficiaries may contact the appropriate CMS regional office  prior to settling a case to request a pre-demand compromise in the event  that the demand amount would consume the entire settlement. CMS  officials told us that they do not, however, advertise the availability of this  option and do not keep data on how often compromises are requested or  granted. Limited MSPRC data on those compromise requests of which  the MSPRC is made aware suggest that about two out of every three  compromise requests are approved by the reviewing CMS regional office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Is Taking Steps to Address Some Key Challenges We Identified with Aspects of Mandatory Reporting", "paragraphs": ["We identified three key challenges related to aspects of mandatory  reporting for NGHPs: determining whether individuals are Medicare  beneficiaries, supplying diagnostic codes related to individuals\u2019 injuries,  and reporting all settlement amounts.

NGHP stakeholders have reported difficulty obtaining the  information needed from individuals involved in NGHP situations in order  to determine whether an individual is a Medicare beneficiary, and whether  the NGHP is therefore required to report the situation. In order to verify an  individual\u2019s Medicare eligibility, an NGHP either needs the person\u2019s  Medicare Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) or the person\u2019s Social  Security number, first initial of the first name and last six characters of the  last name, date of birth, and gender. NGHP stakeholders report that  individuals are reluctant to surrender sensitive information, such as Social  Security numbers, to NGHPs\u2014particularly as there may be an adversarial  relationship between the individual and the NGHP (i.e., that individual is  suing the insurer or self-insured company). Without this information, the  NGHP cannot verify whether the individual is a Medicare beneficiary and  cannot submit the mandatory reporting record. Therefore, NGHP  stakeholders also reported concerns that they could be subject to  mandatory reporting noncompliance fines if not being able to obtain this  information led to being unable to submit a mandatory reporting record.", "To assist NGHPs with this challenge, CMS has provided them with model  language that they can use to document their unsuccessful attempts to  obtain individuals\u2019 HICNs or Social Security numbers. This model  language is a sample statement to be signed by the individual indicating  whether the individual is a Medicare beneficiary for use in cases when the  NGHPs cannot otherwise determine the individual\u2019s Medicare status.  CMS has stated that if an individual refuses to furnish a HICN or Social  Security number, and the NGHP reporting entity chooses to use this  model language, CMS will generally consider the reporting entity  compliant for purposes of mandatory reporting.officials stated that CMS and a number of other federal agencies are  currently conducting internal studies to evaluate possible alternatives that  could be used in lieu of Social Security numbers.", "ICD-9 codes are used by the Medicare claims contractors to determine whether specific  Medicare claims should be denied or paid.

Therefore, CMS would already  have had access to the related codes.", "Some NGHP stakeholders assert that they should not have to report all  liability settlements, as CMS may be able to recover very little from  certain settlements, and CMS is evaluating data to determine if  appropriate reporting thresholds could be established. An official of an  organization representing NGHPs has stated that liability settlements of  less than $25,000 include a small portion of annual settlement payments  but constitute a large number of individual claims. Therefore, the official  suggested that liability NGHPs should not have to report these  settlements to CMS as it would just increase the reporting burden on  NGHPs while yielding small recovery amounts. However, recovery data  show that for fiscal year 2011, the MSPRC issued almost 57,000  demands for liability settlements under $25,000. These demands related  to these settlements totaled almost $71 million, with an average demand  amount of about $1,250.", "Nonetheless, CMS is evaluating its data and the agency is considering  implementing reporting thresholds, if appropriate. However, CMS officials  expressed concern that setting reporting thresholds could have  unintended consequences. If thresholds were set at, for example,  $25,000, then the NGHP industry might begin settling many cases at  amounts just under $25,000 in order to avoid mandatory reporting. CMS  officials reported that any determination of reporting thresholds should  wait until liability reporting data are available so the data can be analyzed  and an appropriate threshold set.

Instead, information relevant to the MSP process for situations involving  NGHPs is categorized on the main Medicare home page in two separate  sections\u2014some MSP process information falls under \u201cCoordination of  Benefits\u201d and other process information falls under \u201cMedicare Secondary  Payer Recovery.\u201d This makes it difficult to find any recent developments  or changes to the MSP process as a whole, as an individual has to check  multiple web pages to locate recent news. Additionally, while CMS has  created an MSP manual, there is no direct link to the manual under the  Coordination of Benefits or Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery  headings on the Medicare home page.

Further, while guidance in the  form of memorandums related to WCMSAs exists, no manual or similar  document currently exists to organize this guidance. The WCMSA-related  memorandums are accessible on the CMS website, but are poorly  organized, making it difficult to find memorandums on particular topics. As  a result, NGHP stakeholders have reported that it is difficult to find  updated WCMSA policies. However, CMS officials told us in January  2012 that the agency was developing a WCMSA user manual that would  be available through the CMS website. Stakeholders also said that the  WCMSA review and approval criteria are not clear, and expressed a  desire for CMS to make this information more transparent. Furthermore,  CMS has established an e-mail address to accept questions regarding  WCMSA submission policy, but the actual e-mail address is not well  publicized and is difficult to find.", "Additionally, while guidance exists for WCMSAs, CMS has issued very  little guidance related to liability MSAs and NGHP stakeholders reported  inconsistent handling of liability MSAs. CMS issued its first formal  memorandum related to MSA for liability situations on September 29,  2011, detailing when it would consider Medicare\u2019s interests satisfied with  respect to future medical expenses in liability settlements. But this is the  only formal memorandum related to liability MSAs that CMS has  provided. And unlike for WCMSAs, CMS does not have a formal review  and approval process for liability or no-fault MSA arrangements. Upon  request, some CMS regional offices will review liability or no-fault MSAs,  but this is at the regional office\u2019s discretion. NGHP stakeholders report  variation in regional office response, including which regional offices will  review liability MSAs, policies (such as setting thresholds for review), and  regional office responsiveness. Regarding developing policies and  procedures for liability MSAs, CMS officials report that the agency is  working to operationalize policy regarding the reporting of future medical  expenses in liability insurance situations, including an option to allow for  an immediate payment to Medicare for future medical costs. This would  provide an additional option for taking Medicare\u2019s interests into account  rather than the option of establishing an MSA.

Specifically, two letters sent to beneficiaries are not sufficient or clear with  regard to the beneficiary\u2019s rights to dispute unrelated claims. The rights  and responsibilities letter, which is sent to beneficiaries by the MSPRC  after it is notified of an MSP situation, does not make beneficiaries\u2019 rights  and responsibilities clear regarding their ability to dispute the conditional  payments that the MSPRC identifies. While the letter notes that the  beneficiary should expect to receive a letter detailing the conditional  payments Medicare has made to date, it does not explain that this letter  may contain some unrelated claims and the beneficiary should review the  document carefully. Furthermore, it does not explain that the beneficiary  has the right to dispute any claims unrelated to the MSP situation. While  CMS revised the rights and responsibilities letter in 2011, the revisions  did not address these issues.", "Beneficiaries also receive a conditional payment letter, which CMS  regards as a first step in determining conditional payments, but that is not  made clear to the beneficiaries. Beneficiary advocates report that these  letters often include charges for unrelated medical services. As a  consequence, according to an attorney who represents Medicare  beneficiaries, beneficiaries are often asked to return too great a portion of  their settlements to Medicare. CMS officials stated that they consider the  conditional payment letter the first attempt at determining the conditional  payments based on the information the MSPRC has, and that they want  the beneficiary and beneficiary\u2019s attorney to help clarify which claims are  related. They told us that the beneficiary is in the best position to clarify  which claims are related, and that the MSPRC will work with the  beneficiary and the beneficiary\u2019s attorney prior to issuing the demand  letter. However, while the conditional payment letter states that the  beneficiary should inform the MSPRC if any of the identified conditional  payments are inaccurate or incomplete, the language used in the  conditional payment letter does not convey that the MSPRC will work with  the beneficiary and the beneficiary\u2019s attorney prior to issuing the demand  letter. Additionally, the letter does not include that CMS may be willing to  compromise its demand amount if it appears the conditional payments will  consume the beneficiary\u2019s entire settlement.

CMS could also improve program effectiveness by aligning  mandatory reporting thresholds with recovery thresholds, once they are  set.", "Additionally, CMS has opportunities to improve the MSP program by  reducing specific reporting requirements for NGHPs and improving  communication with stakeholders. While CMS\u2019s main goal with mandatory  reporting should be to obtain necessary information to pursue MSP  recoveries, CMS could take steps to lessen the burden on NGHPs,  without substantially increasing the burden on CMS or its contractors.
