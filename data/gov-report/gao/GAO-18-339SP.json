However, DHS is in the early stages of implementing these policies.", "GAO identified two areas where DHS could strengthen its portfolio management policies and implementation efforts:", "DHS's policies do not reflect the key practice to reassess a program that breaches\u2014or exceeds\u2014its cost, schedule, or performance goals in the context of the portfolio to ensure it is still relevant or affordable. Acquisition management officials said that, in practice, they do so based on a certification of funds memorandum\u2014a tool GAO has found to be effective for DHS leadership to assess program affordability\u2014submitted by the component when one of its programs re-baselines in response to a breach. Documenting this practice in policy would help ensure DHS makes strategic investment decisions within its limited budget.", "DHS is not leveraging information gathered from reviews once programs complete implementation to manage its portfolio of active acquisition programs. DHS's acquisition policy requires programs to conduct post-implementation reviews after initial capabilities are deployed, which is in line with GAO's key practices. Acquisition management officials said they do not consider the results of these reviews in managing DHS's portfolio because the reviews are typically conducted after oversight for a program shifts to the components. Leveraging these results across DHS could enable DHS to address potential issues that may contribute to poor outcomes, such as schedule slips and cost growth, for other programs in its acquisition portfolio."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DHS update its acquisition policy to require certification of fund memorandums when programs re-baseline as a result of a breach and assess programs' post-implementation reviews to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio.

In fiscal year 2017 alone, DHS planned to  spend approximately $6.5 billion on these acquisition programs, and  ultimately the department will likely invest more than $207.2 billion in  them. DHS and its underlying components are acquiring systems to help  secure the border, increase marine safety, screen travelers, enhance  cybersecurity, improve disaster response, and execute a wide variety of  other operations. Each of DHS\u2019s major acquisition programs generally  costs $300 million or more and spans multiple years.", "To help manage these programs, DHS has established an acquisition  management policy that we have found to be generally sound in that it  reflects key program management practices we\u2019ve identified in prior  work. However, we have found shortfalls in executing the policy and  have highlighted DHS acquisition management issues in our high-risk  updates since 2005. Over the past decade, we have found that  department leadership has dedicated additional resources and  implemented new policies designed to improve acquisition oversight. But  our work has also identified shortcomings in the department\u2019s ability to  manage its portfolio of major acquisitions. For example, in April 2017, we  found that 14 of the 26 programs we reviewed deployed capabilities  before meeting all key performance parameters\u2014the requirements a  system must meet to fulfill its fundamental purpose\u2014which increases the  risk that end users, such as border patrol agents or first responders in a  disaster, received technologies that might not work as intended. We also  found that DHS\u2019s acquisition management policy requires programs to  establish cost, schedule, and performance baselines prior to gaining full  knowledge about the program\u2019s technical requirements, which serve as  the engineering basis for development. The order of these events is  contrary to acquisition best practices and may lead to poor outcomes,  such as schedule slips, cost increases, or inconsistent performance.", "We have made many recommendations over the past decade to help  address these challenges. For example, we previously recommended that  DHS leadership ensure all major programs fully comply with the  acquisition management policy by obtaining department-level approval for  acquisition documents before the programs are allowed to proceed and  specifically assess whether adequate funding is available during all  program reviews. In response, DHS has taken several steps to improve  acquisition management, such as strengthening implementation of its  acquisition management policy and requiring components to certify that  programs are affordable before they are approved to move through the  acquisition life cycle. Nonetheless, DHS has not fully addressed some of  our other recommendations. For example, we previously recommended  that DHS leadership prioritize major acquisition programs department- wide and ensure that the department\u2019s acquisition portfolio is consistent  with DHS\u2019s anticipated resource constraints, as well as present any  anticipated annual funding gaps for acquisition programs in the annual  funding plan submitted to Congress. DHS concurred with these  recommendations and has taken some steps to address them, such as  updating its policies and revising the format of its funding plan submission  to Congress to present anticipated acquisition funding gaps.", "The Explanatory Statement accompanying a bill to the DHS  Appropriations Act, 2015 contained a provision for GAO to develop a plan  for ongoing reviews of major DHS acquisition programs, as directed in the  Senate report. This is our fourth annual review of major DHS acquisition  programs. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS\u2019s major  acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals  and (2) DHS has taken actions to enhance its policies and processes to  better reflect key portfolio management practices.", "To answer these questions, we reviewed 28 of DHS\u2019s 79 major  acquisition programs.

We also included 12 other major acquisition  programs that we or DHS management identified were at risk of not  meeting their schedules, cost estimates, or capability requirements. Eight  of these 12 programs were Level 1 acquisitions that either had not yet  begun obtaining capabilities or had entered the deployment phase of the  acquisition life cycle, while the other four programs were Level 2  acquisitions with LCCEs between $300 million and less than $1 billion.  Appendix I presents individual assessments of each of the 28 programs  we reviewed. These assessments include key information, such as the  status of programs\u2019 schedules, costs, projected funding levels, testing,  and staffing. Our objective for the 2-page assessments is to provide  decision makers a means to quickly gauge the programs\u2019 progress and  their potential cost, schedule, performance, or funding risks.", "To determine the extent to which the programs we reviewed are on track  to meet their schedule and cost goals, we analyzed available acquisition  documentation, such as acquisition program baselines (APB), which  contain information on programs\u2019 schedules and cost estimates. Since the  November 2008 update to DHS\u2019s overarching acquisition management  directive, these documents have required DHS-level approval; therefore,  we used November 2008 as the starting point for our analysis. We used  these documents to construct a data collection instrument for each  program, identifying any schedule slips and cost growth.

These requirements are intended to provide more timely  information that may improve DHS\u2019s efforts to address acquisition  program affordability issues, as well as internal and external oversight of  programs\u2019 progress against its cost goals. These actions are in  accordance with GAO\u2019s cost estimating best practices, which state that  cost estimates should be updated with actual costs so that they are always relevant and current. As a result, we have used these sources to  provide the programs\u2019 current estimate in the individual assessments in  appendix I, as appropriate, and plan to use these data sources to  measure programs\u2019 cost changes going forward.", "According to officials from the Cost Analysis Division, a program\u2019s annual  LCCE update should inform the affordability submission to support the  annual resource allocation process and can be completed at any point  during the fiscal year leading up to this process.

For the 24 programs we assessed with  department-approved APBs, we found the following:", "All 24 programs submitted the detailed data on program affordability  to headquarters by June 2017 to inform the fiscal year 2019 resource  allocation cycle. Most programs\u2019 submissions accounted for changes  since the program\u2019s last LCCE was approved by DHS\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer, except three. For example, the Long Range  Surveillance Aircraft program\u2019s submission reflected no updates from  its November 2011 LCCE because the program was in the process of  re-baselining to account for significant changes. The program began  re-baselining nearly 3 years ago and has been delayed for various  reasons, including challenges with the vendor hired to complete a  revision of the program\u2019s LCCE.", "Eighteen of the 24 programs submitted annual LCCE updates.

The other 3 programs\u2014all within the Coast  Guard\u2014did not submit an annual LCCE because, according to Coast  Guard officials, they have limited internal cost estimating capability  and rely on outside sources for this service, which led to delays in  completing the annual LCCEs for these programs. Coast Guard  officials said they are reviewing options to resolve these delays and  improve the Coast Guard\u2019s cost estimating capability.", "Cost Analysis Division officials anticipate the Coast Guard will increase  compliance with the annual LCCE requirement in fiscal year 2018. They  also plan to update the annual LCCE template to include additional  information, such as comparisons of the updated estimates to the  program\u2019s APB cost goals and projected funding.", "In addition, DHS revised the format of its FYHSP report to Congress,  improving insight into major programs\u2019 acquisition funding, but decreasing  insight into O&M funding. In April 2014, we found that DHS could better  communicate its funding needs for acquisition programs to Congress and  recommended that DHS enhance the content for future FYHSP reports by  presenting programs\u2019 annual cost estimates and any anticipated funding  gaps, among other things. DHS concurred with the recommendation  and, for the first time, included acquisition affordability tables that  presented programs\u2019 annual acquisition cost estimates compared to  projected acquisition funding for select major acquisition programs in its  FYHSP report for fiscal years 2018\u20132022.", "However, DHS no longer reported O&M funding for individual programs.  DHS reported in the FYHSP that it focused on acquisition information  because O&M funding estimates are generally stable year-to-year and  components manage O&M in various ways, such as by individual  program or across a portfolio of programs. By removing O&M funding  information in the FYHSP for all programs, DHS presents an incomplete  picture of programs\u2019 full funding needs and affordability. In April 2018, we  assessed the extent to which DHS had accounted for O&M costs and  funding in greater detail and recommended that DHS reverse the  exclusion of O&M funding at the acquisition program level in its FYHSP  report to Congress for all components. DHS officials stated that they  plan to re-introduce O&M funding for major acquisition programs in the  FYHSP report for fiscal years 2019\u20132023 based on multiple internal  discussions about the best way to present a more comprehensive view of  programs\u2019 total costs and feedback from key stakeholders, such as the  Office of Management and Budget.", "Based on the information presented in the FYHSP report for fiscal years  2018\u20132022, DHS\u2019s acquisition portfolio is not affordable over the next 5  years. For example, the report contained acquisition affordability tables  for 18 of the 24 programs we assessed that have approved APBs. Of  these 18 programs, 9 were projected to have an acquisition affordability  gap in fiscal year 2018. However, some of these projections are  outdated since the FYHSP report\u2014which was issued in September  2017\u2014relied on cost information as of April 2016. Therefore, we updated  these tables using the programs\u2019 current acquisition cost estimate  presented in the individual assessments in appendix I.", "Based on our assessment of programs\u2019 current cost estimates, we also  found that a total of 9 programs are projected to have an acquisition  affordability gap in fiscal year 2018. However, 3 of these 9 programs were  different programs than those identified based on the FYHSP report. Of  the 9 programs we identified with a projected acquisition affordability gap  in fiscal year 2018, we found the following:", "Five programs identified other funding, such as funding from previous  fiscal years that remained available for obligation\u2014known as  carryover funding\u2014which would address their projected acquisition  funding gap. For example, in the FYHSP report, DHS projected  allocating approximately $16 million in funding for the Technology  Infrastructure Modernization program in fiscal year 2018 to cover an  estimated $16 million in acquisition costs. However, in its November  2017 annual LCCE update, this program\u2019s acquisition cost increased  to almost $30 million, resulting in a projected acquisition affordability  gap of almost 45 percent. The program plans to realign $57 million in  O&M carryover funding to cover this and any future acquisition  shortfalls.", "Four programs did not identify other funding that would address their  projected acquisition funding gap, which increases the likelihood that  they will cost more and take longer to deliver capabilities to end users  than expected. For example, in the FYHSP report, DHS projected  allocating $109 million in funding for the Non-Intrusive Inspection  Systems program in fiscal year 2018 to cover an estimated $103  million in acquisition costs. However, in its April 2017 annual LCCE  update, this program\u2019s acquisition costs increased to nearly $186  million, resulting in a projected acquisition affordability gap of 41  percent. The program identified only $2.5 million in fiscal year 2017  acquisition carryover funding.", "Further, 5 of the 24 programs we assessed were not included in the fiscal  years 2018\u20132022 FYHSP report because they were no longer expected  to receive acquisition funding. Officials from 3 of these 5 programs  projected funding gaps that could cause future program execution  challenges, such as schedule slips or cost growth. For example, the  National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility anticipates a projected funding  shortfall of approximately $90 million over the next 5 years, which officials  said could delay a number of activities to make the facility operational.

In March 2007, we examined the  practices that private sector entities use to achieve a balanced mix of new  projects and found that successful commercial companies use a  disciplined and integrated approach to prioritize needs and allocate  resources when making investments. This approach, known as portfolio  management, requires companies to view each of their investments as  contributing to a collective whole, rather than as independent and  unrelated. With this perspective, companies can effectively (1) identify  and prioritize opportunities, and (2) allocate available resources to  support the highest priority\u2014or most promising\u2014opportunities. Based on  this and other work, we identified four key practice areas for portfolio  management in September 2012.", "We previously assessed DHS\u2019s acquisition management and resource  allocation policies against our key portfolio management practices in  September 2012 and April 2014, respectively.

The  memorandum identified several initial focus areas intended to build  organizational capacity, one of which centered on improving and  integrating the department\u2019s processes for acquisition oversight, resource  allocation, and joint requirements analysis. To improve these processes,  the memorandum directed senior DHS leaders to update the existing  acquisition management and resource allocation processes, as well as  lead an expedited review to provide alternatives for developing and  facilitating a component-driven joint requirements process, which  ultimately led to the re-establishment of the JRC.", "In response to our recommendations and the Unity of Effort  memorandum, DHS issued new policies outlining the acquisition  management, resource allocation, and requirements processes in 2016.  We assessed these policies and found that, when considered collectively,  they generally reflect the key portfolio management practices, as shown  in table 5.", "Because DHS\u2019s new policies were issued in 2016, we did not specifically  assess DHS\u2019s implementation of them. However, we did review  documentation resulting from the acquisition management, resource  allocation, and requirements processes since January 2016 to get a  sense of how the department began implementation. Examples of how  DHS\u2019s policies reflect the key portfolio management practices and their  implementation status are outlined below.", "Clearly define and empower leadership: the policies identify the  roles and responsibilities for decision makers in the acquisition  management, resource allocation, and requirements processes, as  well as establish cross-functional teams to support those decision  makers. For example, to fulfill the role of acquisition decision  authority, the Under Secretary for Management is supported by the  Acquisition Review Board, which consists of key DHS senior leaders  responsible for managing the department\u2019s finances, contracts, and  testing, among other things.", "We reviewed the memorandums issued since January 2016 that  document Acquisition Review Board decisions and found that, through  this group, DHS has taken steps to manage across programs through  its acquisition management process. For example, after reviewing the  status of several individual Customs and Border Protection programs  in 2016, the Acquisition Review Board identified the need for a  comprehensive border plan that depicts the component\u2019s current land,  maritime, and air domain awareness capabilities. In October 2016, the  Deputy Under Secretary for Management\u2014who was serving as  acquisition decision authority at the time\u2014directed Customs and  Border Protection to develop such a plan. The plan is to consist of  separate analyses for each of the three domains\u2014starting with land\u2014 that reflect end users\u2019 capability requirements for systems, such as  Integrated Fixed Towers, Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft, and  Medium Lift Helicopter, that address relevant domain threats. As of  February 2018, Customs and Border Protection had not yet  completed the analysis for land domain awareness capabilities.", "Establish standard assessment criteria and demonstrate  comprehensive knowledge of the portfolio: the policies establish  standard criteria for assessing major acquisition programs through the  acquisition management, resource allocation, and requirements  processes. For example, the updated resource allocation handbook  established that PA&E conduct annual assessments of all major  investments using standard criteria in five main categories\u2014 contribution to DHS\u2019s mission, program health, risk, resources, and  governance\u2014to assess the portfolio of investments and present  alternatives for leadership decision. PA&E officials told us they used  these criteria when assessing components\u2019 resource allocation  requests during development of the President\u2019s fiscal year 2018  budget to develop funding options for the Deputy\u2019s Management  Action Group, which is responsible for making resource allocation  recommendations for the Secretary\u2019s approval. PA&E presented its  funding options by DHS mission, which, according to officials  associated with the Deputy\u2019s Management Action Group, allowed the  group to make cross-component allocation decisions that directly  aligned with the department\u2019s strategic goals. We could not verify  these officials\u2019 assertions based on the documentation we were  provided, but will continue to monitor PA&E\u2019s assessment of major  acquisition programs against the standard criteria as the department\u2019s  implementation of its resource allocation policies matures.", "In addition, PARM formally established its Acquisition Program Health  Assessments in October 2016 after more than a year of development  and pilot efforts. These assessments are intended to monitor major  acquisition programs quarterly (both on an individual program level  and in aggregate) by rating programs against standard criteria in  several categories\u2014such as program management, financial  management, and human capital\u2014that DHS deemed important for  successful program execution. We reviewed the quarterly reports  issued from January 2016 to April 2017 and found that they primarily  focused on individual programs. The portfolio-level information  contained in these reports was limited to program results grouped in  various categories, such as by component, by acquisition life-cycle  phase, and by investment type (e.g., information technology). PARM  officials said they plan to use the health assessments as a portfolio  management tool in the future and are working to determine how to  best to analyze and present portfolio-level data. We will continue to  track PARM\u2019s implementation of the health assessment process  moving forward through GAO\u2019s High Risk work to determine DHS\u2019s  progress in demonstrating that major acquisition programs are on  track to achieve their established goals.", "Prioritize investments by integrating the requirements,  acquisition, and budget processes: the policies identify areas  where DHS\u2019s requirements, acquisition management, and resource  allocation processes are integrated and establish processes for  prioritizing investments. For example, the updated resource allocation  policies require reviews of DHS\u2019s major acquisition portfolio during  this annual process. When the portfolio faces a funding gap, programs  are to be returned to their respective components for scope or funding  adjustments, or prioritized by department leadership to identify an  affordable set of programs. For the fiscal year 2018 resource  allocation cycle, PA&E officials provided an example where DHS  leadership directed components to identify funding from alternative  sources to fund specific purposes related to DHS\u2019s mission to prevent  terrorism and enhance security. However, as previously discussed,  the resulting FYHSP report for fiscal years 2018\u20132022 showed that  DHS\u2019s portfolio of major acquisition programs is not affordable over  the next 5 years.", "In addition, the requirements policies established the Joint  Assessment of Requirements, an annual process to prioritize  emerging and existing requirements to inform the department\u2019s  resource allocation decisions.

In fiscal year  2016, the JRC completed the first phase, which included (1)  developing initial criteria to evaluate emerging requirements, and (2)  evaluating and prioritizing a sample of those requirements against the  initial criteria. Based on these results, JRC officials told us in  September 2017 that they are working to develop assessment metrics  for the criteria as part of the next phase.

However, as previously discussed, the JRC is still in the process of  implementing this process.", "We consider this overall key practice area to be partially met because  DHS\u2019s policies do not reflect the key practice (3) to reassess  programs that breach established thresholds within the context of the  portfolio to determine if the program remains relevant and affordable.  PARM officials told us that\u2014in practice\u2014DHS reassesses programs  in the context of their component\u2019s overall acquisition portfolio based  on a certification of funds memorandum submitted to DHS\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer when programs re-baseline as a result of a cost,  schedule, or performance breach. The memorandum is intended to  enable the Acquisition Review Board to discuss affordability by  certifying a program\u2019s funding levels and identifying trade-offs  necessary to address any projected funding gaps. We previously  found that the certification of funds memorandum was an effective tool  for DHS leadership to assess program affordability. However, DHS\u2019s  acquisition management policy requires components to submit this  memorandum prior to most acquisition decision events, but not when  a program re-baselines as a result of a cost, schedule, or  performance breach.", "During our review of programs\u2019 progress against schedule and cost  goals in 2017, we found one instance where a component did not  follow the practice to submit this memorandum when one of its  programs re-baselined as a result of a breach. Specifically, Customs  and Border Protection did not submit a certification of funds  memorandum when the Tactical Communications Modernization  program re-baselined in November 2017 as a result of a schedule and  cost breach. Nevertheless, DHS leadership approved the program\u2019s  revised APB and removed it from breach status, even though DHS\u2019s  Chief Financial Officer identified that the program\u2019s revised LCCE was  not affordable. PARM officials stated that this instance was an  oversight because, at the time, the department was still determining  when certification of funds memorandums should be submitted.", "According to the federal standards for internal control, documentation  of internal control practices is necessary so that they can be  implemented effectively. By amending its acquisition management  policy to require a certification when a program re-baselines as a  result of a cost, schedule, or performance breach, DHS can ensure  that leadership receives the necessary information to reassess that  program\u2019s affordability in the context of a larger portfolio. PARM  officials stated that, moving forward, components will be required to  submit a certification of funds memorandum for each program when a  new APB is submitted for DHS leadership approval.", "In contrast, the acquisition management policy does reflect the key  practice (4) to use information gathered from post-implementation  reviews to fine tune investment processes and the portfolio to achieve  strategic outcomes. For example, DHS\u2019s acquisition management  policy requires programs to conduct post-implementation reviews 6 to  18 months after initial operational capability to identify and document  any deployment or implementation and coordination issues, how they  were resolved, and how they could be prevented in the future. These  reviews are intended to help identify capability gaps that may inform  future acquisitions, among other things.", "However, PARM officials said that they do not consider the results of  the post-implementation reviews when managing the department\u2019s  current acquisition portfolio because these reviews are typically  conducted after program oversight shifts from PARM to the  component. While post-implementation reviews are conducted later in  the acquisition life cycle, the insights they provide could be leveraged  by other programs in the acquisition portfolio, not just the program  under review. For example, the Integrated Fixed Towers program  completed a post-implementation review in June 2016 after its initial  deployment of capabilities to the Arizona border. The review found  that changes in illegal traffic patterns as a result of the program\u2019s  deployment may be predicted, and other technologies may be able to  compensate for changes in these patterns. This information could  help other programs under development plan for similar outcomes or  enable DHS to change deployment plans for existing programs to  address changes in threats.", "PARM has an opportunity to use the results from programs\u2019 post- implementation reviews since it is responsible for overseeing the  department\u2019s acquisition portfolio by monitoring each investment\u2019s  cost, schedule, and performance against established baselines.  Federal standards for internal control state that management should  obtain data on a timely basis so that they can be used for effective  monitoring and that separate evaluations may provide feedback on  the effectiveness of ongoing monitoring. By leveraging the results  from post-implementation reviews in its monitoring efforts, PARM may  be better able to ensure that programs in the current acquisition  portfolio achieve their baselines. PARM officials stated they have  generally focused on leveraging information gathered from canceled  acquisition programs, such as where and why plans went wrong.

DHS is  collecting more timely cost estimate information on its acquisition  programs to make more informed investment decisions. Yet DHS  continues to face challenges in funding its acquisition portfolio, which  highlights the need for disciplined policies that reflect best practices to  ensure that the department does not pursue more programs than it can  afford. DHS leadership has taken positive steps in recent years by  strengthening its policies for acquisition management and resource  allocation, and establishing policies related to requirements. Collectively,  these policies reflect an integrated approach to managing investments.  However, opportunities remain to further strengthen the acquisition  management policy by documenting DHS\u2019s current practice to reassess  programs that breach their established cost, schedule, or performance  thresholds to ensure they are still worth pursuing within the context of the  portfolio. Additionally, leveraging information learned once programs  complete deployment across the acquisition portfolio could help ensure  that programs stay on track against their baselines in the first place.

For example, we reviewed JRC- validated requirements documents; acquisition decision memorandums;  Acquisition Program Health Assessment reports; and documentation  related to the development of DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget request and  the fiscal year 2018\u20132022 FYHSP report, including resource allocation  guidance, presentations to DHS leadership, and preliminary decisions.  We also interviewed officials from the JRC, PARM, PA&E, and the  Deputy\u2019s Management Action Group to identify any current and planned  initiatives to improve management of the department\u2019s portfolio of major  acquisition programs. We then compared our assessment of DHS\u2019s  current policies, practices, and planned initiatives to our previous findings  and the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 through May  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact listed above, Rick Cederholm (Assistant  Director), Aryn Ehlow (Analyst-in-Charge), Pete Anderson, Lorraine  Ettaro, Helena Johnson, TyAnn Lee, Alexis Olson, Sylvia Schatz,  Roxanna Sun, and Lindsay Taylor made key contributions to this report.
