Specifically, IT systems are critical to FDA\u0092s product review, adverse event reporting, and compliance activities. Recognizing limitations in its IT capabilities, the agency has undertaken various initiatives to modernize its systems. GAO was asked to (1) assess FDA\u0092s current portfolio of IT systems, including the number of systems in use and under development, and their purpose and costs; (2) assess the status and effectiveness of FDA's efforts to modernize the mission-critical systems that support its regulatory programs; and (3) examine the agency's progress in effectively integrating and sharing data among key systems. To do this, GAO reviewed information on key FDA systems and interviewed agency officials to determine the status of systems and the effectiveness of key IT management practices, as well as data sharing among key systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While FDA has taken several important steps toward modernizing its IT environment, much remains to be done. FDA reported spending about $400 million for IT investments in fiscal year 2011; however, the agency currently lacks a comprehensive IT inventory that identifies and provides key information about the systems it uses and is developing. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and GAO guidance call for federal agencies to maintain such an inventory in order to monitor and manage their IT investments. This inventory should include information on each system, such as costs, functionality or purpose, and status. However, FDA does not have such a comprehensive list of its systems. Instead, the agency points to budget documents required by OMB, which included information on 44 IT investments for fiscal year 2011. The agency also provided a partial list of 21 mission-critical systems and modernization initiatives. Nonetheless, agency officials acknowledged that these documents do not identify all FDA\u0092s systems or the complete costs, purpose, or status of each system. Until the agency has a complete and comprehensive inventory, it will lack critical information needed to effectively assess its IT portfolio.", "Much work remains on FDA\u0092s largest and costliest system modernization effort\u0097the Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services program. This program is estimated to cost about $280 million and is intended to enhance existing applications and develop new systems that provide information for inspections, compliance activities, and laboratory operations. However, much of the planned functionality has not been delivered and its completion is uncertain. Moreover, the program lacks an integrated master schedule identifying all the work activities that need to be performed and their interdependencies. FDA\u0092s Chief Information Officer (CIO) stated that the agency is reevaluating the scope of the initiative. As a result, it is uncertain when or if FDA will meet its goals of replacing key legacy systems and providing modernized functionality to support its mission. In addition, FDA has not yet fully implemented key IT management capabilities essential for successful modernization, as previously recommended by GAO. These include developing an actionable IT strategic plan, developing an enterprise architecture to guide its modernization effort, and assessing its IT human capital needs. This is due in part to the fact that FDA\u0092s IT management structure has been in flux. Since 2008, the agency has had five CIOs, hampering its ability to plan and effectively implement a long-range IT strategy. While the agency recently hired a CIO, without stable leadership and capabilities, the success of FDA\u0092s modernization efforts is in jeopardy.", "The agency currently has initiatives under way to improve its data sharing with internal and external partners, including adoption of an enterprisewide standard for formatting data and several projects aimed at enhancing its ability to share data. Effective data sharing is essential to its review and approval process, inspection of imports and manufacturing facilities, and tracking of contaminated products. However, these projects have made mixed progress, and significant work remains for FDA to fully implement standardized data sharing. Further, FDA\u0092s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has not comprehensively assessed information-sharing needs to ensure that its systems and databases are organized for effective information sharing. This is needed to help ensure more efficient access to and sharing of key information supporting its mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that FDA develop a comprehensive inventory of its IT systems, develop an integrated master schedule for a major modernization effort, and assess information needs to identify opportunities for greater sharing.

Additionally, in 2011, the agency estimated that 15 percent of the U.S.  food supply was imported, including 60 percent of fresh fruits and  vegetables and 80 percent of seafood. Advances in science and the  increase in imports are factors affecting the complexity of information that  FDA receives. The ability of the agency\u2019s IT systems and infrastructure to  accommodate this growth is crucial to FDA\u2019s ability to accomplish its  mission effectively.", "Compounding these challenges, reports and studies, both by FDA and  others, have noted limitations in a number of key aspects of FDA\u2019s IT  environment, including data availability and quality, IT infrastructure, the  agency\u2019s ability to use technology to improve regulatory effectiveness,  and IT management. In 2007, the FDA Science Board issued a report,  FDA Science and Mission at Risk, which provided a broad assessment  of challenges facing the agency. Specifically, this study found that the  agency\u2019s IT infrastructure was outdated and unstable, and it lacked  sufficient controls to ensure continuity of operations or to provide effective  disaster recovery services. The Science Board also stated that the  agency did not have sufficient IT staff with skills in such areas as capital  planning/investment control and enterprise architecture; that processes  for recruitment and retention of IT staff were inadequate; and that the  agency did not invest sufficiently in professional development. Further,  the Science Board found that information was not easily and immediately  accessible throughout the agency (including critical clinical trial data that  were available only in paper form), hampering FDA\u2019s ability to regulate  products. Data and information exchange was impeded because  information resided in different systems that were not integrated.

FDA officials said these errors resulted in the  creation of multiple records for a single establishment, which led to  inflated counts of establishments offering drugs for import into the U.S.  market. While FDA officials acknowledged this problem, they were unable  to provide us with an estimate of the extent of these errors. In addition,  the agency did not have a process for systematically identifying and  correcting these errors.

For example, the agency had two acting CIOs during  2011, with a permanent CIO only being selected recently (in October  2011). According to the former Acting CIO, FDA filled positions with  acting officials in order to address specific goals.

The first phase includes the  data center modernization effort, which the department stated has  provided FDA with an advanced computing infrastructure and a  production data center with a secure computing environment. According  to HHS, this infrastructure modernization and consolidation effort serves  as the foundation for all other transition activities, and positions FDA to  move forward with the second phase: implementing data center operation  management and service contract efficiencies while working on  modernizing and consolidating software systems with similar business  processes and expediting the retirement of legacy systems.", "Our report recognizes the progress that FDA has made in modernizing its  data center infrastructure, and we agree that this effort is a key  component of the agency\u2019s overall modernization initiative. However, as  we also noted, over the last decade\u2014and concurrent with its data center  modernization effort\u2014FDA has spent tens of millions of dollars on  software systems modernization projects that were intended to provide  updated functionality and enable the retirement of legacy systems. In  particular, FDA spent approximately $160 million from fiscal year 2002 to  fiscal year 2011 on MARCS, yet it has repeatedly delayed milestones for  delivering capabilities and retiring legacy systems.

Since  2002, the program\u2019s requirements were changed and broadened to  include replacement of six additional legacy systems. In April 2005, FDA  developed a design that envisioned a set of integrated service  components intended to provide the applications and tools to support the  agency\u2019s import operations, field operations, compliance operations, firm  management, workload management, and selected aspects of laboratory  operations. The agency estimated that development would cost about  $75 million and be completed in 2008.", "However, later in 2005, a decision was made to put the current vision for  the program on hold, and instead implement web-enabled versions of  OASIS and FACTS. According to an Office of Information Management  (OIM) supervisory IT specialist, the migration to web-enabled systems  allowed the agency to implement single sign-on and enabled the legacy  systems to integrate more easily with new functionality. According to the  Program Manager and contract officials, the decision to implement web- enabled versions was also motivated by vendor plans to halt support for  the current OASIS and FACTS platform and uncertainty about funding for  the program.", "In April 2006, FDA rebaselined the program estimate to include  development costs and maintenance costs for the entire program life  cycle. FDA estimated that the total life-cycle cost would be $221.4 million,  and the investment would end in August 2019.
