DTRA also uses its specialized capabilities and services in various ways to support other government efforts to address WMD threats. DTRA has a formal relationship with Energy to maintain the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. DTRA's relationship with DHS is subject to the broader DOD-DHS relationship and may change as the relationship between DOD and DHS evolves. The agency uses a strategic planning process modeled on the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) to prioritize its resources and assess progress toward its organizational goals. DTRA's planning process identifies long-term goals, establishes short-term objectives by which to measure progress in meeting goals, and collects data to assess progress. DTRA's planning process is influenced by funding, most of which is appropriated for specific programs.

The agency reports to the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, with the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy providing input into several of DTRA\u2019s  programs.  Additionally, DTRA responds to the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff pertaining to the agency\u2019s support of military commanders.  Table 1 provides data on DTRA\u2019s budget and personnel since the agency\u2019s  inception.  DTRA\u2019s budget has increased by over $650 million (about 40  percent) since its establishment, of which over $450 million was due to  increases in the funding of the Chemical and Biological Defense Program  (CBDP).

DTRA also maintains liaison officers at several locations, including the  combatant commanders\u2019 headquarters, the National Guard Bureau, and the  Pentagon.", "DTRA was established in 1998 through the consolidation of three agencies  and two programs, as shown in figure 2.  The Defense Special Weapons  Agency tested, analyzed, and provided assistance in developing new  technologies for maintaining and modernizing the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons.  The agency also worked to counter the effects of the use of  chemical and biological weapons against U.S. military bases and forces.   The Defense Technology Security Administration managed the DOD  license review process for the export of munitions and critical technologies  that have both civilian and military applications.  As part of this effort, the  Defense Technology Security Administration oversaw U.S. satellites  launched abroad.  The On-Site Inspection Agency, established as a result of  the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, carried out on-site  inspections to verify that treaty implementation was done in accordance  with all treaty requirements.  Throughout the 1990s, the agency\u2019s  responsibilities were expanded as new treaties were ratified, and, in 2000,  the agency was asked to support the United Nation\u2019s mission to monitor  and eliminate WMD in Iraq.", "The two additional programs included in DTRA\u2019s formation dealt  extensively with the threats posed by WMD and related materials.  The  Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program implemented a  congressionally mandated program to assist the nations of the former  Soviet Union in securing and eliminating their WMD stockpiles.  We have  undertaken several reviews of the DTRA-managed CTR program.  A list of  our reports concerning the CTR program appears at the end of this report.   In addition, CBDP was established in 1994 to consolidate, coordinate, and  integrate the chemical and biological defense requirements of all the  services into a single DOD program.  DTRA was given the responsibility to  administer the distribution of program funds, but the agency did not  directly manage the program.", "To integrate these components, DTRA began a strategic planning process in  January 1999 and published its first strategic plan in March 2000.  DTRA  used the principles of the Government Performance and Result Act of 1993  (GPRA) to guide its planning process.  The act calls for agencies to develop  long-term strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual  assessment reports.  Also in 2000, DTRA realigned itself around four core  functions (1) threat control, (2) threat reduction, (3) combat support  (support to military forces), and (4) technology development.  Among these  core functions, DTRA officials have stressed combat support as its first  priority.", "Three major changes have occurred in the agency\u2019s responsibilities, as  illustrated in figure 2.

For example, DTRA is overseeing the  construction of a facility that will be used to securely store nuclear  materials from weapons at Mayak, Russia.  This project, however, has  suffered from both a lack of committed Russian funding and access to the  site.  As a result, the project, once scheduled to begin accepting nuclear  materials for storage in 1998, will not begin to do so until 2004.   Additionally, DTRA works through the CTR program to enhance the  security and safety of biological pathogens located at research centers in  the former Soviet Union, such as at Novosibirsk and Obolensk.  However,  lack of Russian cooperation has affected DTRA\u2019s ability to access other  suspected biological facilities, and, after 4 years of effort, DOD has made  little progress in addressing security concerns at the 49 biological sites  where Russia and the United States have collaborative programs.", "DTRA works to prevent the spread of WMD through continuing contacts  with former Soviet Union military personnel and providing expertise and  equipment to the countries of the former Soviet Union to enhance border  security.

According to agency documents,  DTRA evaluates 80 to 100 DOD installations per year through Joint Staff  Integrated Vulnerability Assessments, which are broad in scope and focus  on the overall safety and security of personnel.  For example, agency teams  assess physical security plans, review architectural and structural  drawings, and perform analyses of potential blast effects to recommend  procedural, structural, or other enhancements to reduce vulnerabilities.   These assessments were instituted in the aftermath of (1) the Khobar  Towers bombing in 1996 and (2) the publication of a subsequent DOD  report in 1997 that determined there were no published standards for  securing personnel and facilities.  In addition, DTRA conducts Balanced  Survivability Assessments to evaluate specific U.S. and allied infrastructure  crucial in maintaining command and control of all U.S. forces.  These  assessments evaluate the ability of power, heating, computer, and  communications systems to continue functioning in the event of a WMD  attack, accident or natural disaster, technological failure, or sabotage.   According to agency officials, DTRA teams conduct an average of 8  Balanced Survivability Assessments per year, but that number rose  temporarily to 30 to meet additional requirements.", "DTRA provides additional support to military commanders through the  Defense Nuclear Weapons School and Consequence Management Advisory  Teams (CMAT).  DTRA operates the Defense Nuclear Weapons School in  Albuquerque, New Mexico, to train military and civilian personnel in  various aspects of WMD.

DTRA uses a portion of the CBDP funds for  large-scale technology demonstration projects, such as a project that  focused on restoring operations at bases attacked by chemical or biological  agents.  The agency distributes a large portion of the CBDP funds to others  for various purposes, such as procuring chemical suits for the military  forces.

These reviews focus on how well DTRA meets its customers\u2019  requirements as a combat support agency.  Overall, these two reviews have  concluded that DTRA supports the requirements of the operating military  forces and provides useful products and services.", "The most recent biennial review was issued December 2002.  DTRA was  assessed on its combat support, technology development, and threat  reduction and control efforts.  DTRA\u2019s efforts at threat reduction and  control received high satisfaction ratings from the customers surveyed.   The agency received acceptable satisfaction ratings in combat support but  had below average ratings in the area of technology development.", "In 2001, the Combat Support Agency Review Team conducted an  assessment of DTRA\u2019s responsiveness and readiness to support operating  forces in the event of war or threat to national security.  The Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff is required by law to conduct assessments of all  combat support agencies every 2 years.  The review team went to the  commands supported by DTRA and conducted extensive interviewing and  fieldwork regarding the support provided by DTRA.  In the 2001  assessment, DTRA was commended for significant improvements in  customer orientation and combat support focus.  DTRA was found to be  ready to support the requirements of the operating forces.  A major finding  in the assessment concerned DTRA\u2019s ongoing work on decontamination  standards for airbases and strategic air and sealift assets.  The study  acknowledged that DTRA was supporting the development of these  standards, but, as DOD\u2019s center of WMD expertise, it needs to provide  commanders with the best possible information currently available, rather  than wait until all studies have been completed.  A Combat Support Agency  Review Team official stated that DTRA has addressed the findings of the  2001 assessment, and that the 2003 assessment was delayed by operations  in Iraq but should be released in early 2004.", "As part of the GPRA process, DTRA produced its first annual performance  assessment in 2002.  GPRA requires that agencies report on the extent to  which they are meeting their annual performance goals and the actions  needed to achieve or modify the goals that have not been met.  DTRA\u2019s  performance report did not compare the agency\u2019s achievements to its  goals, discuss the areas where DTRA fell short of its goals, or discuss  DTRA\u2019s plans to address goals that it did not achieve.  For example, in the  threat control area, the agency discussed the number of missions  conducted and the equipment provided under the International  Counterproliferation Program without stating the program\u2019s goals.  In the  threat reduction area, the report discussed the number of weapons systems  eliminated in the former Soviet Union and other achievements, such as  implementing security measures over chemical stockpiles at two sites,  again, without discussing the goals of the program.  In the area of combat  support, the report discussed the number of vulnerability and survivability  assessments, training exercises of all types, and number of training courses  provided, but does not discuss how many of each were planned.  Finally, in  the technology development area, the report discussed several  technologies developed or under development but does not discuss the  agency\u2019s plans for the year.  See figure 5 for a comparison of what is  expected in an annual performance report and what DTRA\u2019s report  contained.", "Although this information is not in DTRA\u2019s performance report, we found  that DTRA leadership meets quarterly to assess progress in meeting each  unit\u2019s goals and discuss activities that are not on track.  Further, DTRA  leadership discusses what needs to be done to get on track and whether  goals are unrealistic or not within its control.  For example, according to  agency officials, they have in the past transferred funding from CTR  programs that were having problems into successful CTR programs to  prevent those funds from being lost because congressionally provided  funds must be spent within a certain time frame."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When DTRA was established in 1998, it modeled its strategic planning  process on GPRA to prioritize resources and assess progress toward its  organizational goals.

The performance report does not  compare accomplishments and activities with established goals and  objectives, nor does it explain what actions are needed to achieve or  modify goals that are not met.
