According to Mexican government officials, high caliber rifles are the preferred weapon used by drug trafficking organizations. According to ATF data, most were purchased legally in gun shops and at gun shows in the United States, and then trafficked illegally to Mexico. U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials also noted a new complicating factor in efforts to fight firearms trafficking is that weapons parts are being transported to Mexico to be later assembled into finished firearms, an activity that is much harder to track.", "In 2009, GAO reported duplicative initiatives, and jurisdictional conflicts between ATF and the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That year, in response to GAO's recommendations on these problems, ATF and ICE updated an interagency memorandum of understanding (MOU) to improve collaboration. ATF and ICE have taken several steps since then to improve coordination on efforts to combat firearms trafficking, such as joint training exercises and conferences to ensure that agents are aware of the MOU and its jurisdictional parameters and collaboration requirements. However, GAO found that ATF and ICE do not regularly monitor the implementation of the MOU. In the absence of a mechanism to monitor MOU implementation and ensure that appropriate coordination is taking place between the two agencies, GAO found that gaps in information sharing and misunderstandings related to their roles and responsibilities persist.", "The indicator used to track U.S. agencies' efforts to stem firearms trafficking to Mexico in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's (ONDCP) National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy , by itself, does not adequately measure progress.

As the Congressional Research Service reported,  while these efforts have continued, under current President Enrique Pe\u00f1a  Nieto, who was elected in 2012, there has been a shift in emphasis  toward reducing criminal violence that threatens the security of civilians  and the business sector. According to a RAND Corporation report,  besides trafficking billions of dollars\u2019 worth of narcotics into the United  States annually, Mexican DTOs\u2019 criminal activity now extends to other  areas, including human trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering,  extortion, bribery, racketeering, and weapons trafficking.", "According to the Strategy DTOs require a constant supply of firearms and  ammunition to assert control over the territory where they operate,  eliminate rival criminals, enforce illicit business dealings, and resist  government operations. The Strategy indicates that firearms that criminal  organizations acquire from the United States are primarily transported  overland into Mexico using the same routes and methods employed when  smuggling bulk cash south and drugs north across the U.S.-Mexico  border. The Strategy also notes that within the United States, DTOs or  their agents typically rely on \u201cstraw purchasers.\u201d According to ATF, a  \u201cstraw purchase\u201d occurs when a person who is a convicted felon (or  otherwise prohibited by federal law from purchasing a firearm) or who  wishes to remain anonymous, uses a third party, the straw purchaser, to  execute the paperwork necessary to purchase a firearm from a federally  licensed firearms dealer. The straw purchaser is a person who, but for  making false statements on the license application, would otherwise be  eligible under federal law to purchase a firearm and is therefore able to  pass the mandatory background check conducted by the federal firearms  licensee. Although straw purchasers may legally purchase firearms for  their own possession and use, when they purchase firearms on behalf of  criminals or others, they violate federal law by making a false statement  to a federal firearms licensee on the required forms. Firearm trafficking  organizations also frequently obtain firearms from unlicensed private  sellers in secondary markets, particularly at gun shows and flea markets  or through classified ads or private-party Internet postings, according to  ATF officials.", "The surge in criminal activity by DTOs along the U.S.-Mexico border has  generated concern among policymakers that this violence is spilling over  into the United States.

In carrying out its responsibilities, ATF licenses and  regulates federal firearms licensees to ensure that they comply with  applicable laws and regulations. ATF also traces U.S. and foreign  manufactured firearms for international, federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies to link a firearm recovered in a criminal  investigation to its first retail purchaser.

According to ATF officials, shifts in the number of guns  seized and traced do not necessarily reflect fluctuations in the volume of  firearms trafficked from the United States to Mexico from one year to the  next. ATF staff explained that there are several factors that have  influenced the year-to-year variance in the number of firearms traced  since 2009. For example, they explained that the high number of firearms  traced in 2009 reflects a single submission by the Mexican military to ATF  for tracing of a backlog of thousands of firearms. Conversely, ATF  officials noted there was a lower number of firearms submitted for tracing  in 2010 because that is the year eTrace in Spanish was initially deployed  in Mexico, and Mexican law enforcement officials at the local, state, and  federal level had to be trained on using the system. In 2011, a much  higher number of firearms were traced as Mexican officials became  proficient in using the system. Finally, U.S. and Mexican officials suggest  the decline since 2011 may reflect a period of adjustment in cooperation  under the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration. This included the centralization of  access to eTrace in Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office and retraction of  eTrace accounts from federal, state, and local law enforcement, which  resulted in fewer Mexican law enforcement officials able to trace firearms  using the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long Guns Account for about Half of All Firearms Seized in Mexico and Traced", "paragraphs": ["According to Mexican law enforcement officials we interviewed, DTOs  prefer high caliber weapons with greater firepower, including high caliber  rifles or long guns, and military grade equipment.

Officials also noted that in recent years  they have seen DTOs acquire military equipment, such as .50 caliber  machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenade launchers. However, they  said that unlike firearms typically used by DTOs, which often can be  traced back to the United States, this type of equipment is known to often  be trafficked into Mexico from leftover Central American military  stockpiles from past conflicts.

In general, U.S. federal laws and regulations  requiring manufacturers and importers of firearms to identify firearms with  a serial number do not apply to parts, unless otherwise specified by law.  Federal firearms licensees and other retailers are not required to report  on the acquisition and disposition of firearm parts as they must for  firearms. Furthermore, any individual in the United States may legally  acquire and possess certain firearm parts that are not otherwise  proscribed by law, including persons prohibited from possessing firearms  and ammunition, such as convicted felons.", "Firearms may be assembled by using parts kits that include all of the  components of a fully operable firearm minus the firearm receiver or  frame, which may be obtained separately. ATF officials explained that in  order to circumvent marking requirements on transactions involving  firearms and thus avoid tracing, criminals will sometimes use unfinished  receivers, such as \u201ccastings\u201d or \u201cflats,\u201d rather than fully functional  receivers. A frame or receiver by itself is classified as a firearm by  definition under the Gun Control Act. The receiver is the part of the  firearm that houses the operating parts, typically the bolt or bolt carrier  group, the magazine well, and the trigger group. A casting is essentially a  piece of metal fabricated with the exterior features and contours of the  firearm receiver for which it is intended to substitute, but that without  further machining will not function as a firearm. Castings and flats are  commonly referred to as 80 percent receivers in marketing materials and  advertisements promoting their sale. The \u201c80 percent\u201d label is intended to  convey that the product has been cast or fabricated with most of the  features of a finished, functional firearm receiver, but it will require further  machining to function as a firearm (see fig. 7).", "A receiver flat is a piece of metal that has the same dimensions as a  receiver, but that has not been shaped into a firearm configuration. In this  form, it cannot accept any component parts, but with the proper  equipment it can be readily bent into shape and molded into a receiver  (see fig. 8).", "According to documents provided by ATF, since kits, castings, and flats  are not classified as firearms, transfers of those items are not regulated  under the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act. Although ICE  officials noted they are subject to export control laws, they have no serial  numbers and generally no markings; thus, firearms assembled with them  are untraceable. In addition, receivers and firearms parts are small and  when transported separately may not be easily identified as items  intended for the production of firearms. They are also easy to conceal,  making it more challenging for customs authorities to detect illicit  shipments of such parts.", "According to ATF officials, there are no reliable data on the extent of  firearm parts trafficking from the United States into Mexico. They noted,  however, that recent seizures of firearms parts, firearms made with  unmarked parts, and equipment used to assemble or manufacture  firearms in Mexico suggest an emerging reliance by criminal  organizations on this source of weapons. For example, law enforcement  officials in Mexico described to us two high-profile cases in 2014 involving  illicit firearm parts assembly of this type. One was in Guadalajara, where  Jalisco state police seized hundreds of unfinished receivers and pieces of  sophisticated equipment being used to complete high caliber rifles.

In their revised MOU, the agencies  committed to a shared goal of keeping the public safe by using the tools  given to both agencies and which are vital to the effective control of  domestic and international trafficking of firearms, ammunition, explosives,  weapons, and munitions. Specifically, the MOU set forth roles and  requirements for each agency with respect to (1) intelligence and  information sharing, (2) general investigative guidelines, (3) specific  investigative guidelines, (4) sources of information, and (5) conflict  resolution. This effort to improve coordination and optimize use of the  agencies\u2019 expertise provided the basis to address the issues that had  hampered interagency collaboration prior to the MOU\u2019s implementation.", "ICE and ATF officials said that after the MOU was signed, they held joint  training exercises and conferences to ensure that agents had knowledge  of the MOU and its jurisdictional parameters and collaboration  requirements. Officials from each agency in headquarters, Mexico, and  border locations we visited indicated that personnel working on firearms  trafficking to Mexico were generally aware of the MOU\u2019s key provisions  and collaborated on this basis.

ATF  and ICE officials in border field offices we visited confirmed that they were  familiar with the MOU and that it provides them guidance on interagency  collaboration.

For example, ATF and ICE disagree on the extent to which  trace data on firearms seized in Mexico collected through eTrace should  be shared to support ICE firearms trafficking investigations. According to  an ICE assistant deputy director, these firearms trace data from Mexico  are currently only shared on a limited basis with ICE. Several ICE officials  expressed an interest in obtaining access to these data and indicated that  this access would enhance their ability to identify methodologies used by  firearms traffickers and trends in criminal activity along the Southwest  border. ICE officials responsible for investigations said that trace data  should be shared in accordance to the MOU, which states \u201cATF shall  report to the appropriate ICE field office in a timely manner any  intelligence received relating to the illegal exportation, attempted  exportation, or planned exportation of any item on the United States  Munitions List...\u201d However, the MOU does not address how general  trafficking information, such as that submitted through eTrace by a third  law enforcement agency, may be shared.", "ATF officials asserted that their agency shares trace data on firearms  seized in Mexico with ICE according to established agency polices, which  currently only allow ATF to provide non-case-specific information to other  agencies in aggregate form. With respect to the results of individual trace  requests, ATF officials explained that they are provided only to the law  enforcement agency that submits the trace information; generally, this  information is not shared with third parties, including other law  enforcement agencies. ATF would have to obtain authorization from the  third-party law enforcement agency that submitted the trace information to  share it with ICE. Thus, ATF cannot automatically share information with  ICE on firearm traces submitted by Mexican law enforcement agencies  without their authorization. ATF staff said these policies are set forth in  the agreements ATF signs with each law enforcement agency for the use  of eTrace. Officials from ATF and ICE said there are joint efforts under  way to find a mechanism to share this information.", "Additionally, the 2009 MOU sets forth investigative guidelines to define  the roles and responsibilities of ATF and ICE pursuant to their respective  statutory authorities. For example, the MOU states that \u201cthe regulation  and inspection of the firearms industry is within the sole purview of ATF\u201d  and that \u201call investigative activities at the port of entry, borders and their  functional equivalents must be coordinated through ICE.\u201d Notwithstanding  these guidelines, we found some confusion among some agency officials  about the appropriate roles of their counterparts in conducting  investigations. For example, a senior ICE official responsible for  investigations questioned the involvement of ATF in firearms trafficking  investigations to Mexico, because, according to the official, ATF\u2019s  jurisdiction focuses on combating domestic firearms violations. ICE  officials also expressed concerns that the involvement of ATF\u2019s  international desk with Mexican agencies may create confusion among  Mexican government authorities over the roles that ICE and ATF play in  addressing firearms trafficking cases. However, an ICE assistant deputy  director explained that pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, ICE has  primary jurisdiction over violations related to the international trafficking of  firearms, but many such trafficking investigations begin with domestic  criminal activities for which ATF has jurisdiction. Therefore, he stressed  that it is essential that the two agencies collaborate to leverage ICE\u2019s  international and ATF\u2019s domestic legal authorities. He added that ATF\u2019s  international operations also provide much-needed capacity building  regarding forensics and e-Trace activities in Mexico. However, ICE and  ATF must work to ensure that confusion is not created among Mexican  agencies regarding the responsibilities for the investigation of  international firearms trafficking by U.S. authorities.", "ATF officials agree that their agency\u2019s efforts to combat firearms  trafficking are concentrated in the United States, and that they recognize  the role of ICE in addressing transnational weapons trafficking. However,  some ATF officials said that it is incorrect to suggest that ICE has  exclusive jurisdiction with respect to illicit cross-border firearms trafficking  to Mexico. According to these officials, most investigations involving the  smuggling of firearms from the United States to Mexico implicate ATF  jurisdiction, because they typically involve the illegal acquisition of  firearms inside the United States. ATF\u2019s jurisdiction extends to unlawful  acquisition of firearms by prohibited persons, straw purchasing, and other  unlawful transfers of firearms. ATF officials added that the bureau\u2019s  statutory responsibility for tracing firearms includes the deployment of  eTrace to Mexican and other foreign law enforcement entities, and noted  that eTrace entries from Mexico can result in the opening of firearm  trafficking investigations focused on criminal activity in the United States.  ATF officials also acknowledge that because of the nature of firearms  trafficking to Mexico, many investigations involve overlapping jurisdiction  with respect to cross-border offenses squarely within ICE\u2019s jurisdiction.  They also noted the critical role ATF plays in providing training and  capacity building on firearms and explosives identification and tracing for  Mexican law enforcement. During our fieldwork, Mexican law enforcement  agencies confirmed the benefits they derived from ATF capacity-building  efforts, and they said they regarded ATF as their lead U.S. counterpart in  investigating firearms trafficking. Thus, although ATF has established  productive cooperative relations with Mexican agencies, there may also  be some confusion in Mexico over ATF\u2019s and ICE\u2019s roles in combating  firearms trafficking, as expressed by some ICE officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATF and ICE Do Not Consistently Monitor Implementation of the 2009 MOU, Resulting in Continued Coordination Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In prior work, we have identified several interagency mechanisms that  can be used to improve collaboration among agencies working on a  shared mission, such as information sharing, agency roles and  responsibilities, and oversight and monitoring. We have also reported  that written interagency agreements, such as MOUs, are most effective  when they are regularly updated and monitored. We observed that when  implementation of such agreements is not regularly monitored, there is  sporadic and limited collaboration among agencies. We also have found  that agencies that create a means to monitor, evaluate, and report the  results of collaborative efforts can better identify areas for improvement.", "Immediately after the MOU was updated in 2009, the agencies committed  to undertake efforts to ensure that its provisions would be implemented  accordingly. For example, at that time, ICE informed GAO that  headquarters had a process to obtain information from ICE field offices  every 60 days to identify coordination issues with ATF that could not be  resolved at the field level within the framework of the MOU. In such  situations, ICE headquarters would then work with the appropriate ATF  component to resolve the issue. ICE officials explained these initial  monitoring efforts were designed to ensure that the updated MOU was  being effectively followed as it introduced several provisions or guidelines  on how ATF and ICE should collaborate on firearms trafficking. However,  according to ICE officials, this process was only in place during the initial  implementation period of the MOU, and the effort was not sustained.", "Currently, officials from both agencies acknowledged that there is no  specific mechanism in place to monitor implementation of the MOU.  However, each agency\u2019s officials referred to different efforts that they said  provide an opportunity to monitor interagency collaboration under the  MOU. For example, a deputy assistant director for ICE stated that  coordination between ICE and ATF on firearms trafficking cases occurs at  the Export Enforcement Coordination Center as well as at the field level.  ICE\u2019s Export Enforcement Coordination Center is intended to serve as the  primary forum within the federal government for executive departments  and agencies to coordinate their export control enforcement efforts. The  Center seeks to maximize information sharing, consistent with national  security and applicable laws. Thus, it is likely that coordination challenges  between ICE and ATF on firearms trafficking could potentially be detected  at the Center. However, given the Center\u2019s broader responsibility to  enhance export control enforcement efforts with multiple agencies, it is  not directly intended to monitor implementation of the MOU. Moreover,  coordination challenges related to the MOU persist even though the  Center has been in place for 5 years, indicating that this may not be an  effective means to monitor the MOU\u2019s implementation.", "Senior ATF officials said that although there is no formal arrangement to  regularly monitor implementation of the MOU, they consider joint  interagency training to be an effective approach to ensure that officials  from both agencies are familiar with the provisions of the MOU and are  working together effectively. However, only two such training exercises  have taken place\u2014one in 2014 and another in September 2015. The  training is intended to acquaint officials from both agencies with how the  agencies coordinate firearms trafficking efforts, and as part of the training,  the MOU provisions are discussed, but these training exercises do not  constitute a mechanism for consistent monitoring of implementation of the  MOU. By not sustaining a monitoring process for the MOU, the agencies  have no assurance that its provisions are being implemented effectively,  and challenges we identified are continuing to persist without a process  for resolution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S.-Mexico Collaboration on Firearms Trafficking Was Scaled Back after 2012, but While Challenges Continue, Bilateral Efforts Have Recently Been Gaining Momentum", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bilateral Firearms Trafficking Efforts Slowed Following Mexican Moves to Consolidate Law Enforcement Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Mexican and U.S. officials described how upon coming to power in  December 2012, the current administration of Mexican President Enrique  Pe\u00f1a Nieto undertook a reevaluation of U.S.-Mexico law enforcement  collaboration, including efforts to combat firearms trafficking. According  to some officials, the government of Mexico took steps to consolidate law  enforcement cooperative activities under an approach termed Ventanilla  \u00danica\u2014which translates to Single Window. Under Ventanilla \u00danica,  Mexico\u2019s Interior Ministry has become the primary entity through which  M\u00e9rida Initiative training and equipment are coordinated, including  capacity-building activities related to firearms trafficking. The government  of Mexico also established a single point of contact within Mexico\u2019s Office  of the Attorney General to approve joint investigations with U.S.  counterparts. Additionally, Mexican officials explained that Mexican law  categorizes firearms trafficking as a federal crime and permits only  federal authorities to work on such cases. This has led to some notable  changes in the way U.S. and Mexican authorities work together on  firearms trafficking efforts.", "One of these changes stemmed from the decision to centralize access to  ATF\u2019s eTrace in the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office. Consistent with  our prior recommendations, in 2010, ATF reached an agreement for  deployment of eTrace in Spanish in Mexico, with Mexican authorities.  According to ATF, this was a significant investment for which ATF  provided training to numerous officials from various Mexican federal,  state, and local law enforcement agencies on the use of eTrace, while  assigning accounts to allow them to access the system. However, by  2013 the Mexican government retracted access to many of these  accounts, effectively limiting eTrace in Mexico to certain authorized  officials in the office of Mexico\u2019s Attorney General. Mexican officials  explained that the decision to consolidate access at the Attorney  General\u2019s office was intended to provide the government of Mexico with  more effective control over the information associated with eTrace, and to  support a central repository of evidence related to federal crimes such as  trafficking of firearms. However, U.S. officials and some Mexican  authorities said that limiting access to eTrace to a single governmental  entity has restricted opportunities for bilateral collaboration. Some U.S.  officials based in Mexico similarly noted that limiting access to eTrace  diminished tracing of total firearms seized by Mexican authorities.", "Another significant change following the reassessment of bilateral  collaboration, which began in 2012, was the suspension of periodic  meetings of a working group known as GC Armas, which brought  together U.S. and Mexican officials from various agencies involved in  combating firearms trafficking. According to ATF officials, prior to 2013,  GC Armas held periodic meetings annually with the participation of  approximately 70 to 100 officials from both governments. These officials  shared useful information on firearms trafficking trends, trace data,  investigations, collaboration questions, and many other issues. ATF  officials said that oftentimes very productive cooperative efforts on  firearms trafficking began informally at GC Armas meetings and were  subsequently formalized. Mexican officials similarly characterized GC  Armas meetings as contributing in a fundamental manner to reaching  significant agreement between law enforcement in both countries on how  to combat firearms trafficking. They noted one such bilateral effort that  resulted in a comprehensive assessment of firearms and explosives  trafficking with recommendations for each country on sharing information  and cooperating on cross-border investigations. Officials from both  countries explained that while bilateral coordination did not cease after  the suspension of GC Armas meetings, overall collaboration slowed down  with fewer opportunities to promote bilateral firearms trafficking initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corruption and Frequent Turnover Continue to Hamper Bilateral Collaboration on Firearms Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["U.S. and Mexican authorities acknowledge the challenges to law  enforcement efforts posed by continuing corruption among some Mexican  officials. As we discussed in our 2009 report, concerns about corruption  within Mexican government agencies often limit U.S. officials\u2019 ability to  develop a full partnership with their Mexican counterparts. Officials we  met with from ATF, ICE, CBP, and State continued to express such  concerns regarding corruption in Mexico. Some Mexico-based ICE  officials, for example, stated that they are conscious that their U.S.-based  colleagues will not always share with them all of the information they have  on firearms trafficking investigations because of concerns about  corruption. That is, ICE officials in the United States and along the U.S.- Mexican border are concerned about sharing information with ICE  officials based in Mexico, fearing that the information may unintentionally  reach corrupt Mexican authorities and compromise their investigations.  According to ICE officials, concerns they had about corruption in Mexico  were exacerbated early in the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration when a vetted  unit of Mexican law enforcement officials that they trusted and that ICE  had trained and worked with for several years was disbanded.", "U.S. officials also highlighted the problems frequent turnover in Mexican  law enforcement pose for bilateral efforts to combat criminal activities,  including firearms trafficking. Some U.S. officials explained that recurring  personnel changes aggravate the issue of corruption. In a country such  as Mexico, where there is an underlying concern about government  corruption, frequent turnover complicates efforts to develop trust with  counterpart officials. Other U.S. officials noted that there are no civil  service protections in Mexico, so there can be a virtually complete change  in the staff of a government agency when a new administration comes  into office, or even when the head of an agency is reassigned. As a  result, all of the people who received specialized training, such as  firearms recognition, can be removed suddenly leaving no institutional  memory, which complicates planning future collaboration and program  implementation. Similarly, ATF officials commented that oftentimes  Mexican law enforcement personnel in key positions for whom they  provided firearms training were subsequently replaced. While turnover  has been a recurring challenge for U.S. agencies working in Mexico,  various U.S. officials said that it appears to have been particularly  frequent in the past few years.

Similarly, ATF was providing training on firearms identification for  Mexican Customs. A Mexican Customs spokesman stressed the  importance of such training in helping front-line customs officers  recognize and safely secure not just firearms but also ammunition,  firearms\u2019 components, and explosives that criminals try to smuggle across  the border. He explained that this training has been critical in allowing  officers at the border to perform their mission.", "Mexican Attorney General officials also noted their increasing level of  cooperation with U.S. authorities on firearms trafficking. They highlighted  ATF training on the use of eTrace and the resumption of GC Armas  meetings in 2015. ICE officials also told us that they have recently  reestablished the vetted unit in Mexico, which improves trusted working  relationships with Mexican counterparts. Finally, in addition to renewing  existing collaborative efforts with Mexican law enforcement counterparts,  ATF has also sought to reach out to other Mexican government entities.

As previously  noted in this report, ATF officials readily acknowledge that shifts in the  number of guns seized and traced do not necessarily reflect fluctuations  in the volume of firearms trafficked from the United States to Mexico in  any particular year. There are many factors that could account for the  number of firearms traced in a given year beside the number of firearms  smuggled from the Unites States. Moreover, as discussed above, for  various reasons the number of firearms seized in Mexico and traced back  to the United States shifted significantly year to year after 2009 and then  declined steadily since 2011. Thus, while the number of firearms seized  and traced by ATF is useful to provide an overall indication of firearms of  U.S. origin found in Mexico, by itself it is not an adequate measure of  progress agencies are making to stem the flow of firearms trafficked from  the United States into Mexico. Additionally, ONDCP has not reported  progress made on the strategic objective in the Weapons Chapter in 2011  or 2013.

For example, in the 2011 Strategy, one supporting  action called for ATF to increase staffing at the El Paso Intelligence  Center Firearms and Explosives Trafficking Intelligence Unit through the  incorporation of partner agencies. In 2013, the Strategy included an  update that the unit had incorporated a CBP analyst dedicated to  weapons-related intelligence. Similarly, in 2011, the agencies said they  had plans under way to train over 200 Mexican law enforcement  personnel in how to correctly use eTrace. The 2013 Strategy noted that  350 Mexican law enforcement personnel had received training on using  eTrace. Nevertheless, the supporting actions described in the Strategy  are not consistently linked to indicators or regularly measured. Currently,  the narrative related to these supporting actions typically covers ongoing  efforts by the agencies to address these actions, but it does not include a  measure of overall progress.

Other actions that  agencies take to stem the flow of firearms from the United States into  Mexico may be worth considering as additional measures of progress,  such as the number of interdictions of firearms destined for Mexico, the  number of investigations leading to indictments for firearms trafficking  related to Mexico, and the number of convictions of firearms traffickers  with a nexus to Mexico.

For those firearms that were traced to a retail dealer in  the United States before being trafficked to Mexico, NTC data also  contained information on the states where they had originated.
