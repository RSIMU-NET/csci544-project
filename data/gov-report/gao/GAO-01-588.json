Although their collaborative efforts have been impressive, the two agencies have largely targeted generic drugs, which comprise less than 10 percent of their combined expenditures. More dramatic cost reductions could be achieved through procurements of high-cost brand-name drugs, although doing so can be more complex and time consuming to garner the necessary clinical support and provider acceptance on therapeutic interchangeability. Nonetheless, DOD's greatly expanded retiree drug benefit and the formularies being developed by both agencies should provide added joint procurement opportunities for such drugs. Also, VA and DOD have shown that flexible approaches to developing joint solicitations can take into account differences in their health systems while still maximizing drug discounts. In GAO's view, their joint activities could be further enhanced by periodically conferring with private managed care pharmacy experts and reporting to Congress on their joint procurement activities. Top management at DOD and VA need to stay focused on their joint procurement and distribution activities as leadership changes continue at the two agencies. VA and DOD have also made progress in their efforts to conduct a consolidated mail outpatient pharmacy pilot. The sooner the pilot proves feasible, the sooner DOD can begin to realize the financial and quality of care benefits associated with the transfer of its refill workload."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2000, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) together spent about $3.2 billion on prescription drugs for beneficiaries. Reflecting national trends, VA and DOD drug expenditures have risen significantly, consuming an increasing percentage of their health care budgets. Newly legislated initiatives are projected to further boost DOD\u2019s annual drug costs by $800 million in fiscal year 2002. To help control these expenditures, VA and DOD have separately and, more recently, jointly contracted for pharmaceuticals to obtain large discounts from drug manufacturers. Considerable leverage can be exerted when the departments commit to buy increased volumes of a particular drug when there are generic drugs or brand name drugs that are interchangeable in efficacy, safety, and outcomes. The departments\u2019 ability to commit to jointly buy more of a particular drug depends largely on their ability to influence provider prescribing practices through the use of formularies.", "Since the early 1980s, the Congress has urged VA and DOD to achieve greater efficiencies through increased collaboration. In May 2000, we testified before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs\u2019 Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on VA and DOD\u2019s joint pharmaceutical procurement and distribution. We identified a number of high-expenditure drug classes and encouraged the departments to review them for clinical appropriateness and potential cost-effectiveness for joint procurement. We also urged DOD to consider using VA\u2019s highly efficient consolidated mail outpatient pharmacy (CMOP) centers to handle DOD\u2019s military pharmacies\u2019 refill prescription workloads. The departments generally agreed with both proposals. As part of your continuing oversight of these efforts, you asked us to report on (1) VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s efforts to increase joint pharmaceutical procurement, (2) challenges cited by VA and DOD in doing so, and (3) the status of their efforts to pilot test CMOP use at DOD.", "To conduct our work, we interviewed VA and DOD pharmacy policy and acquisition officials and reviewed records on procurement, policy, and mail-out operations. We reviewed DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s preliminary comments, joint procurement plans, and cost avoidance estimates related to the drug classes and individual drugs we identified as potential joint procurement candidates. DOD and VA define cost avoidance as the difference between the theoretical cost that would have occurred if contracts were not awarded and the actual cost incurred for the drugs affected by each contract. To learn more about the joint procurement potential of drugs in these classes, we consulted with a managed care pharmacist and obtained the views of academic and private sector managed care pharmacy experts. Regarding the CMOP pilot, we interviewed DOD and VA officials and reviewed records concerning interagency software needs and costs to establish an electronic link between military pharmacy and CMOP center computers, as well as other issues affecting the pilot\u2019s progress. We also visited two VA and DOD medical centers to observe pharmacy computer systems and to discuss links with CMOPs for electronically transmitting refill prescriptions for processing and mailing to beneficiaries. We conducted our work from June 2000 through April 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Reflecting national trends, VA and DOD prescription drug expenditures have increased substantially in recent years and at a much higher rate than their overall health care expenditures. (See figure 1.) In fiscal year 2000, VA purchased about $2.1 billion in pharmaceuticals\u2014$256 million more than in fiscal year 1999\u2014to provide 86 million prescriptions for veterans. In the same year, DOD purchased about $1.14 billion in pharmaceuticals\u2014 an increase of $174 million from fiscal year 1999\u2014to provide 54 million military pharmacy and mail-order prescriptions for active duty and retired military service members and their families. Similarly, DOD\u2019s TRICARE retail pharmacy program costs have skyrocketed\u2014averaging 34 percent increases each year since 1995. A number of factors are likely to further drive up pharmaceutical spending, such as a decrease in private insurance pharmaceutical coverage for individuals eligible for VA or DOD benefits. This is particularly so for DOD\u2014as of April 1, 2001, approximately 1.4 million retirees and their dependents received new retail and mail-order pharmacy benefits at an additional cost of about $800 million annually.", "Since 1997, VA and DOD have each adopted centralized formularies to help ensure that certain drugs are available at all veterans\u2019 and military health care facilities as well as to control pharmacy benefit costs. VA\u2019s national formulary currently lists about 1,100 drugs representing 254 classes, while DOD\u2019s basic core formulary lists 175 drugs in 71 classes.Most of the drug classes in both VA national and DOD core formularies are open\u2014that is, there are no restrictions on provider\u2019s choice of which drug to prescribe for a patient. However, a few drug classes are closed or preferred, meaning that VA and DOD have varying restrictions on providers\u2019 choice of drugs after determining that certain brand name drugs are therapeutic alternatives\u2014that is, interchangeable in terms of efficacy, safety, and outcomes.", "Having closed or preferred classes allows VA and DOD to competitively award requirements contracts for the lowest-priced drugs. In closed classes, VA and DOD providers must prescribe and pharmacies must dispense the contract drug, instead of therapeutic alternatives, to meet the terms of the contract and guarantee drug companies a high market share. Case-by-case exceptions are allowed, such as those for medical necessity. In preferred classes, VA and DOD providers and pharmacies are encouraged to use the preferred drug but may prescribe or dispense other drugs in the same class without obtaining an exception. Due to the complexity of the care issues and the need to garner clinical acceptance and support, VA and DOD can take as long as a year between the date their respective class reviews establish therapeutic interchangeability of competing brand name drugs and the date a contract is awarded. Generic drug contracts do not require drug class reviews\u2014since competing products are already known to be chemically and therapeutically alike\u2014 and, therefore, take less effort and time\u2014about 120 days.", "VA and military pharmacies use a number of purchasing vehicles to buy prescription drugs at substantial discounts from market prices. (See table 1.) For example, in 1999, about 81 percent of VA and DOD\u2019s combined $2.4 billion in drug expenditures was for drugs bought through the federal supply schedule (FSS) for pharmaceuticals. The remaining expenditures were for purchases associated with the different requirements contracts VA and DOD have with drug manufacturers\u2014each using leverage with manufacturers to achieve the lowest-priced product on its formulary.", "For nearly 2 decades, the Congress has urged VA and DOD to maximize federal dollars by sharing their health care resources. In May 1982, the Congress enacted the VA and DOD Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act (P.L. 97-174), which generally encouraged the two departments to enter into agreements to share health care services in existing or newly built health care facilities. In 1996, the Congress began to specifically target cooperation in the purchasing and distributing of pharmaceuticals for the departments\u2019 respective beneficiaries. A 1999 report by a congressional commission concluded that DOD and VA should combine their market power to get better pharmaceutical prices through joint contracts. More recently, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) required VA and DOD to submit a report on how joint pharmaceutical procurement can be enhanced and cost reductions realized by fiscal year 2004. In January 2001, VA and DOD submitted this report on efforts under way to maximize efficiencies in health care systems. Finally, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-419) included a provision encouraging VA and DOD to increase to the maximum extent consistent with their respective missions their level of cooperation in the procurement and management of prescription drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA and DOD Have Markedly Increased Their Joint Procurement Activities", "paragraphs": ["VA and DOD have made important progress, especially this past year, to increase their joint pharmaceutical procurement activities. By May 2001, the departments expect to have more than doubled the number of joint procurement contracts entered into since our May 2000 testimony.

(See table 4 in appendix I.) Although these drugs account for just 1.9 percent of the departments\u2019 combined $3.2 billion drug spending in 2000, VA and DOD estimate these joint procurement discounts achieved sizeable cost avoidance\u2014about $40 million in 2000. This is in addition to the significant cost avoidance the departments are already experiencing from their separate contracts. Last year, the departments began developing plans to merge these contracts as they expire and undertook other collaborative actions that will increase the number of joint procurements in the future.", "In May 2000, we testified that VA and DOD could significantly increase savings with expanded use of joint pharmaceutical procurement, especially for products in high-expenditure drug classes\u2014a number of which we identified. Since that time, the departments have moved to more than double their joint pharmaceutical procurements and the expected financial benefits from these joint activities. As of January 2001, for example, VA and DOD have awarded an additional 12 joint contracts for commonly used generic drugs and are in the process of awarding another 14 joint contracts\u2014including one for a brand name nonsedating antihistamine drug. (See tables 5 and 6 in appendix I.) In 1999, these drugs accounted for about $123 million of combined VA and DOD purchases. The departments estimate substantial discounts from these new joint procurements\u2014an additional $30 million in drug purchasing cost avoidance each year for the 12 contracts already under way\u2014and millions more should stem from the 14 solicitations that are under way.", "As of December 2000, VA and DOD had preliminarily reviewed the high- expenditure classes that we suggested could provide opportunities for additional joint procurements. As a result, they plan over the next few years to target for joint procurement 112 drugs\u2014which accounted for about $400 million of their combined expenditures in 1999. (See table 2 for the major therapeutic areas and appendix II for details.) Further, VA and DOD plan to propose more joint procurements after they complete their analysis of the suggested classes. Most of these planned procurements are for generic drugs, but some are for brand name drugs. For example, VA and DOD also recently completed class reviews on the therapeutic interchangeability of several brand name drugs used to treat sinus congestion and have found sufficient clinical basis to pursue one or two joint procurements.", "The departments estimate that discounts from joint procurements in the targeted classes will yield about $100 million in additional annual cost avoidance although they have not yet estimated cost avoidance for some later year procurements. Also, DOD and VA agreed to merge 52 existing VA-only and DOD-only contracts as these contracts expire. (See table 7 in appendix I.) For example, the departments plan to merge their eight separate contracts for brand name drugs used to lower cholesterol, treat gastrointestinal problems, and control high blood pressure. These contracts yielded cost avoidance in excess of $184 million in fiscal year 2000, which will likely increase as the contracts are consolidated. But, the departments have not yet estimated the consequent potential additional cost avoidance. While potential cost avoidance is difficult to estimate\u2014 especially given the high variability in drug market competition\u2014it is likely that the more joint procurements VA and DOD enter into, the greater the financial benefits they will realize."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improved Collaboration Should Enhance Future Joint Procurement Performance", "paragraphs": ["Prior to May 2000, VA and DOD had primarily used interagency sharing agreements and work groups to collaborate on joint procurement activities. In 1998, for example, the DOD/VA Federal Pharmacy Executive Steering Committee was established to increase the uniformity and cost effectiveness of drug therapy in their separate health systems, including overseeing joint contracts for high-dollar and high-volume drugs. But the geographical separation of the departments\u2019 key pharmacy policy and acquisition staffs continued to hamper their day-to-day communications on joint drug activities and complicate their working relationships. Since May 2000, however, the departments have sought to remedy this. As a result, their key pharmacy officials now meet regularly at hub locations to discuss and further their joint procurement activities, and have developed a continually updated interagency report on their joint procurement activities.", "In August 2000, the DOD/VA Federal Pharmacy Executive Steering Committee began meeting regularly in San Antonio, Texas; Falls Church, Virginia; or Chicago, Illinois, to identify drugs or classes for joint contracting and discuss strategies based on ongoing clinical and formulary decisions. VA and DOD pharmacy policy and acquisition center staff also started holding frequent subcommittee meetings to focus on joint procurement issues.", "Similarly, in July 2000 VA and DOD acquisition center executives and managers began meeting regularly in Philadelphia or Chicago to review progress under a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to combine their buying power, reduce medical materiel costs, and eliminate contracting redundancies. In addition to implementing joint contracting decisions, the MOA provided that the departments also work together to cancel DOD\u2019s distribution and pricing agreements (DAPA) with drug companies by converting them to VA\u2019s FSS prices. Since the May 2000 hearing, a number of issues impeding progress on converting DAPA to FSS prices have been resolved. For example, a needed computer interface was established between the acquisition centers to expedite uploading FSS prices into DOD\u2019s pharmaceutical ordering and purchasing system, and VA agreed to offset its normal surcharge on all FSS sales to military pharmacies. By January 2001, DOD was able to convert its DAPAs and now both agencies use the same FSS prices. As a result of last year\u2019s progress on the MOA, DOD\u2019s acquisition officials expect to reassign some of their employees to work on additional joint pharmaceutical contracting with VA.", "Finally, VA and DOD\u2019s new Joint Contract Status report, which is maintained by VA\u2019s pharmacy policy staff, details every drug and drug class with combined purchase potential. VA and DOD pharmacy policy and procurement staff use the report to monitor joint procurement progress and track results. The report is continually updated to list all current joint and separate (VA-only and DOD-only) contracts and those potential procurements that are dependent on clinical and formulary decisions. A November 2000 update to the report details about 140 unique drugs and drug classes providing the contracting status for existing joint and separate contracts and, for many of these, estimates of award values and annual cost avoidance. The report also lists proposed and pending joint contracts\u2014including several we had identified earlier as potential candidates\u2014and the time frames for the various procurement stages.

For example, VA\u2019s brand name drug purchases are 36 percent of volume but 91 percent of expenditures.Although in jointly procuring brand name drugs it can be more complex and time-consuming to garner clinical support and provider acceptance on therapeutic interchangeability, the cumulative financial benefit potential is far greater. Along with such inherent difficulties, VA and DOD cite such challenges as differences in their beneficiary populations and formularies that make it difficult for them to jointly procure brand name drugs. However, some of these differences are diminishing, and the departments have already demonstrated in two cases that they can jointly procure brand name drugs and still meet their unique clinical and administrative needs. Also, the departments can take such actions as periodically seeking input from experts and providing annual reports to the Congress on their joint procurement activities to help enhance their efforts to address these challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Departments Cite Differing Beneficiaries, Formularies, Clinical Needs, and Provider Prescribing Practices as Complicating Jointly Buying Brand Name Drugs", "paragraphs": ["According to VA and DOD officials, several aspects of their health care systems create challenges that limit their opportunities to jointly procure brand name drugs:   VA and DOD officials cite differences in their patient populations\u2014VA serves mostly older men, while DOD also serves younger men and women and children\u2014as shown in figure 2. They said that the different populations result in dissimilar patterns of drug use and demand among their respective beneficiaries, resulting in fewer opportunities to combine drug requirements and solicit joint contracts.", "VA and DOD officials told us that differences in the scope of their national formularies also limit opportunities for joint drug procurements. VA\u2019s national formulary currently lists about 1,100 drugs for inpatient and outpatient care representing 254 classes, while DOD\u2019s basic core formulary lists 175 drugs for outpatient care in only 71 classes. Also, DOD\u2019s military pharmacy formularies currently limit the drugs available to beneficiaries seeking them whereas its TRICARE retail formularies are unrestricted such that virtually any drug can be obtained. DOD officials are concerned that joint contracts for particular brand name drugs would further restrict drug choice at military pharmacies, which, in turn, could cause beneficiaries to use the retail pharmacies for their drugs. This could drive up DOD\u2019s overall pharmacy costs because its contractors\u2019 drug costs are greater than its discounted military pharmacy drugs.", "VA and DOD officials are also concerned that closing some classes would be clinically unacceptable for certain populations or individuals with certain conditions. For example, VA and DOD have been reluctant to seek joint contracts for orally inhaled corticosteroids (to treat asthma) because some DOD clinicians would not accept limiting drug choices in the oral inhaler class for clinical reasons, such as the special needs of children. Similarly, VA and DOD clinicians said they would not accept closing the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant class because they already have many patients maintained on one SSRI, and switching their SSRI drug therapy could have adverse treatment effects.", "Finally, DOD is concerned that its limited control of private provider prescribing practices could result in significant costs to educate and persuade these providers to prescribe drugs contracted under joint procurements. Unlike VA beneficiary prescriptions, which are all written by VA providers and dispensed by VA pharmacies, DOD beneficiary prescriptions are written by both military and private providers and dispensed by both military and retail pharmacies. In fiscal year 2000, about half of the 52 million prescriptions filled by military pharmacies were written by private providers and TRICARE retail pharmacies filled 12 million prescriptions for DOD beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Numbers of Military Retirees and Expanded DOD Benefits Are Lessening Differences Between DOD and VA Drug Needs", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, DOD\u2019s patient profile and drug demands have become more similar to VA\u2019s.

In fiscal year 2000, close to 70 percent of military pharmacies\u2019 drug costs was for retirees\u2019 prescriptions. (See figure 3.) Further, DOD\u2019s pharmacy benefits for 1.4 million retirees 65 and older expanded in April 2001, which will add an estimated $800 million dollars per year to DOD\u2019s pharmacy expenditures.", "A significant portion of VA and DOD\u2019s combined drug expenditures is already spent on drugs in classes used primarily to treat older patients. For example, in 1999, 8 of the top 10 high-dollar drug classes in each department were the same. (See table 3.) Most of the matching therapeutic classes are widely used to treat health conditions common to the elderly: high blood pressure, depression, ulcers, diabetes, and high cholesterol.

The larger their formularies, the greater the chance they will overlap and provide the two departments more opportunities to jointly procure brand name drugs.", "Recent legislation has prompted DOD to make plans to increase the number of drugs on its basic core formulary. In 1999, the Congress enacted legislation requiring DOD to establish a preferred drug formulary by October 2000, applicable to both military pharmacies and TRICARE retail and mail-order pharmacies. DOD missed this deadline and is developing regulations to implement this requirement later this year. The legislation also allows DOD to develop and implement a tiered retail and mail-order pharmacy copayment system that creates financial incentives for beneficiaries to use less costly formulary brand name and generic drugs. Once implemented, DOD beneficiaries would have full access to nonformulary brand name drugs but would be financially encouraged to choose less costly formulary brand name drugs available for free at military pharmacies or at lower out-of-pocket costs through mail-order or retail pharmacies. TRICARE contractor representatives told us that a uniform formulary\u2014one that applies to both military and TRICARE pharmacies\u2014and adequately tiered retail and mail-order pharmacy copayments are critically needed to help them and DOD better manage pharmacy benefit costs by steering use to less costly drugs.", "In addition, the Congress enacted legislation in 2000 requiring DOD to allow beneficiaries age 65 and older access to its retail and mail-order pharmacy benefits\u2014in addition to their continued eligibility to use military pharmacies to obtain free medications.  For the first time starting in April 2001, all beneficiaries are eligible for DOD\u2019s comprehensive pharmacy benefits at the same copayment rates.  However, DOD\u2019s retail and mail- order pharmacies are comparatively more costly sources for the same drugs than its military pharmacies. (See figure 4.) An expanded basic core formulary would encourage all beneficiaries to obtain more of their prescriptions at the military pharmacies.", "VA is also revising its formulary management processes and will continue to change its formulary based, in part, on our earlier reviews and a study by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM study was done in response to congressional concerns that VA\u2019s formulary may have been overly restrictive, with potentially negative effects on health care cost and quality. IOM\u2019s study dispelled such concerns, concluding that VA was justified in creating its formulary and that well-managed formularies are a key part of modern health systems having positive effects on cost and quality. IOM recommended in part that VA continue to prudently establish closed and preferred classes on its formulary and to use more contracts to carefully limit drug choices in more classes, based on quality and cost considerations.

To address a DOD concern and ensure that DOD beneficiaries would not have to change their current medications, the solicitation specifies that DOD beneficiaries already using an NSA would not have to switch if the departments jointly contracted for the other drug. Military pharmacies will only have to dispense the contracted drug for new patient prescriptions.", "For the nicotine patch class (for smoking cessation), VA and DOD have awarded a joint contract that requires only those VA and DOD facilities offering smoking cessation programs to use the contracted drug. Simply adding the contracted product to their formularies would have required VA and DOD facilities without such programs to stock the patches. The joint procurement allowed VA and DOD to realize an estimated $2.4 million in annual cost avoidance.", "For the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blocker classes, DOD and VA have awarded contracts for preferred formulary drugs without closing the classes. While these contracts encourage providers to prescribe less costly contracted drugs for their patients, providers are free to prescribe noncontracted drugs without having to justify medical necessity. These contracts have resulted in an estimated $13 million in annual cost avoidance.", "For the leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) class of anticancer drugs, DOD negotiated a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to receive the same price as VA\u2019s contract price for Zoladex\u2014a 33 percent discount off old prices. In return, DOD has agreed to the preferential use of Zoladex to treat a subset of DOD\u2019s population\u2014adult prostate cancer patients. However, the BPA does not limit providers\u2019 choice in prescribing LHRH drugs for women and children\u2014a clinical concern that had caused DOD to avoid closing this class. DOD\u2019s preferential use of Zoladex should achieve substantial cost avoidance.

For example, drugs under a joint BPA could be assigned preferential status on the departments\u2019 formularies to encourage\u2014but not require\u2014providers to use the drugs. Competing drugs could also have equal status under multiple joint BPAs rather than closing a class. For example, VA negotiated discounts for SSRI antidepressants with three drug companies under individual BPAs. These BPAs were subsequently extended to DOD.

Using CMOP centers to boost the efficiency of DOD\u2019s refill process might help offset the shortages of qualified pharmacists and other staff at its military pharmacies. DOD also expects that by freeing up its military pharmacists from the labor-intensive task of dispensing prescriptions, they would have more time to work with medical staff and patients toward safer, more effective drug use. CMOP centers also have the benefit of ensuring quality\u2014with their bar-code technology, they have achieved a near error-free dispensing rate. Other potential benefits from using VA\u2019s CMOP centers include customer service. By reducing military pharmacies\u2019 refill workload, pharmacists would have more time to fill initial prescriptions and thus reduce customer waiting times. Beneficiaries have the convenience of receiving refills by mail rather than picking them up at military pharmacies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Made Toward Assessing Feasibility, but Other Issues Remain Before Pilot Is Undertaken", "paragraphs": ["After conducting an assessment of the costs and time required to develop a computer interface between DOD\u2019s military pharmacies and VA\u2019s CMOP centers, DOD plans to seek funding for the project. However, DOD and VA have not developed plans for how or when to address other significant operational and financial issues that must be worked through to ensure a successful pilot program.", "DOD had several concerns in deciding whether to conduct a CMOP pilot with VA. Primary among these concerns was determining the costs and time needed to develop an interface that would allow DOD to electronically transfer millions of refill prescriptions from its military pharmacies to the CMOP centers and allow the centers to confirm the status of each refill. In January 2001, DOD, in consultation with VA, completed a preliminary review of the information technology requirements and determined that this effort should take about 9 months of work by pharmacy information technology specialists and cost roughly $640,000. DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs director told us that, considering the reasonableness of the cost and time estimates, establishing a DOD-CMOP interface is no longer considered a major obstacle and that he is seeking internal funding for the interface.", "According to VA and DOD, other significant operational and financial issues will need to be worked through if DOD decides to adopt CMOP use systemwide. For example, VA would have to plan for and build the equivalent of two new CMOP centers to accommodate DOD\u2019s estimated refill mail-out workload of more than 20 million prescriptions. According to VA officials, the two new CMOP centers for DOD would require 2 to 3 years to build and cost about $27 million. Yet both DOD and VA officials agree that such costs could be significantly reduced if existing VA- or DOD-owned building space could be retrofitted for CMOP\u2019s high- technology equipment and production lines. Unused warehouses and aircraft hangars, for example, might have the 75,000 square feet of open floor space VA\u2019s CMOP design requires. Another DOD concern is that adopting CMOP use could adversely affect military medical readiness. If, for example, DOD\u2019s prime vendors\u2019 drug sales to military pharmacies are reduced with CMOP use, then surcharge revenues generated by such sales and used for medical logistics and readiness planning would likewise be reduced. As we testified in May 2000, this concern could be addressed if DOD\u2019s prime vendors directly supply the CMOPs with drugs needed to fill DOD beneficiaries\u2019 prescriptions\u2014but the departments need to decide on a mutually acceptable course of action.", "VA and DOD officials told us that an interagency memorandum of understanding or sharing agreement would need to be established to do the pilot program and address these and other joint operational and financial concerns. Such an agreement would cover the various details governing DOD\u2019s use of VA\u2019s CMOPs for processing and mailing-out military pharmacy refill prescriptions to DOD beneficiaries. For example, officials anticipate that an agreement will include provisions to accommodate DOD\u2019s medical readiness concerns.", "However, DOD and VA have not established time frames for addressing the remaining issues in order to finish planning so that the pilot can begin. VA and DOD\u2019s existing sharing agreement governing their joint pharmaceutical and related medical procurement activities could be used for the CMOP pilot. Signed in 1999, the MOA provided for such future joint department activities by executing and adding appendixes to spell out mutual commitments and responsibilities. Alternatively, a new agreement could be drawn up for the CMOP activity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA and DOD have made important progress, particularly this past year, in their collaborative efforts to jointly procure drugs to help control spiraling prescription drug costs. Their awarded joint contracts and planned joint procurements are expected to reduce the departments\u2019 total drug costs by almost $170 million a year. This is in addition to significant cost avoidance under the departments\u2019 separate contracts\u2014cost avoidance that will likely increase as the contracts are combined in the future. While their joint procurement efforts have been impressive, to date the departments have largely targeted generic drugs, which make up less than 10 percent of their combined expenditures. More dramatic cost reductions could be realized through procurements of high-cost brand name drugs, although in doing so, it may be more complex and time-consuming to garner the necessary clinical support and provider acceptance on therapeutic interchangeability.", "Nonetheless, DOD\u2019s greatly expanded retiree drug benefit, and both departments\u2019 developing formularies should provide added joint procurement opportunities for such drugs. In particular, DOD needs to complete development of a uniform formulary of preferred drugs among its health system\u2019s pharmacy sources to better manage and control drug use. Also, the departments\u2019 have demonstrated that flexible approaches to developing joint solicitations can take into account differences in their health systems while still maximizing drug discounts. And DOD can work with the TRICARE contractors to help influence nonmilitary providers and their patients to use contracted drugs. This will become particularly important once DOD develops its uniform formulary of preferred drugs. In our view, their joint activities could be further enhanced by periodically conferring with private managed care pharmacy experts and reporting to the Congress on their joint procurement activities. DOD and VA need to ensure that high-level attention remains focused on their joint drug procurement and distribution activities as leadership changes under the new administration occur at the departments.", "In the same regard, VA and DOD have also made progress in their efforts to conduct a CMOP pilot. DOD\u2019s use of VA\u2019s CMOPs to handle its large prescription refill workload would result in drug dispensing cost reductions and better use of limited resources.
