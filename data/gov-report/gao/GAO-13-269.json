Previously, the Bureau routinely accepted all challenges, largely without regard to the data sources cited or provided so long as they supported the calculations and covered the appropriate reporting periods. According to Bureau officials, these changes are based on research that shows that estimates based on some methods and records (e.g., births, deaths, and migration) are substantially more accurate than estimates based on others. Among other changes, the Bureau modified procedures so that challenges by subcounty governments to the Bureau's estimates of people living in housing units will no longer affect countylevel population estimates. Moving forward, any such challenge resulting in an increase in the estimate of a subcounty population will be offset by a downward revision to the population estimate of all other communities in the same county. Also, the Bureau plans to routinely review population challenges in light of each community's population growth trend.Corroborating data will be required for challenges inconsistent with the trend.", "Challenge program officials told GAO that in the past the program focused quality assurance on (1) reviewing the calculations in the documentation submitted by local governments as part of challenge submissions and (2) checking documents and calculations for internal consistency. Moving forward, the Bureau is preparing a quality assurance plan for Bureau staff who review challenges to better ensure proper handling and processing of challenges, as well as the review of calculations.", "The Bureau's 2020 research and testing program is exploring the use of local administrative records for the 2020 Census, such as those used in the challenge program, but this effort is a lower priority than research on the use of national records, in part because national administrative records show greater promise than local records for controlling costs. Bureau officials said local records show the most promise for supporting the development of the 2020 address list. Specifically, the Bureau is exploring how it can use local records to more seamlessly and continually update address lists and maps, rather than waiting to receive such information as part of a one-time decennial update. Bureau officials stated that it is important to continue research on local records because they may be helpful in targeting decennial operations to hard-to-count groups or those in certain geographic areas. However, the results of 2010 Census research and testing on national records have led Bureau officials to conclude that continuing research on national records should be a higher priority."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With a life cycle cost of around $13 billion, the 2010 Census was the most  expensive population count in U.S. history, costing over 50 percent more  than the $8.1 billion 2000 Census. The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau)  estimates that if it used the same approach to count people in 2020 as it  did in 2010, it could potentially cost around $25 billion, or $151 to count  each housing unit compared to the $97 it cost in 2010. The Bureau is  considering a number of ways to control the costs of the 2020 Census  including the expanded use of administrative records, that is, data  collected and maintained by other organizations for the purpose of  administering programs and providing services, such as Medicare  enrollment data or Selective Service System registration address  information. The Bureau made limited use of administrative records for  the 2010 Census. For example, the Bureau used United States Postal  Service files to update its address list, and federal agency records, such  as those from the Department of Defense, were used to count military  and federal civilian employees stationed outside of the United States.", "Administrative records could save the Bureau money if the Bureau uses  them to reduce the need for certain costly and labor-intensive door-to- door visits by Bureau employees, such as collecting data in-person from  nonrespondents, supporting quality control, or helping to evaluate the  quality of the census. The Bureau has initially estimated that by  expanding the use of administrative records it could save up to $2 billion  by reducing the workload from these and other operations. Administrative  records are already used by the Bureau\u2019s Population Estimates  Challenge Program, which gives local governments the opportunity to  challenge the Bureau\u2019s annual estimates of their population counts during  the years between decennial censuses. Under the challenge program,  local governments use their own local administrative records to question  the Bureau\u2019s official population statistics. While not affecting  congressional apportionment or redistricting, the challenges can affect  other uses of census data, such as various state and federal assistance  programs where funding and eligibility are based in whole or in part on  population size. Over the past several months, the Bureau considered  various changes to the challenge program that are designed to, among  other improvements, enhance the accuracy of the intercensal estimates.  The Bureau issued the final rule in the January 3, 2013, Federal  Register, and the changes became effective as of February 4, 2013.", "Given the importance of accurate population estimates, you asked us to  describe these changes.

Administrative records could reduce the cost of the census if they can  help the Bureau reduce the workload for several operations, including  address list building; quality assurance; and nonresponse follow-up,  which, at $1.6 billion in 2010 and lasting several weeks, was the largest  and most costly census field operation.testing program has nine research and testing projects that are exploring  the expanded use of administrative records for these purposes.", "The Bureau\u2019s 2020 research and  The Bureau already uses administrative records to produce annual  population estimates for the nation, states, counties, cities, towns, and  townships as part of its program to estimate changes in population size  and distribution since the previous census.

Counties and subcounties could challenge  the Bureau\u2019s estimate based on evidence that the number of housing  units in their locality differed from the Bureau\u2019s estimate of housing units.  From 2001 to 2008, the Bureau reports revising population estimates  from 287 challenges. These challenges were from 211 governments in 36  states and the District of Columbia. There were as few as 3 challenges in  2001 and as many as 61 each in 2006 and 2007.

In practice, according to agency  officials, the Bureau generally accepted all challenges, largely without  regard to the data sources provided so long as they supported  calculations of population change and covered the reporting periods  required by the challenge program. The rule changes are intended to  improve the quality of data that communities use to challenge the  Bureau\u2019s population estimates and will affect the scope of what county  and state governments can challenge. According to Bureau officials,  these changes are based on research that shows that estimates based  on some methods and records (e.g., births, deaths, and migration) are  substantially more accurate than estimates based on others. The rules  vary for different levels of government\u2014subcounty, county or equivalent,  and state.", "Subcounty. Under the new rules, subcounty governments should use  building, demolition, and mobile home permits, and group quarter counts  to challenge population estimates.

Under the changes, county governments and  their equivalents should use birth and death records, immigration data,  and group quarters counts to challenge population estimates\u2014a  significant reduction in the types of records from what the Bureau has  historically accepted. According to Bureau officials, research conducted  over the past several years has demonstrated that county-level estimation  methods based on other data sources do not produce, on average, as  accurate estimates of population. Consequently, the Bureau plans to  reject county-level challenges relying on other data sources. Under the  changes, the Bureau will only accept county-level challenges to either the  accuracy of the data the Bureau itself used when producing estimates or  to whether the Bureau carried out its estimation procedures properly,  such as in handling data files properly or carrying out calculations. Bureau  officials acknowledged that local governments might see this reduction in  the scope of permissible county-level challenges as being too restrictive,  as evidenced by some public comments submitted in response to the  proposed changes. Bureau officials stated that they will continue their  dialogue with representatives of the Federal-State Cooperative for  Population Estimates\u2014a partnership between the Bureau and state  governments\u2014and other researchers about improving methods of  estimating population, and may revisit the structure of the challenge  program if future research demonstrates that an alternative method of  estimating county population consistently outperforms that used by the  Bureau. Figure 1 shows changes in the types of administrative records  accepted by the challenge program.", "State. The Bureau will generally no longer permit state governments to  submit their own challenges. Bureau officials stated that counties and  cities are the most appropriate entities to submit a population challenge  for their community because they have greater knowledge of their  population. Bureau officials also said that they want to avoid situations  where a state may challenge estimates for communities where respective  local governments disagree with such challenges. The Bureau will allow  states to submit challenges for counties or equivalents where there is no  seat of government, such as in certain New England states and in parts of  Alaska, but will otherwise require all communities affected by a challenge  to have their government communicate directly with the Bureau."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Changes to Procedures are Intended to Improve Accuracy of Population Estimates", "paragraphs": ["The changes to procedures are intended to improve the accuracy of  revisions to population estimates stemming from challenges.

Previously, successful subcounty challenges were  added to respective county-level populations. The Bureau justifies the  change with its research demonstrating that its method for estimating the  county population that lives in housing is generally better than the method  typically used to challenge subcounty estimates. According to Bureau  officials, the method used to challenge subcounty estimates introduced  an upward bias for communities that were experiencing population  decline or a slowing of population growth. According to the change, any  challenge that results in an increase to the estimate of a subcounty  community\u2019s population living in traditional housing will be offset by a  downward revision to the estimate for all other communities in the same  county, in effect reallocating the estimated population within the county.  Bureau officials emphasized that under the new procedures, as before, if  a government successfully challenges the Bureau\u2019s estimate of the  population living in group quarters arrangements within its community, the  revision will be added to the county population as well, and will not be  offset by changes to populations in other communities in the county.", "The Bureau also changed procedures so that it routinely reviews  subcounty population challenges in light of each community\u2019s population  growth trend, requiring corroborating information when a government  claims population growth that is inconsistent with the trend. For example,  one local government in the Midwest successfully challenged the  Bureau\u2019s 2006 population estimate and received an increased population  estimate of about 5.5 percent, even though evidence it submitted showed  the number of housing units in the community was about 3.5 percent  lower than the Bureau\u2019s original calculation for that year. Another local  government successfully challenged the Bureau\u2019s 2007 population  estimate and received an increased population estimate of about 7.4  percent, even though its evidence showed an increase in housing units of  only about 0.8 percent. According to 2010 Census counts in both of these  cases, the average actual annual population growth over the decade was  far below the challenge result, and the trend in population was declining.

Also missing were notices to local  governments from the Bureau on whether challenges were accepted. A  lack of documentation could make it difficult for an independent  verification of the integrity of the program. We discussed these  documentation issues with Bureau officials.

In particular, the Bureau is  considering how it can more seamlessly integrate regular input from local  government address lists and related geographic information systems into  its existing address list and map development processes. The Bureau  would like to update this information continuously rather than wait to  receive the input as part of a one-time decennial update.

The officials stated that while it is important to  continue research on local records, because they may be helpful in  targeting decennial operations to hard-to-count groups or those in certain  geographic areas, the results of 2010 Census research and testing on  national records has led Bureau officials to conclude that continuing  research on national records, such as those listed in figure 2, should be a  higher priority. Bureau officials believe that research on the more broadly  available national records could yield cost savings more quickly than  research on locally available records, and that given resource constraints,  they should attempt to \u201clock in\u201d at least some of the more likely cost  savings before pursuing more uncertain ones.
