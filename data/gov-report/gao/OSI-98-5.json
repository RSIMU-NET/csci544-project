Medicare home health costs averaged about a 33-percent per-year growth from 1989 to 1996\u2014from about $2 billion to almost $18 billion.

These principles authorize Medicare intermediaries to reimburse home health care providers their reasonable costs of serving beneficiaries when those claimed costs are found to be necessary, proper, actual, and related to patient care. In this regard, providers certify that they are familiar with the laws and regulations regarding the provision of health care services and that the services identified were provided in compliance with such laws and regulations.", "Mid-Delta Home Health is one of the largest home health care providers in Mississippi.

In a similar case involving an unrelated home health agency, HCFA formally ruled that \u201ccontributions\u201d returned to the provider in the form of deductions from employees\u2019 salaries had reduced the provider\u2019s costs and therefore had been improperly claimed for Medicare reimbursement. Following the provider\u2019s appeal, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi upheld HCFA\u2019s decision, concluding that, under Medicare regulations, the contributions qualified as refunds of salary, thus reducing the company\u2019s salary expense. The court also noted that Medicare reimbursement was limited to costs incurred.

For the June-August 1997 period, Mid-Delta nurses visited the patient twice a week for these conditions. However, the intermediary noted that the patient\u2019s condition as noted in the plan of care showed the necessity for only one visit a month. In addition, the June-August 1997 plan of care for a diabetic patient with hypertension ordered weekly skilled nursing visits for these conditions. However, the intermediary noted in the review of the patient\u2019s plan of care that the patient needed only monthly skilled nursing visits for bloodwork. Weekly visits were not reasonable and necessary.", "Lack of documentation in plans of care to justify the need for home health services. The plan of care for a diabetic Mid-Delta patient stated that the patient was unable to fill his syringes accurately, necessitating skilled nursing visits. However, the intermediary could find no documentation to support a reason for the patient\u2019s inability. In addition, another patient, having been visited for 6 years, was prescribed a new drug in late April 1997, necessitating twice-a-week visits for 4 weeks. However, the intermediary\u2019s review noted that the patient\u2019s June-August 1997 plan of care still called the medication \u201cnew.\u201d The plan of care, according to the intermediary\u2019s review, included no documentation to indicate the need for continued skilled nursing visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provision of Services to Patients With Questionable Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["Mid-Delta nurses; the intermediary, after a preliminary review of patient data; and we concluded that Mid-Delta was providing services to patients whose eligibility was questionable.", "Some of the Mid-Delta Home Health patients we visited or whose cases we reviewed did not appear to meet HCFA requirements that they be homebound.

Yet, Mid-Delta provided them Medicare-reimbursable home health care services.", "For example, one elderly Mid-Delta Home Health patient was in his yard moving a 5-foot section of a telephone pole when we visited. The patient\u2019s actions contradicted Mid-Delta\u2019s patient records, relied on by the intermediary for eligibility determinations, that indicated that the patient had poor endurance, ambulated with a cane, and appeared homebound. Another Mid-Delta patient, under home health care for about 2 years, received skilled nursing visits twice a week to monitor her blood pressure and a heart condition. However, when we visited her, she was conducting a child care service in her home with four children, aged approximately 2 to 5 years. The intermediary stated, when we asked about this situation, that such activity meant that the Mid-Delta patient was most likely ineligible for home health care. A third homebound patient told us that he regularly walked 2 to 3 miles a day. Some other patients in our investigation also left their homes on a regular basis\u2014whether walking or driving\u2014for such activities as visits to a neighbor, store, bank, or post office.", "With regard to issues of home health care eligibility and services, we have reported in the past that few Medicare home health claims are subject to medical review, Medicare beneficiaries are rarely visited by fiscal intermediaries, and the physicians of record have limited involvement in home health care.
