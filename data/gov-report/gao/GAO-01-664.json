Since that time, as reported in the U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 statistical reports, the balance of outstanding criminal debt has  grown from $260 million to over $13 billion (see figure 1). The Congress  attempted to address some of these problems through the Criminal Fines  Improvement Act of 1987 when it transferred the responsibility for  accounting for and processing criminal debt from Justice to the courts and  gave them the responsibility for establishing a centralized accounting  system (see appendix II, \u201cHistory of Criminal Debt Collection Legislation\u201d).  In 1990, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC)  began developing a centralized entity, called the National Fine Center  (NFC) to record, track, and report on federal criminal debt. The NFC was  expected to automate and centralize criminal debt processing for the 94  federal judicial districts and provide a management information system to  replace the existing fragmented approach for receiving payments and  alleviate long-standing weaknesses in accounting for, collecting, and  reporting on criminal monetary penalties imposed on federal criminals.", "However, after several years of developing a National Fine Center that was  criticized by GAO and the Congress, the AOUSC engaged an independent  consulting firm in February 1996 to perform a full review of the project.  The consulting firm concluded that the task of developing a National Fine  Center, involving several agencies in two branches of government, proved  to be more complex than expected and that the needs of the districts could  not be met through a centralized approach. Thus, with the consent of the  Congress, the NFC was terminated. As such, the criminal debt collection  process continues to be fragmented, involving both judicial and executive  branch entities in 94 districts across the country.", "Also, around the time of the consultant\u2019s report, the Mandatory Victims  Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA) was enacted, requiring that restitution be  assessed at the full amount regardless of an offender\u2019s ability to pay. Since  that time the balance of reported uncollected criminal debt has increased  dramatically. Reported uncollected criminal debt has more than doubled  from about $5.6 billion as of September 30, 1995, to approximately  $13 billion as of September 30, 1999, with about 66 percent of that amount  attributed to restitution owed to nonfederal parties. The collectibility rate  however has not increased proportionally."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Criminal debt arises when a court orders an offender to pay fines and/or  restitution as part of the punishment for violating a federal criminal law.  Unless the offender immediately pays the debt, Justice is responsible for  enforcing its collection. Justice has delegated this responsibility to its  Financial Litigation Units (FLU) in the United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices  (USAO) across the country. As of September 30, 1999, the Executive Office  for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) database reflected approximately  $13.1 billion in reported outstanding criminal debt, of which about $5.6  billion (or 43 percent) was accounted for by the four districts we visited  (see figures 2 and 3 for a breakout of the major types of criminal debt  involved).", "Each of the 94 districts has a USAO, an executive branch agency, and a  U.S. district court that includes district judges, a clerk\u2019s office, and a  probation office within the judicial branch of government. The districts  operate independently from one another with guidance provided by the  offices indicated in table 1.", "In addition to general guidance provided by Justice, the Judicial  Conference, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC), each district  office develops supplemental guidance for criminal debt collection  procedures. Within each district, the USAO, probation office, and the  clerk\u2019s office enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that  documents how criminal debt collection activities will be accomplished.  Each of the USAOs also has a Financial Litigation Plan that details district  guidance on collecting criminal debt.

The country is divided  into 94 federal judicial districts, with a federal district court in each district.  Each of the 94 districts is located in one of 12 regional circuits, and each  circuit has a Court of Appeals.", "After the USAO obtains the conviction of an offender, the court issues a  Judgment in a Criminal Case (JCC), which details terms of the sentence  and orders the payment of a fine and/or restitution, if applicable. To assist  judges in determining the fine and/or restitution amount, a probation  officer prepares and provides to the court a pre-sentence report that  includes financial information related to an offender\u2019s ability to pay a fine  and information related to victims\u2019 losses. In preparing the pre-sentence  report, probation officers are to use financial information obtained from  the investigating agency, the trial, and the offender. In deciding whether to  assess a fine and, if so, the amount to assess, courts are to consider an  offender\u2019s income, earning capacity, and financial resources; the potential  burden placed on an offender\u2019s family; and any restitution or other  obligations that the offender is required to make. For example, if large  amounts of restitution are ordered, the assessment of fines is typically  waived based on the offender\u2019s inability to pay a fine.", "USSC guidelines provide guidance on the minimum and maximum fine  amounts for the U.S. courts to impose based on the offense. The statute  requires the court to order the payment of a fine immediately unless, in the  interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or in  installments. According to the guidelines and the statute, judges may  consider whether paying the fine in a lump-sum would have an unduly  severe impact on the offender or any dependents, and if so, should  establish an installment schedule for paying the fine. The installments  should be in equal monthly payments over the period established by the  court, unless the court establishes another schedule. The length of time  over which scheduled payments should be made is the shortest time in  which full payment can reasonably be made, generally not to exceed 12  months. In addition, judges may waive fines if they believe that offenders  will be unable to pay and are unlikely to become able to pay (e.g., if they  are sentenced to life in prison or cannot afford to hire private counsel).", "Judges may also order restitution to be paid to the victims of a crime. In  accordance with statute, before MVRA was enacted in April 1996, the court  typically waived or reduced the restitution amount based on the offender\u2019s  ability to pay. However, under MVRA, the court typically must order  restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s loss, without  regard to an offender\u2019s economic situation. If the court believes that an  offender cannot immediately or fully pay the restitution amount in the  foreseeable future, the court can order the offender to make nominal  installment payments.", "In some districts, judges must set the payment schedules and document  them in the JCC, and in other districts, judges can delegate to probation  officers the authority to set payment schedules. However, within the last  few years, more judges have been required to establish payment schedules  as a result of several circuit court decisions that have affected policies in  this area. For example, some circuit courts have held that courts are  prohibited from ordering a defendant to pay criminal fines or restitution in  accordance with a payment schedule set by a probation officer or a prison  official because the setting of a payment schedule is an inherently judicial  function that may not be delegated to others. In addition, some circuit  courts have prohibited the imposition of an immediate payment order of  the entire amount unless the defendant can pay the entire amount  immediately. Finally, some circuit courts have interpreted the MVRA to require the court to set the payment schedule in all cases at sentencing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criminal Debt Collection Process", "paragraphs": ["After the assessment process, the criminal debt collection process varies  depending on the other sentencing terms imposed on the offender. Figure 5  shows the typical post-MVRA criminal debt collection process.", "The FLUs within the USAOs\u2019 Civil Divisions have been delegated the  responsibility for collecting criminal debt. After receiving a JCC, the FLU  enters information from the JCC into the FLUs\u2019 case tracking system and  performs certain collection actions depending on such factors as the  amount of the debt. The FLUs\u2019 collection efforts include filing liens (based  on debtor\u2019s address or county of known residence), identifying debtor  assets, garnishing debtor wages, and serving notice of late payments. To  facilitate collection and reduce duplication of effort, the entities involved  with assessing and/or collecting criminal debt (investigative agencies,  prosecuting attorneys, and the courts) should share the financial  information they have obtained about the offender with the FLUs.", "Offenders are encouraged to participate in the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)  Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP). This program provides a  means of collecting voluntary periodic deductions from inmates\u2019 wages  earned from a prison occupation. The amounts are generally small and are  deducted periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or semiannually). When  released from prison or as ordered by the judge at sentencing, the offender  is assigned to a probation officer. If the criminal debt has not been paid, the  probation officer or the court, depending on the district, should establish  an installment schedule for payment. Probation officers may restrict  offenders from performing certain activities, such as traveling outside the  district, if they are not making their required payments. Probation officers  may also request that the court revoke supervision (i.e., send an offender  to prison) if the offender is willfully refusing to make payments.", "Since, as noted above, the NFC effort did not succeed, the FLUs in each  district maintain their own databases to meet their enforcement  responsibilities. Restitution payments from offenders in most districts are  submitted to the clerk\u2019s office. The clerk\u2019s office records these payments  and provides a copy of the payment information to the FLUs so that they  can update their databases. Most criminal fines are paid to the clerk\u2019s office  and deposited into Justice\u2019s Crime Victims Fund, which provides grants for  victim assistance programs and compensation to victims.", "Payments for restitution assessed after MVRA are paid to and disbursed by  the clerk\u2019s office; however, the handling of payments and disbursements for  pre-MVRA restitution vary by district. In 18 districts, the clerk\u2019s office  accepts only post-MVRA restitution payments; therefore, the FLUs in these  districts maintain an additional system to receive pre-MVRA restitution  payments from offenders and to disburse payments received to applicable  victims. Restitution is often owed to many victims, and disbursements must  be prorated based on the amounts owed to each victim. The clerk\u2019s office  disburses checks to victims, whereas the FLU uses an independent  financial institution to receive payments and disburse checks to victims.

These four districts\u2014the Central District of  California, the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, and the  Southern District of Florida\u2014accounted for $5.6 billion (or 43 percent) of  the over $13 billion of outstanding criminal debt as of this date. At these  four districts, we reviewed all 44 cases greater than or equal to $14 million,  which accounted for $3.7 billion (or 66 percent) of the $5.6 billion. We also  selected and reviewed 35 random criminal debt cases with a dollar value of  $5,000 or greater but less than $14 million at each of the four districts (for a  total of 140 random cases); thus, we had a total of 184 cases selected for  our review.

Criminals may not be willing to comply  with the law, and forcing compliance is difficult because criminals are  already convicted felons who may be serving time in prison or may have  been deported. Moreover, offenders in prison have limited earning capacity,  and so potential collections are limited. In 57 percent of the high-dollar  cases we reviewed and in an estimated 20 percent of our sampled  population, the offender was still in prison. Further, significant time may  pass between an offender\u2019s arrest and sentencing, giving offenders time to  hide fraudulently obtained assets, such as funds in offshore accounts, shell  corporations, or family members\u2019 names and accounts.", "Even though the courts are required to consider an offender\u2019s ability to pay  when assessing fines, collection cannot always be assured. Fines are  sometimes assessed to make a statement about the nature of the crime and  its impact on society. Restitution, as discussed below, is typically assessed  without regard to an offender\u2019s ability to pay; therefore, collection may be  unrealistic.", "Asset seizure and forfeiture are important components of law enforcement  efforts to deprive criminals of the proceeds and instruments of their  crimes. Several years may pass between an offender\u2019s arrest and  sentencing. Federal laws authorize agencies to seize assets before a  criminal conviction, thereby potentially overcoming one difficulty in  collecting fines and restitution\u2014defendants diverting their assets before  conviction. However, the FLUs are not permitted to pursue liquidation of  assets for debt collection until after an offender is convicted and  sentenced.", "Proceeds from forfeiture are typically used to make owners (e.g., a  mortgager) whole and to fund law enforcement activities, and are not  necessarily used to fulfill restitution orders. Therefore, the use of  forfeiture, as we reported in June 1994, could decrease amounts that might  otherwise be available for paying restitution to crime victims and reducing  outstanding criminal debt. According to Justice statistics, of the estimated  $536 million of forfeited cash and property recovered during fiscal year  1999, approximately $39 million (or 7 percent) was applied to restitution in  victim-related offenses. The remaining amounts were either converted to  cash and used for law enforcement purposes or retained for official law enforcement use. In our case reviews, only 2 of the 44 high-dollar cases  provided that the proceeds from the sale of assets be used to pay  restitution. None of the JCCs for the random cases stated such terms. In the  2 high-dollar cases, the JCCs specifically stated that the proceeds of the  sale of seized and forfeited assets should be used to pay victims.", "Finally, according to 18 U.S.C. 3613, most criminal debts must remain \u201con  the books\u201d for 20 years plus the period of incarceration and cannot be  \u201cwritten off\u201d until the statute of limitations expires, the debtor is deceased,  or the court approves a petition of remission filed by the USAO. Therefore,  even if Justice determines that certain debts are not collectible, these debts  must remain \u201con the books,\u201d and the FLUs must periodically reassess their  collectibility in accordance with USAO policies (see chapter 3) regardless  of the status of the offender or previous actions to collect these debts. For  example, in accordance with USAO policies, a $30,000 debt must be  reassessed annually even if the FLU was unsuccessful in previous attempts  to identify assets and the offender is serving a sentence of life in prison.", "The U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Manual states that if the FLU determines that a fine will  likely never be collected, it can seek a petition for remission of all or part  of a fine from the judge. According to the Manual, seeking remission is  preferable to placing it \u201cin suspense\u201d and continuing to pursue collection.  However, we found no evidence that the FLU had requested a petition for  remission in the cases we reviewed, even though some cases appear to  have met the criteria for remission. According to FLU officials, obtaining a  court order to write off delinquent debt is a time-consuming process and is  not considered a priority among the many other tasks (e.g., working on  open cases) the FLUs must perform."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Mandatory Restitution", "paragraphs": ["Before the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), the  assessment of restitution, like the assessment of fines, was typically based  on an offender\u2019s ability to pay. However, MVRA requires that assessment of  restitution be based on actual loss and not on the offender\u2019s ability to pay.  Assessments of restitution have significantly increased since the passage of  the act. As of September 30, 1995, approximately $3.4 billion (102,158  cases) in criminal debts was owed to the federal government in fines and  federal restitution and about $2.2 billion (15,126 cases) was owed in  nonfederal restitution. Although federal and nonfederal criminal debt  amounts have increased from September 30, 1995, to September 30, 1999,  the increase for nonfederal debt (i.e., restitution) is far greater (see figure  7).", "When assessed amounts are not based on an offender\u2019s ability to pay, the  likelihood of collecting the full amount may be unrealistic. For example, in  addition to each offender receiving a 240-year prison sentence, the four  offenders convicted of bombing the World Trade Center were each ordered  to pay $250 million in restitution plus fines ranging from $250,000 to  $4.5 million. These four cases alone increased the criminal debt balance by  over $1 billion. All four offenders refused to provide financial information  and, as of May 2000, these offenders had collectively only paid  approximately $3,000. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that a  significant portion of the restitution owed by these offenders will be  collected. In another example, an offender was convicted in March 1997 of  conspiracy, mail fraud, and tax evasion; sentenced to 20 years  imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release; and ordered to pay a fine  of $1 million and restitution of over $475 million. FLU records show that as  of September 30, 1999, the offender had paid only $25. FLU records also  show the offender refused to participate in the Inmate Financial  Responsibility Program. Before sentencing, the offender also refused to  provide the probation officer with a personal financial statement that  would identify income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Other work by the  probation officer, including obtaining a credit report, doing an online  property search, and reviewing tax return information, did not disclose  assets available to pay down the debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Payment Schedules Set by Judges", "paragraphs": ["In some districts, the judges may delegate the authority to set payment  terms to probation officers. In those districts where it has been held that  the courts may not delegate the authority to set payment schedules  (including two of the districts we visited), judges must include them in the  JCC. We found that the payment schedules set by judges can significantly  influence collection efforts. EOUSA and FLU officials we interviewed  indicated they believe that when a judge orders specific payment schedules  in the JCC, they are precluded from making any collection efforts (other  than filing a lien), such as pursuing liquidation of assets, until an offender is  released from probation. However, the view of AOUSC officials and the  Chief Judge in one of these districts is that the inclusion of payment  schedules in the JCC does not preclude the FLU from identifying and  pursuing assets but merely sets a minimum amount that must be paid while  an offender is under supervision. The EOUSA and FLU interpretation  inhibits the FLUs from taking prompt collection efforts, and the  government may lose opportunities to collect criminal debt.", "In 16 of the 44 high-dollar and 41 of the 140 random cases we reviewed,  judges stipulated terms in the JCCs regarding how or when fines or  restitution should be paid; in the remaining cases, the fine or restitution  was due immediately (see table 2 for terms stipulated in our selected  cases). In the cases where judges stipulated payment terms, we found that  the FLUs typically wait until after the offender is released from prison and  probation before performing collection actions (e.g., searching for and  liquidating assets). As a result of such delays, opportunities to maximize  collections may be missed.", "As we reported in 1999, the payment schedules set by judges vary by  district. For example, in 1 of the high-dollar cases and in 17 random cases,  including 13 random cases selected from the Eastern District of New York,  the judges stipulated that the amount was not due until the offender was  released from prison. In these instances, the FLUs typically do not perform  any collection actions other than filing a lien. In 2 high-dollar and 10  random cases, 9 of which were from the Southern District of New York,  judges established a payment schedule based on a percentage of gross  income to be paid on a periodic basis (e.g., 10 percent of gross monthly  income to be paid monthly). In 8 high-dollar and 3 random cases from the  Central District of California, the judge established a minimum amount that  must be paid on a periodic basis (e.g., at least $300 to be paid each month).  We found that probation officers typically did not recommend an increase  in payment amounts, and the FLUs typically did not attempt to increase  them or pursue liquidation of assets, even if financial circumstances  improved. The following examples show the effects of terms being  stipulated in the JCCs.", "In one case, in February 1998, an offender was convicted of bank fraud  and ordered to pay $113 million in restitution jointly and severally with  coparticipants through quarterly payments of at least $2,400. Since the  payment schedule was specified in the order and the offender was  making the minimum payments, neither the FLU nor the probation  officer recommended or attempted to pursue the net proceeds of  $80,000 from the sale of her house and $19,200 from the sale of two cars.  While on probation, the offender was permitted to move to another  country with court approval. As of February 2001, clerk records show  that this offender had paid $28,800 and all coparticipants combined had  paid less than $100,000.", "Another offender was convicted of wire fraud, sentenced in November  1997 to 6 months of home detention to be served concurrently with 3  years of probation and ordered to pay over $74 million in restitution  jointly and severally with coparticipants. The judge ordered the  defendant to make quarterly payments of at least $750 after she  completed home detention. Based on financial statements the offender  provided, her pre-sentence report showed that she had over $40,000 in  unencumbered assets and $5,000 of unsecured debt, resulting in a net  worth of over $35,000. The probation office had not recommended the  pursuit of liquidation, nor had the FLU attempted liquidation of any  assets owned by the offender. According to the FLU, because the judge  included the payment schedule in the judgment, the FLU will not pursue  collection until after the offender is released from supervision. As of  April 2000, the offender had paid $6,000.", "In April 1998, another offender in our selection was convicted of  conspiracy to commit mail fraud and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine in  quarterly installments over a 3-year probation period even though just  before his sentencing, the offender reported $5,000 in cash, $12,400 in  his checking account, and over $100,000 of equity in his home. In this  example, it appears that the offender may have had the ability to pay his  whole fine or a significant portion of it immediately; however, since the  judge set a payment schedule in the JCC, neither the FLU nor the  probation office reassessed the offender\u2019s ability to pay or pursued a  lump-sum payment.

The four FLUs we visited did  not have effective policies and procedures or did not always follow their  policies and procedures to ensure that collection actions were prompt and  adequate for increasing the potential for collecting the maximum amount  of criminal debt. In addition, the four probation offices we visited did not  always follow their procedures that could have allowed for increased  collections from offenders under supervision.

For example, in 48 percent of the high-dollar cases and in an estimated  66 percent of the sampled population we found no evidence that the FLU  attempted to identify the debtor\u2019s assets.

For example, we found only one case in which the FLU garnished  wages. According to FLU officials, enforcement techniques are not pursued  until the FLU determines that an offender has assets or sufficient earnings  and is willfully not paying amounts owed. However, as noted above, the  FLU is performing limited asset discovery work to determine whether  assets do exist that could be pursued, as indicated in the example where  the FLU performed an asset search in May 2000, 5 years after the offender\u2019s  release from supervision, and only after the case had been selected for our  review. Based on that search, the FLU scheduled a deposition with the  offender to determine whether there were assets that could be liquidated.  In another example, an offender was convicted of embezzlement, false  imprisonment, and tax evasion and was sentenced in 1998 to 20 months of  imprisonment and 3 years of probation. The offender was also ordered to  pay approximately $67,000 in restitution in monthly installments of at least  10 percent of gross monthly income.

Although  the offender reported having significant assets on his financial submission  for use in preparing the pre-sentence report, the probation officer did not  recommend a significant partial payment. Instead, the probation officer  established a $25-per-month installment schedule which the offender  stopped paying after he was released from probation. Even if the offender  had continued to make these payments, it would have taken over 1,000  years for the debt to be paid off.", "We also found that probation officers used arbitrary methods, such as  negotiated amounts and good-faith payments, to establish the installment  payment schedules, instead of linking them to income, expenses, or other  financial criteria as required. For example, an offender who was ordered to  pay $5,900 in restitution entered into a payment agreement with the  probation office that called for $10 monthly payments, even though  financial submissions indicated that the offender had a positive monthly  cash flow (income minus necessary monthly expenses) of about $360. At a  rate of $10 a month, it would take the offender over 49 years to pay off the  debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Installment Schedules", "paragraphs": ["Offenders under supervision are to submit to their probation officers (1) monthly supervision reports listing income and necessary expenses and  (2) on a less frequent basis, updated personal financial statements.

However, we found that  probation officers did not follow their guidelines for reviewing an  offender\u2019s financial circumstances. Following the guidelines could have  allowed for increased installment payments for 1 of the 13 high-dollar and  12 of the 77 random cases in which an installment schedule had been  established by either the probation officer or the judge. We also found that  in the cases in which the judge set a minimum amount that must be paid or  set other payment terms, probation officers typically did not recommend  increased payment amounts or liquidation of assets, even if an offenders\u2019  financial circumstances improved (see examples and related discussion in  chapter 2).", "For example, for the offender with the $25-per-month payment, the  probation officer did not attempt to increase the amount even though the  offender reported (1) significant assets on his financial submission for use  in preparing the pre-sentence report, (2) ownership of two vehicles (a 1990  Lexus and a 1991 Ford Bronco), (3) a net positive cash flow on his monthly  reports, and (4) bank accounts without listed balances. In another  example, an offender was convicted of mail fraud, sentenced in 1998 to 3  years of probation, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $12,000.  The judge ordered restitution to be paid in $100 quarterly payments (i.e.,  $33 per month) unless modified by the probation officer. For the July 1999  reporting period, 9 months after being sentenced, the offender reported a  positive monthly cash flow of over $1,500; however, the probation officer  did not recommend that the payment amount be increased. Not adequately  monitoring an offender\u2019s financial circumstance results in missed  opportunities to seek an increase in an offender\u2019s installment payments.", "Probation officers have considerable leverage over an offender under  supervision and can take actions if offenders are not making agreed-upon  installment payments. For example, probation officers can withhold  consent for a debtor to travel outside the district, or they can seek to  revoke probation. Even though installment payments typically range from  $25 to $100 per month, offenders do not always make the agreed-upon  installment payments. In several cases, we found no evidence that  probation officers took action to enforce the installment schedules (i.e.,  sought to revoke probation and send the offender back to prison) when the  offender failed to make agreed-upon installment payments. Probation  officers indicated that they must prioritize their time in light of the number  of offenders they are supervising. They stated that their first priority is to  ensure that offenders do not engage in criminal activity or violate other  terms of probation (e.g., are not using drugs during the probation period).", "However in a couple of instances, we found that when probation officers  recommended against an offender being released from probation based on  nonpayment of criminal debt in accordance with an established installment  schedule, the judges rejected the recommendations. For example, in April  1999, a judge for one of our sample cases granted an offender an early  release from probation even though the probation office had recommended  against the release stating that the offender, who had been convicted of  mail fraud in April 1997 and ordered to pay $175,000 in restitution, had not  made sufficient restitution payments.

In addition, we found that FLUs typically were not  monitoring the collection efforts of probation officers, as advised by the  U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Manual, and that, contrary to district procedures, probation  officers were not informing FLUs of an offender\u2019s upcoming release from  probation.

The OIG  recommended that a formal national requirement be established for  prosecuting attorneys to provide debtor financial information to the FLU  staff after an offender has been sentenced. However, based on our case file  reviews, we found that sharing financial information with the FLUs  continues to be a problem in the four districts we visited. Specifically, in  52 percent of the high-dollar cases and in an estimated 61 percent of the  sampled population, we found no evidence in the FLU files of  correspondence with the investigating case agents or prosecuting  attorneys.

For example, an offender in our sample reported over $420,000 of  net worth in a personal financial statement dated September 1989 that was  used by the probation office to prepare the pre-sentence report. In another  example, prior to sentencing, an offender provided a bank statement  showing a balance of over $73,000; however, there was no evidence that  actions were taken to pursue these funds.

However, district guidance for the four districts we visited states that the  FLUs are to assist the probation offices, if requested. During our reviews,  we found that the FLUs typically did not monitor collection efforts of  probation officers and that probation officers rarely requested assistance  or notified the FLUs before an offender was released from probation. In  general, the FLUs did not pursue collection until they determined that an  offender had been released from probation.", "In commenting on our June 1998 report related to establishing offender\u2019s  payment schedules, the AOUSC stated that greater emphasis should be  placed on Justice\u2019s role in collecting fines and restitution because Justice  has primary responsibility for collecting criminal debt. We believe that the  current district guidance, which states that FLUs should assist if requested,  adversely affects the FLUs\u2019 ability to enforce debt collection and puts them  in a reactive instead of a proactive role.", "For example, in March 1989, an offender was ordered to pay $26 million in  restitution to hundreds of investors who had invested in the offender\u2019s  fraudulent company. In April 1995, the offender was released from prison  and in 1997 made several payments before moving to a different district. In April 1999, he agreed to make $500 monthly payments to one of the  financial institutions he owed money to plus 50 percent of the income from  future speaking engagements and 100 percent of the income from the  \u201cmovie rights\u201d he sold pertaining to a published novel he wrote. As of June  2000, the FLU had not pursued collection because, according to the FLU,  the offender is \u201cunder the supervision of probation,\u201d and the probation  office had not requested its assistance. There have been no recorded  payments since 1997. An Internet search that we performed revealed that  the offender is involved in many activities from which he is most likely  deriving additional income, including publications, a spot on a radio  program, and a full-time salary.", "Several months before an offender is to be released from probation with an  outstanding debt, procedures at the four districts we visited require  probation officers to notify the applicable FLU. However, there was rarely  evidence of such notification in the FLU\u2019s files. As we reported in chapter 3,  the FLU\u2019s tracking system does not adequately track the status of an  offender; consequently, unless the probation officer notifies the FLU, the  FLU will not always know when an offender is scheduled to be released  from supervision.

In these instances, there was no indication in the file that  the probation officer notified the FLU of the offender\u2019s release or the status  of the offender\u2019s criminal debt obligations, including the terms of the  installment agreement. For example, an offender was sentenced in October  1989 to 2 years in prison and 5 years of probation for income tax evasion.  The offender was also ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. During supervision,  the offender made over $17,000 in payments, with the last payment  occurring in September 1997, 1 month before the offender\u2019s release from  supervision.

Although  the courts are responsible for processing collections and disbursements for  most criminal debt, clerk\u2019s office officials have stated that they do not have  the systems in place to calculate required interest. Instead, the clerk\u2019s  offices rely on the FLUs\u2019 tracking systems to calculate interest, if assessed.  Posting information to these databases typically requires the exchange of  hardcopy information between the clerk and the FLU so that both  databases can be updated to properly reflect collections and  disbursements. The National Fine Center (NFC) was supposed to eliminate  this duplication; however, since the NFC effort failed (as noted in chapter  1), both entities continue to maintain separate systems for tracking  collections and disbursements.", "Highlighting this inefficiency is the fact that each month both entities must  post payments received from offenders participating in the Bureau of  Prisons (BOP) Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP), in which a  portion of prisoners\u2019 earnings is used to pay their outstanding debt.  Hundreds of inmates typically participate in the program. Monthly or  quarterly payments received from each inmate are generally small dollar  amounts, but they are collectively large in volume. For example, a typical  monthly report from BOP for the Eastern District of New York contains  about 400 inmate debt payments. Since both the FLU and the clerk\u2019s office  track payments, each entity must determine what debt balance (i.e., special  assessment, fine, or restitution) to apply these 400 payments to and then  post each payment. If the payment is for restitution, amounts collected  must be prorated to the victims (sometimes hundreds of victims) before  checks can be disbursed.", "Maintaining these separate, nonintegrated systems also places greater  emphasis on the need for timely coordination and communication so that  data in these systems are accurate and the information is timely. For the  cases we reviewed in which payments had been collected, there was  typically a delay between the time that the clerk posted a payment and the  time that the FLU posted the same payment. We also found that the FLUs  typically did not inform the clerk of payments they received, resulting in several significant differences in the payment records. For example, an  offender was convicted of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  Act (RICO) violations, wire fraud, and bribery and was sentenced in 1996 to  60 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release. The offender  was ordered to make restitution in the amount of $412 million. According  to clerk\u2019s office records, $3,050 had been paid as of September 30, 1999,  while FLU records showed that over $11.7 million had been paid as of the  same date. District guidance at the four districts we visited did not  specifically require the FLUs to notify the clerk\u2019s offices of payments they  received or require the FLUs and the clerks to periodically reconcile  payment data recorded in the two systems. Without timely notification of  payments received or periodic reconciliations, differences between the two  systems will continue to exist.", "We also identified inefficient practices involving the processing of  disbursements to victims. In 76 districts, the clerk\u2019s offices are receiving all  types of criminal debt payments from offenders and disbursing checks to  restitution victims; however, in 18 of the 93 USAOs, the FLUs receive  restitution payments from offenders for offenses that occurred before the  MVRA and are disbursing checks for restitution only to pre-MVRA victims.  Having these two entities in 18 of the districts perform similar functions  results in wasted resources. According to AOUSC officials, they are  working with the remaining clerk\u2019s offices to process pre-MVRA restitution.  In addition, the four clerk\u2019s offices we visited generally set a low or no  threshold amount for disbursing a check to a victim. As a result, we found  instances in which the clerk\u2019s office issued checks for less than $10 to  victims ranging from individuals to large financial institutions. In one  example, restitution was owed to several companies ranging from $500 to  $75,000. Once every month or so, checks were being disbursed to these  companies. In October 1998, 12 checks were issued ranging from 20 cents  to $62, and 4 of these checks were returned as undeliverable, including one  for 20 cents and another for 53 cents. Disbursing such small amounts is not  cost-effective unless these are the final checks to be issued (i.e., the  offender most likely will not be submitting additional payments)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Oversight Roles of OMB and Treasury", "paragraphs": ["Historically, management oversight of the criminal debt collection process  has been divided between the executive and judicial branches with Justice  responsible for enforcing collections and the courts responsible for  receipting and disbursement of collections.

The NFC was an attempt to automate  and centralize the criminal debt collection process, which would have  increased management oversight. However, since that effort was  terminated in 1996, as noted in chapter 1, the collection responsibilities  continue to be fragmented between Justice and the courts, with neither  having a central management oversight role.", "Moreover, neither OMB nor Treasury has identified the need to take an  active role in overseeing the federal government\u2019s process for collecting the  billions of dollars of outstanding criminal debt.

We believe that the involvement in the  task force of AOUSC and Treasury\u2014given Treasury\u2019s central agency role of  preparing the federal government\u2019s financial statements and implementing  DCIA\u2014is critical to the success of the task force.", "We recommended that one of the responsibilities of the task force be to  address issues in accounting for and reporting criminal debt. As we note in  the report, accounting standards require a receivable to be recognized once  amounts due to the federal government are assessed, net of an allowance  for uncollectible amounts. In addition, OMB guidance requires agencies to  provide accounting and management information for effective  stewardship, including resources entrusted to the government (e.g.,  nonfederal restitution). Treasury and OMB agreed that criminal debt  should be reported on either Justice\u2019s or the court\u2019s financial statements.  The courts did not specifically address accounting and reporting issues,  and Justice stated that it would not be proper to report criminal debt  receivables on Justice\u2019s financial statements and that it believes  administration and possession of the receivables is the responsibility of the  courts. Justice\u2019s comments related to this issue, plus the lack of a response  from AOUSC regarding their position on this issue, illustrate the need for  cooperation and coordination in the criminal debt collection area.", "We also recommended that OMB work with Justice and other executive  branch agencies, while the task force is being established, to report and/or  disclose criminal debt information in the agencies\u2019 financial statements and  to subject such information to audit. OMB disagreed with this  recommendation, stating that these reporting issues would be better  handled by the task force. In light of Justice\u2019s and OMB\u2019s responses, we  have deleted the recommendation for OMB to work with Justice and other  executive branch agencies, while the task force is being established, and  incorporated this recommendation into the task force recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Specific Comments", "paragraphs": ["Justice generally agreed with the premise of the report and recognized the  need for improvements in the criminal debt collection area. Justice also  agreed with 10 of our 12 recommendations specifically addressed to it and  partially agreed with the other 2. The AOUSC commented that most of our  recommendations directed to it had already been implemented and that it  is pursuing those related to working with Justice to refer eligible debt to  Treasury and reduce duplication of the recordkeeping function. Treasury  agreed with our recommendation specifically addressed to it regarding  assisting Justice and the courts in identifying eligible delinquent debt for  referral to Treasury.", "Justice and the AOUSC also commented on the methodology used to  develop the report findings. In addition, the AOUSC commented on the  focus of the report and on the lack of recognition given to actions the  courts have taken to improve the criminal debt collection process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Justice and AOUSC\u2019s Comments on Our Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Justice and AOUSC, in commenting on the methodology we used to select  and review cases, stated that closed cases (i.e., debts paid in full) should  have been reviewed and that many of the cases reviewed had already been  determined by Justice to be uncollectible debt and had been placed \u201cin  suspense.\u201d We disagree. To address the requestor\u2019s objectives of  determining the key reasons for the growth in reported uncollected  criminal debt and whether adequate processes exist to collect criminal  debt, we selected cases that involved debt amounts outstanding as of  September 30, 1999. Since we used debts outstanding as of September 30,  1999, many of which were more than 3 years old, ample time for collection  activity had passed before we reviewed the cases, enabling us to assess the  level of collection efforts performed. Reviewing closed cases or focusing  on those cases that had not been placed in suspense by the FLUs would not  have addressed why debts have not been collected nor would it have  provided a sound basis for determining whether there are adequate  processes for collecting criminal debt at the four districts visited.", "The amount of outstanding criminal debt continues to grow and has grown  substantially over the past several years. However, the collection rate for  fiscal years ending September 30, 1995 through 1999, has averaged about 7  percent. The report clearly points out that this is partly due to the  uncontrollable factors discussed in chapter 2, but also to the lack of  (1) adequate collection processes, (2) coordinated efforts to collect such  debt, and (3) management oversight. Thus, to determine why outstanding  amounts continue to increase, we selected and reviewed cases with the  largest outstanding debt balances as of September 30, 1999, at the four  districts with the largest amounts of outstanding debt including debts in  suspense as well as debts not in suspense. In addition, we reviewed a  stratified randomly selected sample of 35 cases in each of the four districts.  Selecting closed cases or cases that had not been placed in suspense would  have provided anecdotal information about successful collections, but  would not have addressed our objectives of determining the reasons for the  growth and determining whether adequate processes exist, especially given  the overall low collection rate.", "We also found that debts recorded as \u201cin suspense\u201d do not necessarily  represent amounts that are uncollectible. For example, even if offenders  were making monthly installment payments, the FLU must put either the  entire debt balance in suspense or none of the balance in suspense. In  addition, to determine why amounts had not been collected, regardless of  whether they were in suspense, we assessed the collection efforts that had  been performed and found that adequate steps, such as performing asset  discovery work, were not always taken or documented prior to the FLU\u2019s  placing such debts in suspense. Further, we found little evidence that  prosecutors and probation officers had shared financial information with  FLUs, thus potentially weakening the FLUs\u2019 ability to assess an offender\u2019s  ability to pay (i.e., determine collectibility).", "Justice also commented that many of the cases we reviewed involved  incarcerated debtors and pre-date existing criminal debt policies. We point  out in chapter 2 that incarceration may limit an offender\u2019s ability to pay  while in prison, however the high dollar cases we reviewed typically  involved debtors who had defrauded innocent victims of millions of  dollars, resulting in the large restitution amounts being owed. Although the  offender\u2019s earning potential may be limited while incarcerated, other debt  collection techniques such as identifying and pursuing assets, should be  performed. Further, as we point out in the report, only about 20 percent of  the stratified randomly selected cases involved offenders who were  incarcerated at the time of our review.", "In chapter 3 we point out that much of the outstanding criminal debt as of  September 30, 1999, involved cases that were over three years old.", "However, many of the procedures that should be used are typical debt  collection tools (e.g., filing liens, issuing demand letters) that should be  applied to effectively collect criminal debt. We found that the FLUs were  not always performing these procedures. In addition, we found that the  FLUs we visited were not always following their prescribed procedures for  reassessing an offender\u2019s ability to pay. Had these cases been revisited as  required, any new policies could have been applied to outstanding debts at  that time.", "Finally, AOUSC also questioned why cases under $5,000 were not reviewed.  Our review focused on the largest\u2013dollar cases ($14 million or greater) as  well as a stratified randomly selected sample of cases between $5,000 and  $14 million. We excluded those under $5,000, which, as shown in table 7 in  appendix I, comprised only $8.9 million of the $5.6 billion of outstanding  debt at the four districts visited, or less than 0.2 percent of the total dollar  amount of outstanding debt at such districts, an amount that we deemed  immaterial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice", "paragraphs": ["Justice agreed with 10 of the 12 recommendations specifically addressed to  it. In addition, Justice partially agreed with the other 2 recommendations,  which related to (1) requiring FLUs to use collectibility analyses to  prioritize criminal debt collection efforts on debt types deemed through  historical experience to be more collectible, and (2) adequately measuring  criminal debt collection performance against established goals. Justice  indicated that it is already performing the recommended functions,  however we believe that the intent of these 2 recommendations should be  further discussed so that additional improvements can be made in these  areas. As to performing a collectibility analysis, Justice stated that it is  already performing an analysis in accordance with its suspense policies.  However, we found that the FLUs\u2019 suspense policies are not the same as  performing an effective collectibility analysis since debts may be placed in  suspense without performing an adequate assessment of collectibility.  Also, having historical collectibility analyses would allow the FLUs to  prioritize new debts based on factors that indicate increased potential for  collections.", "Justice also stated that it is already measuring criminal debt collection  performance against established goals. However, it is our understanding  that these efforts focus on reporting collection activity and analyzing  collection practices, not on establishing goals and measuring performance  against such goals, as we recommend. In addition, we believe that  performing a collectibility analysis is an essential first step in adequately  setting goals and measuring performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts", "paragraphs": ["In addition to commenting on our methodology, the AOUSC commented  that the effect of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA)  should have received greater attention in the report and that the report  should give greater recognition to actions that the courts have already  taken to improve criminal debt collection. We believe that we have  provided sufficient balance in the report as evidenced by an entire chapter  devoted to uncontrollable factors, such as MVRA, that contribute to the  growth in outstanding criminal debt. This chapter precedes chapters  devoted to procedural and coordination issues so that the reader is made  aware of the significance of uncontrollable factors and the context in  which the adherence to required policies and procedures and coordination  of efforts take place. In addition, mandatory restitution is listed as a factor  in the transmittal letter at the beginning of this report and is discussed in  many places throughout the report.", "The AOUSC also commented that more recognition should be given to  actions it has taken to improve criminal debt collection. One such action  includes a comprehensive policy and procedural manual issued in  September 2000, several months after our district visits, and not widely  distributed until December 2000. In our report we point out that if the  AOUSC effectively implements its revised guidance related to  (1) developing pre-sentence reports, (2) establishing and monitoring  offenders\u2019 compliance with installment schedules, (3) providing financial  information reported in the pre-sentence report to the FLUs within an  established time frame after sentencing, and (4) notifying FLUs within an  established time frame before an offender is released from supervision,  then reported weaknesses in these areas are likely to be addressed. Since  the guidance was issued after our visits, we were not able to assess  whether these policies have been effectively implemented and have  therefore recommended that AOUSC ensure that such policies are  effectively implemented.", "Finally, AOUSC stated that it had implemented most of our  recommendations; however, the letter did not specifically address each  recommendation. While we recognize that the revised guidance should  help improve collections, the policies must be effectively implemented  before our recommendation is satisfied. The policy and procedural manual  does not address our recommendations to (1) revise the language in the  Judgment in a Criminal Case forms to clarify that payment terms  established by judges are minimum payments and should not prohibit or  delay collection efforts and (2) establish cost-effective thresholds for  disbursements made by check to victims for restitution payments. In  addition, we were not provided with details of additional actions taken by  the courts to address such recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
