Although NWS was able to operate within its appropriated level in fiscal year 1997, it had to operate with a smaller budget than 1996 and absorb increased costs. NWS referred to this difference in available funds as a budget \u201cshortfall.\u201d The objectives of our review, based on subsequent discussions with your offices, were to (1) describe the formulation and execution of the NWS fiscal year 1997 budget and (2) identify key events regarding NWS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 budget \u201cshortfall\u201d and efforts to address it.

NWS operations also support other agencies\u2019 missions and the nation\u2019s commercial interests. For example, NWS provides weather forecasts and warnings to support aviation and marine safety.", "To fulfill its mission, NWS uses a variety of systems and manual processes in collecting, processing, and disseminating weather data to and among its network of field offices and regional and national centers. Many of these systems and processes are outdated. NWS began a nationwide modernization program in the 1980s to upgrade observing systems, such as satellites and radars, and design and develop advanced computer workstations for weather forecasters. The goals of the modernization are to achieve more uniform weather services across the nation, improve forecasts, provide better detection and prediction of severe weather and flooding, permit more cost-effective operations through staff and office reductions, and achieve higher productivity.", "In conjunction with its modernization, NWS plans to restructure its field offices, reducing their number from 256 to 119. However, delays in implementing the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System have slowed progress in office restructuring. NWS now expects the modernization to be completed before the end of fiscal year 1999.", "In the past, we and others have identified several weaknesses in NWS\u2019 actions to modernize its operations and manage its information technology resources. In February 1995, we designated the NWS modernization as an area of high risk due to its cost, complexity, past problems, and criticality to the NWS mission. Because of continuing concerns over cost increases and schedule delays associated with the modernization, it remains in the high-risk category today.", "NOAA has also been plagued by financial management problems. For example, Commerce\u2019s Office of the Inspector General noted in February 1997 that NOAA could not provide all the financial information required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, or ensure the accuracy of certain components of financial information in its consolidated financial statements. The independent certified public accounting firm auditing NOAA\u2019s fiscal year 1996 financial statements was unable to express an opinion on these statements due to inadequacies in NOAA\u2019s accounting records and internal controls. The auditors identified 11 material weaknesses in NOAA\u2019s internal controls, including budgetary execution transactions that were not supported or reconciled. The auditors recommended that NOAA focus on communicating the importance of financial management and fiscal responsibility to its program offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To describe key events related to the formulation and execution of NWS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 budget, we examined guidance developed by OMB, including the communication of budget requests and apportionments, as well as congressional guidance provided in appropriation acts and accompanying congressional committee reports on the execution of NWS\u2019 budget. We also obtained and reviewed relevant budget documents for NWS, including its budget request and its requests for the reprogramming of funds.", "To identify key events regarding NWS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 budget \u201cshortfall\u201d and efforts to address it, we examined records of communication among NWS, NOAA, and Commerce, as well as communications to the Congress.

We also reviewed the audit report prepared by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Inspector General and an independent certified public accounting firm on NOAA\u2019s fiscal year 1996 financial statements, dated February 26, 1997.", "We performed our work at NOAA headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at NWS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, from July 1997 through January 1998. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Commerce or his designee.

This circular provides detailed guidance on the form and content of budget requests and the basis for making budget estimates. At NOAA, this guidance is supplemented by a budget handbook that reinforces many of the circular\u2019s principles.", "According to the NOAA handbook, the NOAA Comptroller with input from the NOAA components\u2014the National Weather Service; National Ocean Service; National Marine Fisheries Service; Oceanic and Atmospheric Research; and National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service\u2014prepares a draft budget request for departmental review and approval. NOAA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget request contained several appropriation accounts, including operations, research and facilities; construction; and fleet modernization, shipbuilding and conversion. The operations, research and facilities account, the largest appropriation, includes separate estimates for each of NOAA\u2019s components and provides the majority of their funding. This account contains no-year funding authority\u2014that is, its appropriation remains available for obligation for an indefinite period of time. There is no appropriation account specific to NWS.", "Table 1 provides a snapshot of the development of the NWS fiscal year 1997 budget. This process began when the department submitted a fiscal year 1997 budget request of nearly $2 billion to OMB for NOAA operations, research, and facilities, including a request of $693 million for NWS.", "OMB reviews each department and agency budget request based on presidential priorities and other factors and makes an initial proposal on how resources will be allocated. Departments and agencies are notified of OMB\u2019s initial resource allocation decisions about 2 months after making their initial budget submissions. This notification is commonly referred to as a \u201cpassback.\u201d Agencies may appeal their passbacks.", "The OMB passback to the Department of Commerce resulted in overall reductions for NOAA as well as a specific reduction of about $22 million for NWS\u2019 portion of NOAA\u2019s operations, research, and facilities request. As required by OMB Circular A-11, NOAA revised its budget request to bring it into accord with these decisions. Both OMB and NOAA budget preparation guidance instruct staff to support the ultimate request in the President\u2019s budget. In response to the passback, NWS revised its fiscal year 1997 budget to about $671 million, the amount contained in the President\u2019s budget request to the Congress.", "The final step in the budget formulation process is congressional review of the agency\u2019s budget and the enactment of appropriations. After holding hearings and deliberating on NOAA\u2019s budget request, the Congress reduced the amount for NOAA\u2019s operations, research, and facilities request by about $117 million and specified that NWS absorb about $33 million of the cut, resulting in a fiscal year 1997 budget for NWS of $638 million.", "After an agency\u2019s appropriation is enacted, the agency receives an apportionment from OMB. Apportionment and subsequent allotmentswithin the agency are established, often by calendar quarter and by program or major activity, to prevent obligations in a manner or at a pace that would result in the agency exceeding appropriated levels.", "As an agency executes its budget, it may feel changes from planned spending levels are needed. To allow for efficient and effective execution of agency budgets while still maintaining appropriate oversight of executive actions, the Congress has provided reprogramming guidelines that define when changes from planned spending levels require congressional notification. Reprogramming is the shifting of funds within an appropriation for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of appropriation. For example, to help address its budget \u201cshortfall,\u201d NWS requested a $7.9 million reprogramming of NOAA funds in April 1997.", "There are no governmentwide reprogramming guidelines; guidance varies among appropriation subcommittees. For example, the annual Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act typically provides that no funds are available for a reprogramming which results in, among other things, the creation of a new program; elimination of a program, project, or activity; or relocation of an office or employees unless the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress are notified 15 days in advance of the reprogramming.", "Appendix II contains a chronology describing the key events related to the formulation and execution of the NWS fiscal year 1997 budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Events Associated With NWS\u2019 Budget \u201cShortfall\u201d and Efforts to Address It", "paragraphs": ["Due to the reductions that OMB and, subsequently, the Congress made to NWS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 budget request, as well as inflation and other cost increases, NWS believed it had a budget \u201cshortfall.\u201d NWS officials felt that NWS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 budget was not sufficient to provide desired levels of services. NWS appeared to define its \u201cshortfall\u201d generally as the gap between its final 1997 budget (less a one-time program increase of $14 million for modernization and associated restructuring demonstration and implementation) and its 1996 budget adjusted for inflationary and other increased costs, such as pay raises."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Varying Amounts of Budget \u201cShortfall\u201d Were Reported to the Congress", "paragraphs": ["NOAA and NWS reported varying amounts to the Congress about the size of NWS\u2019 estimated budget \u201cshortfall.\u201d For example, after receiving its fiscal year 1997 appropriations, NOAA and NWS officials noted spending reductions of $27.5 million in a February 14, 1997, briefing to congressional staff. Two months later, in an April 4, 1997, briefing to congressional staff, NOAA noted spending reductions of $42.2 million. By May 1997, the reported \u201cshortfall\u201d had increased to $47.4 million. Table 2 shows the varying estimates of \u201cshortfall\u201d reported to the Congress and the changing components associated with each estimate.", "In a May 15, 1997, hearing before the Subcommittee on Science, Space and Technology, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, some Members of Congress indicated that they were confused by the varying amounts of reported budget \u201cshortfall.\u201d According to NOAA and NWS officials, the varying amounts provided to the Congress responded to specific questions asked at particular points in time and did not necessarily include all known elements of the \u201cshortfall.\u201d For example, although a January 3, 1997, NWS memorandum to NOAA mentioned the withholding of inflationary increases and a March 18, 1997, NWS memorandum to NOAA mentioned the increased NWS contribution for NOAA-wide support services, these elements of the \u201cshortfall\u201d were not provided to the Congress in the February 1997 and April 1997 briefings, respectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Variety of Measures Were Planned to Address the \u201cShortfall\u201d", "paragraphs": ["To address its budget \u201cshortfall,\u201d NWS planned a number of measures, both temporary and permanent.

According to a December 1997 NWS analysis, NWS reduced (1) contracts and services by $15.2 million, (2) rent, communications, and utilities by $9.4 million, (3) salaries and benefits by $4.4 million, (4) employee relocations by $3.6 million, and (5) travel by $3 million. It also deobligated prior year funds, primarily permanent change of station costs, by $6.6 million. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Commerce stated that NWS did not fill field office operational vacancies as they occurred throughout fiscal year 1997. This was done to enable NWS to place employees in available positions, thereby mitigating the negative impact of a planned major reduction-in-force. It further stated, however, that the longer these operational vacancies remained unfilled, the more critical the need to fill the positions became. As we will discuss in the next section, NWS also received congressional concurrence on a reprogramming request to NOAA, giving NWS $5.4 million that enabled it to restore funding to maintain its operational equipment and fund some personnel separation costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reprogramming Request and Certification Process Contributed to Confusion on \u201cShortfall\u201d", "paragraphs": ["Two key events to address the NWS budget \u201cshortfall\u201d appeared to cause confusion among department officials. The first event centers on an NWS reprogramming request to NOAA. According to an April 18, 1997, NWS schedule, NWS requested a reprogramming of $7.9 million to address its \u201cshortfall.\u201d This request was forwarded to the Department\u2019s Acting Chief Financial Officer by the NOAA Under Secretary on May 29, 1997.", "Our review of e-mail correspondence between the Counselor to the NOAA Under Secretary and an NWS Budget Analyst showed that there were several inquiries made about the status of the reprogramming request between May 6, 1997 to June 6, 1997, but there was no official communication that the request had been approved. However, the NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Operations assumed that the reprogramming request would be approved by Commerce and that funds were available to hire personnel to fill vacancies in the field that had been deferred because of the \u201cshortfall.\u201d This official told NOAA officials on June 13, 1997, that NWS intended to start filling critical field vacancies.", "On June 16, 1997, the NOAA Deputy Under Secretary informed the NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Operations that NWS could not fill the vacancies because it had a \u201cdeficit on the books.\u201d This was primarily because the reprogramming request had not yet been approved, which meant that funds NWS believed were available for new hires would need to be retained to pay for possible personnel separations. Indeed, the department\u2019s Acting Chief Financial Officer did not notify the Congress of the reprogramming request until July 3, 1997, nearly 3 months after the original request. By this time, the request for $7.9 million had been revised to $5.4 million because the department, based on input from NWS, determined that less money was needed to address personnel reductions associated with the streamlining of NWS. The Subcommittee on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, informed the department on July 16, 1997, that it had no objections to the reprogramming proposal.", "The second event involves NWS\u2019 effort to obtain certification approval from NOAA to consolidate, automate, and/or close weather service offices. On April 22, 1997, 4 days after NWS submitted the reprogramming request for $7.9 million, NWS forwarded 83 certification packages to the NOAA Under Secretary for approval. Section 706(b) of Public Law 102-567 specifies that the Secretary of Commerce must certify that consolidating, automating, and/or closing of field offices will not result in any degradation of service to the affected service areas. The NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Modernization told us that he briefed the Secretary of Commerce on this certification process on June 10, 1997.", "Upon learning that NWS would not be able to fill vacancies in the field because the aforementioned reprogramming request had not yet been approved, the NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Modernization recommended to the NOAA Deputy Under Secretary on June 20, 1997, that 27 of the 83 certification packages be held back. This was because the packages included about 27 affected areas whose responsible weather field offices contained vacancies. The NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Modernization stated that the vacancies, if left unfilled, would result in a degradation of services for the area served by that weather field office. The NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Modernization told us that he had assumed all along that these vacancies would be filled when the certification packages were forwarded to the NOAA Under Secretary for approval.", "Subsequent to the NWS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Modernization\u2019s recommendation, the NOAA Under Secretary did not take action on the 83 certification packages sent to him in 1997.

The NOAA Under Secretary claimed that NOAA had been receiving conflicting information from NWS on how it would provide essential weather services while recognizing that the public expects government agencies to reduce their costs. At the same time, the Under Secretary announced his intention to appoint an outside Special Advisor on Weather Services to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the NWS budget and operations.", "According to the Special Advisor\u2019s subsequent October 14, 1997, report to the Secretary of Commerce, Commerce and NOAA financial management information systems, coupled with NWS\u2019 complex budget structure, budget formulation/execution policies and management processes, limit visibility of operational and overhead costs and the traceability of these costs to products and services. The Secretary of Commerce later announced on October 23, 1997, that he plans to hire a chief financial officer for NWS to address the need for management and budget reforms. NOAA\u2019s Chief of Audit and Internal Control told us that the department is currently reviewing the position description for the NWS Chief Financial Officer and intends to advertise for it soon.", "Lastly, the Special Advisor felt that the fiscal year 1998 proposed budget and the 1999 department submission to OMB contained inadequate base funding.
