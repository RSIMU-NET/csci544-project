Specifically, GAO's analysis of Interior's annual budget justifications for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 found that ONRR reported meeting its compliance goals for 6 of the 8 fiscal years. According to ONRR officials, ONRR did not report meeting its compliance goals for 2 years because of a shift in the agency's goals that created a short-term misalignment of planned work and available resources. ONRR's fiscal year 2017 goals for its compliance program were (1) to obtain a return of $2 of additional royalties for every dollar spent on compliance activities and (2) to collect a defined amount of additional royalties. ONRR's compliance goals generally aligned with the agency's requirement that resources should not be expended without an expected return. However, these goals may not align with the agency's mission to collect, account for, and verify royalty payments and other statutory requirements because the goals do not address accuracy\u2014or the extent to which its compliance work is covering, for example, royalty payments. By establishing a goal that addresses accuracy, for example, by covering a portion of royalty payments with its compliance activities, ONRR could increase the extent to which it had reasonable assurance that its compliance program is fully accounting for federal oil and gas royalty payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that ONRR establish an accuracy goal that addresses coverage that aligns with its mission.

In 1982, Congress voted to pass the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty  Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), requiring, among other things, that  the Department of the Interior (Interior) establish a comprehensive  inspection, collection, and fiscal and production accounting and auditing  system for these revenues. In particular, the act requires Interior to  establish such a system to provide the capability of accurately  determining oil and gas royalties, among other moneys owed, and to  collect and account for such amounts in a timely manner. To accomplish  this, Interior tasks its Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) with  collecting and verifying the accuracy of royalties paid by companies that  produce oil and gas from over 26,000 federal leases. Each month, these  oil and gas companies self-report data to ONRR on the amount of oil and  gas they produced and sold, the value of this production, and the amount  of royalties that they owe to the federal government.", "To ensure that the data provided to ONRR are accurate and all royalties  are being paid, ONRR relies on its compliance program. Under this  program, ONRR initiates compliance activities by selecting companies  and properties for review to assess the accuracy of their royalty data and  compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. To assess its  compliance program\u2019s performance, ONRR established annual  compliance goals that have changed several times over the last decade  and include measures that identify the percentage of royalties that  ONRR\u2019s compliance activities cover and the return on investment for  those activities. ONRR\u2019s compliance program also directly coordinates  with the members of the State and Tribal Royalty Audit Committee  (STRAC), which have programs that review the accuracy of royalties  paid for oil and gas extracted on federal lands within their respective  states and receive a portion of such royalties.", "Over the past approximately 10 years, we, Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG), and Interior\u2019s Royalty Policy Committee have raised  concerns about whether ONRR is collecting all royalties that are owed to  the federal government. In February 2011, in part because of the  challenges identified in our past work, which indicated that Interior did not  have reasonable assurance that it was collecting its share of revenue  from oil and gas produced on federal lands, we added Interior\u2019s  management of federal oil and gas resources to our list of programs at  high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.", "You asked us to review issues related to ONRR\u2019s federal oil and gas  royalty compliance efforts.

Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for onshore  activities and manages approximately 700 million acres of subsurface  mineral rights throughout the country, including the acreage it leases to  companies for oil and gas development. At the end of fiscal year 2016,  about 41,000 oil and gas leases accounted for approximately 28.2 million  acres in 32 states, according to BLM data. For offshore oil and gas  activities, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is generally  responsible for leasing and resource planning and evaluation, among  other functions, and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental  Enforcement is generally responsible for permitting and inspecting as well  as verifying production volumes on offshore leases, among other  functions. Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended,  Interior is responsible for leasing and managing approximately 1.71 billion  offshore acres.", "To begin the leasing process, Interior holds auctions through which  companies may secure the rights to federal leases that allow them to drill  for oil and gas upon meeting certain conditions. Once a company obtains  a lease, it may conduct further exploration and subsequently determine  whether it would like to drill a well. If a company plans to drill, it must first  secure a permit from Interior. To secure a permit to drill under an onshore  lease, a company must submit an application for a drilling permit to the  appropriate BLM field office. BLM officials then evaluate the company\u2019s  proposal to ensure that it conforms to the relevant BLM land use plan for  the area as well as applicable laws and regulations, including those  focused on protecting the environment. To secure a permit to drill on  offshore leases, a company must submit an application for a drilling  permit to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, where it  is reviewed for completeness and whether all technical elements conform  to applicable regulations.", "Once a company secures a permit and begins producing, oil and gas is  transported to market and sold. As part of this process, companies may  elect to process the natural gas into various products before its sale.  Under ONRR regulations, companies may deduct certain costs  associated with transportation and natural gas processing from the  royalties due. Companies can continue to produce oil and gas until the  lease is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities, regardless of  the length of the lease. To ensure compliance with applicable laws,  regulations, and other requirements, both BLM and the Bureau of Safety  and Environmental Enforcement have inspection and enforcement  programs that are designed to verify that companies comply with all  requirements at the lease site, including those related to measuring oil  and gas volumes. The authority for inspecting wells and leases for this  purpose is derived from FOGRMA. The act requires the Secretary of the  Interior to develop guidelines that specify the coverage and frequency of  inspections. Interior has delegated responsibilities for implementing the  act to BLM for onshore leases and to the Bureau of Safety and  Environmental Enforcement for offshore leases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ONRR\u2019s Role in Collecting, Disbursing, and Verifying Royalties", "paragraphs": ["ONRR\u2019s oversight of federal royalties includes collecting company-paid  royalties, disbursing these royalties to appropriate accounts, and verifying  the company-paid royalties through its compliance activities.", "Collecting: Companies that obtain federal onshore or offshore oil and  gas leases are typically obligated to pay royalties on any oil or gas they  produce from the leases and then sell. As a condition of producing oil and  gas under federal and Indian leases, companies are required to submit  two key monthly reports to ONRR\u2014one specifying the total production  and disposition of oil and gas and the other stating the royalties due  based on production. However, because of various leasing and  development arrangements made by companies, these two reports are  often submitted by different companies. The companies physically  developing the lease, referred to as the operators, are responsible for  reporting the production volumes to ONRR in monthly production  reports. The companies with a financial interest in the lease, referred to  as the payors, are responsible for reporting the cash royalty owed on the  federal and Indian oil and gas production in their monthly royalty  reports. Each month, payors are to calculate the royalty payment owed  to the federal government using the four key variables illustrated in the  following equation:  Royalty payment = ((volume sold x sales price) less deductions) x  royalty rate  Companies are to submit monthly production and royalty reports via a  web-based portal to ONRR\u2019s royalty information technology (IT) system.  In addition to filing the royalty report with ONRR, companies typically  make the actual cash royalty payment via an electronic fund transfer to an  account at the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).", "Disbursing: Once ONRR reconciles the self-reported royalty payment  data from the monthly royalty reports with the payments to Treasury,  ONRR is to disburse the royalties from the Treasury account to the  appropriate federal, state, tribal, or Individual Indian Money (IIM)  accounts. All these transactions are to be recorded and stored in  ONRR\u2019s IT system.", "Verifying: ONRR is responsible for verifying royalties through its  compliance program, which includes ensuring that the royalty revenues  generated from the sale of oil and gas extracted from leased federal lands  are accurately reported and paid. In conducting its compliance activities,  ONRR is to assess the elements of the royalty equation: commodity price,  volume of oil and gas, transportation and processing allowances, and  royalty rate. ONRR also is to ensure that all relevant laws, regulations,  and lease terms have been followed. ONRR has two key statutory  requirements for its compliance program: FOGRMA and the Federal Oil  and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996 (RSFA).  FOGRMA requires that ONRR establish a comprehensive auditing  system to provide the capability to accurately determine oil and gas  royalties. RSFA directs ONRR not to conduct audit activities if it and the  relevant state determine that the cost of conducting or requiring the audit  exceeds the expected amount to be collected by the activity, based on  the most current 12 months of activity. ONRR\u2019s Work Planning Group  identifies which companies or leases will be subject to compliance  activities. The three primary levels of compliance activities ONRR  conducts are audits, compliance reviews, and data mining\u2014each of  which provides a varying degree of assurance that royalties are  accurately paid.", "Audits: According to ONRR documents, an audit involves detailed  examinations of companies\u2019 royalty payments and corresponding  reporting to ONRR. As part of an audit, ONRR staff are to assess the  accuracy and completeness of the companies\u2019 self-reported  production and royalty data compared to third-party documents, such  as sales contracts and oil and gas sales receipts from pipeline  companies. According to ONRR documents, it is to design its audits to  ensure that royalty payments and other obligations to ONRR are in  substantial compliance with applicable lease terms, federal laws and  regulations, and other policies.", "Compliance reviews: ONRR describes compliance reviews as an  analysis designed to determine the reasonableness of company- reported production and royalty data. In contrast to audits, compliance  reviews are quicker, more limited checks on the accuracy and  completeness of companies\u2019 self-reported data and do not include  systematically examining the underlying source documentation used  to generate the self-reported data.", "Data mining: ONRR began its data mining program in 2011 and  officially organized it within the compliance program beginning in fiscal  year 2018. Data mining is a partially automated activity to identify and  resolve data errors prior to audits and compliance reviews. According  to ONRR officials, data mining examines large sets of company- reported data for certain common errors, such as irregularities in the  volume of oil or gas extracted.

In 1981, we reported that  Interior was not collecting potentially hundreds of millions in royalties due  from federal oil and gas leases. In response, in 1981, the Secretary of  the Interior established the Commission on Fiscal Accountability of the  Nation\u2019s Energy Resources, also known as the Linowes Commission, to  investigate allegations of irregularities in royalty payments, among other  issues. The Linowes Commission raised a number of concerns, and its  1982 report stated that management of royalties for the nation\u2019s energy  resources had been a failure for more than 20 years. The report found  that because the federal government had not adequately managed this  multibillion-dollar enterprise, the oil and gas industry was not paying all  the royalties it rightly owed. The report cited a range of problems,  including the failure to verify data that companies reported as well as late  payments and underpayments.", "Following this report, Interior and Congress took actions aimed at  improving revenue collection, including reorganizing oil and gas revenue  collections under a new bureau within Interior, passing FOGRMA in 1982,  and passing RSFA in 1996.

Prior to fiscal year 2010, one of ONRR\u2019s  compliance goals was to conduct compliance activities on a specified  percentage of royalties within 3 years of the date it received payment. In  December 2006, Interior\u2019s OIG issued an audit report that found, among  other things, that the royalty compliance coverage goal had reduced the  number of companies and properties subject to compliance work. The  report stated that ONRR should consider modifying its compliance  program strategy to ensure appropriate coverage of properties and  companies within a reasonable time frame even if this resulted in a  reduction in the overall percentage of dollars covered and recommended  that ONRR develop separate performance measures for companies and  properties subjected to compliance coverage. ONRR concurred with the  recommendation and developed an implementation action plan. For fiscal  year 2010, ONRR eliminated its royalty coverage goal in response to the  OIG recommendation.", "Company/operator/payor and property coverage goals. For fiscal year  2010, ONRR revised its compliance goals to address company and  property coverage, or conducting compliance activities\u2014including audits  and compliance reviews\u2014on a certain percentage of companies and  properties. ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget justification stated that the  new compliance goals would reflect the cumulative percentage of unique  companies and properties covered by audits, compliance reviews, or the  royalty-in-kind compliance strategy. For fiscal year 2010, ONRR\u2019s  company coverage goal was to cumulatively conduct compliance  activities on 57.6 percent of companies that paid royalties from fiscal  years 2008 through 2012. ONRR\u2019s property coverage goal was to  cumulatively conduct compliance activities for 35 percent of properties  where oil and gas had been extracted and sold from fiscal years 2008  through 2012.", "For fiscal year 2011, ONRR revised its compliance goals, eliminating the  property coverage goal. ONRR also revised its company coverage goal to  cumulatively conduct compliance activities on 66 percent of companies  that paid royalties for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. ONRR further  revised this goal for fiscal year 2014 to consider operators and payors  instead of companies. In fiscal year 2014 ONRR established a  compliance goal of conducting compliance activities on 90 percent of  operators and payors but dropped the goal to 52 percent for fiscal year  2015. The goal for covering a percentage of operators and payors was  eliminated beginning in fiscal year 2016, which left ONRR without a  compliance goal addressing its coverage of royalty payments. Agency  officials we interviewed told us that they eliminated ONRR\u2019s company  coverage goal because they concluded that the compliance program was  reviewing too many companies and properties with smaller royalty  payments, which officials deemed an inefficient use of limited compliance  resources. ONRR officials added that budgetary constraints and the  complexity of company bankruptcies and consolidation in the oil and gas  industry also contributed to the goal\u2019s elimination.", "Additionally, in 2008, ONRR established a data mining program to  examine large sets of operator-reported data to identify royalty and  reporting errors, such as when the production volumes that payors and  operators reported for the same lease did not match. This work led to  additional royalty collections, but ONRR did not consider these results  when calculating its annual performance measure for company and  property coverage. According to officials, data mining was the  responsibility of ONRR\u2019s Royalty Reporting group and was not  considered compliance work.", "Return on investment goal. ONRR has had a goal for return on  investment for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 that measured the  efficiency of the compliance work that all of its program areas performed.  However, Interior elevated this goal from a bureau-specific goal to a  strategic plan goal for fiscal year 2017. This goal is a ratio of costs to  collections for compliance activities\u2014and is to assess whether ONRR  collected additional royalties for every additional dollar the agency spends  on compliance reviews, audits, and data mining. To account for  variations in collections and oil and gas prices, ONRR is to calculate its  performance on return on investment based on the royalties from the  previous 3 years. For example, the return on investment the agency  reported for fiscal year 2017 was based on revenues collected from fiscal  years 2014, 2015, and 2016. According to ONRR officials, the goal for  fiscal year 2017\u2014to collect an additional $2 in royalties for every $1 spent  on compliance activities\u2014was developed based on trends from prior  years. Achieving this return on investment would indicate that ONRR met  its goal.", "Total additional royalty collections goal. In fiscal year 2016, ONRR  developed a bureau-specific goal for total additional royalties collected  from compliance reviews, audits, and data mining. The goal for fiscal year  2016 was to collect an additional $110 million from compliance activities.  In the following fiscal year, 2017, ONRR elevated this goal to a strategic  plan goal and kept the amount the same, at $110 million in additional  royalties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ONRR Used All Levels of Compliance Activities to Generally Meet Goals", "paragraphs": ["To generally meet its compliance goals during fiscal years 2010 through  2017, ONRR used all levels of its compliance activities: audits,  compliance reviews, and data mining. The number of audits completed  annually generally remained the same for fiscal years 2010 through 2017,  declining slightly from 162 in 2010 to 153 in 2017. During the same time  period, the number of completed compliance reviews decreased,  declining from 1,233 in 2010 to 683 in 2017 (see fig. 2). During this time  frame, ONRR\u2019s Data Mining group increased the number of exceptions  resolved to address instances of incorrectly reported data from 4,323 in  2010 to over 26,000 in 2017.", "Our analysis of ONRR\u2019s data on compliance activities showed that adding  data mining financial results in 2011 was associated with a decrease in  the return on investment for ONRR\u2019s other compliance activities. Prior to  including data mining, compliance reviews earned a 6 to1 return on  investment, STRAC compliance work earned about a 4 to1 return on  investment, and audits earned a 2 to1 return on investment. By the end of  fiscal year 2017, data mining proved to be far more cost-effective for  royalty compliance, with a return on investment of 9 to1. During the same  time, return on investment declined for all compliance reviews (including  STRAC compliance work) and all audits (see fig. 3). According to ONRR  officials, the reason for this decline was that data mining was identifying  royalties that might otherwise have been identified through audits or  compliance reviews. Additionally, ONRR officials we interviewed stated  that data mining has been more cost-effective than audits or compliance  reviews in identifying additional royalties. Officials we interviewed stated  that data mining often identifies more simple reporting errors.", "Return on investment is an indicator of the efficiency of ONRR\u2019s  compliance program. As long as ONRR is collecting more royalties  through its compliance activities than it is spending on identifying those  royalties, the federal government will obtain additional revenues.  According to ONRR officials we interviewed, the agency does not  calculate the potential additional royalty revenues that would be  generated if it conducted additional compliance activities. However,  ONRR officials said they do calculate the effect of reduced funding on  compliance activities. For example, ONRR stated in its fiscal year 2018  budget justification document that reductions in its budget for compliance  work would directly result in reductions to additional royalty collections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ONRR\u2019s Goals May Not Align with Agency Mission and Statutory Requirements to Account for Royalty Payments", "paragraphs": ["ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017 compliance goals, the most recent compliance  goals we reviewed, may be useful for assessing certain aspects of  ONRR\u2019s performance but may not be effectively aligned with the agency\u2019s  stated mission or fulfill other statutory requirements. ONRR\u2019s 2017  strategic priorities document states that the agency\u2019s mission is to collect,  account for, and verify energy revenues. Additionally, statutory  requirements under RSFA direct ONRR not to conduct audit activities if it  and the relevant state determine that the cost of conducting or requiring  the audit exceeds the expected amount to be collected by the activity,  based on the most current 12 months of activity. ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017  return on investment compliance goal helps the agency comply with  RSFA by assessing whether the agency\u2019s compliance program is cost- effective.", "Moreover, ONRR\u2019s statutory requirements under FOGRMA require that it  establish a comprehensive auditing system to provide the capability to  accurately determine oil and gas royalties, among other requirements.  However, ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017 compliance goals do not sufficiently  address its mission or FOGRMA requirements, in part, because its goals  do not address accuracy\u2014or consider the extent to which its compliance  work is covering, for example, royalty payments. While ONRR previously  had coverage goals, agency officials told us that they eliminated their  company and property coverage goals because they concluded the  compliance program was reviewing too many companies and properties  with smaller royalty payments. ONRR officials told us that this was  deemed an inefficient use of limited compliance resources. However, it is  difficult for ONRR to provide reasonable assurance that it is accurately  collecting royalties when it does not have data on the extent to which, for  example, royalties or companies were subject to compliance activities.  According to agency officials we interviewed, ONNR stopped tracking  these data when ONRR eliminated its coverage goals for fiscal year  2016. As a result, ONRR could be determining that it is meeting its  current annual compliance goals but potentially doing so by examining a  small percentage of royalties or companies. For example, ONRR may be  able to achieve a 2 to 1 return on investment, but only conduct  compliance activities on 10 percent of the approximately $5 billion in  royalties paid in calendar year 2017. This raises questions about the  extent to which ONRR can provide reasonable assurance that its  compliance program is assessing the accuracy of oil and gas royalty  payments because it does not have a goal for, or data on, the amount of  royalties subject to compliance activities.", "Finally, because ONRR no longer has a coverage goal\u2014which helps it  assess the extent to which it has ensured the accuracy of royalty  payments\u2014it does not track the amount of royalties subject to its differing  level of compliance activities. ONRR has established a compliance  program with three activities\u2014audits, compliance reviews, and data  mining\u2014each of which offers varying levels of assurance for determining  the accuracy of royalty payments. However, the extent to which its  compliance program allows ONRR to accurately determine and collect  royalty payments is unclear because the agency does not track each  compliance activity\u2019s contribution toward a coverage goal. Interior\u2019s OIG  reported a similar finding in December 2006. In its report, the OIG found  that ONRR\u2019s compliance goal for coverage of royalties was misleading  because it weighed audits and compliance reviews equally, although the  two compliance activities provided differing levels of assurance about  whether royalties were accurately paid. The OIG recommended that  ONRR should revise the compliance goal to account for each compliance  activity separately. While ONRR did not concur with establishing a goal  for each of the compliance activities, it agreed to internally track separate  measures for them. According to ONRR documentation, the agency took  steps to identify what amount of royalties was covered by audits or  compliance reviews but did not report this information. When ONRR  eliminated its coverage goals for fiscal year 2016, it no longer tracked  information on the extent to which royalty payments were subject to its  different levels of compliance activities. By establishing a coverage goal  (e.g., identifying the number of companies or percentage of royalties  subject to compliance activities over a set period of time) that aligns with  the agency\u2019s mission and tracking the extent to which each of its  compliance activities contributes toward this goal, ONRR would have  greater assurance that its compliance program has the capability to  accurately determine oil and gas royalties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ONRR\u2019s Process to Select Compliance Cases Is Not Documented and May Not Align with Compliance Goals", "paragraphs": ["ONRR\u2019s process to select compliance cases for audits and compliance  reviews is not documented.

According to these officials, the work  planners or analytics staff review a variety of royalty payment and oil and  gas production information to identify trends and outliers that may indicate  potential royalty noncompliance. The officials told us that they also  consider other factors in their selection decisions, such as whether a  company was new\u2014and therefore may be unfamiliar with how to correctly  report royalties\u2014or had undergone a change in ownership\u2014which can  lead to reporting errors. Additional factors that ONRR officials told us they  considered were referrals by ONRR staff based on recently completed  compliance activity on a specific company or property and the risk scores  for the relevant companies and properties generated from the agency\u2019s  compliance risk model.", "For compliance reviews, ONRR officials we interviewed told us that the  Work Planning Group includes information from a Go/No-go analysis,  which they said allows ONRR to make a decision early in the process to  cost effectively decide whether to initiate a compliance review. According  to ONRR officials, the use of the Go/No-go analysis began in fiscal year  2015 as means to better ensure that the compliance activities they select  will identify a finding of royalty noncompliance. According to the officials,  the Work Planning Group then compares the list of companies and  properties to other sources of information, such as the findings of recently  completed work and ONRR\u2019s royalty compliance risk model, to select  cases based on the group\u2019s professional judgment. Overall, ONRR  officials we interviewed said that the Work Planning Group maintains a  small pool of cases for either an audit or compliance review for when staff  become available after completing other work.", "ONRR officials said that as there was no requirement that they develop  documented procedures for case selection, they rely on the experience  and training of members of the Work Planning Group to review the  available information and select cases based on requests from the Audit  Management and Compliance Management groups.

As  mentioned previously, ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017 goals for its compliance  program are to achieve a specified return on investment and total amount  of additional royalties collected from the cases it selects to undergo  compliance activities. However, according to ONRR officials we  interviewed, these goals are not considered when selecting cases.  Rather, these officials told us that the Work Planning Group attempts to  select cases for compliance activities that are the most likely to result in a  finding of royalty noncompliance. A finding of noncompliance for a  company can result from a variety of circumstances, such as reporting an  incorrect volume of oil or gas sold or claiming allowances for  transportation and processing costs above established limits. ONRR  officials stated that the agency\u2019s IT system tracks whether a completed  compliance case resulted in a finding, but the agency does not regularly  assess the percentage of completed cases that produce findings.", "Prior to 2015, ONRR had performance measures for determining the  extent to which cases selected aligned with its compliance goals but  stopped using these measures after it made changes to the goals. Prior  to fiscal year 2010, for example, ONRR had a goal for conducting  compliance activities on a certain percentage of royalties within 3 years  from the date it received payment. To support this goal, ONRR sought to  select companies with relatively high royalty dollar amounts. ONRR then  assessed its performance toward achieving this goal by reviewing all  completed audits and compliance reviews over a 3-year period and  calculating the percentage of total royalties paid over this period from  completed compliance cases. For example, in fiscal year 2008, ONRR  reported that compliance cases covered 69 percent of royalties received  in calendar year 2004.", "However, as we noted previously, the 2006 OIG report found that the  focus on coverage of royalties resulted in ONRR providing limited  coverage of its universe of companies and properties. Additionally,  ONRR officials we interviewed confirmed that selecting cases with higher  royalty amounts to achieve the royalty coverage goal resulted in more  limited coverage of companies because the goal directed ONRR toward  repeatedly selecting many of the same large companies each year for  compliance activities.", "In response to the recommendations in the OIG\u2019s report as well as  ONRR\u2019s own recognition of the reduced company coverage resulting from  its selection of companies that pay high royalties, ONRR transitioned to a  new performance measure for case selection along with a new  compliance goal in fiscal year 2010. ONRR\u2019s new performance measure  assessed the number of unique companies and properties for selected  compliance activities. This new performance measure, according to  ONRR officials, was driven by ONRR\u2019s new compliance goal for  cumulatively covering a certain percentage of unique companies and  properties over a 3-year period.", "According to ONRR officials, after the company and property coverage  goal was in place for approximately 5 years, officials determined that this  goal and corresponding performance measure was driving the  compliance case selection process to select too many companies and  properties with smaller royalty payments, which they deemed an  inefficient use of limited compliance resources. As a result, ONRR  officials told us that the agency decided to change its compliance goal in  fiscal year 2015 to focus on return on investment and total additional  dollars collected. However, ONRR did not establish a corresponding  performance measure for its compliance case selection process that  would determine the extent to which cases selected contributed to  ONRR\u2019s compliance goals.", "As stated previously, we have reported that the requirements in GPRA  and GRPAMA for establishing performance metrics serve as leading  practices for divisions, programs, and initiatives. Performance measures  help agencies make resource decisions, provide managers information on  which to base their organizational and management decisions, and create  powerful incentives to influence organizational and individual behavior.  Furthermore, successful performance measures are aligned with division  and agency-wide goals and missions. According to ONRR officials we  interviewed, they have not established performance measures for  determining whether the way such cases are selected aligns with the  agency\u2019s compliance goals because there is no specific requirement to do  so. By developing performance measures (e.g., establishing a specified  percentage of compliance cases that identify findings of royalty  noncompliance or total additional royalties) that assess whether the  agency is selecting cases that are helping it achieve its compliance goals,  ONRR would be able to better monitor its performance in achieving its  goals and whether changes to its selection process affect its  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ONRR Has Not Analyzed the Effectiveness of Its Risk Model on Case Selection", "paragraphs": ["ONRR has developed a model that assesses the risk of noncompliance  for companies and properties.

In December 2006, Interior\u2019s OIG recommended that ONRR  consider additional factors that may indicate a risk of noncompliant royalty  payments when making case selection decisions. In addition to the  factors that ONRR was using to select cases to help achieve its  compliance goals, such as cases with high royalty dollars, the OIG  recommended that ONRR incorporate other risk factors, including  companies or properties having a history of underreported royalties and  falsely reported information to other federal agencies, such as the  Environmental Protection Agency. In December 2007, Interior\u2019s  Subcommittee on Royalty Management reiterated the importance of using  a risk-based process for compliance and made a number of related  recommendations to ONRR. Among these were that ONRR should fully  implement the quantitative model it was developing as part of its pilot  program. Additionally, the subcommittee recommended that ONRR  evaluate its risk model\u2019s performance and then establish a process to  continually validate and update the model to ensure that it remains  effective.", "In response to these recommendations, ONRR worked with a contractor  from 2006 through 2012 to develop an initial risk model. This model  evaluated the risk of royalty noncompliance for each lease based on four  characteristics: the type of lease, the specific location of the lease, the  region of the country the lease was in, and the type of commodity  extracted. The model looked at a number of indicators of risk, which were  grouped into four overall risk drivers: complexity of the oil and gas market,  complexity of regulations, commodity-specific practices, and transparency  of the market. According to officials from the Work Planning Group we  interviewed, they used the risk scores generated from this model to help  inform the list of compliance cases to be reviewed the following year.  These officials told us that they stopped using the scores from this model  around 2012 for two reasons. First, the model allowed for the scores to be  manually weighted based on the judgment of those selecting the  compliance cases, and this weighting process was believed to have  eventually hurt the accuracy of the risk scores. Second, agency officials  determined that the risk scores the model was producing did not correlate  closely with cases resulting in significant findings.", "In 2013, ONRR tasked a different contractor with developing a new set of  risk models. According to an initial development document, ONRR  requested separate risk models for companies and properties that would  determine the propensity for a company to submit an incorrect royalty  payment using historical royalty compliance data that ONRR and third- party sources provided. The contractor produced two risk models, one  that assigned a risk score to companies and one to properties. The risk  scores\u2014which ranged from 0 to 100\u2014attempted to quantify the risk of  royalty noncompliance. The initial models were completed in 2014, and  ONRR began including the risk scores from these models in the data that  the Work Planning Group reviewed during the case selection process.  Documents from the contractor show that the models then went through  an initial validation process using the results of cases that the contractor  selected when the models were instituted in 2014 and completed cases  from 2012 onward.", "According to documents summarizing the contractor\u2019s efforts, the  validation showed a correlation between higher risk scores on the  company model and cases that resulted in findings and additional royalty  revenues. However, the contractor reported that higher risk scores on the  property model did not correlate with either findings or additional royalty  revenues. The documents we reviewed also included a number of  recommendations to ONRR to improve its risk modeling, including adding  third-party and commercial data sources, adding data sources from within  ONRR and other oil and gas bureaus within Interior, and attempting to  redefine property risk and building a new property risk model. However,  according to officials we interviewed, they have not yet acted on any of  these recommendations. ONRR requested that the contractor update the  models with data from recent royalty reporting and completed compliance  cases, which it did in both 2015 and 2018 but does not do either regularly  or periodically.", "According to ONRR officials, the Work Planning Group currently  considers the risk scores based on the company model when selecting  cases but does not consider the risk scores based on the property model,  as the group considers those scores less reliable. ONRR officials told us  that they do not believe that their current risk approach is entirely effective  and are considering having staff from the Analytics and Risk Management  group develop a risk model for the agency. To date, ONRR has not  analyzed how the use of the risk scores has affected case selection or  findings of royalty noncompliance and is therefore unable to identify  whether its risk model is effective. As a result, the agency does not have  sufficient information to make a decision on whether to continue using the  model as it exists today, consider potential improvements, or discontinue  the model in favor of another approach.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such  as by comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and  analyzing significant differences. By periodically analyzing whether the  risk model is effectively identifying potential royalty noncompliance and  whether the model\u2019s results are being effectively used to assist in case  selection, and making changes to the model (e.g., updating it) or  developing a new model based on this analysis, ONRR would be better  able to determine how to proceed with using risk analysis to inform its  case selections."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "STRAC Members Reported They Are Satisfied with ONRR Coordination but Do Not Have Documented Processes, and Compliance Activities in Their Work Plans Do Not Align with ONRR Goals STRAC Officials Expressed Satisfaction with ONRR\u2019s Coordination on Royalty Compliance", "paragraphs": ["STRAC officials we interviewed from the nine member states that had  agreements with ONRR for conducting royalty compliance generally  expressed satisfaction with ONRR\u2019s coordination of compliance activities,  including both the frequency of interaction as well as support for budget  and training.", "STRAC officials from all nine member states generally expressed  satisfaction with the frequency of interaction between STRAC and ONRR.

STRAC member agreements from eight of the nine STRAC members  included language that the \u201cstate will contribute to ONRR\u2019s GPRA goals  and thereby the performance goals of this Agreement by performing  audits, compliance reviews and other investigations in coordination with  ONRR. The yearly performance goals are listed on the state\u2019s annual  work plan.\u201d However, when we reviewed the STRAC members\u2019  corresponding annual work plans, we found no information on how the  members\u2019 compliance activities contributed to ONRR\u2019s goals. For  example, several of the STRAC members\u2019 work plans included  information on the leases and properties selected for compliance  activities but did not include information on how those selections would  contribute to ONRR\u2019s compliance goals.", "In addition, the majority of STRAC officials from member states said they  did not consider ONRR\u2019s compliance goals for return on investment or  total additional royalty collections when selecting compliance cases.  When we asked STRAC members about their goals, three of nine STRAC  member states noted that they had compliance program goals. For  example, one STRAC member\u2019s goal was to \u201cmaximize revenue to the  state\u201d and \u201cimplement on behalf of ONRR and the state, a constantly  improving and efficient royalty audit program.\u201d Another member\u2019s goal  was to \u201cprotect the US Citizens\u2019 Federal Mineral Interest within the  boundaries of the state by ensuring that a fair value, as established by the  federal regulations, is received.\u201d Officials from the other six STRAC  members told us that their states do not have goals for federal oil and gas  royalty compliance activities because ONRR does not require that they do  so. For STRAC members that did not have compliance goals, officials  provided examples of informal goals\u2014or goals that were not documented.  For example, one STRAC official reported that the state\u2019s goal was to try  to audit 50 percent of royalties paid to the state every 2 years. Another  STRAC official stated the state tries to review major market areas in the  state once every 7 years. When we compared STRAC officials\u2019  responses on their goals to ONRR\u2019s broader compliance goals for return  on investment and total additional royalty collections, we found that the  majority of states\u2019 compliance goals did not align with ONRR\u2019s goals.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risk and define risk  tolerances, such as by defining objectives in alignment with the  organization\u2019s mission, strategic plan, and performance goals. In  requiring eight of the nine STRAC members to conduct compliance  activities consistent with the agency\u2019s compliance goals, ONRR was  following these standards. However, ONRR approved the STRAC  members\u2019 work plans, although those work plans did not specify how the  described members\u2019 compliance activities would contribute to ONRR\u2019s  goals as the agency stated they would in the agreements between the  seven of the nine STRAC members and ONRR. By requiring STRAC  members to describe in their annual work plans how their compliance  activities would align with ONRR\u2019s current compliance goals, ONRR  would have better assurance that activities were aligned with its  compliance goals.", "Finally, ONRR does not track STRAC member states\u2019 contributions  against its annual compliance goals. ONRR has the data available to  track these contributions because the results of STRAC members\u2019  compliance activities are retained in ONRR\u2019s IT system. For example, we  obtained reports on the aggregate overall return on investment of STRAC  members and reviewed individual data entries from STRAC members\u2019  work that included a data field for revenue collections. According to  regulations, if a state accepts delegated authority, it is to assist ONRR in  meeting the requirements of GPRA as well as in developing and  endeavoring to comply with ONRR\u2019s Strategic Plan and Performance  Measurements. Because ONRR does not track STRAC member states\u2019  contributions toward its annual compliance goals, the agency has limited information for assessing whether the funding they are providing to  STRAC members is achieving its goals. ONRR officials we interviewed  stated that they do not track states\u2019 contributions to ONRR\u2019s overall  compliance goals as there is no requirement to do so. However, by  tracking the performance of each state and its contribution toward  ONRR\u2019s compliance goals, ONRR could better assess the effectiveness  of states\u2019 performance in supporting the agency\u2019s mission of ensuring  accurate royalty payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["ONRR is taking steps intended to improve its royalty compliance program  and better verify that all royalties paid on the sale of oil and gas extracted  from leased federal lands are accurate. These steps include reorganizing  the management structure of its compliance program, implementing new  systems for managing compliance cases electronically, and instituting a  training curriculum for newly hired auditors. However, although ONRR  reported generally meeting its compliance goals for fiscal years 2010  through 2017, its current goals may not align with the agency\u2019s mission or  other statutory requirements. For example, ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017  compliance goals do not sufficiently address its mission to collect,  account for, and verify revenues, in part, because its goals do not  address accuracy, such as through a coverage goal. Establishing a  coverage goal (e.g., identifying the number of companies or percentage  of royalties subject to compliance activities over a set period) that aligns  with the agency\u2019s mission, and tracking the extent to which each of its  compliance activities contributes to this goal, would provide ONRR more  reasonable assurance that its compliance program is assessing the  extent to which oil and gas royalty payments are accurate. Furthermore,  ONRR\u2019s audits, compliance reviews, and data mining efforts each provide  a different level of assurance that royalties are accurately paid, but the  agency does not measure how each of the compliance activities  contributes to the FOGRMA requirement to establish a system with the  capability to accurately determine and collect royalties in a timely manner.  By tracking the extent to which each of its compliance activities  contributed to any future coverage goal, ONRR would have greater  assurance that its compliance program has the capability to accurately  determine oil and gas royalties.", "In addition, ONRR\u2019s compliance program relies on its Work Planning  Group, which is responsible for reviewing information on companies and  properties to select cases for audits or compliance reviews. The Work  Planning Group, however, does not have a documented case selection  process. By developing a documented case selection process that  includes procedures for how to select compliance cases, ONRR could  better ensure that it retains the organizational knowledge needed to  effectively select compliance cases and defend the process in external  reviews. In addition, ONRR does not have performance measures to  determine the extent to which cases selected align with ONRR\u2019s  compliance goals. By developing performance measures (e.g.,  establishing a specified percentage of compliance cases that identify  findings of royalty noncompliance or total additional royalties) that assess  whether the agency is selecting cases that are helping it achieve its  compliance goals, ONRR would be able to better monitor its performance  in achieving its goals and whether changes to its selection process affect  performance.", "Moreover, since 2006, ONRR has worked to develop a model to assess  the risk of royalty noncompliance for use in its compliance case selection  process. After several iterations with two contractors, ONRR began using  the risk scores from its model to assist with case selection in 2014.  However, according to ONRR officials, the agency is considering  discontinuing the use of its current model in favor of one that is internally  developed. ONRR has not analyzed how the use of the risk scores has  affected case selection or findings of royalty noncompliance and is  therefore unable to identify whether its risk model is effective. By  periodically analyzing whether the risk model is effectively identifying  potential royalty noncompliance and whether the model\u2019s results are  being effectively used to assist in case selection and making changes to  the model (e.g., updating it) or developing a new model based on this  analysis, ONRR would be better able to determine how to proceed with  using risk analysis to inform its case selections.", "Furthermore, none of the nine STRAC members had documented case  selection processes. In the agreements between the nine STRAC  members and ONRR, the agency includes terms and conditions that the  members agree to, but ONRR does not require STRAC members to have  documented procedures for compliance case selection. By including  requirements in ONRR\u2019s agreements with STRAC members to develop a  documented case selection process, including procedures for how to  select compliance cases and how to document which factors were  considered in selection decisions, ONRR could better assess whether  members select cases that align with the agency\u2019s compliance goals.  Additionally, ONRR does not require that STRAC members specify how  their compliance activities included in annual work plans contribute to  ONRR\u2019s compliance goals, although those goals appear on the work  plans. ONRR approved the work plans but did not specify how the  members\u2019 compliance activities would contribute to its goals as the  agency stated they would in the agreements between eight of the nine  STRAC members and ONRR. By requiring STRAC members to describe  in their annual work plans how their compliance activities would align with  ONRR\u2019s current compliance goals, the agency would have better  assurance that activities were aligned with its performance goals. Lastly,  ONRR does not track STRAC members\u2019 contributions toward its annual  compliance goals though it has the data to do so.
