From 2000 to 2005, the Food Stamp Program has grown from $15 billion to $29 billion in benefits. During this period of time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) replaced paper food stamp coupons with electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards that work much like a debit card at the grocery checkout counter. Given these program changes and continuing retailer fraud, GAO was asked to provide information on (1) what is known about the extent and nature of retailer food stamp trafficking, (2) the efforts of federal agencies to combat such trafficking, and (3) program vulnerabilities. To do this, GAO interviewed agency officials, visited 10 field offices, conducted case file reviews, and analyzed data from the FNS retailer database."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FNS's estimates suggest trafficking declined between 1995 and 2005 from 3.8 cents per dollar of benefits redeemed to 1.0 cent, resulting in an estimated $241 million in food stamps trafficked in 2005. The rate of trafficking in small grocery and convenience stores is 7.6 cents per dollar, significantly higher than the rate for large stores, where it is estimated to be 0.2 cents per dollar. In addition, the use of EBT cards has changed the way some benefits are trafficked, for example eliminating middlemen who used to collect and redeem large amounts of paper coupons from program participants willing to sell them. FNS has taken advantage of EBT data to improve its ability to detect and disqualify trafficking retailers, while law enforcement agencies have conducted a decreasing number of investigations. Cases using only EBT transaction data now account for more than half of trafficking disqualifications, supplementing traditional, but more time-consuming, undercover investigations. Other federal entities, such as the USDA's Inspector General and the U.S. Secret Service, have reduced the number of traffickers they pursue in recent years and focused their efforts on high-impact cases. This has resulted in fewer cases referred for federal prosecution and fewer federal convictions for retailer trafficking. Despite FNS progress, the program remains vulnerable because retailers can enter the program intending to traffic, often without fear of severe criminal penalties. FNS authorizes some stores with limited food supplies so that low-income participants in areas with few supermarkets have access to food, but may not inspect these stores again for 5 years unless there is some indication of a problem. Oversight of early operations is important because newly authorized retailers can quickly ramp up the amount of benefits they traffic. One location that FNS disqualified for trafficking redeemed almost $650,000 in 9 months. In addition, FNS has not conducted analyses to identify high risk areas and to target its limited compliance-monitoring resources. Furthermore, disqualification, FNS's most severe penalty, may not be a sufficient deterrent, and FNS must rely upon others for prosecution. Finally, states' failing to pursue trafficking recipients leaves a pool of recipients willing to traffic when a disqualified store reopens."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Every year, food stamp recipients exchange hundreds of millions of  Every year, food stamp recipients exchange hundreds of millions of  dollars in benefits for cash instead of food with authorized retailers across  dollars in benefits for cash instead of food with authorized retailers across  the country, a practice known as trafficking.

The four estimates, which were  the best available data on this subject, covered the calendar years 1993,  1996 to 1998, 1999 to 2002, and 2002 to 2005. The methodology FNS used  to develop these estimates has some limitations; the estimates do not  provide a precise measure of food stamp trafficking. However, they can  be used to provide an indication of the magnitude of food stamp  trafficking and the change in the rate over time.", "To understand the nature of trafficking, assess the efforts to combat it, and  identify continued program vulnerabilities, we conducted interviews with  the following program stakeholders: officials from FNS headquarters and  regional offices; other officials responsible for investigating food stamp  trafficking including the USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and  the U.S. Secret Service; food stamp advocates and researchers; officials  from industry associations and EBT contractors; and officials from  selected state law enforcement bureaus. In addition, we obtained relevant  information from the state audit, comptroller, and treasurer community.  We selected and visited 10 FNS field offices (Chicago, Ill.; Dallas, Tex.;  Denver, Colo.; Detroit, Mich.; Los Angeles, Calif.; New York, N.Y.;  Portland, Ore.; Sacramento, Calif.; Tallahassee, Fla and Towson, Md.)  located in the seven FNS regions. We selected these offices to achieve  variation in geographical distribution, the ages of the states\u2019 EBT systems,  and the number of stores that were disqualified from participating in the  program for trafficking. At each office, we conducted semistructured  interviews with FNS officials and used a case file review tool to review  nonprobability samples of files for 163 retailers that were disqualified for  trafficking in fiscal year 2005. We also interviewed officials from seven of  the states where we made our field office visits.", "In addition, to identify efforts to combat trafficking, we analyzed FNS\u2019s  authorized retailer database, the Store Tracking and Redemption System,  to determine the number of permanent trafficking disqualifications by  store address, to calculate the time between a store\u2019s initial authorization  and its first disqualification for fiscal years 1996 through 2005, and to  determine the number of sanction actions that had been taken against a  retailer leading up to the retailer\u2019s being permanently disqualified. To  ensure the accuracy of the FNS data we analyzed, we interviewed agency  officials to identify and resolve any inconsistencies that could affect our  work. In addition, we reviewed documentation on how these data were  gathered and maintained.

FNS operates  44 field offices throughout the country, and they have the primary  responsibility for authorizing retailers to participate in the Food Stamp  Program.

However, the regulations do not specify  how many food items retailers should stock. The store owner submits an  application and includes forms of identification such as copies of the  owner\u2019s Social Security card, driver\u2019s license, business license, liquor  license, and alien resident card. The FNS field office program specialist  then checks the applicant\u2019s Social Security number against FNS\u2019s database  of retailers, the Store Tracking and Redemption System, to see if the  applicant has previously been sanctioned in the Food Stamp Program. The  application also collects information on the type of business, store hours,  number of employees, number of cash registers, the types of staple foods  offered, and the estimated annual amount of gross sales and eligible food  stamp sales.", "If the application is complete, most field offices will forward a request to  the private contractor employed by FNS to conduct on-site inspections  that verify the information in the application and provide additional  information for the approval process. The contractor visits the store and  submits a map of the store layout, the inspection form, and photographs of  the outside and inside of the store and its inventory. The contractor  reports information on the type of store and its location, access to parking,  the number of cash registers and EBT point-of-sale devices, whether  shopping carts or baskets are available, and the availability of nonfood  stock and services offered, such as liquor, tobacco, gasoline, check  cashing, and lottery tickets. As part of the inspection, the contractor also  evaluates the general store conditions and notes problems\u2014such as empty  coolers and shelves, dusty cans and expired or outdated foods\u2014that could  indicate that this may not be a viable grocery operation. Upon receiving  favorable information from the contractor, the FNS program specialist  authorizes the store to participate in the Food Stamp Program for 5 years.  Unless a problem arises with the store, it typically would not be   re-inspected until it applies for reauthorization.", "At the end of fiscal year 2005, more than 160,000 retailers were authorized  to accept food stamp benefits. During the fiscal year, almost 24,000 new  stores were authorized, 30,000 were reauthorized and almost 17,000 left  the program, most for voluntary reasons. As shown in table 1,  supermarkets account for only about 22 percent of the authorized stores  but redeem the lion\u2019s share of food stamp benefits. FNS defines a  supermarket as a store with $2 million of gross sales, three or more cash  registers, and coded as a supermarket on its food stamp application.  for allowable foods. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity  Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), however, required each state  agency to implement an EBT system to electronically distribute food  stamp benefits, and the last state completed its implementation in fiscal  year 2004. Under the EBT system, food stamp recipients receive an EBT  card imprinted with their name and a personal account number, and food  stamp benefits are automatically credited to the recipients\u2019 accounts once  a month. As shown on the left in figure 2, in a legitimate food stamp  transaction, recipients run their EBT card, which works much like a debit  card, through an electronic point-of-sale machine at the grocery checkout  counter, and enter their secret personal identification number to access  their food stamp accounts and to authorize the transfer of food stamp  benefits from a federal account to the retailer\u2019s account to pay for the  eligible food items.

The coupons might also change hands among  multiple middlemen, with each taking a cut, before ultimately being  exchanged for cash from a willing retailer. Field office officials told us that  EBT has largely eliminated the middleman because retailers must now  have the recipients\u2019 EBT card and personal identification number to  conduct a trafficking transaction. As a result, some recipients have  adapted their trafficking behavior to the new EBT environment. For  example, one field office official told us that some food stamp recipients  now stand outside of stores offering to loan their EBT cards to shoppers  entering the store. In this situation, the shopper would purchase groceries  using the card and return it and a discounted amount of cash to the  recipient upon leaving the store.

These paper cases accounted for the majority of FNS\u2019s 841 trafficking  disqualifications in fiscal year 2005.", "As part of the monitoring process, FNS collects each month\u2019s food stamp  transaction data from the states\u2019 EBT processors and adds the data to its  EBT transaction database for analysis.

In the field offices, program specialists begin their work on paper cases by  reviewing the Watch List and leads from other sources, such as the state  food stamp agency, the state EBT processors, and law enforcement  agencies. Using experience with the retailers in the area, program  specialists may determine that suspicious transactions for some retailers  are explainable. In such cases, the specialist may take no further action or  schedule a later review of the store\u2019s transactions. In cases for which they  cannot explain the suspicious transactions, program specialists determine  which retailers they will pursue as paper cases. If the program specialist is  unable to develop a paper case, the case may be referred to the Retailer  Investigations Branch for an undercover investigation.", "After deciding to open a paper case, FNS obtains clearance from the OIG  to pursue the case, and then the program specialist uses FNS data and a  variety of other resources to gather evidence. Program specialists  generally use 3 months of EBT data to show suspicious patterns. In the  case files we reviewed, charge letters typically contained hundreds of  examples of suspicious transactions, although FNS guidance does not  specify the number of transactions necessary to support a case. Specialists  also review FNS historical data on retailers to check for such things as  prior program violations. In addition, these specialists obtain more  current transaction data as well as information on recipients suspected of  trafficking with the retailer, through state Food Stamp Program databases.  Many specialists supplement these data with online resources, such as  mapping software to identify suspicious shopping patterns. Program  specialists can also consult the photos taken at the time of authorization to  assess whether conditions in the store support the volume of food stamp  redemptions claimed. Figure 4 shows the limited counter space and the  single cash register of a store that claimed food stamp redemptions of  almost $200,000 per month and was later disqualified for trafficking. Such  information enables the program specialists to corroborate conclusions  they have drawn based on patterns in the EBT transaction data.", "In addition, most program specialists in the offices we visited told us they  also visit the store once before charging a retailer with trafficking. Some  store visits allow the program specialist to check for possible explanations  for the suspicious transaction patterns, while others corroborate the  suspicion that the stores are in business to traffic. For example, during one  store visit, program specialists found cans of food on the shelves with  thick layers of dust, many items that had passed their expiration dates, and  jars of spaghetti sauce so old that the contents had separated.", "The store owner may attempt to rebut the charges. For example, a store  owner may claim to have extended credit to recipients so they could  purchase food until they received their next month\u2019s food stamp benefits,  and the high-dollar transactions were repayment of the credit. Although  extending credit is also a violation of program rules, it carries a lesser  penalty\u2014temporary disqualification\u2014than trafficking.

Stores that received a  temporary or permanent disqualification in 1996 had been open an average  of about 8.7 years, but by 2005, that average had dropped to 6.3 years. Two  factors may have contributed to this 28 percent decrease in length of time  between authorization and disqualification: improved FNS monitoring of  the program and use of EBT transaction data or more store owners who  begin to traffic food stamps sooner. The officer-in-charge of the Chicago  field office believes that in her area an increasing number of store owners  are trafficking immediately after authorization. We analyzed FNS\u2019s  authorized retailer data for stores in the Chicago area and found that the  average time between authorization and a store\u2019s first temporary or  permanent disqualification dropped by nearly half.

The US Secret Service used to take on  investigations when large amounts of food stamp coupons were being  trafficked. However, its involvement in retailer trafficking investigations is  rare because the Secret Service finds that large trafficking investigations  are less common since the implementation of EBT. EBT cards typically  only have a few hundred dollars of benefits each month, so it takes many  transactions for a dishonest store owner to traffic a large amount of  money. However, in large trafficking investigations or those where a  retailer is believed to be diverting profits from trafficking to terrorist  causes, the Secret Service or the FBI might work with the OIG and other  agencies on a sting operation or a joint task force. For example, the OIG  and FBI worked jointly with state and local law enforcement authorities in  Florida on an investigation involving store owners who were ordered to  pay $2.6 million in restitution to the USDA and went to prison after  pleading guilty to trafficking over $3 million in food stamp benefits. OIG  officials told us they were actively conducting task force investigations  with other federal, state and local law enforcement authorities.   If an investigation is accepted and developed for prosecution by a law  enforcement entity, there is still no guarantee that the trafficker will be  prosecuted.

These data  illustrate the relatively small number of store owners who have faced  prosecution for trafficking in recent years, particularly in light of the   841 owners who were disqualified in fiscal year 2005. These data also  show that the proportion of investigations accepted by the US Attorney for  prosecution has been increasing in recent years. OIG officials told us they  believe they are better targeting investigations for referral.", "With fewer retailers prosecuted, the number of convictions has also  declined. Because of the length of time it takes to prosecute a case, there  is a lag between the time when a trafficking investigation is accepted by  the US Attorney for prosecution and the time when a retailer is convicted.  Thus, it is not possible to compare the figures for investigations accepted  for prosecution and those resulting in convictions in the same year.

FNS field office officials told us their first priority  is getting stores into the program to ensure needy people have access to  food. In part because large grocery stores are sometimes scarce in urban,  low-income areas, officials may allow stores with minimal food stock that  meet the minimum FNS requirements to become authorized food stamp  retailers. Officials told us that when a retailer only stocks small quantities  of eligible food items, such as just a few cans of one kind of vegetable, it is  often an indication of the intent to traffic. However, FNS regulations do  not specify the amount of food items that would constitute sufficient  stock. The officer-in-charge of a large urban field office expressed  frustration with this lack of specificity. Many authorized stores in her area  are gas-and-grocery combinations or convenience stores and some of  these stores stock only one item from each required food group. However,  she said the field office cannot deny these stores authorization based upon  minimal food stock because, in her experience, the denial would be  overturned if appealed. Another official at an FNS regional office told us  about a store that was denied authorization in that region. According to  this official, the denial was overturned by the Administrative Review  Branch when the reviewing officer determined that a single can of corn  sufficed as one of the three different products required in the fruit or  vegetable food group. In addition, Secret Service officials said that some  merchants quickly learn that they do not need to restock their stores to  continue to redeem food stamps because stores aren\u2019t routinely checked  for 5 years unless there is some indication of a problem with the store.  Staff in one of the 10 FNS field offices we visited told us that they have to  authorize some retailers who seem suspicious, but they perform post- authorization visits of these stores to ensure they are legitimate.", "During the authorization process, FNS field offices rely on contractors to  inspect stores to ensure they meet program requirements, but FNS does  not independently verify the inspectors\u2019 reports. The inspector provides  the final check that a store exists, it has food in each of the required food  groups, and the information provided on the application for authorization  to become a food stamp retailer is correct. However, at one field office, a  contract inspector was submitting false reports, allowing dishonest  retailers into the program.", "Oversight of retailers\u2019 entry into the program and early operations is  important because newly authorized retailers can quickly ramp up the  amount of food stamps they traffic, and there is no limit on the value of  food stamps a retailer can redeem in 1 month. At one field office location  where retailers are often innovative in their trafficking schemes, FNS  officials noticed that some retailers quickly escalated their trafficking  within 2 to 3 months after their initial authorization. As shown in figure 7,  one disqualified retailer\u2019s case file we reviewed at that field office showed  the store went from $500 in monthly food stamp redemptions to almost  $200,000 within 6 months. Redemption activity dropped precipitously after  the trafficking charge letter was sent to the retailer in late October. In its  application for food stamp authorization, this retailer estimated he would  have $180,000 of total annual food sales, yet the retailer was redeeming  more than that each month in food stamp benefits before being caught in a  Retailer Investigations Branch investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Access to Transaction Data Allow Trafficking to Continue for Months Undetected", "paragraphs": ["Although EBT implementation provides FNS with valuable transaction  data to identify potential trafficking, an FNS headquarters official said  monitoring and identification of traffickers will be improved once program  specialists have faster access to transaction data to detect suspicious  ramp-up activity. Currently, FNS receives each state\u2019s EBT transaction  data monthly on disk from the states\u2019 EBT contractors. Using this process,  the program specialists would not be aware of a retailer\u2019s rapid ramp-up  activity until they had 2 months\u2019 worth of transaction data, in the third  month after the retailer\u2019s authorization. Then, following the normal case  development process, a charge letter would not be sent to the store until  the fourth month, leading to possible disqualification in the fifth month.  According to this official, as retailers learned that FNS would eventually  discover them by analyzing their EBT transactions, they responded by  ramping up their trafficking activity more quickly to make a quick profit  before FNS could take action.", "FNS officials told us they believe that the solution to combating rapid  ramp-up trafficking is for FNS to receive EBT transaction data daily. FNS  systems could then monitor the data more quickly and produce daily  reports of rapidly increasing amounts of retailer transactions called \u201cspike  reports.\u201d In order for FNS to receive so much data on a daily basis, it is  working on building large data pipelines from the states\u2019 EBT processors  and developing its ability to manage that data before the end of this year.

One field official said  that there is a large network of trafficking retailers in her field office area  that dissects the charge letters sent to traffickers to determine what  analyses FNS conducts and to teach other retailers how to elude  detection. Secret Service officials confirmed the existence of fraud  networks in this area and said that one ringleader will recruit, encourage,  and reward an entire family and the friends of that family for trafficking  food stamp benefits.", "Some retailers have also found new ways to exploit the EBT technology  and continue to traffic. In her July 2003 testimony, the USDA Inspector  General reported that her office had recently identified a fraudulent  scheme that, while rare, appeared to be growing in the Food Stamp  Program. The OIG noticed that some authorized retailers were moving  their point-of-sale terminals to an unauthorized location, such as an  unauthorized store or apartment, for trafficking purposes. In its  Semiannual Report to Congress for the first half of fiscal year 2004, the  OIG reports that four individuals moved the authorized terminals to  different locations in Chicago so they could exchange cash for food stamp  benefits away from the authorized stores and possible detection. This  allowed them to conduct a large number of transactions one after another.  These individuals had been sentenced to serve from 15 to 57 months in  prison and ordered to pay $29.1 million in restitution for defrauding the  Food Stamp Program in this way from the fall of 1997 through August  2001. OIG headquarters officials told us that moving authorized and  unauthorized terminals remains a significant area of concern because of  the large volume of money that could be redeemed quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FNS Has Not Taken the Next Steps to Target Its Monitoring Resources to High Risk Areas", "paragraphs": ["FNS has not taken the steps to ensure that it identifies those areas or  stores that are at highest risk for trafficking so that it can allocate its  resources accordingly. FNS has made good use of EBT transaction data to  produce its Watch List to identify suspicious transaction patterns and  target certain stores. It has also established task forces of undercover  investigators when it identifies geographic areas needing additional  coverage. However, it is now at a point where it can begin to formulate  more sophisticated analyses to identify high risk areas and target its  resources. For example, certain states have a disproportionate share of the  disqualified stores compared with the number of food stamp recipients in  their states, yet it is not clear whether these numbers indicate that  trafficking is more common in those states or whether FNS program  specialists and investigators have engaged in more intensive pursuit of  traffickers in those areas. Our analysis of FNS\u2019s database of retailers  showed that of the 9,808 stores permanently disqualified from the Food  Stamp Program, about 35 percent were in just 4 states: New York, Illinois,  Texas, and Florida, and yet about 26 percent of food stamp recipients lived  in those states. However, FNS headquarters officials did not know the  number of program specialists in the field offices in these states who  devote a portion of their time to monitoring food stamp transactions and  initiating paper cases. Moreover, FNS officials believe there are probably  other areas of the country where trafficking is occurring that may warrant  further attention or additional resources, such as California, where fewer  than 5 percent of all permanent store disqualifications occurred and about  8 percent of food stamp recipients live. However, FNS officials have not  yet developed a clear strategy or criteria to systematically identify those  areas and reallocate resources in response.", "In addition, some retailers and store locations have a history of program  violations that lead up to permanent disqualifications, but FNS did not  have a system in place to ensure these stores were quickly targeted for  heightened attention. Our analysis showed that, of the 9,808 stores that  had been permanently disqualified from the program, about 90 percent  were disqualified for their first detected offense. However, 9.4 percent of  the disqualified retailers had shown early indications of problems before  being disqualified. About 4.3 percent of these retailers had received a civil  money penalty, 4.3 percent had received a warning letter for program  violations, and 0.8 percent had received a temporary disqualification.  Most of these stores were small and may present a higher risk of future  trafficking than others, yet FNS does not necessarily target them for  speedy attention.", "Further, some store locations may be at risk of trafficking because a series  of different owners had trafficked there. After an owner was disqualified,  field office officials told us the store would reopen under new owners who  continued to traffic with the store\u2019s clientele. One field office official  would like to be able to bar these repeat store locations, while another  suggested a 90-day waiting period before a new owner of a disqualified  store location could qualify as an authorized food stamp retailer. As table 3  shows, our analysis of FNS\u2019s database of retailers found that about 174, or  1.8 percent, of the store addresses had a series of different owners over  time who had been permanently disqualified for trafficking at that same  location, totaling 369 separate disqualifications. In one case, a store in the  District of Columbia had 10 different owners who were each disqualified  for trafficking, consuming FNS\u2019s limited compliance-monitoring resources.", "Our analysis of the data on these stores with multiple disqualified owners  indicates that FNS officials found this type of trafficking in a handful of  cities and states. Almost 60 percent of repeat store locations were in six  states and 44 percent were in 8 cities, often concentrated in small areas.  For example, as figure 8 shows, 14 repeat store locations were clustered in  downtown areas of both Brooklyn and Baltimore. However, it is not clear  whether these data indicate heightened efforts of compliance staff or  whether trafficking is more common in these areas. Regardless, early  monitoring of high-risk locations when stores change hands could be an  efficient use of resources.", "Efficient use of resources is particularly important because available  compliance-monitoring resources have decreased in recent years. As the  importance of paper cases has grown, the compliance-monitoring  workload has gradually shifted to field office program specialists at a time  when overall program resources have dwindled.

The most  severe FNS penalty that most traffickers face is disqualification from the  program, and FNS must rely on other entities to conduct investigations  that could lead to prosecution. For example, in the food-stamp-trafficking  ramp-up case previously cited, this retailer redeemed almost $650,000 of  food stamps over the course of 9 months before being disqualified from  the program in November 2004. As of August 2006, there was no active  investigation of this retailer.", "Because of the time it takes to develop an investigation for prosecution  and the costs associated with doing so, a natural tension exists between  the goal of disqualifying a retailer as quickly as possible to prevent further  trafficking and seeking prosecution of the retailer to recover losses and  deter other traffickers. One FNS field office official said it can take months  or even years to investigate a case for prosecution and in the meantime the  store continues to traffic. FNS can disqualify a retailer relatively quickly\u2014 thereby saving federal dollars from misuse\u2014compared with the time OIG  needs to investigate a case for referral for prosecution.

In response, some  states actively pursue and disqualify these recipients. For example,  Illinois has used these lists to disqualify more than 3,000 of the almost  20,000 suspected recipients referred to them since 1999 through FNS  retailer investigations. In addition to pursuing recipients who are  suspected of trafficking, one state told us it uses some recipients charged  with trafficking to gather evidence against retailers.", "However, FNS field offices do not always send lists of suspected individual  traffickers to states or counties administering the program, and not all  states investigate the individuals on these lists. Officials from four FNS  field offices we visited said they don\u2019t send the list of recipients suspected  of trafficking to the states or counties administering the program. Other  field office officials said they send the lists to their states, but they are not  acted upon because states do not have the resources to conduct  investigations into recipients who may be trafficking. FNS headquarters  officials also believe that not many states are acting on the lists they  receive because it is difficult and potentially costly to prove individual  cases of recipient trafficking. One field office official said that store  owners represent only half of the problem and that states could do more  to address trafficking. If states could reduce recipients\u2019 trafficking, it  would curb retailer trafficking as well.", "Instead of focusing on food stamp recipients who traffic their benefits,  states are using their resources to focus on recipients who improperly  collect benefits, according to FNS officials. The current incentive  structure for the states includes performance bonuses to reward states for  correcting payment errors and reducing error rates. In addition, states are  penalized financially if their error rates reach a specific threshold for   2 years in a row. States that do investigate recipient traffickers can keep  35 percent of any monies they recover; however, it may be difficult to  recover the funds, and the amount recovered may be minimal. When a  state proves a recipient has trafficked, the recipient can no longer receive  benefits, but other members of the family can. States can try to recover  some of the benefits trafficked by deducting a set amount from the family  benefits each month. However, pursuing recipients who traffic can be  costly and time-consuming. Taken together, these factors can result in  states\u2019 choosing to focus on improper benefit payments rather than  recipient trafficking. This inaction by some states allows recipients  suspected of trafficking to continue the practice, and such inaction also  leaves a pool of recipients ready and willing to traffic their benefits as  soon as a disqualified store reopens under new management. In fact,  California field office staffs have begun to track suspected trafficking  recipients from a disqualified store to a new store, where they begin  exhibiting the same patterns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the Food Stamp Program, stores are the frontline for ensuring that  recipients use food stamps to purchase appropriate food items, and these  stores operate with no day-to-day oversight. Although the vast majority of  stores do not traffic food stamp benefits, each year millions of dollars of  program benefits that were awarded to provide food to needy individuals  and families are trafficked. FNS, using EBT data, has made significant  progress in taking advantage of new opportunities to monitor and  disqualify traffickers. However, because store owners can begin trafficking  as soon as they are authorized to participate in the program, pocketing  large sums of cash for months before FNS can detect potentially  suspicious transaction patterns, early monitoring and detection are critical  to curbing larger losses to the program. FNS has at its fingertips a wealth  of information that could help it develop additional criteria to target  certain stores or geographic areas for early or more heightened  monitoring, including the presence of low food stocks, the location of  repeat offender stores, areas of recipient trafficking, and areas with  evidence of organized fraudulent activity. FNS\u2019s loss of monitoring staff in  recent years magnifies the need to ensure that compliance-monitoring  resources are focused on those stores and geographic areas at greatest  risk of trafficking. A more focused effort to target and disqualify these  stores could help FNS meet its continuing challenge of ensuring that  stores are available and operating in areas of high need while still  maintaining program integrity.", "Yet, as EBT has limited the amount of benefits that can be trafficked at  one time, there is less chance the retailer or the recipient will be  prosecuted. There is no easy solution to this lack of deterrence. Law  enforcement agencies are making decisions to efficiently use their  resources by targeting larger or more critical cases. And FNS currently  does not have authority to impose stiffer penalties on retailers other than  program disqualification or in limited situations, civil money penalties in  lieu of disqualification. Food stamp trafficking will continue to be lucrative  for retailers as long as the potential rewards outweigh the penalties and  there are recipients willing to exchange their benefits for cash and  resources are not used for investigations and penalizing recipients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture direct  FNS to take the following five actions.", "To help ensure that its limited compliance-monitoring resources are used  efficiently, FNS should    develop additional criteria to help identify stores most likely to traffic and  their locations; conduct risk assessments, using compliance and other  data, to systematically identify stores and areas that meet these criteria;  and allocate resources accordingly, and   provide more targeted and early oversight of stores that meet these  criteria, such as conducting early monitoring or follow-up inspections.", "To provide further deterrence for trafficking, FNS should    develop a strategy to increase the penalties for trafficking, working with  the OIG as needed.
