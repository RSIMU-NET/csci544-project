Because of questions about whether the program, called Project Liberty, had spent all the funds it received from the federal government, GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which the program expended the funds awarded from the federal government, (2) whether the federal government had an effective process in place to determine the amount of funds to provide the program, (3) whether the federal government had adequate financial oversight of the program, and (4) steps taken by the federal government and New York State to assess the program's effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the period September 11, 2001, through September 30, 2004, Project Liberty reported that it had expended approximately $121 million, or three-quarters of the $154.9 million in grants awarded by FEMA, leaving a remaining balance of $33.9 million. The majority of the remaining balance, approximately $32 million, related to unresolved issues involving the adequacy of supporting documentation for the New York City Department of Education's (NYC DOEd) expense claims. As of March 31, 2005, city and state officials told GAO they had accepted alternative forms of supporting evidence related to $5.2 million in NYC DOEd expenses; however, this alternative evidence provides only limited assurance of the propriety of the claimed amounts. It is unclear whether similar alternative sources of evidence will be accepted for the remaining $26.8 million in NYC DOEd expense claims. FEMA assisted state officials in developing estimated funding needs for Project Liberty immediately after the terrorist attacks. By necessity, these initial budgets were developed using estimates established during the initial stages of the disaster. However, FEMA never required Project Liberty to prepare adjusted budgets to reflect new information or subsequent changes to the program. As a result, FEMA did not have realistic budget information to assess how city and state officials were planning to spend Project Liberty grant funds. FEMA assigned primary responsibility for oversight and monitoring to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) through an interagency agreement. Although SAMHSA had procedures in place to monitor Project Liberty's delivery of services, it performed only limited monitoring of financial information reported by Project Liberty about the cost of those services. For example, while SAMHSA received periodic financial reports from Project Liberty, it did not perform basic analyses of expenditures in order to obtain a specific understanding of how the grant funds were being used and, as noted above, did not have updated budget information to gauge how actual spending compared to budgets. As a result, SAMHSA was not in a position to exercise a reasonable level of oversight to ensure that funds were being used efficiently and effectively in addressing the needs of those affected by the September 11 attacks. Both the state of New York and the federal government have taken steps to assess how Project Liberty delivered services. These assessments were ongoing as of March 2005.

Specifically, FEMA awarded the state of New York $22.7 million  for an Immediate Services Program (ISP) on September 24, 2001, with  subsequent amendments bringing the ISP total to $22.8 million.  In addition,  FEMA awarded the state of New York $132.1 million for a Regular Services  Program (RSP) on June 14, 2002.", "The state of New York operated the crisis counseling and public education  program under the name Project Liberty.

In response to this request, we  reviewed the use of funds given to the state of New York by the federal  government by determining (1) the extent to which Project Liberty  expended the funds awarded from the federal government, (2) whether the  federal government had an effective process in place to determine the  amount of funds to provide Project Liberty, (3) whether the federal  government had adequate financial oversight of Project Liberty, and  (4) steps taken by the federal government and the state of New York to  assess the effectiveness of the program in meeting stated objectives and  the results of these assessments.", "To address these objectives, we (1) reviewed documentation relating to the  expenditure of Project Liberty funds through September 30, 2004, the most  recent data available as of March 31, 2005, the end of our fieldwork, and  found it sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report; (2) reviewed the  grant applications and correspondence used to determine funding;  (3) assessed the sufficiency of the federal government\u2019s financial oversight  of Project Liberty in light of GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government; and (4) reviewed assessments of Project Liberty.

The presidential declaration allowed the state of New  York to apply for federal assistance to help recover from the disaster.   FEMA was responsible for coordinating the federal response to the  September 11 terrorist attacks and providing assistance through a variety  of programs, including the CCP.  The CCP was authorized in section 416 of  the Stafford Act to help alleviate the psychological distress caused or  aggravated by disasters declared eligible for federal assistance by the  President.  Through the CCP, FEMA released federal grant awards to  supplement the state of New York\u2019s ability to respond to the psychological  distress caused by the September 11 terrorist attacks through the provision  of short-term crisis counseling services to victims and training for crisis  counselors.", "FEMA relied on SAMHSA to provide expertise related to crisis counseling  and public education for Project Liberty.  FEMA assigns SAMHSA\u2019s  responsibilities for the CCP through an annual interagency agreement.   These responsibilities included, among other things, providing technical  assistance, monitoring the progress of programs conducted under the CCP,  and performing program oversight. Within SAMHSA, the Center for Mental  Health Services (CMHS) carried out these responsibilities for Project  Liberty.  CMHS received support from SAMHSA\u2019s Division of Grants  Management, which provides grant oversight.", "NYS OMH established Project Liberty under the CCP to offer crisis  counseling and public education services throughout the five boroughs of  New York City and 10 surrounding counties free of charge to anyone  affected by the World Trade Center disaster and its aftermath.  The areas  served by Project Liberty are shown in the shaded areas of figure 1.", "The state of New York\u2019s primary role was to administer, oversee, and guide  Project Liberty\u2019s program design, implementation, and evaluation and pay  service providers, but not to provide services itself.  New York City and the  surrounding counties contracted with over 200 service providers and were  responsible for overseeing day-to-day activities.  Figure 2 shows the  organization structure of Project Liberty at the federal, state, and local  levels.", "Under the CCP, Project Liberty\u2019s goal was to serve New York City and the  10 surrounding counties by assisting those affected by the September 11  terrorist attacks to recover from their psychological reactions and regain  predisaster level of functioning.  The CCP supports services that are short- term interventions with individuals and groups experiencing psychological  reactions to a presidentially declared disaster and its aftermath.  Crisis  counseling services were primarily delivered to disaster survivors through  outreach, or face-to-face contact with survivors in familiar settings (e.g.,  neighborhoods, churches, community centers, and schools).  Although the  CCP does not support long-term, formal mental health services such as  medications, office-based therapy, diagnostic services, psychiatric  treatment, or substance abuse treatment, FEMA approved an enhanced  services program for Project Liberty.  This enhanced services program  allowed for an expansion of services, including enhanced screening  methods; a broader array of brief counseling approaches; and additional  training, technical assistance, and supervision to a set of service providers.   These enhanced services were intended to address the needs of individuals  who continued to experience trauma symptoms and functional impairment  after initial crisis counseling but did not need long-term mental health  services.", "Project Liberty was funded through two separate, but related, grant  programs:  the ISP and RSP.  The ISP grant was designed to fund Project  Liberty for the first 60 days following the disaster declaration.  Because  there was a continuing need for crisis counseling services, the ISP was  extended to last about 9 months, until the RSP began.  The RSP grant was  awarded and was designed to continue to provide funding for an additional  9 months of crisis counseling services, but was extended to last for 2 \u00bd  years.  Figure 3 shows key milestones for Project Liberty.", "For the approved ISP application, FEMA made funds available directly to  the state. Under the RSP, after approval, funds were transferred from  FEMA to SAMHSA, which awarded the grant to the state of New York  through SAMHSA\u2019s grants management process.  The state of New York, in  turn, disbursed funds to the service providers and local governments  through the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

As shown in figure 5, these claims were to have multiple levels of  review to determine whether the expenses claimed were allowable under  the CCP\u2019s fiscal guidelines.  This review structure, which placed primary  responsibility for reviewing claims on the local government units, was  based on the state of New York\u2019s existing grant management policies.   Additional controls for Project Liberty included (1) NYS OMH site visits to  service providers in New York City and surrounding counties; (2) closeout  audits by independent auditors of certain New York City service providers  to test whether claims were documented and allowable; and (3) annual  audits of New York City and surrounding counties conducted under the Single Audit Act, which requires independent auditors to provide an  opinion on whether the financial statements are fairly presented, a report  on internal control related to the major programs, and a report on  compliance with key laws, regulations, and the provisions of the grant  agreements.", "Our publication, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, provides a road map for entities to establish control for all  aspects of their operations and a basis against which entities can evaluate  their control structures.

These standards  require that the expenditure of grant funds be supported by detailed  documentation, such as canceled checks, paid bills, time and attendance  records, and contract and subgrant award documents.  According to NYC  DOEd officials, they could not meet the documentation standards  established by NYS OMH because (1) NYC DOEd reorganized on July 1,  2003, which coincided with the delivery of crisis counseling services under  the Project Liberty grant, resulting in significant loss of staff, loss of  institutional knowledge, and therefore lost or diminished ability to retrieve  supporting documentation, and (2) NYC DOEd\u2019s complex financial systems  cannot produce the type of transaction-specific documentation required by  NYS OMH and makes the process of retrieving supporting documentation  unwieldy and administratively burdensome.", "A SAMHSA official told us SAMHSA was aware of issues involving the  supporting documentation for the NYC DOEd expense claims; however,  because officials viewed it as a grantee issue, they have had limited  involvement with NYS OMH\u2019s efforts to resolve these issues.

First and foremost, the  memos do not provide the type of supporting documentation necessary to  verify the validity of the claimed expenses as required by the federal  documentation standards.  Second, the memos are not certified by an  external source, such as an independent auditor.  Third, the memos were  prepared solely to support NYC DOEd\u2019s Project Liberty expenses and may  not represent written policies and procedures that existed during the time  the claimed expenditures were incurred.

The plan of services described the state\u2019s plan for treating the identified  population, including segments of the population needing special services  or outreach methods such as counseling and training in various languages.

In preparing the  budget, the state of New York relied on SAMHSA\u2019s Budget Estimating and  Reporting Tool, which was designed to assist states in developing budgets  consistent with FEMA guidelines.  The state of New York took two  different approaches in constructing the ISP and RSP budgets for Project  Liberty. The ISP budget used estimates of administrative costs and a simple  direct services cost calculation. The direct services costs were based on  the estimated number of people needing crisis counseling services, the  estimated average length of treatment each person would need, the  estimated hourly rate for crisis counselors, and the estimated length of the  ISP. The RSP budget, on the other hand, was prepared by the state of New  York based on estimates provided by NYS OMH, each of the New York City  boroughs, and the 10 surrounding counties eligible for CCP grant funding.", "Once the state of New York submitted its ISP and RSP grant applications,  FEMA had processes in place to review and approve them.  Although the  processes differed, both shared common elements. The first step for both  applications was a technical review conducted by the FEMA regional office  with jurisdiction over the state of New York to ensure that the applications  had a direct link to the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Once this technical  review was completed, the applications were sent to FEMA headquarters  and to SAMHSA for review and comment. In addition, the RSP was  reviewed by a panel of mental health professionals who had experience  with CCP grants. The ISP and RSP review processes also differed in that  FEMA\u2019s regional office had final decision authority for the ISP application  while FEMA headquarters had final decision authority for the RSP  application.

However, FEMA and  SAMHSA never required the budgets to be modified to reflect new  information or significant changes to the program.", "The estimates used by the state of New York to develop its initial needs  assessment, or number of people it believed would need crisis counseling  services, included several risk factors and loss categories. In keeping with  existing CCP policy, FEMA and SAMHSA encouraged the state of New York  to modify the needs assessment formula by adjusting the loss categories of  affected persons and the risk factors for each of those loss categories to  better reflect the situation in New York. The state of New York also  estimated the number of direct victims in each loss category because  official numbers were not available.  For example, the official number of  deaths was not known until more than 2 years after the disaster.  As a result  of these estimates, the needs assessment for the state of New York\u2019s ISP  application determined that 2.3 million people would need crisis  counseling services as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11,  2001.  With the RSP application, the needs assessment formula was  modified to estimate the pervasive reactions to the disaster and to update  the loss category numbers, such as the number of people dead, missing, or  hospitalized.  These modifications increased the estimate of the people  who would need crisis counseling to 3.4 million.", "We found that based on the approved budgets for the ISP and RSP, Project  Liberty estimated that it would need $154.9 million to provide crisis  counseling and public education to the estimated 3.4 million people and  training for Project Liberty staff who would be delivering these services, at  a cost of approximately $46 per person.  In its report for the period ending  September 30, 2004, Project Liberty estimated that it had provided crisis  counseling to 1.5 million people at a cost of $121 million, or approximately  $83 per person.", "Another estimate used in preparing the grant applications was the length of  time needed to carry out the services identified in the plan of services. The  state of New York used the maximum length of service provision allowed  by FEMA regulations in its ISP and RSP applications, 60 days and 9 months,  respectively.  However, crisis counseling services were actually provided  for approximately 9 months under the ISP and over 30 months under the  RSP.", "In addition, the state of New York initially understood that crisis counseling  and public education services offered by Project Liberty would be limited  to the services normally allowed by the CCP, such as short-term individual  and group crisis counseling, community outreach, and training for crisis  counselors.

Despite these major changes in the program, FEMA and SAMHSA did not  require and Project Liberty did not prepare adjusted budgets to reflect their  revised plans for meeting the needs of the victims of September 11.

SAMHSA received  periodic financial reports but did not perform basic analyses of  expenditures to obtain a specific understanding of how Project Liberty was  using federal funds.  In addition, as discussed above, budget information  was outdated and therefore an ineffective tool to monitor actual  expenditures.  SAMHSA\u2019s limited level of oversight over Project Liberty\u2019s  financial information was driven in part by its assessment that the program  was not high risk, but this assessment did not fully consider the magnitude,  complexity, and unique nature of the program and was not revisited even  after significant program changes occurred.  As a result, SAMHSA was not  in a position to exercise a reasonable level of oversight to ensure that funds  were used efficiently and effectively in addressing the needs of those  affected by the September 11 terrorist attacks.", "SAMHSA\u2019s oversight for Project Liberty included review of service delivery  information and identification of unusual items included in Project  Liberty\u2019s program reports, eight site visits, and routine communication with  NYS OMH and FEMA.  These oversight activities helped SAMHSA gain  assurance that NYS OMH was delivering appropriate services.  However,  SAMHSA\u2019s oversight of these services did not directly link with, and  therefore did not provide assurance related to, financial information  reported by Project Liberty.  In addition to requiring Project Liberty to  submit budgets to show how it planned to use federal funds, FEMA  regulations also required Project Liberty to periodically submit financial  reports to show how funds were actually spent.  Required financial reports  included quarterly expenditure reports, a final accounting of funds, and a  final voucher.  SAMHSA officials told us they did some high-level review of  the financial information provided to determine how quickly the program  was using grant funds and when the grant funds should be made available  to NYS OMH.  However, they did not perform basic analyses of  expenditures to obtain a specific understanding of how Project Liberty was  using federal funds.", "We found that SAMHSA did not use financial information submitted by  Project Liberty to conduct basic analytical reviews of how funds were  being spent and whether this spending was consistent with the budgeted  program expenditures.  Table 2 illustrates a basic analysis we performed of  Project Liberty\u2019s reported and budgeted expenditures for the period  June 14, 2002, through September 30, 2004, which identified significant  differences by category between reported expenditures and budget.", "Notwithstanding the fact that budgets were not updated for major program  changes, several of these differences should have raised questions about  whether Project Liberty was using federal funds within allowable  categories and within its approved budget.  For example, the Project  Liberty personnel budget was over $93 million; however, as of  September 30, 2004, over 26 months into the program that was initially  planned for completion in 9 months, it had reported personnel  expenditures of only about $26 million, for a difference of about $67  million.  A SAMHSA official said that because of the way Project Liberty  reported its expenditures, SAMHSA officials could not track its financial  reports to its budget.  As a result, we found that SAMHSA was not aware of  the significant variations between Project Liberty\u2019s reported expenditures  and budget and did not make inquiries of Project Liberty officials to obtain  an understanding of why these variations were occurring. Some of the  differences between reported and budgeted expenditures may have  resulted from the fact that Project Liberty was not required to formally  adjust the initial program budget to reflect significant changes.  However,  the differences may also have raised questions about whether SAMHSA\u2019s  understanding of how the program was planning to spend funds was  consistent with actual spending patterns.   Comparisons between Project  Liberty\u2019s reported budget and expenditures could have helped SAMHSA  better assess the status of the program to allow it to take effective action to  ensure that Project Liberty was using federal funds to provide the most  value for victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.", "The differences between Project Liberty\u2019s reported budget and  expenditures may also have been caused by inconsistencies in financial  information submitted by Project Liberty.  FEMA and SAMHSA did not  provide detailed guidance on how to classify CCP expenditures but instead  left Project Liberty to interpret how expenditures should be classified.  We  found that Project Liberty expenditures were not always consistently  reported to FEMA and SAMHSA.  For example, Project Liberty did not  consistently classify evaluation expenditures.  If an NYS OMH employee  was evaluating the program, the expenditure was classified as personnel,  but if the work was contracted to someone outside of NYS OMH, the  expenditure was classified as evaluation.  As a result, SAMHSA could not  reliably use Project Liberty\u2019s financial reports to determine how much it  cost to evaluate the program.  By obtaining a better understanding of how  federal funds were spent by Project Liberty, SAMHSA would have improved  its ability to determine whether funds were used most efficiently and  effectively in carrying out the objectives of the program.", "SAMHSA\u2019s limited oversight of Project Liberty\u2019s financial information was  driven in part by its own assessment that the program was not high risk.   SAMHSA\u2019s oversight of Project Liberty included an initial assessment of the  risk associated with the grantee.  SAMHSA applied risk factors identified in  HHS regulations regarding grants, including financial management issues,  such as financial stability and experience in handling federal grants, to  RFMH, the fiscal agent for NYS OMH responsible for making payments to  service providers.  For example, SAMHSA reviewed the result of RFMH\u2019s  fiscal year 2001 financial audit that was required by the Single Audit Act  and found that RFMH received an unqualified audit opinion while handling  a total of about $62 million in federal funds.  SAMHSA concluded that  RFMH had a strong track record for handling federal funds and classified  RFMH as not high risk.  Based in part on this risk assessment, SAMHSA  officials told us staff with financial backgrounds were not actively involved  in the oversight of Project Liberty.", "However, we found that SAMHSA\u2019s risk assessment only considered risks  associated with RFMH and did not consider other potential risks  associated with the Project Liberty grant.  For example, the assessment did  not consider all significant interactions in the complex federal, state, and  local government environment that existed for Project Liberty; the amount  of the RSP grant award, which was the largest RSP grant ever made by  FEMA; or the geographic complexities of the program, including the size of  the area affected and the diversity of the community being served.  In  addition, SAMHSA did not revisit its initial risk assessment even after the  program encountered significant changes and challenges, including the  design of the first-ever enhanced services program and the documentation  issues with NYC DOEd expenses, which have yet to be resolved. As a  result, SAMHSA\u2019s level of oversight was not in line with the challenges and  complexities that increased the risks associated with Project Liberty.", "Based in part on its risk assessment process, SAMHSA\u2019s oversight of  Project Liberty was primarily carried out by its programmatic staff who  focused on activities that did not directly link to the financial information  being reported by NYS OMH.  Without useful financial information,  including updated budgets, and without analyses of the financial  information Project Liberty was reporting, SAMHSA was not in a position  to exercise a reasonable level of oversight to ensure that grant funds were  effectively used to address the needs of those affected by the September 11  terrorist attacks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessments of Project Liberty Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["Both the state of New York and the federal government have taken steps to  assess how Project Liberty delivered services.  NYS OMH is conducting its  own assessment of Project Liberty and partnered with NYAM to obtain  information from telephone surveys.  SAMHSA contracted with NCPTSD, a  center within the Department of Veterans Affairs, to conduct a case study  of New York\u2019s response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, with a  primary focus on Project Liberty.  Both NYS OMH and NCPTSD\u2019s overall  assessments of the program were ongoing as of March 2005.  FEMA plans  to consider lessons learned from NYS OMH and NCPTSD when conducting  its own internal review of the CCP.", "NYS OMH is conducting an evaluation of Project Liberty, which includes  designated funding for program evaluation.  This nonstatistical evaluation  consists of several components, including analysis of data collected by  service providers documenting services delivered through encounter data  forms, recipient feedback through written questionnaires and telephone  surveys, provider feedback through written reports and staff surveys,  and other initiatives. The data collected by service providers was the  primary method used to assess the services delivered by the program.   Based on these data, NYS OMH preliminarily found that Project Liberty had  reached a large number of people affected by the September 11 terrorist  attacks and that it was successful in reaching many diverse communities.   NYS OMH reported that 95 percent of providers who responded to its  surveys rated the overall quality of services provided as good or excellent.   NYS OMH also reported that the majority of respondents to its recipient  surveys indicated that they have returned to their predisaster mental health  condition, a goal of Project Liberty.  However, according to NYS OMH, the  recipient surveys were made available beginning in July 2003 to  organizations providing crisis counseling for distribution to individuals  receiving services and therefore may not be representative of all Project  Liberty recipients.  NYS OMH did not report the number of providers who received surveys and reported a low response rate for recipients.   Because the number of surveys offered to providers was not disclosed and  because of low response rates for the recipient surveys, we were unable to  determine the level of coverage provided by these surveys.", "NYS OMH also partnered with NYAM, a not-for-profit organization  dedicated to enhancing public health through research, education, public  policy, and advocacy.  NYAM conducted nonstatistical telephone surveys in  2001 and 2002 of New Yorkers to assess the magnitude and duration of the  mental health effects of the terrorist attacks.  NYS OMH worked with  NYAM to assess the reach and recognition of Project Liberty by adding  questions to NYAM's ongoing September 11 telephone surveys.  NYAM and  NYS OMH reported that 24 percent of the respondents interviewed were  aware of Project Liberty and, among respondents who had heard of the  program, 67 percent had a good impression of the program.  However,  because the sampling methodology for the NYAM phone surveys was not  disclosed and because of low response rates, we were unable to determine  the survey coverage.", "Based on these evaluation activities, as well as their own experience with  Project Liberty, NYS OMH officials have begun to identify lessons to be  learned.  For example, they found that emergency mental health plans and  resources in place prior to September 11 were insufficient to fully respond  to the mental health impact of the terrorist attacks.  Much of the  infrastructure needed to implement Project Liberty, such as data collection  procedures and public education materials, had to be developed in the  immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks.  In addition, NYS OMH found  that the services covered by the CCP were not sufficient to meet the mental  health needs of the minority of individuals who developed severe and  persistent symptoms that substantially interfered with day-to-day  functioning.  Although the state of New York was given permission to  develop and implement an enhanced services program to meet the needs of  the more severely affected individuals, similar intensive interventions are  not currently routinely included as part of the FEMA CCP.  NYS OMH  officials told us that when their evaluation is completed, they expect that  they will have comprehensively identified best practices and obstacles  encountered and that they will make recommendations to FEMA and  SAMHSA for actions needed to better organize a mental health response to  future disasters funded by the CCP.", "SAMHSA entered into an interagency agreement with NCPTSD, a center  within the Department of Veterans Affairs, to conduct a case study of New  York\u2019s response to the September 11 terrorist attacks.  The primary purpose  of the NCPTSD case study was to identify lessons to be learned from New  York\u2019s experience that could be useful to other communities that might  have to respond to major disasters, including acts of terrorism.  As part of  its study, NCPTSD interviewed 103 individuals, including service providers  and management from 50 public and private provider organizations in New  York City and the surrounding counties.  NCPTSD used a qualitative  methodology to analyze the data to develop findings and  recommendations.  According to SAMHSA, the NCPTSD report is expected  to be issued as soon as all stakeholders\u2019 comments have been received and  considered.", "FEMA officials told us they plan to consider lessons learned from the  NCPTSD and NYS OMH assessments of Project Liberty through FEMA\u2019s  internal review of the CCP that was ongoing as of March 2005.  This  internal review is being conducted in partnership with SAMHSA and,  according to FEMA, will consider whether aspects of FEMA\u2019s CCP,  including its regulations and guidance, need to be improved.  For example,  FEMA plans to work with SAMHSA to consider the extent to which the  enhanced services should be included as a permanent part of the CCP.    FEMA officials told us that the internal review will have to be completed in  conjunction with their primary work responding to disasters; therefore,  they have not established a timetable to complete this review.

It further stated that our recommendations primarily  relate to the use of grant funds by NYC DOEd, and that no similar issues  were identified with respect to the use of funds by other program  subgrantees.", "Our report clearly acknowledges the unique and unprecedented  circumstances that led to the establishment of Project Liberty.  These  unique circumstances were largely the basis for our conclusion that Project  Liberty required a high level of federal oversight.  A number of red flags  signaled the need for a heightened federal role, including: the RSP grant  was the largest such grant ever made by FEMA; the program initially  designed to last about a year is now over 3 \u00bd years old and still ongoing,  with an extension being considered to September 30, 2005; and  reimbursements for approximately $32 million, representing over 20  percent of the total federal funds awarded, remained unresolved as of May  2005.  The fact that the level of federal oversight was not commensurate  with the unprecedented circumstances surrounding Project Liberty was  what led us to our findings and recommendations in this area.", "Five of our eight recommendations relate to strengthening federal financial  oversight of future CCP grants; two of the recommendations specifically  address the NYC DOEd use of grant funds; and the remaining  recommendation calls for ensuring that lessons learned from Project  Liberty will be used to improve future programs funded by the CCP.  Thus,  DHS was incorrect in stating that our recommendations primarily relate to  the NYC DOEd issues.", "As to FEMA\u2019s statement that we did not identify any other issues about the  use of grant funds, the scope of our work included determining the extent  to which Project Liberty expended grant funds and whether the federal  government had adequate financial oversight of Project Liberty.  Our work  did not address whether payments made, including those made by NYC  DOEd, were a valid use of federal resources.  We have no basis for reaching  the conclusion suggested by FEMA.", "SAMHSA\u2019s letter also discussed the unprecedented conditions surrounding  Project Liberty and, as discussed below, strongly disagreed with our  assessment that SAMHSA\u2019s financial oversight was limited.  SAMHSA also  stated that during a recent site visit, NYC DOEd\u2019s Chief Financial Officer  indicated that documentation was available to support claims as necessary.   SAMHSA further stated that it will be recommending that the NYS OMH  conduct an independent audit of these claims as one of the conditions of  approving an extension of the grant to September 30, 2005.  During our  fieldwork, we were consistently told by NYC DOHMH officials that NYC  DOEd had not been able to produce documentation for the majority of  expenses it incurred on behalf of Project Liberty that met the  documentation standards for reimbursement under federal grants. Given  ongoing questions about the existence of documentation supporting NYC  DOEd claims, the sufficiency of this documentation, or both, we agree that  an independent audit is appropriate.", "SAMHSA stated that overall, the federal oversight of Project Liberty was  appropriate, reasonable, and responsive to state and local needs.  SAMHSA  outlined several factors to support this statement, including that it received  financial data from the state of New York on a routine basis and monitored  the allocability, allowability, and reasonableness of project expenditures.   While SAMHSA acknowledged that project budget data were not updated  comprehensively, it stated that it did request and receive updated budget  information in several instances, particularly in conjunction with project  extensions.  SAMHSA further stated that we had not cited any problems  with program expenditures but instead seemed to focus on differences  between classification of budgeted and reported expenditures.  SAMHSA  acknowledged that the budget was not prepared in the same format as  reported expenditures, and stated that inconsistent categorization of  expense accounts were largely the reason for the classification  discrepancies we highlighted in our report.", "Our conclusion that SAMHSA\u2019s oversight of Project Liberty\u2019s financial  information was limited was based in large part on the fact that the  SAMHSA did not have a basis to reliably monitor how Project Liberty was  using federal funds, since, as SAMHSA acknowledged, it did not have  updated budget information and the reported expenditure data were not  accurate due to classification discrepancies.  At the time of our review,  SAMHSA was not aware of these discrepancies because it had not been  conducting basic analyses, such as comparisons between Project Liberty\u2019s  budgeted and reported expenses.  Further, there were no staff with  financial backgrounds involved with the oversight of Project Liberty  expenditures.  SAMHSA\u2019s limited oversight was based in part on the fact  that it did not deem the project high risk from a financial standpoint,  despite the complex federal, state, and local environment, the fact that this  was by far the largest RSP grant ever awarded by FEMA, the size and  diversity of the community being served, and the overall challenging and  changing circumstances of September 11.  Overall, we found that  SAMHSA\u2019s level of oversight was not in line with these challenges and  complexities associated with Project Liberty.", "SAMHSA went on to state that in its opinion, classification of Project  Liverty as high risk simply based on total estimated project expenditures  would be inappropriate.  It further noted that there is no regulatory  mechanism allowing SAMHSA to assess risk on a complex federal, state,  and local government environment as was specified in our report.", "We did not suggest that the risk classification should simply be based on  total estimated project expenditures.  As discussed above, our report  clearly delineates a number of different risk factors that should have been  considered in the risk classification.  Further, we disagree that the current  regulatory mechanism would not allow SAMHSA to consider these risk  factors in making its risk assessment of Project Liberty.  While current  regulations do not require SAMHSA to consider programmatic factors in its  risk assessment, they do not prevent SAMHSA from considering risk  factors other than those delineated in its regulations in its overall  assessment of the program and its operations.  As noted by SAMHSA in its  written comments, Project Liberty was by far the largest and most complex  effort in the 30-year history of the CCP and presented unique and  unprecedented challenges for government authorities at all levels.
