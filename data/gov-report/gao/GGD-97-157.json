These organizations reflected a range of ADR practices; had ADR processes in place a sufficient length of time to provide information about use, outcome, and lessons learned; and had at least some use or outcome data available. In the private sector, we studied Brown & Root, Inc.; Hughes Electronics Corporation; the Polaroid Corporation; Rockwell International Corporation; and TRW Inc. In the federal sector, we studied the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Air Force, the Postal Service, the Department of State, and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

Many private sector firms turned to ADR to supplement their traditional ways of handling disputes (e.g., through the chain of command) with the intent of reducing the number of litigations. For federal organizations, ADR offered a way to avoid the burdens associated with both the administrative redress system and litigation by federal employees. Additionally, the use of ADR in the private and federal sectors was spurred in the early 1990s by a dramatic increase in the number of discrimination complaints, along with the costs, time, and frustration involved in attempting to resolve them. Several new laws and regulatory changes made companies and agencies even more likely to develop ADR processes. Moreover, in some quarters\u2014such as EEOC\u2014a recognition emerged that the interest-based approach that is the basis for some ADR techniques can be a constructive alternative to adversarial, position-based processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Organizations Turned to ADR to Avoid the Time and Costs Involved in Resolving Workplace Disputes", "paragraphs": ["Private and federal organizations alike turned to ADR to reduce their involvement in costly and time-consuming processes: lawsuits and\u2014especially in the federal sector\u2014formal administrative redress procedures. In 1995, we reported that private employers were adopting ADR approaches because of their concerns about the costs\u2014in time, money, and good employee relationships\u2014of dealing with employment-related lawsuits and discrimination complaints. Among the five private companies we studied as case illustrations, four cited significant litigation costs as a reason for developing their ADR processes. One of the companies\u2014Brown & Root\u2014turned to ADR after spending over $400,000 to defend itself in a discrimination suit. Although the company prevailed in the case, an official referred to it as \u201cthe case nobody won,\u201d because of the human and financial costs it involved. (See app. II.)", "Among federal agencies, the primary reason officials reported for making ADR processes available has been to avoid the costs\u2014especially those involving time and organizational efficiency\u2014associated with the redress system. For example, according to EEOC data, the average length of time it took for federal agencies to close a discrimination complaint in fiscal year 1995 was 305 days. For cases that involved both a hearing and a later appeal to EEOC, the average processing time was 801 days. As we stated in our November 1995 testimony, the prospect of having to deal with the lengthy and complex dispute resolution system can have a broader impact: it can affect the willingness of federal managers to deal with conduct and performance issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interest in ADR Grew With the Rising Tide of Discrimination Complaints", "paragraphs": ["In both the private and federal sectors, the time and cost pressures that helped spur the use of ADR increased when the number of discrimination complaints rose sharply in the early 1990s.

In the federal sector, the increase in the number of discrimination complaints filed with federal agencies was also substantial, rising by 55 percent between fiscal years 1991 and 1995\u2014from 17,696 to 27,472. In December 1994, the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations reported that the rise in complaints lodged with administrative agencies and the increase in employment litigation had led employers, employee groups, and lawmakers to seek alternatives.", "The increase in discrimination complaints in the early 1990s can be attributed to several factors, according to EEOC, dispute resolution experts, and officials of organizations that we studied. They said that downsizing efforts resulted in a surge of complaints in both the private and federal sectors. In addition, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 established new grounds for employment-related complaints by the disabled. (Federal workers had gained similar protections under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.) Further, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 allows for the award of compensatory damages of up to $300,000 to employees in cases where the employer has engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination. While monetary damages had previously been available to private sector complainants, under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 federal as well as private sector workers can be awarded compensatory damages, and private sector workers can also receive punitive damages in certain circumstances. The act also provided for jury trials; according to the literature we reviewed, in jury trials, a plaintiff has a greater chance of prevailing and receiving a higher award than in a hearing before a judge alone. At each of the five federal agencies we studied as case illustrations, officials said the increase in complaints at their agencies was driven partly by the availability of monetary awards in addition to the previously available forms of relief. Officials at four federal agencies said it was typical for a complainant to request compensatory damages, regardless of the severity of the allegation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Laws and Regulatory Changes Encouraged ADR Use", "paragraphs": ["New legislative and regulatory developments in the 1990s have supported the use of ADR in resolving workplace disputes. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 encouraged the use of ADR where appropriate; and the Civil Rights Act of 1991 encouraged the use of ADR in EEO complaints lodged by workers in the private and federal sectors alike. Other examples include the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990, which required federal agencies to develop policies to address the use of ADR, and the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, which encouraged federal courts to use ADR in managing their caseloads. In addition to these statutory encouragements, regulatory features came into being as well. For example, EEOC issued regulations in 1992 that encouraged the use of ADR in the federal discrimination complaint process.

Traditional methods of dispute resolution\u2014lawsuits in the private sector, formal administrative redress procedures in the federal sector\u2014are predominately position-based. Simply stated, each disputant stakes out a position\u2014such as a complaint of discrimination or a defense against a complaint\u2014and hopes to win the case. But interest-based dispute resolution, which is the basis for some ADR techniques, focuses on determining the disputants\u2019 underlying interests and working to resolve their conflict at a more basic level, perhaps even bringing about a change in the work environment in which their conflicts developed.", "EEOC, among others, has noted the potential value of the interest-based approach to dispute resolution in reducing the number of formal discrimination complaints. Reflecting on the high number of discrimination complaints among federal employees, an EEOC study recently concluded that \u201c. . . there may be a sizable number of disputes in the 1614 process [so named for the regulations governing the process\u201429 C.F.R. Part 1614] which may not involve discrimination issues at all. They reflect, rather, basic communications problems in the workplace. Such issues may be brought into the EEO process as a result of a perception that there is no other forum available to air general workplace concerns.

In contrast, in the federal sector, a 1994 EEOC surveyshowed that about 31 percent of the 75 federal agencies responding to the survey had made ADR processes available for discrimination complaints. For the years after 1994, no data were available on the scope of private sector use of ADR in the workplace, but based on discussions with experts at the American Arbitration Association, the CPR Center for Dispute Resolution, and the Equal Employment Advisory Council, use of ADR in the private sector has increased since 1994. The most recent data on the use of ADR in the federal sector are from EEOC\u2019s 1996 survey. Based on responses of 87 federal agencies to that survey, the percentage of federal agencies making ADR available had risen to 49. We found, however, that in using percentages to compare the availability of ADR in the private and public sectors, a significant difference should be kept in mind. According to our July 1995 report, private firms using ADR generally made it available organizationwide.

The Justice Center of Atlanta, for example, reported a resolution rate of about 70 percent among the more than 50,000 cases it has mediated since 1977. The private sector organizations we studied applied mediation to a variety of workplace disputes, but whether the resolution rates varied with the nature of the dispute was unknown. Among the federal agencies we studied, only one\u2014Walter Reed Army Medical Center\u2014applied mediation to a variety of workplace disputes. At Walter Reed\u2019s ADR Center, the resolution rate varied with the nature of the dispute: 83 percent for disputes that the center classified as \u201ccommunication\u201d cases, 67 percent for EEO cases, and 43 percent for cases involving disciplinary actions.

But, according to the ADR Counsel at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the laws and regulations governing matters appealable to EEOC and MSPB do not prohibit its use. The Administrative Dispute Resolution Acts of 1990 and 1996 allow federal agencies to use arbitration if all the parties consent to its use, so long as the agency does not require any participant to consent to arbitration as a condition of entering into a contract or obtaining a benefit (e.g., employment). The 1996 act also requires that before using binding arbitration, the agency consult with the Department of Justice on its appropriateness. The act also requires that the arbitrator interpret and apply relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, legal procedures, and policy directives.", "More widely available in the private sector than in the federal sector, arbitration was available to employees outside the collective bargaining process at all five companies we studied.

No federal agency quantified with precision cost savings from ADR. The primary reason may be reflected in the experience of Agriculture, the only federal agency in our study that evaluated costs.

With this caveat, the team reported \u201cit seems fairly certain\u201d that EEO complaint-processing costs using boards were less than those under the traditional process. However, when settlement costs were considered, it was unclear whether boards were less costly because board-facilitated settlements were more costly than settlements and decisions in a comparison group of cases handled by the traditional process.

To introduce its pilot mediation program, the Postal Service conducted two 1-week conferences for managers, trained staff as mediators in each location, and developed a video about the program.

All five of the companies we studied offered arbitration, which, as noted earlier, is generally unavailable to federal employees outside the collective bargaining process. The arbitration policies of the five companies illustrated some key differences between their redress systems and those of the federal agencies we studied.", "Mediation was the most widely used technique among the organizations we studied. Most of the organizations reported using both internal and external mediators. Among the private firms, for example, Brown & Root and Polaroid reported they used their own employee volunteers as mediators most of the time. However, employees at these companies could ask for a mediator from an external source (such as the American Arbitration Association). Among the federal agencies, the Air Force selected mediators according to the issues involved\u2014its practice is to assign mediators to the kinds of cases in which they specialized\u2014and gave some consideration to the preference of the parties involved. The mediator could be an EEO counselor trained in mediation or an external mediator from another Air Force installation, another federal agency, a contractor, or a \u201cshared neutrals\u201d program.

Two of the three private sector companies that reported they regularly used mediation\u2014Brown & Root and Polaroid\u2014offered mediation for a wide array of issues and at any point in the dispute resolution process. The other company, TRW, usually offered external mediation as a step before arbitration. Among the federal agencies, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center was alone in having established mediation for a wide array of disputes. The others generally reported confining the use of mediation to discrimination and to a point very early in the discrimination complaint process. This point occurred after an employee had contacted his or her agency\u2019s EEO office (the first step in the federal discrimination complaint process) but before the employee had filed a formal complaint. Among the agencies we studied, mediation was offered at this point as an alternative to the counseling that is required by the regulations governing the discrimination complaint process.", "Just as federal employees are generally expected to exhaust the administrative processes available to them before going to court,employees of the private companies we studied were expected by their employers to use arbitration before initiating a lawsuit. In some ways, arbitration is to the private sector what the administrative redress system is to the federal sector: for example, both are adjudicatory in nature and intended to provide due process, and both are meant to provide employees with a means of being heard on issues that could be taken to court. But the arbitration policies of the private firms we studied provided at least two examples of ways in which this private sector dispute resolution method can differ significantly from the federal government\u2019s approach.", "First, at three of the firms we studied\u2014Brown & Root, Hughes Electronics, and Rockwell\u2014employees were required, as a condition of employment, to use arbitration in lieu of litigation to settle disputes. (See apps. II, III, and V.) At each of these three firms, the arbitrator\u2019s decision was binding on both the company and the employee. The employee\u2019s judicial recourse was limited to petitioning a court to review the arbitration decision. In contrast, federal employees have recourse to the administrative redress process and the courts. A discrimination complainant who is dissatisfied with the available administrative remedies may take his or her case to federal district court for a de novo trial.", "Second, all five of the private companies we studied required their employees to share in the costs of arbitration. In contrast, federal employees do not share in the costs of the administrative redress processes available to them. Officials at each of the firms we studied said the requirement that employees share in the costs of arbitration was intended to ensure the impartiality of arbitrators as well as to discourage frivolous complaints. Sharing of arbitration costs by employees and employers was one of the key quality standards for private arbitration recommended by the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations.", "So that they would not discourage legitimate complaints, four of the private firms we studied charged employees only a nominal fee or capped the employee\u2019s share. Two companies imposed a nominal fee: Brown & Root required employees to pay $50; Polaroid required them to pay $100. The other three companies\u2014Hughes, Rockwell, and TRW\u2014required employees to pay up to half of the arbitration costs.

Among the federal entities, the Postal Service had under way an extensive evaluation by an outside consultant, and the Air Force had an evaluation in the design stage. Agriculture had evaluated its Dispute Resolution Boards in the pilot phase but not in the 3 years in which the boards operated.

Brown & Root, as discussed earlier, reported that in the first 3 years of ADR use, the overall cost of dealing with workplace disputes (including the annual cost of the ADR program itself) was less than half of what it had been just for legal fees to cover employment-related litigation. Brown & Root also reported that the number of employment-related lawsuits had been reduced to nearly zero, and the number of cases filed with the EEOC or similar entities had been reduced by half. While other organizations had only limited data, they said they believed that early resolution of disputes and the avoidance of formal redress and litigation not only saved time but avoided costs as well.

Postal Service officials, for example, said their organization had this lesson in mind when it adopted a policy of providing mediation of complaints within approximately 2 weeks of a request for mediation services (see app. IX).

For example, at Walter Reed, where the ADR program received largely positive responses in its employee participant surveys, the dispute resolution officer said he had learned that some supervisors viewed settlements with suspicion, feeling that settlements seemed to \u201cgive away the store.\u201d As a result, he said, resolving officials at Walter Reed have become more judicious in making settlements.

Specifically, he asked us to provide information on (1) private sector companies\u2019 and federal agencies\u2019 reasons for using ADR, (2) the types of ADR these organizations have made available to their employees through procedures other than those under collective bargaining agreements and the extent to which they have put ADR processes in place, and (3) the results, if any, they have achieved by using ADR. In addition, he asked that we illustrate the practices of selected federal agencies and private sector firms in using ADR processes to resolve workplace disputes for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements by addressing the following questions. 1. What were the experiences of the selected federal and private sector employers in planning and implementing ADR processes? 2. To what extent did these employers evaluate their ADR processes and to what extent did they believe that their ADR practices have been successful in resolving workplace disputes and in lessening the costs\u2014in time and money\u2014associated with formal redress procedures and litigation? 3. What lessons did the selected agencies and companies report that they learned in planning, implementing, and evaluating their ADR processes?", "Because of the Chairman\u2019s interest in reforming the federal employee redress system, we primarily focused on ADR use in the types of disputes that federal employees can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and not those generally grieved under collective bargaining procedures.

Among the experts with whom we spoke were officials from MSPB, EEOC, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), the National Academy of Public Administration, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the CPR Center for Dispute Resolution, and the Equal Employment Advisory Council (EEAC). To develop information about the types of ADR processes offered by federal employers and the extent to which these processes are offered, we used the results of EEOC surveys of federal agencies that were reported in February 1994 and October 1996. To develop information about the types of ADR processes offered by private sector employers and the extent to which these processes are offered, we used the results from one of our surveys.", "In identifying the predominant ADR methods used in the private and federal sectors, we applied definitions based on materials developed by OPM and ACUS. Because ADR is an evolving field, there is some inconsistency among practitioners in the terms they use to describe their ADR approaches. For this reason, we occasionally grouped different organizations\u2019 ADR approaches under the same names, although the organizations themselves called these approaches by different names. We discussed this practice with each of the affected organizations and obtained their concurrence.", "To illustrate private and federal sector organizations\u2019 experiences in planning and implementing ADR processes, the extent to which they evaluated their ADR processes and the extent to which they reported that these processes have been successful in resolving workplace disputes and lessening costs, and the lessons they reported having learned, we judgmentally selected for study five private sector companies and five federal agencies that had had some experience with ADR. Because there is no readily identifiable inventory of federal and private sector ADR users, we used a variety of methods to identify candidates for case illustrations. To identify federal agencies using ADR, we reviewed surveys of federal agencies by EEOC and ACUS, reviewed literature about federal agencies using ADR, reviewed information that federal agencies reported to EEOC, and spoke to officials knowledgeable about ADR use in the federal government, including officials from MSPB, EEOC, OPM, ACUS, and FMCS.

In the private sector, we studied the following large companies: Brown & Root, Inc; Hughes Electronics Corporation; the Polaroid Corporation; Rockwell International Corporation; and TRW Inc. Our final selection of companies was dependent on their willingness to participate in the study.

The consortium\u2019s results have not been formally evaluated; however, the consortium cochairman said he believed that the high resolution rate has helped participating agencies avoid the time and costs of redress and litigation.", "Between May 1993 and February 1997, the consortium mediated 171 cases, settling 153 (89 percent) of them. Data on the nature of settlements were being analyzed at the time of our study, according to the consortium member responsible for the effort.", "User satisfaction with the process and with the mediators is also high, according to the consortium\u2019s surveys of users. Of evaluations received from 75 users (survey results were not broken out by successful and unsuccessful mediations), 84 percent reported that their overall level of satisfaction with the mediation process was good to excellent, while 73 percent of the respondents who reached agreement said that their level of satisfaction with the agreement was good to excellent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned by the Organization", "paragraphs": ["The cochairman attributes the consortium\u2019s success to the training, development, and evaluation process for the volunteer mediators and to the evaluations completed after each mediation. The post mediation evaluations have been valuable in making improvements to the program, according to the cochairman. Some of the improvements include scheduling for longer and multiple sessions and having more caucuses between individual parties and mediators. A major change was made as well in the intake process, which at first was managed by the training provider. Because the employees of the training provider were not familiar with government agencies, early mediations did not always include an agency representative with the authority to approve the terms of a resolution. As a result, consortium mediators with an understanding of government organizational structures now handle the intake process.", "Another lesson learned, according to the consortium cochairman, was that some benefits derive even in cases not resolved through the consortium mediation. In these cases, issues in dispute often become clarified, which may help bring about later resolution.", "The cochairman said that there have also been lessons learned about trends in agencies\u2019 use of consortium mediation services. Initially, the consortium\u2019s mediation services were underutilized. However, through marketing efforts and as consortium successes became known by word-of-mouth, use of the consortium\u2019s services has increased to a point at which the pool of volunteer mediators is now being used to its limits. Still, the cochairman believes, more federal agencies in the Seattle area could be participating. Some of these agencies, he learned, are reluctant to expose their operations to mediators from outside the agency. The cochairman said he believes that outreach geared to individual agencies is needed to encourage them to participate in the consortium."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Denver Regional Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above individuals, the contributions of the following GAO staff are acknowledged: Gary V.
