Since undertaking the realignment, VA has concentrated its efforts on transferring approximately 6,000 staff to the CIO's authority and on creating a new organizational structure. It has also taken certain actions to establish an IT governance plan, identify workforce management responsibilities, and increase communication about the realignment with staff. However, it has not yet created a knowledge and skills inventory to help determine proper roles for all employees in the new organization, established governance boards to manage resources, or dedicated an implementation team to manage change and track the progress of the realignment with performance metrics. As a result, the department risks jeopardizing the success of its efforts and may not realize the long-term benefits of the realignment. Within the new structure, the CIO is to have responsibility for ensuring that there are fiscal controls over the IT appropriation and for overseeing capital planning processes, budget execution, and financial management programs. According to the department, it plans to establish the CIO's control by (1) designating organizations with specific roles and responsibilities for controlling the budget to report directly to the CIO; (2) implementing a governance structure that assigns budget oversight responsibilities to specific governance boards; and (3) developing and implementing IT portfolio management and financial management processes.

To assess the realignment,  we identified critical success factors by reviewing relevant GAO products  and researching industry best practices on organizational transformations.  In addition, we conferred with a leading provider of research and analysis  on the IT industry to obtain its input on the relevance and soundness of  factors we identified for consideration in our assessment of the  realignment effort. We then assessed whether the department\u2019s  realignment documentation identified actions that reflected these factors  and held periodic meetings with realignment team members, including  contractors, to discuss whether and how these factors were being  considered in the department\u2019s realignment plans and actions. To  determine how the centralized management approach will ensure that the  CIO is accountable for the entire IT budget, we reviewed documentation  and plans that addressed budget oversight and execution under the new  organization. To supplement our analysis, we met with officials in VA\u2019s  Office of Information and Technology who are responsible for managing  and executing the budget.

For example, according to an October 2005 memorandum from  the former CIO to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the CIO had direct  control over only 3 percent of the department\u2019s IT budget and 6 percent of  the department\u2019s IT personnel. In addition, in the department\u2019s fiscal year  2006 IT budget request, the Veterans Health Administration was identified  to receive 88 percent of the requested funding, while the department was  identified to receive only 4 percent.

However, in our view, having a  dedicated implementation team, responsible for day-to-day management of  major change initiatives, is crucial to VA\u2019s ability to ensure that the IT  realignment is fully and successfully implemented in a coherent,  integrated, and coordinated manner. The approach articulated in the  department\u2019s comments does not make clear how progress will be  monitored, schedule slippages or shortfalls identified, and solutions to  problems developed and implemented. Without having a dedicated  implementation team, as we recommend, the department may increase the  risk to the success of the realignment.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Member  of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, House of Representatives.

These  documents included the realignment contract request for quotes and  memorandums signed by the Secretary and Deputy Secretary relating to  approval of the permanent assignment of operations and maintenance and  development staff to the Office of Information and Technology. The  documents also included the establishment of the VA single information  technology (IT) leadership authority. We also obtained and analyzed the  realignment contractor\u2019s performance work statement, which detailed the  work the contractor was to perform. In addition, we reviewed other  contractor deliverables, such as process charters for the new IT  management processes, the \u201cto be\u201d organization structure transition plan,  and the transition management plan. VA also provided IV&V contractor  documents that assessed each of the realignment contract deliverables.  We reviewed these documents to identify problems and concerns raised  by the IV&V contractor.", "To identify factors critical to the success of the centralization effort, we  reviewed GAO products relevant to organizational transformation. We also  reviewed industry best practices documentation, such as the IT  Governance Institute\u2019s Control Objectives for Information and related  Technology 4.0, to identify industry standard success factors for IT  organizations. To validate the success factors, we met with IV&V  contractor officials to elicit their input on the relevance and soundness of  factors we identified for consideration in our assessment of the  realignment effort. IV&V contractor officials concurred that the factors we  developed are critical to VA\u2019s successful IT realignment. In addition, we  compared documents obtained from VA and realignment contractor  officials against these factors to determine the level to which the critical  success factors were included. We also conducted monthly meetings with  the VA realignment team and the realignment contractor to determine  whether these critical success factors were being considered in the  implementation of the realignment.", "We visited the VA medical center and a benefits administration office in  Baltimore and a VA medical center in Philadelphia to become familiar with  the methodology that the realignment contractor was using to assess VA\u2019s  readiness for the realignment. We observed teams from the realignment  contractor as they gathered information that would be used to create a  baseline of IT activities and a transition plan for the department. We  selected these locations due to the schedule availability of the department  and the contractor and because they are representative of VA facilities.", "To determine how the centralized management approach will ensure that  the CIO is accountable for VA\u2019s entire IT budget, including those funds  that previously had been administered by its administrations, we reviewed  VA and realignment contractor documentation and plans that specifically  address IT budget oversight and execution under the realignment. These  documents included roles and responsibilities for those VA organizations  listed in the single IT leadership organization structure that are to have  responsibility for IT portfolio and financial management, the IT  Governance Plan, and the IT Portfolio Management and Financial  Management Process Design and Implementation Plans. To supplement  our analysis, we met with officials in VA\u2019s Office of Information and  Technology who are responsible for managing and executing the IT  budget. We conducted our work in VA offices in Washington, D.C., and at  VA facilities in Baltimore and Philadelphia from June 2006 through May  2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, major contributors to this report  were Barbara Oliver, Assistant Director; Nabajyoti Barkakati; Jacki Bauer;  Neil Doherty; Nancy Glover; B.
