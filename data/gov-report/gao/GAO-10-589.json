GAO was asked to examine the effectiveness of the physical and electronic security features of the passport card and second generation BCC. This report addresses: (1) How effectively State's development process--including testing and evaluation--for the passport card and second generation BCC mitigates the risk of fraudulent use? (2) How are U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers using the cards' security features to prevent fraudulent use at land ports of entry?

While following standards and guidance helps to ensure the security of these documents, State's development process could be improved. State addressed most problems identified during evaluation and testing; however, it did not address some of the resulting issues and recommendations or did not document its reasons for not doing so. In addition, State tested and evaluated the security of only prototypes of the passport card, which did not include key features such as the background artwork, personalization features, and other security features that were added or changed for the final passport card. Moreover, State did not test the security of the second generation BCC or the updated passport card expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2010. Fully testing the passport card and BCC and addressing identified problems would provide State a more complete understanding of the overall security and performance of its cards and a greater assurance that its cards are adequately secure. CBP officers in primary inspection--the first and most critical opportunity to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States with fraudulent travel documents--use a variety of methods to identify fraudulent documents, but are unable to take full advantage of the security features in passport cards and BCCs because of time constraints, limited use of technology in primary inspection, and the lack of sample documents for training. While CBP has deployed technology tools for primary inspectors to use when inspecting passport cards and BCCs, it could still make better usage of fingerprint data to mitigate the risk of imposter fraud with BCCs, the most common type of fraud. In addition, although CBP provided training on security features of the passport card and second generation BCC to inspecting officers prior to their issuance, the conduct of training without sample passport cards or second generation BCCs at the Vermont POEs visited by GAO indicate that improvements are still needed. State and DHS need to fully implement GAO's prior recommendation to improve training on new documents prior to their issuance, including the provision of exemplars to be used during training to better familiarize officers with the look and feel of the actual documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State fully address any problems found during testing and evaluation, including documenting the reasons for not addressing any of them, and test and evaluate the security features on the cards as they will be issued.

In addition, the  complex symbolic codes and pseudocodes provide protection against  counterfeiting and forgery because they are based on cardholder  characteristics and cannot be accurately created for counterfeit cards or  altered for forged cards unless the counterfeiter has broken the codes.  Laser engraving is used to print the cardholder\u2019s image as well as the  personalization information, combining flat and tactile printing.

They indicated that  they did not change to a solid polycarbonate body because there are  problems using polycarbonate in the radio frequency identification (RFID)  chip layer and it would increase the cost of the cards. In addition, at the  time, the card manufacturer thought that the technology for security  printing on polycarbonate was too new and State didn\u2019t believe that using  layers of polycarbonate over layers of polyvinyl chloride posed any  significant problems. Since procurement, the technology for laser  engraving and printing the background artwork on polycarbonate has  improved, but there continue to be technical issues that impact the  feasibility of its use. State also does not believe that laser engraving below  the layer of the background artwork significantly improves the security of  the cards because any attempt to alter the data or photo would visibly  damage the card. In addition, State officials believe the recommendation  to add rainbow printing on the front of the cards is more a preference than  a requirement and is satisfied with having it just on the back of the cards.

For example, State did not assess  the risk of not following FDL\u2019s recommendation that State submit the final  passport card for analysis of the security features, which State did not do  because it was in the final stages of procurement when the design was  finalized and it wanted to meet schedule, or FDL\u2019s recommendation that it  add rainbow printing to the front of the card.

State officials believe that evaluation activities were not  necessary because the appearance of the card is so similar to the one  currently issued, the changes improved the security of the card, and it did  not consider the durability failures encountered during prototype passport  card testing to be significant. In 2007, we recommended that State  periodically reassess the security features when planning the redesign of its  travel documents. State agreed with the recommendation and has taken  steps to address it. However, there was no assessment of the final passport  card or second generation BCC prior to issuance and there is no plan to  formally assess the second generation passport card prior to issuance. Such  an assessment could identify potential vulnerabilities in the security of these  cards before they could be exploited. There have been no reports of  successful fraudulent use of the cards and the addition of more security  features to the passport card was not in response to any threats or  vulnerabilities and should further strengthen the card against fraud. State  and FDL inspected counterfeit second generation BCCs that were  intercepted and found that none of the security features or personalization  codes had been compromised. However, by not following a structured  process for assessing the security features of the passport card prior to  issuing the second generation passport card, State missed an opportunity to  identify and address any potential vulnerabilities of the passport card\u2019s  design to resist fraudulent use.", "In response to our 2007 recommendation, State created a new position in  the Bureau of Consular Affairs responsible for the coordination of the  efforts of various State organizations involved in designing and ensuring  the security of documents issued by Consular Affairs\u2014the Forensic  Document Design and Integrity Coordinator.

Preventing the fraudulent use of travel documents requires a  combination of well-designed documents with layered security features and  an inspection process that utilizes these security features. A well-designed  document has limited utility if inspection officers do not utilize the available  security features to detect attempts to falsely enter the United States.  Although designs for the passport card and the second generation BCC  generally meet or exceed standards and guidelines for international travel  documents, inclusion of all security features recommended by guidance and  standards for international travel documents does not guarantee that the  security features are of sufficient quality and are designed to ensure the  overall security of the cards. State\u2019s development process could be  improved to better assess the security of its cards and to fully address  problems and issues found during the testing and evaluation of its cards,  which could provide greater assurance that State has secure, well- performing documents. We have previously recommended that State  periodically assess the security features when redesigning its travel  documents. It did not do so when redesigning the passport card. By  conducting such an assessment, State potentially could have identified and  addressed any vulnerabilities of the passport card\u2019s design to resist  fraudulent use. State has taken actions to conduct such assessments in  future redesigns, which, if effectively implemented, should better position  State to identify vulnerabilities in its travel documents\u2019 abilities to resist  fraud before they can be exploited.

Further, while State addressed most problems found during its testing, it  either did not fully address the issues and recommendations or it did not  fully document its decisions for not doing so.
