TSA and maritime industry stakeholders still face several challenges to ensuring that the TWIC program can be implemented successfully: (1) TSA and its enrollment contractor need to transition from limited testing of the TWIC program to successful implementation of the program on a much larger scale covering 770,000 workers at about 3,500 maritime facilities and 5,300 vessels. (2) TSA and its enrollment contractor will need to educate workers on the new TWIC requirements, ensure that enrollments begin in a timely manner, and process numerous background checks, appeals, and waivers. (3) TSA and industry stakeholders will need to ensure that TWIC access control technologies will work effectively in the maritime environment, be compatible with TWIC cards that will be issued, and balance security with the flow of maritime commerce.

Ensuring that only  workers that do not pose a terrorist threat are allowed access to secure  areas of the nation\u2019s transportation facilities is critical to helping prevent a  terrorist attack. The TWIC program was created to help protect these  facilities from the threat of terrorism by issuing identification cards only to  workers who do not pose a terrorist threat and allow these workers  unescorted access to secure areas of the transportation system. To  accomplish this objective, the TWIC program will include collection of  personal and biometric information to validate workers\u2019 identities,  background checks on transportation workers to ensure they do not pose  a threat to security, issuance of tamper-resistant biometric credentials that  cannot be counterfeited, verification of these credentials using biometric  access control systems before a worker is granted unescorted access to a  secure area, and revocation of credentials if disqualifying information is  discovered, or if a card is lost, damaged, or stolen. The TWIC program was  initially intended to serve all modes of transportation; however, TSA, in  partnership with the Coast Guard, is focusing initial implementation on the  maritime sector and is planning to implement the program in other modes  in the future.", "In December 2004 and September 2006, we reported on the status of the  development and testing of the TWIC program. Our 2004 report identified  the challenges TSA faced in developing regulations and a comprehensive  plan for managing the TWIC program and several factors that caused TSA  to miss initial deadlines for issuing TWIC cards. Our September 2006  report identified the challenges encountered during TWIC program testing  and several problems related to TWIC contract planning and oversight. In  August 2006, TSA decided that the TWIC program would be implemented  in the maritime sector using two separate rules. TSA issued the first rule in  January 2007 requiring worker enrollment and card issuance and plans to  issue a proposed rule on access control technologies in 2008. Since our  September 2006 report, the Congress passed the Security and  Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006, directing TSA, among  other things, to implement the TWIC program at the 10 highest risk ports  by July 1, 2007. In January 2007, TSA awarded a $70 million contract to  begin enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards to workers at these  maritime facilities.", "My testimony today focuses on two key areas: (1) the progress TSA has  made since September 2006 in implementing the TWIC program and   (2) some of the remaining challenges that TSA and the maritime industry  must overcome to ensure the successful implementation of the TWIC  program. My comments are based primarily on our December 2004 and  September 2006 reports on the TWIC program, which reflect work  conducted at TSA and the Coast Guard, as well as site visits to  transportation facilities that participated in testing the TWIC program.   In addition, in March and April 2007, we interviewed TSA officials and  obtained some supporting documentation regarding the agency\u2019s efforts to  implement the TWIC program.

These systems and facilities are critical components of  the U.S. economy and are necessary for supplying goods throughout the  country and supporting international commerce. U.S. transportation  systems and facilities move over 30 million tons of freight and provide  approximately 1.1 billion passenger trips each day. The Ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach estimate that they alone handle about 43 percent  of the nation\u2019s oceangoing cargo. The importance of these systems and  facilities also makes them attractive targets to terrorists. These systems  and facilities are vulnerable and difficult to secure given their size, easy  accessibility, large number of potential targets, and proximity to urban  areas. A terrorist attack at these systems and facilities could cause a  tremendous loss of life and disruption to our society. An attack would also  be costly. According to testimony by a Port of Los Angeles official, a 2002  labor dispute led to a 10-day shutdown of West Coast port operations,  costing the nation\u2019s economy an estimated $1.5 billion per day. A terrorist  attack to a port facility could have a similar or greater impact.", "One potential security threat stems from those individuals who work in  secure areas of the nation\u2019s transportation system, including seaports,  airports, railroad terminals, mass transit stations, and other transportation  facilities. It is estimated that about 6 million workers, including  longshoreman, mechanics, aviation and railroad employees, truck drivers,  and others access secure areas of the nation\u2019s estimated 4,000  transportation facilities each day while performing their jobs. Some of  these workers, such as truck drivers, regularly access secure areas at  multiple transportation facilities. Ensuring that only workers that do not  pose a terrorism security risk are allowed unescorted access to secure  areas is important in helping to prevent an attack. According to TSA and  transportation industry stakeholders, many individuals that work in secure  areas are currently not required to undergo a background check or a  stringent identification process in order to access secure areas. In  addition, without a standard credential that is recognized across modes of  transportation and facilities, many workers must obtain multiple  credentials to access each transportation facility they enter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TWIC Program History", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in November 2001.

In response to ATSA, TSA established  the TWIC program in December 2001 to mitigate the threat of terrorists  and other unauthorized persons from accessing secure areas of the entire  transportation network, by creating a common identification credential  that could be used by workers in all modes of transportation. In  November 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA)  was enacted and required the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a  maritime worker identification card that uses biometrics, such as  fingerprints, to control access to secure areas of seaports and vessels,  among other things.", "The responsibility for securing the nation\u2019s transportation system and  facilities is shared by federal, state, and local governments, as well as the  private sector.

In testing the TWIC program, TSA enrolled and issued TWIC  cards to only about 1,700 workers at 19 facilities, well short of its goal of  75,000. According to TSA and the testing contractor, the lack of volunteers  to enroll in the TWIC program testing and technical difficulties in enrolling  workers, such as difficulty in obtaining workers\u2019 fingerprints to conduct  background checks, led to fewer enrollments than expected. TSA reports  that it used the testing experience to make improvements to the  enrollment and card issuance process and has taken steps to address the  challenges that we previously identified. For example, TSA officials stated  that the agency will use a faster and easier method of collecting  fingerprints than was used during testing and will enroll workers  individually during implementation, as opposed to enrolling in large  groups, as was done during testing. In addition, the TWIC enrollment  contract Statement of Work requires the contractor to develop an  enrollment test and evaluation program to ensure that enrollment systems  function as required under the contract. Such a testing program will be  valuable to ensure that these systems work effectively prior to full-scale  implementation. We also reported that TSA faced the challenge of  ensuring that workers are not providing false information and counterfeit  identification documents when they enroll in the TWIC program.  According to TSA, the TWIC enrollment process to be used during  implementation will use document scanning and verification software to  help determine if identification documents are fraudulent, and personnel  responsible for enrolling workers will be trained to identify fraudulent  documents.", "Since we issued our report in September 2006, we have also identified  additional challenges to implementing the TWIC program that warrant  attention by TSA and its enrollment contractor. We recently spoke with  some maritime stakeholders that participated in TWIC testing and that will  be involved in the initial implementation of the program to discuss their  views on the challenges of enrolling and issuing TWIC cards to workers.  These stakeholders expressed concerns regarding the following issues:  Educating workers: TSA and its enrollment contractor face a challenge  in identifying all workers that are required to obtain a TWIC card,  educating them about how to enroll and receive a TWIC card, and ensuring  that they enroll and receive a TWIC card by the deadlines to be established  by TSA and the Coast Guard. For example, while longshoremen who work  at a port every day may be aware of the new TWIC requirements, truck  divers that deliver to the port may be located in different states or  countries, and may not be aware of the requirements.", "Timely enrollments: One stakeholder expressed concern about the  challenges the enrollment contactor faces in enrolling workers at his port.  For example, at this port, the enrollment contactor has not yet begun to  lease space to install enrollment centers\u2014which at this port could be a  difficult and time-consuming task due to the shortage of space.  Stakeholders we spoke to also suggested that until TSA establishes a  deadline for when TWIC cards will be required at ports, workers will likely  procrastinate in enrolling, which could make it difficult for the contractor  to enroll large populations of workers in a timely manner.", "Background checks: Some maritime organizations are concerned that  many of their workers will be disqualified from receiving a TWIC card by  the background check. These stakeholders emphasized the importance of  TSA establishing a process to ensure timely appeals and waivers process  for the potentially large population of workers that do not pass the check.  According to TSA, the agency already has established processes for  conducting background checks, appeals, and waivers for other  background checks of transportation workers.

Few facilities that participated in TWIC testing used  biometric card readers that will be required to read the TWIC cards in the  future. As a result, TSA obtained limited information on the operational  effectiveness of biometric card readers, particularly when individuals use  these readers outdoors in the harsh maritime environment, where they can  be affected by dirt, salt, wind, and rain. In addition, TSA did not test the  use of biometric card readers on vessels, although they will be required on  vessels in the future. Also, industry stakeholders we spoke to were  concerned about the costs of implementing and operating TWIC access  control systems, linking card readers to their local access control systems,  connecting to TSA\u2019s national TWIC database to obtain updated security  information on workers, and how biometric card readers would be  implemented and used on vessels and how these vessels would  communicate with TSA\u2019s national TWIC database remotely. Because of  comments regarding TWIC access control technology challenges that TSA  received from maritime industry stakeholders on the TWIC proposed rule,  TSA decided to exclude all access control requirements from the TWIC  rule issued in January 2007.

If implemented effectively, the security benefits of the TWIC program in  preventing a terrorist attack could save lives and avoid a costly disruption  in maritime commerce. Alternatively, if key components of the TWIC  program, such as biometric card readers, do not work effectively, they  could slow the daily flow of maritime commerce. For example, if workers  or truck drivers have problems with their fingerprint verifications on  biometric card readers, they could create long queues delaying other  workers or trucks waiting in line to enter secure areas. Such delays could  be very costly in terms of time and money to maritime facilities. Some  stakeholders we spoke to also expressed concern with applying TWIC  access control requirements to small facilities and vessels. For example,  smaller vessels could have crews of less than 10 persons, and checking  TWIC cards each time a person enters a secure area may not be necessary.  TSA acknowledged the potential impact that the TWIC program could  have on the flow of maritime commerce and plans to obtain additional  public comments on this issue from industry stakeholders and develop  solutions to these challenges in the second rulemaking on access control  technologies.", "In our September 2006 report, we recommended that TSA conduct  additional testing to ensure that TWIC access control technologies work  effectively and that the TWIC program balances the added security of the  program with the impact that it could have on the flow of maritime  commerce.
