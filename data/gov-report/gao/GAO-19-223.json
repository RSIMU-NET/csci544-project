(See figure) Capital asset projects\u2014which involve the acquisition of land and other assets, including through environmental remediation\u2014must undergo a series of reviews by independent experts and DOE's senior leadership. In contrast, operations activities are not reviewed outside of EM. EM's policy defines operations activities as reoccurring facility or environmental operations, as well as activities that are project-like, with defined start and end dates. EM cleanup site managers have discretion on how to classify cleanup work because DOE and EM have not established classification requirements. Since 2015, experts in DOE's Office of Project Management have raised concerns that some operations activities should be classified as capital asset projects, and that managing them under less stringent requirements poses cost and schedule risks. For example, the experts stated the cleanup of tanks of radioactive liquid waste should be designated as capital asset projects. However, these experts also stated that EM did not respond to their concerns, even though the office has department-wide responsibilities for overseeing project management. Until EM works with DOE's Office of Project Management to establish requirements for classifying cleanup work, the department may incur more cost and schedule risks than it should.", "EM's cleanup policy does not follow any of 9 selected program management leading practices or 9 of 12 selected project management leading practices. For example, EM's 2017 cleanup policy does not follow the program management leading practice of conducting risk management throughout the life of a program or the project management leading practice of requiring independent reviews of operations activities. These leading practices help ensure that a program optimizes scope, cost, and schedule performance and that it achieves its goals and intended benefits. Until EM revises its cleanup policy to follow leading practices, EM's operations activities are at risk of uncontrolled changes to scope, exceeding initial budget and schedule, and failing to meet their original goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that EM (1) establish cleanup work classification requirements and (2) revise its cleanup policy to follow program and project management leading practices.

In 1989, the Department of  Energy (DOE) established its nuclear waste cleanup program by creating  the Office of Environmental Management (EM). The EM program\u2019s  mission is to complete the safe cleanup of this Cold War legacy and to  work to reduce associated risks and costs within the established  regulatory framework.", "The EM program faces substantial future cleanup costs and has decades  of additional work remaining at contaminated DOE sites. EM has spent  more than $164 billion since it began its cleanup work in 1989.  Additionally, DOE faces an estimated $494 billion in future costs over a  period of more than 70 years, a liability that has roughly tripled over the  past 20 years, according to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial statement.  This liability may grow, even though DOE has spent roughly $6 billion  annually on its cleanup work in recent years. Because of the substantial  and increasing estimated cleanup costs to the federal government, in  2017 we added the federal government\u2019s environmental liability to our  high-risk list of agencies and program areas that are vulnerable to fraud,  waste, and mismanagement or that are most in need of transformation.  According to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial statement, the EM  program\u2019s portion of DOE\u2019s total environmental liability is $377 billion, the  largest share of the federal government\u2019s environmental liability. From  fiscal years 2011 to 2018, EM\u2019s environmental liability increased by about  $214 billion. The new Assistant Secretary for the Office of Environmental  Management, who assumed office in March 2018, has acknowledged the  importance of improving EM\u2019s performance in addressing EM\u2019s large and  growing environmental liabilities.", "Effective program and project management are important to the success  of efforts such as the EM program, according to the Project Management  Institute (PMI). The Program Management Improvement Accountability  Act of December 2016 requires the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) to adopt and oversee implementation of government-wide  standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management  in executive branch agencies. In June 2018, OMB issued a  memorandum on the implementation of this law that included initial  implementation guidance and called for agencies to set their own  program management standards. The memorandum stated that the act  aims to improve program and project management practices within the  federal government. The OMB memorandum also stated that agencies  may use program management leading practices developed by us, other  agencies, and external voluntary consensus standards bodies, such as  PMI.", "EM divides its cleanup work into capital asset projects and operations  activities. According to DOE\u2019s order governing the management of capital  asset projects\u2014DOE Order 413.3B\u2014a capital asset project is a project  with defined start and end points required in the acquisition of capital  assets; capital asset projects can also include the environmental  remediation of land to make it useful. According to OMB, capital assets  are land (including park lands); structures; equipment (including motor  and aircraft fleets); and intellectual property (including software), which  are used by the federal government and which have an estimated useful  life of 2 years or more. Operations activities are reoccurring facility or  environmental operations as well as activities that are project-like, with  defined start and end dates, according to EM policy. According to EM  officials, EM manages its operations activities based on requirements  listed in a cleanup policy that it issued in July 2017.", "Over the years, we have found many problems with DOE\u2019s management  of its major capital asset projects\u2014those with a total project cost over  $750 million\u2014including uncontrolled changes to scope, exceeding  budgets and schedules, and failing to meet the original mission.  Examples of EM\u2019s capital asset projects that encountered problems  include the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at the Hanford site  and the Salt Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River site,  facilities that EM is building to process liquid radioactive waste stored in  tanks at these sites. In recent years, DOE has improved its  requirements for the management of capital asset projects by significantly  changing Order 413.3B. We recognized these DOE efforts to improve its  project management in our 2017 high-risk update. However, our 2017  high-risk update also expressed concern that EM\u2019s operations activities  are not subject to the same oversight as capital asset projects.", "You asked us to review the EM program, particularly its management of  operations activities. This report examines how the EM program manages its cleanup work,  the extent to which EM\u2019s cleanup policy follows selected program and  project management leading practices, and how EM measures the overall performance of its operations activities.", "To examine how the EM program manages its cleanup work, we  reviewed various DOE documents, including DOE\u2019s Order 413.3B, EM\u2019s  2012 operations activities protocol, EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy, and  documents received from cleanup sites. We also interviewed DOE and  EM officials from headquarters and 5 of EM\u2019s 16 cleanup sites. (We  contacted all sites and interviewed five sites that responded to our  request for an interview over the phone.) We then decided to conduct  site visits. We visited two of these sites\u2014Savannah River and Idaho\u2014 because they are among the sites with the highest number of operations  activities and the most diverse types of and highest cost cleanup work  remaining. Our findings from these 5 sites are not generalizable to all EM  sites, but they help explain the delineation of roles between the site  managers and EM headquarters in managing and classifying cleanup  work. We also reviewed the role of DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management  in EM\u2019s cleanup work. More specifically, we examined whether this office  played a role in the development of EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy and  classification of EM\u2019s cleanup work, consistent with the Office of Project  Management\u2019s designation as DOE\u2019s enterprise project management  organization.", "To examine the extent to which EM\u2019s cleanup policy follows selected  program and project management leading practices, we selected two sets  of criteria for program and project management leading practices. To select program management leading practices, we first reviewed PMI\u2019s  The Standard for Program Management \u2014Third Edition. We identified 9  program management leading practices based on PMI\u2019s standards  related to a program\u2019s management of scope, cost, schedule  performance, and to independent review of performance. To select  project management leading practices, we first identified 12 project  management leading practices listed in DOE\u2019s Order 413.3B related to  management of scope, cost, schedule performance, and to independent  review of performance for projects. We then compared these 12 project  management leading practices to PMI\u2019s A Guide to the Project  Management Body of Knowledge\u2013Fifth Edition, which includes PMI\u2019s  standards for project management, to make sure these leading practices  align with PMI\u2019s standards for project management. To validate our  selection of program and project management leading practices, we  shared these selected leading practices with PMI representatives and  incorporated their feedback, as appropriate. PMI representatives agreed  with the program and project management leading practices that we  selected.", "We then compared EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy and the 11 associated  standard operating policies and procedures developed by EM by the time  of our analysis (by May 2018) with the 9 program management and 12  project management leading practices we selected, and we analyzed the  extent to which the policy and associated guidance follows these leading  practices. We also interviewed EM officials to learn more about the  2017 cleanup policy. We used a 5-point scoring system to determine the  extent to which EM\u2019s cleanup policy follows program and project  management leading practices. If the score for a leading practice was  \u201cfully met\u201d or \u201csubstantially met,\u201d we concluded that EM\u2019s policy followed  that leading practice.", "To examine how EM measures the performance of its operations  activities, we analyzed EM\u2019s use of the three measures of performance  that EM policy identified as being used for this purpose: earned value  management (EVM), performance metrics, and cleanup milestones.  To evaluate EM\u2019s EVM systems, we compared EM\u2019s use of EVM with 8 of  the 10 best practices for earned value management found in our Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, which draws best practices from  federal cost-estimating organizations and industry. Specifically, we  reviewed the use of EVM systems in the 21 contracts EM uses to execute  its operations activities, and we compared this with EVM best practices.  To gather this information, we submitted a data collection instrument to all  16 sites to ascertain whether or not they follow these best practices for  each contract containing operations activities. We also requested  documentation, such as EVM system certification information or  surveillance reports, supporting the sites\u2019 answers. We relied mainly on  their responses but, when available, also reviewed the documentation we  received to check the sites\u2019 answers for accuracy and completeness.", "In addition, as part of our analysis, we analyzed EM headquarters\u2019 EVM  data on operations activities from October 2016 through September 2017  (the most recent data available at the time of our review) to determine  whether or not the EVM data were reliable. We checked for anomalies  such as missing or negative values for each of those months. We also  reviewed DOE and EM documents\u2014such as monthly progress reports  submitted by the 16 sites to EM headquarters for review and the monthly  reviews prepared by an EM headquarters office for senior management\u2014 to see what EVM data senior management used for decision-making.", "To provide a score for our analysis, we used a 5-point scoring system to  score the answers for each contract against each best practice. After  scoring each best practice individually, we then used these scores to  develop an average score for the three EVM characteristics: whether EM  has ensured that these EVM systems are (1) comprehensive; (2) provide  reliable data; and (3) are used by EM leadership for decision-making.", "To examine EM\u2019s use of performance metrics data, we reviewed annual  performance metrics collected by EM headquarters for every operations  activity from 2010 to 2017 (representing the period during which EM  managed cleanup work as operations activities); reviewed relevant  documentation; and interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about  those data, among other things. Specifically, we interviewed DOE and EM  officials at headquarters and from the five cleanup sites (including in- person interviews at the Savannah River and Idaho sites).

As a result,  some sites track milestones differently than EM headquarters does. We  also found that EM does not consistently define or track met, missed, or  postponed cleanup-related milestones at selected sites, and EM\u2019s  milestone reporting to Congress is inconsistent. EM sites renegotiate  milestone dates with their regulators before they are missed, and EM  does not track the history of these changes. This is because once  milestones are changed, sites are not required to maintain or track the  original milestone dates. As a result, the new milestones become the new agreed-upon time frame, essentially resetting the deadline. Further, in its  report to Congress on enforceable milestones\u2019 status, EM reports the  most recently renegotiated milestone dates with no indication of whether  or how often those milestones have been missed or postponed. Thus, the  EM program is unable to use milestone data to provide a clear, reliable  picture of its performance. Furthermore, EM officials at headquarters and  selected sites said they had not conducted root cause analyses on  missed or postponed milestones. Thus, EM cannot address systemic  problems and consider them when renegotiating milestones with  regulators. In addition, without such analysis, EM and its cleanup  regulators lack information to set more realistic and achievable  milestones. As a result, future milestones are likely to continue to be  pushed back, further delaying the cleanup work and likely increasing  cleanup costs. In this same report, we recommended, among other  things, that EM should establish a standard definition of milestones  across the cleanup sites, track changes to the milestones, report annually  to Congress on the status of its milestones, and conduct root cause  analyses of performance shortcomings that lead to missed or postponed  milestones."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s EM program has the challenging mission of safely cleaning up  radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, and environmental contamination  from 50 years of federal nuclear weapons production and energy  research, while working to reduce associated risks and costs within the  established regulatory framework. Since its mission began in 1989, EM  has spent more than $164 billion on its cleanup work, and it faces future  cleanup costs of more than $377 billion\u2014the federal government\u2019s single  largest environmental liability.", "To improve management of projects undertaken within the department,  including EM, DOE established its Office of Project Management and  strengthened project management requirements in Order 413.3B for  managing capital asset projects. However, since 2009, when EM created  a new category of cleanup work called operations activities, EM has  opted not to apply DOE\u2019s project management requirements to almost 80  percent of its cleanup work. From fiscal years 2011 to 2018, EM\u2019s  environmental liability increased by about $214 billion. DOE\u2019s Office of  Project Management officials have raised concerns about how EM  classifies this work. Until EM works together with DOE\u2019s Office of Project  management (1) to establish requirements for classifying cleanup work as  capital asset projects or operations activities and (2) to assess EM\u2019s  ongoing operations activities to determine if they should be reclassified as  capital asset projects based on the newly established requirements, the  department may incur more project management risk of cost increases  and schedule delays than it should for hundreds of billions of dollars of  remaining work.", "In July 2017, EM released a new cleanup policy containing requirements  for managing its program and its operations activities, but this policy does  not follow most of the selected program and project management leading  practices we identified related to management of scope, cost, and  schedule performance, and independent review of performance. Until EM  reviews and revises its cleanup policy to include program and project  management leading practices related to scope, cost, schedule  performance, and independent reviews, the EM program is at risk of  uncontrolled changes to scope, exceeding its cost estimates and  schedule, failing to meet its goals, and increasing DOE\u2019s environmental  liabilities.", "The new Assistant Secretary for the Office of Environmental Management  has acknowledged the importance of improving EM\u2019s performance in  addressing the department\u2019s large and growing environmental liabilities.  However, the three tools that EM uses to measure its overall program  performance and contractors\u2019 performance on operations activities\u2014 earned value management, performance metrics, and cleanup  milestones\u2014do not provide a clear, reliable picture of performance for EM  leadership, Congress, and other stakeholders. In particular, EM\u2019s EVM  systems for operations activities are not comprehensive, do not provide  reliable data, and are not used by EM leadership to measure overall  performance of the EM program. Furthermore, a large portion of the work  performed by contractors is categorized as level of effort, limiting the  usefulness of the EVM data. In addition, EM\u2019s performance metrics are  not linked to the costs of the work performed. Until EM updates its  cleanup policy to require that EVM systems be maintained and used in a  way that follows EVM best practices, EM leadership may not have access  to reliable performance data to make informed decisions in managing its  cleanup work and to provide to Congress and other stakeholders on  billions of dollars\u2019 worth of cleanup work every year. Moreover, until EM  develops a policy that ensures that work is categorized as level of effort  only in appropriate, specified circumstances, such as when work is not  measurable or when measurement is impractical, it may not have reliable  performance data to help it achieve its objective of reducing risks and  costs associated with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of cleanup work every year.

DOE stated that the department commits (1) to reviewing its  methodology for categorizing work and revising it, as appropriate, as  well as (2) to determining the appropriate application of any revisions  to the work classification methodology to new and existing work. DOE  also stated that the Assistant Secretary for EM is ultimately  responsible for the proper classification of work and will consult with  the Office of Project Management. We appreciate DOE\u2019s commitment  to addressing these two recommendations. As we stated in our report,  in July 2015, the Secretary of Energy gave DOE\u2019s Office of Project  Management responsibility to serve as DOE\u2019s enterprise project  management organization. As such, DOE states that this office is  responsible for providing leadership and assistance in developing and  implementing DOE-wide policies, procedures, programs, and  management systems pertaining to project management, as well as  for independently monitoring, assessing, and reporting on project  execution performance. Officials from this office are experts in project  management, especially as it relates to capital asset projects. Given  (1) the high-risk posed by EM\u2019s cleanup work and the high  environmental liability, which may continue to grow; (2) the difference  in the stringency of requirements between managing and overseeing  operations activities and capital asset projects; and (3) the concerns  raised by DOE top project management experts that some current  operations activities should be classified as capital asset projects, we  encourage the Secretary to direct EM not only to consult with DOE\u2019s  Office of Project Management but to take advantage of the office\u2019s  role and expertise and direct EM to work with this office to come to an  agreement about proper classification requirements and classification  of current and future cleanup work. It is in DOE\u2019s interest to ensure its  cleanup work is classified and managed appropriately, regardless of  which office is ultimately responsible for the proper classification of  work.", "DOE concurred with our recommendations to review and revise EM\u2019s  2017 cleanup policy to include program and project management  leading practices related to scope, cost, schedule performance, and  independent reviews and to require that EVM systems be maintained  and used in a way that follows EVM best practices.

We  also interviewed DOE officials from the Office of Project Management and  members of the Project Management Risk Committee, and EM officials  from headquarters, such as the Associate Principal Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Field Operations, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Acquisition and Project Management, officials from EM\u2019s Office of Project  Management, Office of Budget and Planning, Office of Program Planning,  officials in charge of managing the Integrated Planning, Accountability,  and Budgeting System database that collects monthly performance  information from the sites, and officials from 5 of EM\u2019s 16 cleanup sites.  (We contacted all sites and interviewed 5 sites over the phone that  responded to our request for an interview.) We then decided to conduct  site visits. We visited two of these sites\u2014Savannah River and Idaho\u2014 because they are among the sites with the highest number of operations  activities and the most diverse types of and highest-cost cleanup work  remaining. Our findings from these 5 sites are not generalizable to all EM  sites, but they help explain the delineation of roles between the site  managers and EM headquarters in managing and classifying cleanup  work. We also attended an EM internal training session in which EM  headquarters officials introduced the 2017 cleanup policy to officials at  the Hanford site and attended EM cleanup public conferences. Moreover,  we reviewed the role of DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management in EM\u2019s  cleanup work. More specifically, we examined whether this office played a  role in the development of EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy and classification of  EM\u2019s cleanup work, consistent with its designation as DOE\u2019s enterprise  project management organization. To assess the reliability of EM\u2019s fiscal  year 2019 budget data, we requested information about EM\u2019s Financial  Integration System module of the Integrated Planning, Accountability, and  Budgeting System database, from which these data were provided.  Based on the responses from officials in charge of this database, we  determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine the extent to which EM\u2019s cleanup policy follows selected  program and project management leading practices, we selected two sets  of criteria for program and project management leading practices using  leading practices from the Project Management Institute, which are  generally recognized as the top leading practices for program and project  management. To select program management leading practices, we first  reviewed the Project Management Institute\u2019s The Standard for Program  Management\u2014Third Edition (2013). We identified 9 program  management leading practices based on PMI\u2019s standards related to a  program\u2019s management of scope, cost, schedule performance, and  independent review of performance. To select project management  leading practices, we first identified 12 project management leading  practices listed in DOE\u2019s Order 413.3B related to a project\u2019s management  of scope, cost, schedule performance, and independent review of  performance. We then compared these 12 project management leading  practices to PMI\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of  Knowledge\u2013Fifth Edition, which includes PMI\u2019s standards for project  management, to make sure these leading practices align with PMI\u2019s standards for project management. To select these leading practices, (1)  two GAO analysts separately examined the PMI and DOE  documentation, then, (2) a GAO specialist independent of the team  producing this report reviewed the leading practices we selected. All three  GAO staff agreed on these selected leading practices. To validate our  selection of program and project management leading practices, we  shared these selected leading practices with PMI representatives and  incorporated their feedback, as appropriate. PMI representatives agreed  with the program and project management leading practices that we  selected.", "We then compared EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy and the 11 associated  standard operating policies and procedures developed by EM by the time  of our analysis (by May 2018) with the 9 program management and 12  project management leading practices we selected. We included these  standard operating policies and procedures in our analysis because EM  officials stated that EM intentionally wrote this policy at a high level  because EM planned to develop standard operating policies and  procedures that would establish more detailed steps to implement the  policy. We analyzed the extent to which the policy and the 11 standard  operating policies and procedures follow these leading practices. We also  interviewed EM headquarters and site officials to learn more about the  2017 cleanup policy. We used a 5-point scoring system to determine the  extent to which EM\u2019s cleanup policy follows selected program and project  management leading practices. We used the following 5-point scoring  system: \u201cfully met\u201d means that complete evidence was provided that  satisfied the leading practice; \u201csubstantially met\u201d means that evidence  was provided that satisfied a large portion of the leading practice;  \u201cpartially met\u201d means that evidence was provided that satisfied about half  of the leading practice; \u201cminimally met\u201d means that evidence was  provided that satisfied a small portion of the leading practice; and \u201cdid not  meet\u201d means that no evidence was provided that satisfied the leading practice. If the score for each leading practice was \u201cfully met\u201d or  \u201csubstantially met,\u201d we concluded that EM\u2019s cleanup policy and its  associated standard operating policies and procedures followed the  leading practice. In contrast, if the score was \u201cpartially met,\u201d \u201cminimally  met,\u201d or \u201cnot met,\u201d we concluded that EM\u2019s policy did not follow the  leading practice. To determine this score, two GAO analysts separately  examined EM\u2019s policy document and then agreed on a final score for  each of the leading practices.", "To examine how EM measures the performance of its operations  activities, we analyzed EM\u2019s use of the three measures of performance  that EM policy identified: earned value management (EVM); performance  metrics; and cleanup milestones. To evaluate EM\u2019s EVM systems, we  compared EM\u2019s use of EVM with 8 of the 10 best practices for earned  value management found in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide,  which draws best practices from federal cost-estimating organizations  and industry. Specifically, we reviewed the use of EVM systems in the  21 contracts EM uses to execute its operations activities and compared  this review\u2019s results with EVM best practices. To gather this information,  we submitted a data collection instrument to all 16 sites to ascertain  whether or not they follow these best practices for each contract  containing operations activities. We also requested documentation, such  as EVM system certification information or surveillance reports,  supporting their answers. We relied mainly on the sites\u2019 responses but,  when available, also reviewed the documentation we received to check  the sites\u2019 answers for accuracy and completeness.", "To determine whether information on EVM is reported to EM senior  leadership, we also reviewed (1) monthly progress reports EM sites  presented to EM headquarters management that ranged from April 2017  to April 2018 depending on the site and (2) monthly reports that EM Office  of Project Management presents to EM headquarters senior leadership;  specifically the April 2018 Cleanup Program Monthly Performance and  the EM Segment Activity Portfolio Summary, or \u201cQuad Chart,\u201d reports,  which were the most recent reports available at the time of this analysis.", "In addition, as part of our analysis, we analyzed EM headquarters\u2019 EVM  data on operations activities from October 2016 through September 2017  (the most recent data available at the time of our review) to determine  whether or not the EVM data were reliable. We checked for data  anomalies, such as missing or negative values for each of those months.  We also reviewed DOE and EM documents\u2014such as monthly progress  reports submitted by the 16 sites to EM headquarters for review or the  monthly reviews prepared by an EM headquarters office for senior  management\u2014to see what EVM data senior management used for  decision-making.", "To provide a score for our analysis, we used the following 5-point scoring  system to score the answer for each contract for each best practice: \u201cfully  met\u201d means that complete evidence was provided that satisfied the best  practice; \u201csubstantially met\u201d means that evidence was provided that  satisfied a large portion of the best practice; \u201cpartially met\u201d means that  evidence was provided that satisfied about half of the best practice;  \u201cminimally met\u201d means that evidence was provided that satisfied a small  portion of the best practice; and, \u201cdid not meet\u201d means that no evidence  was provided that satisfied the best practice. For each best practice, we  color-coded the assessment at the contract level. Contracts that fully met  or substantially met the criteria were coded green, those that partially met  the criteria were coded yellow, and those that did not or minimally meet  the criteria were coded red. We then assigned a score for each color: 1  for red, 3 for yellow, and 5 for green. We determined the overall score for  each best practice by taking the average across the 20 contracts we  reviewed. After scoring each best practice individually, we then used  these scores to develop an average score for the three EVM  characteristics: whether EM has ensured that these EVM systems are (1)  comprehensive, (2) provide reliable data, and (3) are used by EM  leadership for decision-making.", "To examine EM\u2019s use of performance metrics data, we reviewed annual  performance metrics collected by EM headquarters for every operations  activity from 2010 to 2017.
