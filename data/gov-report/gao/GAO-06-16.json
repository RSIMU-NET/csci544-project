This report discusses actions related to the development of this plan, including whether required practices and procedures were followed in contracting for the services of a management consulting company and in hiring an intermittent employee as a consultant. Also, the report identifies avenues of redress available to OSC employees for filing prohibited personnel practice allegations against OSC, and other redress options that could be made available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At OSC's request, the Administrative Resource Center (ARC), an office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt which provides OSC with contracting support for a fee, issued a $140,000 sole-source task order for an organizational assessment to a consulting firm, Military Professional Resources, Inc. (MPRI). In doing so, several required steps were not taken: competition was not sought among Schedule vendors and there was no convincing demonstration of why a sole-source order was necessary; the determination of the reasonableness of MPRI's price was not documented; and OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer's representatives without authorization or training and, further, performed other duties that should have been reserved for the contracting officer. ARC officials told us they relied largely on OSC's input in justifying the sole-source order and determining MPRI's price to be reasonable and that they were unaware that the OSC officials had performed contracting-related duties. They told us that they are now paying particular attention to requests from their customers, including OSC, for sole-source orders. OSC officials said that they relied on ARC's expertise, as their contracting office, to ensure that proper contracting procedures were followed. The tasks specified in the statement of work for the consultant that OSC hired as an intermittent employee and that he completed before his departure were consistent with Office of Personnel Management criteria for appropriate uses of expert and consultant appointments. The intermittent employee was tasked with two major lines of work related to efficiency and curriculum development. OSC management expressed confidence in the individual's qualifications and was within its discretion to both hire him and set his level of compensation. While OSC employees, like other federal employees, are protected against prohibited personnel practices and may seek redress from OSC in making such allegations, this option becomes unworkable because of potential conflicts of interest when an OSC employee raises such an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice against either of the two top OSC officials. Two other federal agencies with redress roles, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, have taken steps to address potential conflicts of interest when their own employees use their agency's respective redress processes. Steps could be taken to ensure that OSC employees have alternative avenues of recourse; for example, they could have an external investigation conducted through an independent body or broader appeal rights to the MSPB. OSC could not independently implement these options, and would need to be given authority to do so."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is charged with safeguarding the merit  system by protecting federal employees from prohibited personnel  practices, such as retaliation against whistleblowing, discrimination, and  nepotism.

In March 2004,  we reported that OSC had not been consistently processing its cases within  statutory time limits, creating backlogs.  In January 2005, in part to reduce  these backlogs, the Special Counsel created a plan to reorganize OSC  offices and change certain internal procedures.", "You raised some questions about certain actions taken as part of OSC\u2019s  plan, including OSC\u2019s sole-source procurement of an organizational  assessment from a management consulting company and the hiring of an  intermittent employee to perform consulting services.

This report responds to your interest by assessing (1) whether  required practices and procedures were followed in contracting for the  services of a management consulting company to conduct an  organizational assessment, (2) whether OSC followed required procedures  and policies when it hired an individual to perform consulting services on  an intermittent basis, (3) the avenues of redress available to OSC  employees who wish to file prohibited personnel practice allegations and  how two other federal agencies with redress roles handle complaints by  their employees against their agency, and (4) other redress options that  could be made available to OSC employees.", "To assess OSC\u2019s actions related to contracting for the organizational  assessment, we reviewed OSC\u2019s memorandum of understanding with the  Administrative Resource Center (ARC), an office within the U.S.  Department of the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Public Debt, to provide  procurement assistance to OSC for a fee.  We reviewed the task order that  ARC issued to the company on behalf of OSC, as well as other documents,  such as OSC\u2019s sole-source justification and the company\u2019s statement of  work.

Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting, business-like  enterprises that provide a variety of common administrative services, such  as payroll processing, information technology support, and contracting.", "The agreement between ARC and OSC is a mechanism for interagency  contracting.  This type of fee-for-service procurement process generally  involves three parties:  the agency requiring a good or service, the agency  placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that  provide the goods and services.  The requiring agency officials determine  the goods or services needed and, if applicable, prepare a statement of  work, sometimes with the assistance of the ordering agency.  The  contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or  order is properly awarded or issued (including any required competition)  and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements.  If  contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer\u2019s  representative\u2014generally an official at the requiring agency with relevant  technical expertise\u2014is normally designated by the contracting officer to  monitor the contractor\u2019s performance and serve as the liaison between the  contracting officer and the contractor.  While interagency contracting can  offer the benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness, this approach  needs to be effectively managed.  Due to the challenges associated with  interagency contracts, we recently designated interagency contracting as a  governmentwide high-risk area.", "As authorized by OSC\u2019s appropriation, OSC may use 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 to hire  intermittent consultants.  Section 3109 permits agencies, when authorized  by an appropriation or other statute, to acquire the temporary or  intermittent services of experts or consultants.  Under the statute,  appointments of experts and consultants may be made without regard to  competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements.   Individuals appointed under this authority may not be paid in excess of the  highest rate payable for a GS-15 unless a higher rate is expressly provided  for by statute or an appropriation.  Under section 3109, OPM is responsible  for prescribing criteria governing circumstances in which it is appropriate  to employ an expert or consultant and for prescribing criteria for setting  pay.", "Section 3109 of title 5 and OPM\u2019s implementing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part  304 provide for broad discretion in the appointment of experts and  consultants.  In promulgating its regulations, OPM recognized that agencies  need to obtain outside opinion and expertise to improve federal programs,  operations, and services and that by bringing in the talent and insights of  experts and consultants, agencies can work more economically and  effectively.", "OSC\u2019s primary mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited  personnel practices.  It carries out this mission by conducting  investigations, attempting informal resolution through discussions with the  agency during the investigation phase (or by offering mediation), and,  when necessary, prosecuting corrective and disciplinary actions before the  MSPB.  An individual may also request that the Special Counsel go before  the MSPB to seek to delay an adverse personnel action, such as a  termination, pending an OSC investigation.  If an agency fails to remedy a  prohibited personnel practice upon request by OSC, corrective action may  be obtained through litigation before the MSPB. OSC may also seek  disciplinary action against an employee believed to be responsible for  committing a prohibited personnel practice by filing a complaint with the  MSPB.  However, when the disciplinary action involves presidential  appointees (subject to Senate confirmation), OSC forwards its complaint  against the appointee, a statement of supporting facts, and any response of  the appointee to the President for appropriate action.", "Obtaining the assistance of OSC may be an individual\u2019s only recourse with  regard to an alleged prohibited personnel practice, unless the individual  can pursue the matter with the MSPB or through the discrimination  complaint process.  Only employees who have been subject to an adverse  action, such as a termination, demotion, or suspension beyond 14 days,  may appeal to the MSPB and argue that such adverse action was the result  of a prohibited personnel practice.  An employee would not be able to go  directly to the MSPB to complain that a geographic relocation was the  result of a prohibited personnel practice.  Even when an employee alleges  that he or she was retaliated against for whistleblowing, he or she must  first go to OSC and wait 120 days before filing directly with the MSPB,  unless that employee was subject to an adverse action as noted above.  An  employee may also pursue resolution of a prohibited personnel practice  through the federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) process if the  prohibited practice relates to discrimination covered under the  antidiscrimination laws enforced by the EEOC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Order for Organizational Assessment Did Not Comply with Rules", "paragraphs": ["In contracting with MPRI for the organizational assessment, several  required steps were not taken:  competition was not sought among Schedule vendors, and there was no  convincing demonstration of why a sole-source order was necessary,  the determination of the reasonableness of MPRI\u2019s price was not   OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer\u2019s  representatives without authorization or training and, further,  performed other duties that should have been reserved for the  contracting officer."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No Competition Was Sought and Waiver Lacked Credibility", "paragraphs": ["Contracting officers are generally required by the Competition in  Contracting Act to promote and provide for full and open competition in  soliciting offers and awarding government contracts.  Use of GSA\u2019s  Schedule program is considered a competitive procedure as long as the  procedures established for the program are followed.  In this instance,  GSA\u2019s procedures required ordering offices to prepare a request for quotes  and evaluate contractor catalogs and price lists, transmit the request to at  least three contractors, and after evaluating the responses, place the order  with the Schedule contractor that represented the best value.  GSA\u2019s  Schedule for Management, Organizational and Business Improvement  Services (MOBIS), under which the MPRI task order was issued, includes  these special ordering procedures.  At the time the MPRI order was placed  (April 2004), neither the FAR nor GSA\u2019s ordering procedures explicitly  provided for sole-source orders under GSA Schedule contracts.  However,  ordering offices could meet competition requirements by properly  justifying such an order.", "Rather than follow the required GSA special ordering procedures by  placing the task order competitively on behalf of OSC, ARC approved a  written sole-source justification prepared by OSC.  The justification  stipulated that the required services were available from only one  responsible source\u2014MPRI\u2014and no other contractor could satisfy agency  requirements.  When supplies or services are available from only one  responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy  agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.  However, the justification merely asserted that \u201cno other contractor except  MPRI, Inc. has the experience and background in this type of sensitive  assessment.\u201d  It did not contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify a  sole-source order and did not provide the minimum required information.", "For example, the justification did not  demonstrate that the proposed contractor\u2019s unique qualifications or the  nature of the acquisition required an exception to full and open  competition,  describe efforts made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many  potential sources as practicable,  determine that the anticipated cost would be fair and reasonable, or  describe the market research conducted and the results.", "The only support in OSC\u2019s justification for the statement that MPRI was  uniquely qualified for the task is a statement that \u201can informal market  survey reveals that only MPRI has the demonstrated past performance in  bringing together the required unbiased and highly ethical subject matter  experts to complete this type of assessment in the time allocated.\u201d    However, the cited market survey does not provide a credible foundation  for the conclusion that only MPRI could perform the work.  The Special  Counsel and his Deputy asked three vendors, including MPRI, for  presentations.  OSC officials could not recall how these three vendors were  selected, and no documentation was available\u2014such as a request for  quotes\u2014that set forth the requirement to which the vendors were  responding.  Rather, the request was communicated orally to the vendors.   OSC provided us with proposals submitted by two of the vendors and  stated that MPRI submitted a statement of work as its proposal.  This  statement of work subsequently became part of ARC\u2019s official contract file.   We found that the summary statement of OSC\u2019s requirement and the scope  of work differ among the three proposals.  OSC officials explained that the  two vendors\u2019 proposals were not well-matched to what the Special Counsel  had communicated to them as OSC\u2019s requirements and that MPRI offered a  \u201cno-frills\u201d approach that met OSC\u2019s needs.  Nevertheless, in the absence of  a documented request for quotes or other solicitation tool, it is not possible  to determine whether MPRI and the other vendors were responding to the  same set of requirements.  Further, our recent search of GSA\u2019s Web site  revealed that 1,668 vendors (1,163 of them small businesses) had contracts  under GSA\u2019s MOBIS schedule, many of which could have potentially  performed the required services.", "The sole-source justification listed other factors as well.  It stated that  \u201cthere is insufficient time and no contractor\u2019s  currently have the  expertise to meet Government\u2019s requirements given the required budget  limitations.\u201d  There is no explanation in the justification as to why only this  contractor could perform the task within the required time frame.  In fact,  despite the reference to urgency, 3 days before the period of performance  was to end, OSC asked ARC to change the required completion date, almost  doubling the time frame from 3 to 5-\u00bd months (with no increase in price).   While acknowledging that the final, written report was a contract  deliverable in the statement of work, OSC officials explained that MPRI  met their needs within the 3-month period by providing a briefing on its  findings that enabled OSC to begin addressing the problems that had been  identified.  Further, contracting without providing for full and open  competition cannot be justified on the basis of concerns related to the  amount of funds available.  Thus, the justification\u2019s reference to budget  constraints necessitating a sole-source order is not a valid rationale.", "ARC contracting officials did not question or validate OSC\u2019s justification,  but told us they relied to a great extent on OSC\u2019s input in justifying the sole- source order.

First,  OSC employees may use the agency\u2019s administrative grievance system.  If  fact-finding is needed for a complaint filed against OSC staff, an OSC  employee who has not been involved in the matter being grieved and, when  possible, does not occupy a position subordinate to any official involved in  the matter being grieved, is selected to conduct a review and prepare a  report.  Ideally, that employee is also located in a different geographic area;  for example, an OSC employee in Dallas could be assigned to a complaint  filed in Washington, D.C.  OSC officials stated that this would ensure  objectivity and independence in the processing of the complaint. Fact- finding is conducted informally and includes the collection of documents  and statements of witnesses, as necessary.  The grievant\u2019s second-level  supervisor would render a decision based upon the fact-finder\u2019s report and  any comments on the report provided by the grievant.  The grievant may  appeal this decision to the Deputy Special Counsel, or, if the matter was  grieved to the Deputy Special Counsel in the first instance, to the Special  Counsel.  Both current and former OSC officials stated that this process  could be successfully used when the prohibited personnel practice  allegation relates to the actions of an official below the Deputy Special  Counsel level.  However, if the administrative grievance system were to be  used to address grievances against the Special Counsel or the Deputy  Special Counsel, there would be a conflict of interest since the final  decision maker in this process is the Special Counsel.", "Second, OSC officials stated that OSC employees who believe a prohibited  personnel practice has occurred can file a complaint with OSC in the same  fashion as an individual from outside OSC.  However, OSC employees do  not have an outside agency to represent them in an independent manner\u2014 the role that OSC plays for non-OSC employees in cases involving  prohibited personnel practices.  When an employee raises a prohibited  personnel practice allegation against the Special Counsel, addressing such  an allegation within OSC becomes unworkable because, OSC officials  stated, all OSC employees ultimately report to the Special Counsel.

However, the effort was not  completed, she said, noting that OSC staff did not reach a consensus over  what the alternative process should be for handling complaints against the  Special Counsel.  The previous Special Counsel and current OSC officials  who were involved in this effort told us that one of the options being  considered was to have the matter investigated by an outside inspector  general.

The PCIE is an interagency council, including presidentially  appointed inspectors general, charged with promoting integrity and  efficiency in federal programs.  The complaint stated that OSC could not  investigate these allegations because the Special Counsel could not oversee  an investigation of which he is the subject and that all OSC staff are his  subordinates.  The complaint further observed that the complainants\u2019  ability to remain anonymous would be jeopardized if any OSC staff were  assigned to work on the investigation.   As discussed above, current OSC  policy and procedures do not provide for special handling of complaints  against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel.  The Deputy  Special Counsel told us that he and the Special Counsel agreed that OSC  should not handle the complaint, and subsequently forwarded it to the  PCIE\u2019s Integrity Committee and notified the chair of the PCIE.
