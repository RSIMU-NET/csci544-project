In April 2003, GAO reported that NASA's acquisition strategy has increased the risk that the agency will implement a system that will cost more and do less than planned. This report is one of a series of reviews of NASA's acquisition and implementation of IFMP, and focuses on the core financial module's ability to provide the information necessary for external financial reporting."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The core financial module of IFMP provides NASA its first agencywide accounting system--a significant improvement over the 10 disparate systems previously used. However, to meet IFMP's aggressive implementation schedule, NASA deferred testing and implementation of many key requirements of the core financial module. Consequently, when NASA announced, in June 2003, that this module was fully operational at each of its 10 centers, about two-thirds of the financial events or transaction types needed to carry out day-to-day operations and produce external financial reports had not been implemented in the module. NASA officials acknowledged that, as part of their implementation strategy, they had not yet converted the module to support full-cost accounting. In addition, we found that NASA also deferred implementation of other key core financial module capabilities. Because NASA did not use disciplined processes for defining, managing, and testing key system requirements, or substantially reengineer its business processes prior to implementation, the core financial module, as implemented in June 2003, does not address several long-standing external reporting issues and has created some new problems. Long-standing external financial reporting issues have not been addressed. NASA has not used its implementation of the core financial module as an opportunity to drive needed changes in its management practices and business processes. Therefore, the system does little to address NASA's ability to properly account for $37 billion of reported property or certain aspects of the agency's $15 billion annual budget. New financial reporting problems have emerged. NASA went forward with its aggressive implementation plans even though agency managers knew of problems with the module's ability to properly process and record certain transactions. As a result, the module does not appropriately capture critical information on the cost of NASA's operations, such as certain accrued costs, accounts payable, and obligation transactions. In April 2003, GAO reported that the core financial module did not address key internal management information requirements. Now, GAO has found that the module cannot reliably provide key financial data needed for external financial reporting. Although NASA intends to address many of these issues, its implementation approach raises concerns over its ability to do so. These deferred external reporting capabilities, combined with the findings from our April 2003 report, indicate that NASA's June 2003 core financial module and related systems do not substantially comply with the requirements of Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA). FFMIA addresses the need for agencies' financial systems to provide value to those who use financial data. NASA must address these issues if the core financial module and IFMP are to achieve the objective of providing reliable, timely financial information for both internal management decision-making and external reporting purposes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has  cited deficiencies with its financial management systems as a primary  reason for not having the necessary data required to oversee its  contractors, accurately account for the full cost of its operations, and  efficiently produce accurate and reliable information needed for both  management decision-making and external reporting purposes.   Recognizing the importance of successfully implementing an integrated  financial management system, in April 2000, NASA began an effort known  as the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP).  When  completed, IFMP is planned to consist of nine modules that will support a  range of financial, administrative, and functional areas.  On June 23, 2003,  NASA announced that the core financial module\u2014considered the  backbone of IFMP\u2014was fully operational at each of NASA\u2019s 10 centers.     The core financial module is intended to provide NASA\u2019s financial and  program managers with timely, consistent, and reliable cost and  performance information for management decisions and external financial  reporting.", "NASA has made two efforts in the recent past to improve its financial  management processes and systems but both of these efforts were  eventually abandoned after spending a total of 12 years and a reported   $180 million. Given the importance of NASA\u2019s current effort, you asked us  to assess the program.  In April 2003, we issued our first report on IFMP to  alert you to concerns we had, based on our work to date.  In that report, we  provided you with, among other things, our assessment of the core  financial module\u2019s ability to satisfy NASA\u2019s internal management decision- making needs.", "As agreed, we continued our review of IFMP in three areas to assess:  (1) whether NASA has been acquiring and implementing IFMP in the  context of an enterprise architecture, (2) the extent to which the core  financial module will address NASA\u2019s external reporting requirements, and  (3) NASA\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate and schedule for IFMP. We are  responding to the first and third issues in separate reports, and we have  summarized our findings on all three issues in a summary report.  This  report addresses the second issue\u2014the extent to which the core financial  module, as completed in June 2003, will satisfy NASA\u2019s key external  reporting requirements.  Specifically, we assessed whether the core  financial module, as of June 2003, provides the functionality needed to  (1) accurately account for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and  material, (2) properly account for the full cost of NASA\u2019s projects and  programs, (3) capture and report certain key budgetary information,   (4) accurately record accounts payable, and (5) comply substantially with  the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act  (FFMIA) of 1996.   FFMIA emphasizes the need for agencies to be able to  provide financial management information, including cost information, for  measuring the results of program performance on an ongoing basis.   FFMIA also requires that an agency\u2019s independent auditor report on the  ability of agency financial management systems to comply substantially  with these requirements.", "We performed our work from April 2003 through September 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.   Details on our objective, scope, and methodology are in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["From 1996 through 2000, NASA was one of the few agencies to be judged  by its independent auditor at that time, Arthur Andersen, as meeting all of  the federal financial reporting requirements.  That is, NASA was one of the  few agencies to receive an unqualified, or \u201cclean,\u201d opinion on its financial  statements, with no material internal control weaknesses noted, and no  indications that its financial management systems were not in substantial  compliance with the requirements of FFMIA.  FFMIA reflects the need for  agencies to have systems that produce reliable, timely, and accurate  financial information needed for day-to-day decision making by requiring  agencies to implement and maintain financial management systems that  substantially comply with (1) federal financial management systems  requirements, (2) the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger (SGL) at  the transaction level, and (3) applicable federal accounting standards.  Thus, the auditor\u2019s report implied that NASA could not only  generate reliable information once a year for external financial reporting  purposes but also could provide the kind of information needed for day-to- day management decision making.", "However, as we and others have reported, the independent auditor\u2019s  reports did not provide an accurate picture of NASA\u2019s financial  management systems and, instead, failed to disclose pervasive financial  management problems that existed at NASA.  For example, we have  identified NASA\u2019s contract management function as an area of high risk  since 1990 because of NASA\u2019s inability to (1) oversee its contractors and  their financial and program performance, and (2) implement a modern,  integrated financial management system, which is integral to producing  accurate and reliable financial information needed to support contract  management.  Also, in February 2002, NASA\u2019s new independent auditor,  PricewaterhouseCoopers, further confirmed NASA\u2019s financial management  difficulties and disclaimed an opinion on the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2001  financial statements.  The audit report also identified a number of material  internal control weaknesses\u2014primarily regarding PP&E and materials\u2014 and stated that, contrary to previous financial audit reports, NASA\u2019s  financial management systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA.", "While NASA received an unqualified opinion for its fiscal year 2002  financial statements, these results were achieved only through heroic  efforts on the part of NASA and its auditor and again, the audit report  identified a number of material internal control weaknesses and stated that  NASA\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially comply with  FFMIA.  To its credit, in April 2000, NASA began an effort known as IFMP.   The schedule for implementing IFMP was originally planned for fiscal year  2008, but after NASA\u2019s new Administrator came on board in fiscal year  2002, the timeline was accelerated to fiscal year 2006, with the core  financial module to be completed in fiscal year 2003.  NASA\u2019s IFMP  includes nine module projects supporting a range of financial,  administrative, and functional areas.  According to NASA officials, of the  nine module projects, five are in operation, one is currently in  implementation, and three are future modules.  The five modules in  operation are resume management, position description management,  travel management, executive financial management information (called  Erasmus), and core financial; the one project in implementation is budget  formulation; and the three future module projects are human resources,  asset management, and contract administration.", "The core financial module, which utilizes the SAP R/3 system, is  considered the backbone of IFMP and has become NASA\u2019s standard,  integrated accounting system used agencywide.  The other IFMP module  projects will be integrated/interfaced with the core financial module, where  applicable.  The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program  (JFMIP) defines a core financial system (or module) as the backbone of  an agency\u2019s integrated financial management system: It should provide  common processing routines, support common data for critical financial  management functions affecting the entire agency, and maintain the  required financial data integrity control over financial transactions,  resource balances, and other financial systems.  A core financial system  should support an agency\u2019s general ledger, funds management, payment,  receivable, and cost management functions.  Also, the system should  receive data from other financial-related systems, such as inventory and  property systems, and from direct user input, and it should provide data for  financial statement preparation and for financial performance  measurement and analysis.", "The scope of NASA\u2019s core financial module includes the general ledger,  budget execution, purchasing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and  cost management.  NASA completed implementation of the core financial  module at all 10 NASA centers in June 2003.  The pilot for the core financial  module\u2014conducted at Marshall Space Flight Center\u2014was implemented in  October 2002.  NASA then deployed the core financial module at the other 9  NASA centers in three \u201cwaves,\u201d the last of which was completed in June  2003.", "In April 2003, we issued our first report on IFMP in response to your  request.  At that time, we reported that NASA was not following key best  practices for acquiring and implementing the system, which may affect the  agency\u2019s ability to fully benefit from the new system\u2019s capabilities.   Specifically, we reported that NASA (1) did not analyze the relationships  among selected and proposed IFMP components, (2) had deferred  addressing the needs of key system stakeholders, including program  managers and cost estimators, and (3) did not properly manage and test its  system requirements prior to implementation of the core financial module.   As a result, we reported that:  NASA has increased its risks of implementing a system that will not  optimize mission performance, and will cost more and take longer to  implement than necessary;   the core financial module is not being designed to integrate the cost and  schedule data that program managers need to oversee the work of  NASA\u2019s contractors; and    costly rework will likely be required to fix requirement defects not  identified prior to implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule-driven Approach Limits Transaction Processing Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Although NASA has met the core financial management module\u2019s  implementation schedule, the system as implemented in June 2003 has  limited external financial reporting capabilities.

However, to meet its  implementation schedule, we also found that NASA (1) deferred  requirements that require significant business process reengineering or  extensive software configuration and (2) continues to rely on manual  procedures for many transactions that should be automated in the new  system.  Consequently, only about one-third of the transaction types that  NASA uses in its business processes are currently implemented and fully  automated in the core financial module."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Full Cost of NASA\u2019s Programs Not Yet Available", "paragraphs": ["As part of its implementation strategy, NASA delayed conversion to full- cost accounting until the core financial module was implemented at all  centers.  After completing implementation of the module in June 2003,  NASA began designing the agency\u2019s new cost-allocation structure and  expected that full-cost accounting capabilities needed to provide the full  cost of its programs and projects for external financial reporting purposes  would be available through the core financial module by October 1, 2003.   Properly designing, configuring, and testing the cost-allocation structure is  key to capturing the full costs of all direct and indirect resources and  allocating them to NASA\u2019s programs and activities.  However, on May 30,  2003, NASA\u2019s Inspector General reported that NASA had not yet determined  how to allocate space shuttle program costs to programs that benefit from  space shuttle services or how to allocate civil service personnel costs to  benefiting programs and projects. Once these issues were resolved, NASA  would then have to configure the core financial module software to  accommodate the new allocation structure and properly test the new  configuration.  Consequently, NASA\u2019s Inspector General expressed  concerns about NASA\u2019s ability to meet its October 1, 2003, target date.  In  early October, we inquired about the status of full-cost accounting within  the core financial module and IFMP officials told us that this capability  would be fully implemented on October 26, 2003.  However, because of the  timing of this report, we did not verify whether this implementation date  was met.", "If NASA is successful in implementing full-cost accounting, the new system  should link all of NASA\u2019s direct and indirect costs to specific programs and  projects, and for the first time shed light on the full cost of these programs  for external financial reporting purposes.

Adequately testing and configuring a system  prior to implementation helps assure the integrity and effectiveness of  transactions that will be processed through the system, thereby reducing  the likelihood of rejected transactions, labor-intensive manual  workarounds, and inaccurate data.  However, prior to implementation,  NASA tested only 120, or 53 percent, of the 225 unique financial events or  transaction types identified by NASA as critical for carrying out day-to-day  operations and producing external financial reports.  NASA deferred  implementation of the remaining 105 transaction types until after June 23,  2003, when the system would be implemented at all centers.", "Ideally, all transactions should be thoroughly tested prior to implementing  a system.  However, to meet the agency\u2019s implementation schedule, NASA  identified and deferred implementation of transactions that it determined  would not have a significant or immediate impact on operations.  For  example, 29 of the deferred transactions were related to year-end closing  procedures that would not be needed until September 30, 2003.  However,  other deferred transactions do have a significant and immediate impact on  NASA\u2019s operations throughout the year.  For example, 40 transaction types  were related to upward and downward adjustments to prior year data,  many of which affected NASA\u2019s ability to properly capture adjustments to  obligations.   Because NASA deferred implementing this capability, the  agency has continued to rely on ad hoc, manual processes and  \u201cworkarounds.\u201d  As discussed later, these are the same cumbersome  manual processes that resulted in a $644 million error in NASA\u2019s fiscal year  1999 financial statements.", "NASA hoped to implement most of these deferred transactions by October  2003.  In mid-October, NASA officials told us that 75 of the 105 deferred  transaction types had been implemented, and the remaining 30 transaction  types would be implemented later in fiscal year 2004.

Although manual  accounting entries are sometimes necessary to record unusual or  infrequent events, many of NASA\u2019s manual entries are made to record  routine events that should be processed electronically.  For example, NASA  uses summary-level manual processes to record all transactions occurring  throughout the year related to its reported $37 billion of property.   Such a  large proportion of manual procedures runs contrary to the purpose of an  automated system and makes the agency more vulnerable to processing  errors and delays.  In fact, prior to implementation, NASA\u2019s consultant  responsible for performing an independent compliance review of the core  financial module raised concerns about the excessive number of  transactions processed with manual journal voucher entries.

However, NASA currently updates the core financial module\u2019s  general ledger using periodic summary-level manual entries.  Although  NASA plans to implement an integrated asset management module in 2005,  this alone will not ensure that transaction-level detail is used to update the  core financial module.", "NASA\u2019s PP&E and materials are physically located at many locations  throughout the world, including NASA centers, contractor facilities, other  private or government run facilities, and in space.  NASA\u2019s most significant  challenge, with respect to property accounting, stems from property  located at contractor facilities, which accounts for almost $11 billion, or  about one-third, of NASA\u2019s reported $37 billion of PP&E and materials and  consists primarily of equipment being constructed for NASA or items built  or purchased for use in the construction process.  NASA has not  reengineered the agency\u2019s processes for capturing contract costs  associated with PP&E and material, though, and therefore, does not record  these property costs in the general ledger at the transaction level. Instead,  according to NASA officials, the agency plans to continue to (1) record the  cost of PP&E and materials as expenses when initially incurred,   (2) periodically determine which of those costs should have been  capitalized, and (3) manually correct these records at a summary level.", "To illustrate, NASA\u2019s contractors provide NASA with monthly contractor  cost reports, which contain accrued cost information for any work  performed during the month.  However, these reports do not contain  enough information for NASA to determine what portion of the reported  cost pertains to the construction or acquisition of property and therefore,  NASA initially records all costs reported by its contractors as an expense.   Then, on a quarterly or annual basis, NASA receives a property report  from its contractors that provides summary-level information on the  amount of property constructed or purchased and currently in the  contractor\u2019s possession.  Based on these reports, NASA records the cost of  contractor-held assets in its general ledger and reverses the expense  previously recorded from the contractor cost reports. The problem with  NASA\u2019s current process for capturing, recording, and accounting for  property in the possession of contractors is that it provides no way for  NASA to ensure that the money it spends on the construction of its  property is actually recorded as discrete property items.", "Although NASA plans to implement an integrated asset management  module in 2005, the new system will not change the way NASA captures,  records, and accounts for property in the possession of contractors.  As  noted above, because this problem stems from NASA\u2019s inability to link  accrued costs reported by its contractors with specific equipment items  being constructed, the problem will not be alleviated when physical  custody of the equipment is ultimately transferred to NASA and recorded in  NASA\u2019s property records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Requirements Deferred for Statement of Budgetary Resources", "paragraphs": ["The core financial module does not capture and report certain key  budgetary information needed to prepare the agency\u2019s Statement of  Budgetary Resources.  Although the software that NASA purchased for the  core financial module was certified by JFMIP as meeting all mandatory  system requirements, NASA may have relied too heavily on the JFMIP  certification.  JFMIP has made it clear that its certification, by itself, does  not automatically ensure compliance with the goals of FFMIA.  Other  important factors that affect compliance with Federal Financial  Management System Requirements (FFMSR) include how well the  software has been configured to work in the agency\u2019s environment and the  quality of transaction data in the agency\u2019s feeder systems.  When NASA  later tested specific requirements related to adjustments to prior year  obligations, the core financial module failed the test.  Consequently, NASA  deferred implementation of those requirements and opted to rely on  manual compilations, system queries, or other workarounds to compensate  for the system\u2019s inadequacies. These workarounds are known to have  caused reporting problems in the past.", "According to FFMSR, an agency\u2019s core financial module should  automatically classify and record upward and downward adjustments of  prior year obligations to the appropriate general ledger accounts.   However, NASA\u2019s core financial module, as implemented in June 2003, does  not provide this capability.  For example, if an upward adjustment is  required because an invoice includes costs not previously included on the  purchase order, such as shipping costs, the system erroneously posts the  upward adjustment to a prior year obligation instead of a current year  obligation.  Because the system does not properly capture and report these  adjustments, NASA must rely on manual compilations and system queries  to extract the data needed to prepare the agency\u2019s Statement of Budgetary  Resources\u2014just as it did using its legacy general ledger systems.  As we  reported in March 2001, this cumbersome, labor-intensive effort to gather  the information needed at the end of each fiscal year was the underlying  cause of a $644 million misstatement in NASA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 Statement  of Budgetary Resources.", "During its initial test of system requirements but prior to implementation at  Marshall Space Flight Center and Glenn Research Center in October 2002,  NASA became aware of the software\u2019s limitations regarding upward and  downward adjustments to prior year obligations.

However, the upgrades  incorporated after the initial implementation at Marshall and Glenn did not  resolve all of the issues related to upward and downward adjustments.  As  a result, NASA continued to face significant problems in this area.   According to NASA officials, the agency continued to work with the  software vendor to reconfigure the software as necessary to accommodate  adjustments to prior year obligations.  NASA expected a new software  patch to resolve any remaining problems by October 1, 2003.

This standard states that  a liability should be recognized and recorded as an account payable  when contractors construct facilities or equipment for the government.   The liability should be based on an estimate of work completed.   However, the core financial module does not capture accrued costs or  record accounts payable when the cumulative costs for a given contract  exceed obligations.

This standard requires agencies to report the full  cost of their programs in their general-purpose financial reports.

The concepts  and standards included in SFFAS No. 4 are aimed at achieving three  general objectives: (1) providing program managers with relevant and  reliable information relating costs to program outputs, (2) providing  relevant and reliable cost information to assist the Congress and  executives in making decisions about allocating federal resources and  evaluating program performance, and (3) ensuring consistency between  costs reported in general purpose financial reports and costs reported to  program managers.  However, as we reported in April 2003, the core  financial module does not provide program managers, cost estimators,  or the Congress with managerially relevant cost information that they  need to effectively manage and oversee NASA\u2019s contracts and programs.   As a result, NASA\u2019s continuing inability to provide its managers with  timely, relevant data on the cost, schedule, and performance of its  programs is a key reason that GAO continues to report NASA\u2019s contract  management as an area of high risk. Because this information is not  available through the core financial module, program managers will  continue to rely on hard copy reports, electronic spreadsheets, or other  means to monitor contractor performance.  Consequently, NASA risks  operating with two sets of books\u2014one that is used to report information  in the agency\u2019s general-purpose financial reports and another that is  used by program managers to run NASA\u2019s projects and programs.", "Compliance with federal accounting standards goes far beyond  receiving a \u201cclean\u201d opinion on financial statements.  A key indicator that  an agency\u2019s financial management systems do not substantially comply  with federal accounting standards is the existence of material  weaknesses in the agency\u2019s internal controls.  As noted earlier,  NASA  has not addressed material weaknesses in its internal controls and  processes over PP&E and materials, which make up nearly 85 percent,  or $37 billion, of NASA\u2019s assets.

Thus far, NASA has focused on deploying the  system on its established schedule, rather than ensuring that it satisfies the  agency\u2019s internal management and external reporting requirements.  To  meet its schedule, NASA has put off addressing user requirements that  would necessitate significant business process reengineering or extensive  software configuration.  While NASA is meeting its implementation  milestones, it is only able to do so because the agency has deferred critical  system capabilities, such as the ability to properly capture, record, and  account for its PP&E and material; process budgetary accounting entries;  and provide managerially relevant cost information.

Although NASA  takes issue with the date of our review, it is important to note that we  selected June 2003 because NASA represented that the core financial  module was fully operational at all of its centers at that time. In making that  representation, NASA officials acknowledged that, as part of their  implementation strategy, they had not yet converted the system to support  full-cost accounting.  However, they did not disclose any other deferred  capabilities.", "Moreover, NASA\u2019s comments assert that for PP&E and budgetary reporting,  the manual processes or workarounds it has developed to produce year- end balances for the agency\u2019s annual financial statements also satisfy the  requirements of FFMIA.  We disagree with this assertion.  The development  of significant manual workarounds in these areas masks the fact that  NASA\u2019s core financial module is not designed to, and cannot, produce  timely and reliable PP&E and budgetary data with traceability to  transaction-based support.  The ability to produce reliable numbers once a  year for financial reporting purposes does not by itself constitute FFMIA  compliance.  In its written comments, NASA indicated that it has made  changes to the module since June and that the core financial module as  implemented in October 2003 has many of the capabilities that were  lacking in the June 2003 module.  Although we requested status updates  between June and October to track NASA\u2019s progress, we did not reassess  the module\u2019s capabilities as of October 2003.  However, with the possible  exception of full-cost accounting, which was planned for October 1, 2003,  the changes NASA has cited still involve manual workarounds for  producing year-end numbers.

Specifically, NASA stated that it (1) has extended the data structure  embedded in the core financial module to capture more detailed cost data,  (2) is currently assessing its contractor reporting requirements, and (3) is  evaluating the possibility of accommodating contract cost and schedule  data in an integrated environment.   While it is too early to assess the  significance or impact of NASA\u2019s current effort, we are encouraged that  NASA is considering the possibility of reengineering its acquisition  management processes.  This would be an important first step toward  ensuring that NASA\u2019s contractors provide the appropriate level and type of  cost data needed for both internal management and external reporting  purposes and that the core financial module is properly configured to  support the agency\u2019s information needs. However, we continue to believe it  would have been more effective and efficient if NASA had conducted its  assessment of contractor reporting requirements as part of a larger  reengineering effort prior to configuration of the core financial module.", "Further, any effort that falls short of end-to-end business process  reengineering will likely not result in a system that substantially improves  the data available for contract oversight or ensures consistency between  costs reported in general purpose financial reports and costs reported to  program mangers.", "In its written comments, NASA also emphasized that the core financial  module alone cannot meet all of the functional requirements needed to  manage a program or to prepare cost estimates and asserts that  applications such as Erasmus, an executive-level program performance  reporting tool, will enable NASA to meet the full depth and breadth of user  requirements. We agree that the core financial module alone cannot meet  all of NASA\u2019s information needs and that an executive-level reporting tool  such as Erasmus may provide NASA executives with greater visibility over  program performance.  However, Erasmus does little to help program  managers oversee contractor performance, and like the core financial  module, may contain cost data that are not consistent or reconcilable with  cost data used by program managers to manage contracts.  The underlying  problem, as we reported in April 2003, is that NASA uses one set of  contractor-reported cost data to update the core financial module while  program managers use a separate set of contractor-reported cost data that  resides outside the system to monitor contractor performance.   Consequently, the cost data maintained in the core financial module and  reported in NASA\u2019s external financial reports are not consistent or  reconcilable with cost data used by program managers to manage  contracts.", "Finally, NASA stated that the asset management module, scheduled for  implementation in 2005, will make a significant contribution to its program  management and cost estimating activities.  This module is primarily  intended to maintain detailed property records for NASA-held property.

NASA represented that its current  processes for capturing and recording property for financial statement  reporting purposes also meet the requirements of FFMIA because it has  begun requiring more frequent and detailed property reporting by its 55  largest contractors.  We disagree with NASA\u2019s assertion.  Because NASA\u2019s  current contractor cost-reporting processes do not provide the information  needed to distinguish between capital and non-capital expenditures, NASA  currently records as expenses all contractor costs as they are incurred and  then manually adjusts previous entries to record assets based on periodic  summary-level contractor property reports.  While this process may satisfy  NASA financial statement reporting needs, the development of significant  manual workarounds in this area masks the fact that NASA\u2019s core module is  not designed to and cannot produce timely and reliable PP&E data with  traceability to transaction-based support.  The ability to produce reliable  numbers once a year for financial reporting purposes does not equate to  FFMIA compliance.", "In accordance with FFMSR, federal accounting standards, and the SGL,  when an agency incurs costs for the purchase or construction of PP&E and  material, those costs should be recorded in both the agency\u2019s asset  management system and its core financial management systems\u2019 general  ledger.  The only difference for contractor-held property is that the asset  management system belongs to the contractor.  The asset management  system, whether NASA\u2019s or its contractors\u2019, would maintain the agency\u2019s  detailed logistical property records for PP&E and materials\u2014including  information related to asset location, date of purchase, useful life, quantity,  cost, and condition\u2014and the core financial module\u2019s general ledger would  maintain a cumulative balance of all purchased or constructed property  based on the cost incurred for individual items.  The ability to reconcile  detailed transactions in the asset management system with amounts  recorded in the general ledger provides an efficient way to maintain  independent general ledger control over these assets.  As mentioned above,  NASA first expenses all PP&E in the core financial module, and then later,  makes adjustments to record the costs of PP&E as assets at a summary  level.  There is currently no traceability from the core financial module  general ledger to the detailed logistical property records of PP&E and  materials.", "NASA also stated that one of the objectives of the asset management  module, now in formulation, is to significantly improve reporting for  contractor-held property.  While it is our understanding that NASA\u2019s new  asset management module, as planned, will maintain detailed property  records for NASA-held property and be integrated with other IFMP  modules, including the core financial module, we know of no plans to add  contractor-held property to this system. In fact, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation requires contractors to maintain the logistical property records  for government property in their possession and prohibits government  agencies from maintaining duplicate property records.  Under these  circumstances, as part of an overall effort to reengineer its acquisition  management process, we believe that NASA must capture the cost and  other information it needs from its contractors and develop traceability to  contractor logistical records to ensure accountability over its contractor- held property on an ongoing basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budgetary Information", "paragraphs": ["NASA disagreed with our recommendation regarding its ability to produce  reliable, timely, and useful budgetary information, including adjustments to  prior year obligations.

While  NASA\u2019s written comments indicate that many of these deferred capabilities  were largely enabled by September 30, 2003, they also indicate that more  time will be required before the module can process adjustments to prior  year obligations.  As a result, NASA must use manual workarounds to  process these transactions related to fiscal year 2003 activity.

We recognize that NASA records costs that exceed  current obligations in the IFMP business warehouse until additional funds  are obligated and in order to highlight or detect potential program cost  overruns.  While we encourage NASA\u2019s effort to monitor costs in excess of  obligations, we do not believe its method for doing so is appropriate.  We  continue to believe that these costs should be properly recorded in the  general ledger in the period in which they are incurred.  The risk in NASA\u2019s  method is that when costs and liabilities are not properly recorded in the  general ledger, these balances are likely to be understated in any financial  reports produced during the year, as well as at year-end.", "It is also important to note that comparing costs with obligations will not  necessarily detect a cost overrun.  For example, this strategy would not  have alerted NASA to its largest cost overrun in recent years\u2014the $5 billion  cost growth in the International Space Station program reported in 2001.   This overrun was not the result of incurring more costs than the funds  obligated.  Instead, it was due to the cost growth projected to occur in the  future\u2014i.e., growth in the estimated costs to complete the program.  This  cost overrun went undetected for a long period of time because of NASA\u2019s  deeply-rooted culture of managing programs based on current year budgets  rather than total costs.  As we reported in 2002, for NASA to manage its  program costs properly, it needs to focus on the total costs of a program  rather than just annual budgets.  Thus, NASA\u2019s plan to hold costs in  suspense when they exceed obligations will not make such cost overruns  any easier to detect or manage.  Instead, as we reported in April 2003, to  adequately oversee NASA\u2019s contracts, program managers need reliable  contract cost data\u2014both budgeted and actual\u2014and the ability to integrate  these data with contract schedule information to monitor progress on the  contract.
