For  example, contractors noted the site\u2019s participation in a service academy  career conference in San Diego, California, in August 2018. They also  said they are considering ways to recruit skilled positions that are in high  demand, such as toolmakers, by offering to cover relocation expenses for  newly hired workers. They further noted that the site maintains an  internship program and has plans to double the number of interns, from  35 in 2018 to 71 in 2019, as a strategy to increase talent in critical areas.", "According to Kansas City site contractor representatives, the site  increased the total number of contractor staff by about 65 percent in a 4- year period, from 2,492 in August 2014 to 4,134 in August 2018, and is  expected to continue to increase to nearly 5,000 staff by August 2019.  Figure 9 shows the change in number of Kansas City site staff during the  last fiscal year for which data are complete, and the reasons for the  changes, as reported to us by site contractor representatives. To meet  forecasted workload increases, the site plans to continue to increase staff  in each year through 2020, with the numbers of planned annual hires  ranging from 800 to more than 1,000 staff, according to site contractor  representatives.", "Obtaining Timely Security Clearances for New Staff  Kansas City site officials identified a challenge in obtaining appropriate,  high-level security clearances for new staff on a timely basis. Contractor  representatives we interviewed noted that 100 percent of staff who  directly contribute to the design, disposition, fabrication, inspection,  scheduling, and protection of products and services related to nuclear  weapons require a Q clearance. They further noted that the large  majority of support functions also require a Q clearance. As we reported  in March 2018,  the National Background Investigation Bureau had a  backlog of more than 700,000 investigations as of February 2018. As  we reported, this backlog was caused in part by two 2015 breaches of  Office of Personnel Management personnel records. We designated the  government-wide personnel security clearance process as a high-risk  area in January 2018.", "Of this national backlog, 3,609 were investigations of Q applicants. As of  April 2018, over 790 Kansas City site personnel were awaiting Q  clearances, according to Kansas City site contractor representatives.  According to these representatives, historically, the Bureau took 80 days,  on average, to investigate most Q applicants prior to the 2015 breaches;  however, as of February 2018, the Bureau took 316 days, on average, to  do so. According to Kansas City site contractor representatives, the  Bureau is not projecting normal operations until late 2019 or early 2020.  From fiscal year 2017 through March 2018, 778 Q clearances were  granted for the Kansas City site, with an average of 335 days at the  Bureau and another 27 days at NNSA to make a final determination.  According to site contractor representatives, these long wait times may  contribute to less than full employee utilization at the site. For example,  they noted that fully cleared staff are able to perform roughly 38 percent  more productive work than uncleared staff, and that difference amounts to  approximately 695 direct labor hours of productive work per person in a  year.", "The Kansas City site is taking steps to mitigate the challenges associated  with the Bureau\u2019s backlog. For example, the site is hiring hourly  production factory staff well in advance of the full production schedule for  the B61-12 and W88 Alt 370 weapons systems in fiscal year 2019, in part  to ensure these staff will be cleared in time to meet workload demands,  according to site contractor representatives. Site contractor  representatives told us that they have also worked to expedite the  issuance of clearances by working with local Office of Personnel  Management officials on interviews for clearance cases. In addition, the  site has worked to ensure that new staff can be trained and productive  while awaiting clearances. Specifically, according to contractor  representatives, the site has established segregated training space for uncleared workers;  created security plans and escorting practices that allow uncleared  staff supervised access into secure areas to perform unclassified  work, where possible; and  temporarily converted some production space into areas where  uncleared staff can perform unclassified hand assembly work.", "In addition, the Kansas City site has requested 339 interim Q clearances,  267 of which had been approved, as of January 2018. DOE\u2019s order that  establishes requirements for processing and granting security clearances  allows for interim security clearances to be issued under exceptional  circumstances and when such action is clearly consistent with agency  and national interests. DOE considers interim clearances to be temporary  measures pending completion of the investigation, which must be in  process when the interim clearance is granted. As of September 2018,  less than 1 percent of interim clearances approved for the Kansas City  site had been cancelled once full investigations were completed,  according to site contractor representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["Kansas City site contractor representatives identified challenges  regarding the site\u2019s monitoring and management of external suppliers\u2019  capacity and skills, and other challenges\u2014such as ensuring that suppliers  are willing to establish long-term partnerships with the Kansas City site\u2014 that could affect supply chain risk. Since the site procures about 65  percent of its nonnuclear components from external suppliers, these  management challenges are highly important, according to site contractor  representatives. For example, disruption to the established supply chain  due to insufficient capacity, skills, or a supplier\u2019s decision not to do  business with the Kansas City site can result in production delays.  According to Kansas City site contractor representatives, delays in such  instances are possible because site contractor representatives would  need to take additional time to either replace the lost supplier or develop  its own production line to produce the parts in-house at the Kansas City  site.", "To help mitigate challenges regarding the site\u2019s overall monitoring and  management of suppliers\u2019 capacity, skills, and other risks, the Kansas  City contractor representatives said that they developed two key analytic  tools. These tools are a Supplier Capacity Analysis Tool, developed in  2018, and a Supplier Overall Risk Tool, which has been evolving since  2015, according to these representatives. According to Kansas City site  officials, contractor representatives use these analytical tools to evaluate  over 230 suppliers on a quarterly basis and to evaluate the top 39  suppliers monthly. The evaluations assess factors such as operational  performance and financial health, whether a supplier is the sole  commodity supplier, and a supplier\u2019s willingness to partner with the site.", "To help mitigate supplier capacity risks, the site develops plans, using  information from the supplier evaluations, to ensure sufficient external  supplier capacity, according to Kansas City site contractor  representatives. For example, Kansas City site contractor representatives  used the supplier capacity analysis tool to identify capacity gaps for at- risk commodities, including machine parts, and to develop gap-closure  plans, according to these contractor representatives. As a result of these  plans, contractor representatives certified two new suppliers and entered  into agreements with several other suppliers to provide reserve capacity.  In addition, NNSA\u2019s Enterprise Modeling and Analysis Consortium  conducted alternate analysis on the Kansas City site\u2019s workload capacity  that corroborated the Kansas City site\u2019s conclusion that mitigation steps  being taken at the Kansas City site, including ensuring adequate external  supplier capacity, should address increased workload concerns.", "To help mitigate risks regarding suppliers\u2019 skills in working with the  Kansas City site, site contractor representatives also said that the site has  taken steps to help train new suppliers. For example, site contractor  representatives perform multiple on-site training exercises within the first  6 months of new supplier relationships. These exercises educate the  suppliers on purchase order requirements, terms, drawing definitions, and  quality expectations using a documented, comprehensive, nine-step  process, according to site contractor representatives.", "To help mitigate risks regarding suppliers\u2019 willingness to establish long- term partnerships with the Kansas City site, site contractor  representatives told us that they have begun taking steps to encourage  and foster long-term partnerships with suppliers. According to these  representatives and a study NNSA conducted of lessons learned from an  essentially complete warhead life extension program, facilitating  effective supply chains for the nuclear enterprise requires enduring  business relationships with suppliers of commercial off-the-shelf  components. Because specifications for weapons components and  materials are exacting and quantities required are frequently low, many  potential suppliers are reluctant to expose themselves to the risk of  production for a niche market, according to Kansas City site officials and  contractor representatives. To mitigate reluctance to partner with the  Kansas City site, contractor representatives stated that the site has  developed points of contact with each supplier. These points of contact  work toward establishing and maintaining a collaborative partnership in  which production forecasts are routinely shared and performance metrics  are discussed to foster continuous improvement when needed.", "In addition, Kansas City site contractor representatives stated that the site  is taking steps to develop relationships with other sites to address site- wide challenges regarding supplier evaluations, which can contribute to  risks such as lower efficiency and effectiveness and higher costs. The site  is taking this action in response to a July 2018 DOE Office of Inspector  General (OIG) report that identified the potential duplication of supplier  evaluations among NNSA sites, including the Kansas City site, resulting  in lower efficiency and effectiveness, and higher costs. The OIG report  noted that the need to minimize duplication of efforts will become even  more important when considering the additional demands on production  related to upcoming weapon refurbishment efforts, which are expected to  increase the number of supplier quality auditors needed by the Kansas  City site. The OIG recommended that to maximize efficiencies and  effectiveness, NNSA should work with contractors, including the Kansas  City site, to assess ways to improve the efficiency of supply chain  management activities, among other things.", "Steps the Kansas City site has taken in response to this OIG report  include establishing a point of contact with Sandia National Laboratories,  which is leading an overarching effort across the nuclear security  enterprise to address duplication concerns, according to site contractor  representatives. In addition, a December 2018 report to the President by  DOD, in consultation with other agencies, identified supply chain risks in  the government\u2019s manufacturing and defense industrial base, including at  DOE and NNSA sites, and recommended that DOE establish an  Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment program to address risks within  the energy and nuclear sectors. According to NNSA officials at the  Kansas City site, they are still determining how it will respond to this  recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weapons Design Changes", "paragraphs": ["With increasing concurrency of production forecasted, Kansas City  contractor representatives have identified challenges regarding their need  to minimize weapons design changes during production, which in the past  contributed to cost increases and schedule delays for the W76-1 life  extension. According to Kansas City contractor representatives and  NNSA officials, at least two general weapons design issues can  contribute to overall schedule pressure at the Kansas City site. For  example, delays due to design changes intended to make parts easier to  produce can exacerbate schedule delays by compressing the overall  weapons refurbishment schedule. In addition, design changes are  undertaken for other reasons, such as in response to weapons testing  results.", "First, according to NNSA\u2019s B61-12 program manager, even though both  design laboratories and production site team members advocate for the  design changes that make parts easier to produce, the enterprise-wide  impact of these changes late in the design process may, as site  contractor representatives noted, impact the LEP\u2019s schedule and may  require more resources and plant/vendor capacity to meet the schedule.  According to this official, given the resource demands of simultaneously  occurring major weapons refurbishments, such as the B61-12 and W88  Alt 370, schedule impacts can be magnified and have caused justifiable  concern with leadership at NNSA, the design laboratories, and the  Kansas City site.", "Second, Kansas City site officials expressed concern that some  component design requirements continue to change late in the production  development phase, sometimes because of test results, which creates  tension between improving the design and stabilizing production  requirements and processes in preparation for full-scale production.  Kansas City site officials stated that such design changes pose an  ongoing management challenge. Specifically, time lost because of design  delays in the earlier stages of weapons\u2019 design and development often  needs to be recovered later, during time allotted for production, to meet  established delivery schedules, according to Kansas City site officials.  Such delays have triggered the need for schedule recovery plans at the  Kansas City site in the past.", "In response to the concerns, NNSA has led several mitigation steps to  address schedule risk as both the B61-12 and W88 Alt 370 enter the final  stages before full production begins, according to NNSA\u2019s B61-12  program manager. For example, NNSA revised its baseline change  process for the B61-12 and W88 Alt 370 to require all changes, including  production-related changes, to be reviewed, according to NNSA\u2019s B61-12  program manager. Specifically, NNSA implemented a change  management board with several tiers for review and approval of proposed  design changes based on the type of change, and potential impact to  program milestones, cost, and risk. Varying levels of required review and  approval, depending on the change, can include NNSA production and  design agency officials, senior site managers, B61-12 or W88 Alt 370  project officers, or other senior managers at DOD and NNSA. The intent,  according to this official, is to screen all the changes and determine if they  are really needed and when, and if site-wide resources and schedules  can support the changes.", "In addition, Kansas City site contractor representatives said that they  have developed management strategies to help mitigate production- related impacts of design changes, such as adding work shifts to increase  production output. For example, an August 2017 analysis by Kansas City  site contractor representatives shows the use of three shifts\u2014both partial  and full shifts\u2014to meet workload demand in multiple functional areas,  including production of cables, high voltage assembly, encapsulation and  welding, arming and firing mechanisms, machining, and environmental  and pressure laboratories. Using additional shifts can help the Kansas  City site recover from schedule delays that might result from late design  changes, according to site contractor representatives. Moreover, lessons  learned from the W76-1 LEP\u2014which will complete production in 2019\u2014 are helping to improve coordination between production sites and design  agencies, specifically through increased coordination earlier in the  weapon development process, according to Kansas City site contractor  representatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Further Changes to Stockpile Requirements Are Anticipated, Which May Affect Existing Workload Plans at the Kansas City Site", "paragraphs": ["While current efforts to mitigate the challenges Kansas City site  contractor representatives have identified are expected to help address  the site\u2019s anticipated future workload, as discussed previously, this  workload could further increase if certain 2018 Nuclear Posture Review  policy statements, based on nuclear weapons stockpile studies now  underway in response to the review, result in changes to production  requirements. For example, the Nuclear Posture Review called for  modifying existing sea-launched ballistic missile warheads to provide a  low-yield option; advancing a program to replace the W78 Intercontinental  Ballistic Missile warhead by 1 year; the study of a sea-launched,  nuclear-armed cruise missile; and sustaining the B83 strategic nuclear  bomb past its currently planned retirement date. NNSA and DOD are  developing studies and implementation plans for the 2018 Nuclear  Posture Review, but it is too soon to know to what extent these studies  and plans may affect the Kansas City site. One early indication of how  implementing the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review may affect the Kansas  City site is that, according to the Fiscal Year 2019 Stockpile Stewardship  and Management Plan, concurrent production of the W80-4 LEP and  the W78 replacement LEP is now expected to extend into the 2030s. In  addition, the 2019 plan anticipates that alts may be needed to sustain the  B83, if the weapon system remains in the stockpile for long enough.", "We concluded in an April 2017 report that the new Nuclear Posture  Review comes during a particularly challenging decade for NNSA\u2019s  nuclear modernization efforts, as the agency plans to simultaneously  execute at least four nuclear LEPs along with major construction projects,  such as efforts to modernize NNSA\u2019s uranium and plutonium  capabilities. We further concluded that NNSA\u2019s modernization budget  estimates for fiscal years 2022 through 2026, which reflected past  program plans, may exceed the funding levels programmed for  modernization in future budgets, raising affordability concerns. Moreover,  we concluded that NNSA had not addressed a projected \u201cbow wave\u201d of  future funding needs\u2014that is, an impending and significant increase in  requirements for additional funds\u2014or the mismatch between potential  funding needs and potential funding available even before the Nuclear  Posture Review was completed. We recommended that NNSA include an  assessment of affordability of NNSA\u2019s portfolio of modernization  programs in future versions of the Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan\u2014for example, by presenting options NNSA could  consider to bring its estimates of modernization funding needs into  alignment with potential future budgets. NNSA did not explicitly agree or disagree with our recommendation, but we will continue to monitor any  action NNSA takes in response to the recommendation.", "In addition to addressing affordability concerns, NNSA has been advised  to stabilize long-term workload at operating sites. A congressional  advisory panel examining the governance of the nuclear security  enterprise issued a report in November 2014 recommending, among  other things, actions intended to stabilize long-term workload at operating  sites. In particular, it recommended that NNSA, working with DOD,  create a long-term operating plan to support the nation\u2019s warhead  modernization strategy; it further specified that this plan should be  designed to create a relatively stable, long-term workload. The panel\u2019s  report stated that a stable baseline of design, engineering, and production  is needed to make effective use of the available capabilities in the  weapons complex, provide the basis for sizing and modernization of the  weapons complex, and identify potentially conflicting demands on  available capabilities. While NNSA has taken some actions in response to  this recommendation, an expert panel concluded in March 2018 that  NNSA\u2019s overall response had been inadequate and called for NNSA to  develop, among other things, an integrated strategic plan for the entire  nuclear security enterprise. The panel concluded that, given NNSA\u2019s  expected increase in workload across the nuclear weapons complex, and  the new 2018 Nuclear Posture Review uncertainties, NNSA\u2019s ongoing  implementation of this and other recommendations made by the Panel  over the next several years will take on additional importance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NNSA for its review and comment.

In particular, we obtained  information on the Kansas City site forecasted workload based on fiscal  years 2012 and 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plans  (SSMP), comparing full production schedules, including upcoming B61-12  Life Extension Program (LEP) and W88 Alteration (Alt) 370 work.  Because the design and capacity of the modern production facility,  completed in 2012, was based largely on the 2012 SSMP and previous  plans, we used this as the baseline plan. We then compared nuclear  weapons systems LEP and Alt schedules in the 2012 SSMP with the  2018 SSMP because Kansas City contractor representatives told us that  plans and associated workload had changed significantly by 2018. In  addition, we reviewed Kansas City contractor information provided by the  \u201cwhat-if\u201d capacity analyses tool, including graphs and charts depicting  workload for each weapons system undergoing LEPs or Alts.

Specifically, we reviewed  NNSA\u2019s 2017 Master Asset Plan, which provided additional information  and alternate analyses concerning the age of the Kansas City site\u2019s  production equipment. Regarding the third management challenge\u2014 ensuring a sufficient, capable, and security-cleared workforce\u2014we  reviewed both site-level information and information from other sources,  including from NNSA and the Department of Energy (DOE). For example,  we reviewed NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan, which also includes workforce information and  analyses. In addition, we asked the Kansas City site contractor  representatives and NNSA officials for additional clarification and detail  concerning the management challenges and mitigation actions, as well as  specific examples to support their statements. For issues related to the  clearance process, we contacted DOE officials to obtain information on  DOE supplemental guidance for interim clearance mitigation steps. To  confirm the accuracy of staffing-related information provided by Kansas  City site contractor representatives, we obtained information from these  representatives on how the site performed certain calculations, such as  determining the change in number of Kansas City site staff; number of  Kansas City site staff, by years of service; and distribution of Kansas City  staff, by age. We reviewed the various formulas Kansas City contractor  representatives used in preparing its analyses in order to understand the  logic used in making these determinations.
