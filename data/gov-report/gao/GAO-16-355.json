GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, NLS documents, and administrative data; interviewed NLS officials, librarians from 8 of the 101 network libraries selected for geographic diversity and a range in the number of users, and officials from research and advocacy groups and assistive technology companies; and reviewed literature on NLS-eligible populations and trends in assistive technologies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) is primarily used by older adults with visual disabilities, and NLS has taken some steps to ensure eligible users' access to and awareness of available services. In fiscal year 2014, about 70 percent of the program's 430,000 users were age 60 and older and almost 85 percent had visual disabilities, according to the most recent NLS data available at the time of GAO's review. Federal regulations establish eligibility for NLS services for people with a range of disabilities. However, medical doctors must certify eligibility for people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia, which is not required for those with visual or physical disabilities. According to officials from network libraries and other stakeholder groups, the requirement for a doctor's certification is an obstacle to accessing services because of additional steps and costs to the individual. These officials and stakeholders said other professionals, such as special education teachers, are also positioned to certify eligibility for applicants with reading disabilities. GAO has previously noted the importance of disability programs keeping pace with scientific and medical advances. However, the certification requirement has remained largely unchanged for more than 40 years. NLS has taken steps to inform eligible groups about its services, such as partnering with other organizations that serve these groups, developing a new website, and distributing an outreach toolkit to network libraries. However, NLS has no plans to evaluate which outreach efforts have resulted in new users in order to ensure resources are used effectively\u2014a key practice identified previously by GAO.", "NLS offers materials to its users in a range of formats, but its efforts to adopt new, potentially cost-saving technologies are hampered by limitations in both its statutory authority and its analyses of alternatives. Users may choose to receive, through the mail, audio materials on digital cartridges or hard copy braille documents. Users may also choose to download audio and braille files from an NLS-supported website. During fiscal year 2014, 86 percent of users chose to receive audio materials on digital cartridges, according to NLS data. NLS officials said they would like to provide users with devices for reading electronic braille files, a faster and less bulky approach than braille documents, and per the agency's July 2015 analysis, could become more cost effective with technological advances. However, federal statute does not authorize NLS to use program funds to acquire and provide braille devices as it does for audio devices, which prevents the agency from taking advantage of technology that has the potential to reduce costs. NLS is also examining new technologies for audio materials but has not fully assessed available alternatives. For example, NLS is considering supplementing its collection of human-narrated audio materials with text-to-speech (i.e., synthetic speech) materials, which some evidence suggests could be produced more quickly and at a lower cost. However, NLS has not comprehensively compared the text-to-speech option to its current approach in order to make a decision on whether to move forward, as called for by GAO best practices for alternatives analysis. Without this analysis, NLS may miss an opportunity to meet its users' needs more efficiently and cost effectively."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider authorizing NLS to provide its users devices for reading electronic braille files.

Others may have trouble holding or handling a book due to  conditions such as quadriplegia or paper allergies. The inability to read  can have a significant impact on an individual\u2019s education, work capacity,  and full integration in society. The program was authorized in 1931, and  it received about $50 million in federal funding in fiscal year 2016. U.S.  citizens and residents with sufficiently severe visual or physical disabilities  or reading disabilities resulting from organic dysfunction such as dyslexia  and other learning disabilities are eligible for the NLS program.  Headquartered in Washington, D.C., NLS operates in conjunction with a  national network of state and local libraries that conduct outreach,  determine eligibility, and distribute reading materials.

We assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing cognizant NLS  officials and reviewing related documentation, and found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for our reporting objectives. Additionally, we  interviewed officials from NLS, LOC, and USPS. We also interviewed staff  at 8 of NLS\u2019s 101 network libraries about topics including user  demographics and NLS technologies. We interviewed librarians in the  District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois (two libraries), Massachusetts (two  libraries), Oklahoma, and Washington state. We selected these libraries  to achieve diversity in geographic location, number of users, and outreach  practices. For example, we included some libraries that had piloted new  outreach materials from NLS or changed their organizational structure in  recent years. We also interviewed officials from a number of external  stakeholder groups, including research and advocacy organizations for  relevant disabled populations; other organizations that provide accessible  reading materials; private companies that produce assistive technology  for those with visual disabilities; and the CNIB Library, a private non-profit  library in Canada for those with visual and other disabilities. Finally, we  reviewed select articles and reports on the demographics of NLS-eligible  populations and trends in assistive technologies for these populations.

In addition, NLS relies on a network of  101 regional and sub-regional libraries and outreach centers to implement  the program. Most states have one regional library participating in the  network that is operated by the state or other entity. Some states also  have sub-regional libraries that coordinate with the regional libraries to  serve a specific geographical area, and are generally operated by public  libraries.

With regard to reading disabilities, a National Center for Learning  Disabilities (NCLD) report estimated that in 2012 there were  approximately 2.4 million public school students who qualified for special  education programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA) based on learning disabilities, and many of these students had  reading disabilities specifically. In addition, according to the Survey of  Income and Program Participation in 2010, there were at least 3.5 million  adults ages 18 and older with learning disabilities, including reading  disabilities such as dyslexia. Regarding physical disabilities, NLS  officials said that the wide range in the types and severity of potentially  qualifying conditions and the lack of centralized data make it difficult to  estimate the population of potentially eligible users of the NLS program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NLS Users Are Primarily Older Adults with Visual Disabilities, but NLS Efforts Are Not Ensuring Full Access and Awareness", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Older Adults with Visual Disabilities Make Up the Majority of Users, though an Eligibility Requirement May Limit Access of Potential Users with Reading Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2014, about 430,000 individuals used the NLS program, with  the majority being older individuals who were blind or had other visual  disabilities. The majority of NLS users were aged 60 and over (about 70  percent), with almost 20 percent at least 90 years of age (see fig. 2). In  addition, almost 85 percent of NLS users were either blind or had other  visual disabilities resulting in their inability to read standard print (see fig.  3). NLS officials told us that the majority of users have age-related  vision loss and therefore did not qualify for services until later in life.  About 6 percent of NLS users had physical disabilities, which include  multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to officials we  spoke with from network libraries. Another nearly 6 percent of users had  reading disabilities. NLS guidance explains, and network library officials  corroborated, that users\u2019 reading disabilities generally include dyslexia,  autism, and traumatic brain injuries. In part because of their older age,  many users have physical dexterity issues which compound their other  disabilities, according to NLS officials. Although NLS does not track users\u2019  mobility or dexterity limitations as part of its annual data collection efforts,  a survey of users and non-users NLS contracted for in 2013 indicated that  almost half of users had limited mobility, and about a third had problems  with manual dexterity.", "NLS\u2019s 2013 survey of users and non-users indicated that NLS users  generally have retired from employment or are unemployed, have low or  fixed incomes, and are more likely to live alone than non-users. In  addition, 13 percent of the user respondents reported having served in  the military.", "The number of NLS users remained stable from fiscal year 2010 through  fiscal year 2014, according to NLS data. NLS officials said they estimated  about 10 percent turnover in their users each year. While they recruit new  users, they said the number of older users who die each year generally  results in the number of users staying about the same. Although NLS  does not project user estimates for future years, the proportion of the U.S.  population age 65 and older is expected to increase from 13 percent in  2010 to more than 20 percent in 2050, which may increase the number of  NLS\u2019s older users.", "While NLS serves individuals with a range of disabilities, an eligibility  requirement specific to individuals with reading disabilities may hinder this  group of potentially eligible users from accessing services. Specifically,  the regulatory requirement that only doctors of medicine may certify a  reading disability was cited as a barrier to services by staff with whom we  spoke at 5 of the 8 network libraries, 2 organizations that provide similar  services to NLS, and 2 organizations specializing in learning disabilities.  This eligibility requirement, which originated in 1974 and has remained  largely unchanged since, creates additional steps and costs for applicants  with reading disabilities in comparison to other groups, and may hinder  some individuals\u2019 access to services. For example, officials we spoke with  from a network library said that many of their potential users have little  money and live in rural areas that are far from doctors, which limits their  ability to get the necessary certification.", "Furthermore, a medical diagnosis is not necessary to determine if an  individual has a reading disability, according to a number of groups we  interviewed and the policies of other organizations that support people  with these disabilities. According to staff we spoke with at two  organizations specializing in learning disabilities, and 6 of the 8 network  libraries, special education teachers and school staff are typically also  knowledgeable about reading disabilities. Recognizing this, certification of  reading disabilities is conducted by non-medical personnel for other  disability services. For example, under IDEA educational services are  provided to eligible children with disabilities, including learning disabilities,  which may affect reading. However, IDEA does not require a doctor\u2019s  certification of eligibility; this determination is instead made by the child\u2019s  parents and a special education team generally comprised of the child\u2019s  teacher and at least one other person qualified to conduct diagnostic  examinations of children, such as a school psychologist or remedial  reading teacher. In addition, two private organizations that, similar to  NLS, provide individuals with alternatives to standard print materials, use  LOC regulations as guidance to determine the eligibility of individuals with  disabilities except for reading disabilities. These organizations instead  allow individuals who are deemed competent authorities for the other  LOC eligibility categories by the organizations to certify for reading  disabilities.", "Although the eligibility requirement for those with reading disabilities may  be inconsistent with other federal policies and with some entities\u2019 current  practices, and potentially hinder access to services, NLS does not plan  any modifications. Network libraries have formally recommended to NLS  that it re-visit the requirement that a doctor certify the eligibility of those  with reading disabilities. This is also consistent with our previous  recommendations that agencies providing disability benefits and services  should ensure they use up-to-date medical criteria, which reflect  advances in medicine and technology and include consideration of non- medical evidence. NLS officials said that changing the eligibility  requirement for reading disabilities may lead to more users and increased  costs. Two other organizations that provide similar services saw an  increase in the number of users after they changed their certification  requirements so non-medical personnel could certify eligibility. NLS has  not estimated the potential demand for its services by those with reading  disabilities, and so the actual effect on NLS services from revising the  eligibility requirement is unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NLS Is Initiating New Outreach Efforts, but Does Not Collect Information Needed to Evaluate Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["NLS\u2019s current users likely represent a small percentage of those eligible,  but NLS has initiated new efforts to increase awareness and usage of its  services.

The efforts may help address outreach challenges reported to us by staff  at the eight network libraries, including limited nationwide awareness, a  lack of information in accessible formats, difficulty reaching the wide  variety of potentially eligible populations, and a lack of guidance provided  network libraries. NLS\u2019s efforts to improve outreach include:  Increasing electronic recruitment methods: NLS has established  additional electronic resources, including website announcements and  advertisements through social media. For example, NLS developed a  Facebook page and is developing a new website. These changes  may increase nationwide awareness of services, which staff at 5 of  the 8 libraries told us was needed.", "Producing more information in accessible formats: NLS is developing  videos for its website as well as talking guides on how to use its  services.

(See fig. 4.) About a third of NLS users continued to  receive cassettes through the mail, although this format is being phased  out. Downloading from the Internet was less popular than receiving  materials through the mail, with only about 10 percent of NLS users  downloading audio materials through NLS\u2019s online Braille and Audio  Reading Download (BARD) system. BARD enables eligible users to  search for and select audio files for immediate download rather than wait  to receive materials through the mail.

At the  same time, younger NLS users\u2014a minority of the customer base\u2014may  prefer to use other devices, such as smartphones, to access NLS audio  materials, according to staff we spoke with at 6 of the 8 network libraries.  Staff in one library said younger users tend to be more sophisticated in  their use of technology, and prefer to use smaller, mainstream devices  rather than the NLS player.

According to NLS\u2019s 2013 user survey,  about 40 percent of those not using BARD cited lack of Internet access as  a reason. Staff at all 8 network libraries told us that many of their NLS  users lack access either to the Internet or a computer. For example, staff  in one library told us many of their NLS users have low incomes, or are  older with fixed incomes, and many, especially in more rural areas, lack  the high-speed Internet connection needed for BARD. According to NLS\u2019s  2013 user survey, about 50 percent of sampled users who do not use  BARD said they lacked the computer skills to do so. Similarly, staff in all 8  network libraries we contacted said the process of downloading files from  BARD onto a computer, and then transferring them to a cartridge that can  be played on an audio device, is challenging for some users. For  example, staff in one library said users have difficulty figuring out which  folder to save downloaded files into on their computers. Recognizing this,  NLS officials told us they expect in summer 2016 to introduce a new  software application known as Media Manager intended to simplify the  process of downloading from BARD onto a computer by handling a  number of the steps automatically.", "Meanwhile, the much lower use of braille compared to audio among  NLS\u2019s customer base may, in part, reflect the rate of braille use among  blind people in the United States overall as well as characteristics of NLS  users. The precise number of blind and visually impaired people who use  braille in the United States is not known, according to a study on braille by  LOC\u2019s Federal Research Division, as well as officials from two national  organizations that produce braille materials and an assistive technology  company we contacted. However, according to the LOC study, several  estimates suggest that the proportion of blind and visually impaired  Americans who use braille may be about 10 percent. According to a  research and advocacy group for the blind and an organization that  produces braille materials, braille use declined after many blind students  were moved from specialized schools for the blind, which are more likely  to teach braille, into public schools. Another factor that has impeded the  wider use of braille, according to an organization that provides braille  materials and an assistive technology company we contacted, has been  the high cost of refreshable braille devices, which sell for $1,000 to  $2,000 at a minimum. Beyond reflecting braille use in the wider  population, NLS users\u2019 low use of braille may also reflect the specific  demographics of the NLS population.

This view is  consistent with those of several other organizations we contacted,  including a research and advocacy organization serving people who are  blind. There is also some evidence suggesting that blind people have  better employment outcomes if they use braille. NLS officials told us  they believe that the ability to loan refreshable braille devices could attract  more users to NLS. The agency has cited several advantages of this  technology compared to hard copy braille, including that it is less bulky to  store and transport and can be delivered more quickly to users. (See  fig.7 for images of a 13-volume hard copy braille book in NLS\u2019s collection  and an example of a refreshable braille device.)", "However, NLS is currently unable to provide refreshable braille devices to  its users due to statutory language that limits its use of appropriated  funds. Since the 1930s, the statute has authorized NLS to use  appropriated funds to provide braille materials to its users. However, the  statute does not allow NLS to use such funds to provide users with  devices for reading electronic braille files. Although the statute did not  originally allow NLS to provide users with any playback equipment, in the  1940s it was amended to allow NLS to provide devices for playing audio  materials. In 2015, the LOC submitted a request to the Committee on  House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and  Administration to amend the law to allow it to use appropriated funds to  provide playback equipment for formats in addition to audio recordings,  including refreshable braille devices. In November 2015, legislation was  introduced in the House of Representatives that would amend the law to  allow NLS to use appropriated funds to purchase and provide to its users  playback equipment for braille materials, among other things.", "The current cost of refreshable braille devices makes them cost- prohibitive for NLS; however, emerging technology may soon change  that. As previously noted, several sources indicate that the current cost  for these devices is about $1,000 to $2,000 at a minimum. According to  one study we reviewed, the current technology used in these devices is  effective, but it is also expensive to produce, in part because it relies  heavily on manual assembly. However, efforts are underway to develop  new refreshable braille technology that could significantly reduce the cost  of these devices. For example, a consortium of organizations has  supported research on refreshable braille technology and, according to  one organization that has been involved in the effort, plans to unveil a  prototype device in 2016 that could cost as little as $300. NLS hired a  consultant to examine the potential costs and benefits associated with  providing braille through lower-cost refreshable braille devices rather than  hard copy. The resulting report, delivered in July 2015, found that the total  annual cost of NLS\u2019s current approach\u2014including the costs for NLS to  produce hard copy braille documents, for network libraries to store them,  and for USPS to deliver them\u2014is about $17 million. It found that if the  cost of refreshable braille devices were to come down to about $400, then  the total annual cost of an alternate approach in which NLS loans these  devices to its users, and hard copy braille is largely replaced by electronic  braille, could be about $7 million\u2014a savings of almost $10 million per  year compared to the current approach. According to standards for  internal control in the federal government, agencies should identify,  analyze, and respond to changes that may create the risk of not  successfully fulfilling their missions, including changes in the  technological environment. As long as its statute does not allow NLS to  use appropriated funds to provide refreshable braille devices, NLS will not  be able to take advantage of technological advances that could potentially  help it fulfill its mission more cost efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Audio Player with Wireless Connectivity", "paragraphs": ["NLS is in the preliminary stages of developing an audio player with  wireless connectivity that could download audio directly from BARD, an  approach that it believes would improve services for users and potentially  reduce overall costs to the federal government. NLS officials said users  would benefit from a device capable of downloading audio materials  directly from the Internet because they would receive content faster than  receiving digital cartridges through the mail. As noted above, there are  obstacles to the wider use of BARD among NLS\u2019s customer base, but an  NLS-provided audio player with wireless connectivity could mitigate some  of these issues. Specifically, such a device would eliminate the multi-step  process now required to download BARD files to a computer and then  transfer them onto NLS\u2019s audio player. Staff we spoke with in 5 of the 8  network libraries commented that downloading audio files directly to an  NLS player would be simpler than the current process. In addition, NLS is  considering how it might address another obstacle\u2014lack of Internet  access\u2014by providing not just the audio player but also the required  Internet connectivity. At the time of our review, the goal of providing  users with a device capable of connecting directly to the Internet was  included in NLS\u2019s draft strategic plan, and NLS officials said they were in  the process of hiring a business analyst and project manager to more fully  assess the business case for moving forward with this effort. LOC officials  told us they expect NLS to submit a proposal for this initiative to LOC\u2019s  Information Technology Steering Committee during fiscal year 2016.", "As it considers moving forward with this effort, NLS is leaning toward  designing its own next generation, specialized player, but it has not fully  assessed the costs and benefits of designing its own player versus using  a commercially available player. NLS officials said that, in their  experience, the existing commercially-available players lack the durability  needed for NLS\u2019s purposes, may not be suitable for users with physical  disabilities, and are expensive. Libraries for those with visual impairments  in some other countries, meanwhile, have found that commercially  available audio players can meet their users\u2019 needs. For example, the  CNIB Library, which provides free reading materials to those with visual  and other disabilities in Canada, does not provide its own specialized  device to users but instead helps them acquire commercially-available  devices when they cannot afford to do so. CNIB officials said they chose  this approach because it was less expensive than developing their own  player, and also commented that it offers users a range of choices to  meet their needs. Some libraries for the blind in Europe and Asia also  purchase commercially-available audio players for library users,  according to two assistive technology companies we contacted. NLS  officials told us they have not ruled out using a commercially-available  device as their next generation player, and while they have not yet  analyzed this option, they plan to explore it further through requests for  information and market research. We have previously found it is important  for agencies to thoroughly analyze alternatives, including their relative  costs and benefits, so they consistently and reliably select the project  alternatives that best meet mission needs. In a 2007 report, we found  that when NLS developed its current digital audio player, it did not  sufficiently consider the option of acquiring a commercially-available  device designed specifically for those who are blind or have physical  disabilities, and we recommended that NLS develop and document  analyses of alternatives including commercial products. At that time,  NLS did not act on our recommendation and take steps to consider  commercial products. We continue to believe that without such an  assessment, NLS runs the risk of not choosing the most cost-effective  approach for providing its next generation of audio players.", "Although NLS has relied exclusively on human narration to provide audio  materials, text-to-speech\u2014i.e., synthetic, computer-generated speech\u2014 may be acceptable to many NLS users, according to interviews and  survey data. According to several organizations we contacted that serve  those with visual impairments and two studies we reviewed, the sound  quality of text-to-speech has improved over time. For example, one study  found that while not quite equivalent to natural human speech, state-of- the-art text-to-speech is becoming more natural-sounding, with  appropriate phrasing and pacing. In addition, evidence suggests that  many NLS users may be willing to listen to text-to-speech materials.  According to NLS\u2019s 2013 user survey, almost 80 percent of sampled NLS  users were willing to listen to text-to-speech audio materials. While staff  at 4 of 8 network libraries we contacted said NLS users prefer human  narration, staff in all 8 libraries said using text-to-speech is a viable option  for certain types of NLS reading materials. In Canada, the CNIB uses  text-to-speech for the front and back matter of the books it produces, and  expects to incorporate more text-to-speech into its collection in the future.  The CNIB website also has a link to a nonprofit organization that provides  audio books primarily in text-to-speech format to those with visual and  other disabilities, helping its users gain access to a collection of over  250,000 audio books. In addition, one assistive technology company told  us that libraries for the blind in Europe regularly use text-to-speech for  newspapers and magazines, and they often use it initially for best-selling  novels so they can provide these quickly to their users.", "NLS officials are considering whether to supplement NLS\u2019s audio  collection with text-to-speech materials, but they have not assessed the  costs and benefits of doing so, nor have they included moving forward  with text-to-speech content as an objective in the agency\u2019s draft strategic  plan. NLS officials told us they might in the future use text-to-speech for  certain types of reading materials for which human narration is less  critical, such as reference materials, cookbooks, bibliographies, and  endnotes. They said an advantage of text-to-speech materials is that they  can be produced more quickly than human-narrated materials: Officials  said it takes 3 to 4 months to record a book with human narration. Also, it  may be less expensive to produce text-to-speech materials. Officials said  it costs, on average, about $3,600 to record a book with a human  narrator, and in fiscal year 2014 the agency spent $10.5 million on such  recording. In contrast, they said it costs $75 to convert an audio book  provided by a commercial publisher to NLS\u2019s format, and they estimated  that producing text-to-speech books might cost about the same. However,  although NLS officials said they have done some preliminary  experimentation to understand the high-level challenges of producing  text-to-speech materials, and have hired a contractor to develop software  for converting digital text files to text-to-speech files that meet NLS\u2019s  specifications, they have not made a decision about whether to move  forward with text-to-speech. Furthermore, they have not yet  comprehensively assessed the option of incorporating text-to-speech  compared to relying solely on human narration, an assessment called for  by best practices we previously identified for alternatives analysis. Thus,  NLS lacks information about an initiative that has the potential to deliver  content more quickly and cost effectively."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The NLS program provides accessible reading materials to those who  cannot read standard print due to visual, physical, and other disabilities.  Eighty-five years after the program was established, NLS is providing an  important service to many older and visually-disabled adults, but it is also  missing opportunities to meet the needs of all groups eligible for services.  For example, the regulatory requirement that a medical doctor must  certify eligibility for individuals with reading disabilities treats this group  differently than other populations and creates an obstacle to receiving  services. Likely because this requirement has remained largely  unchanged for the past 40 years, it is inconsistent with currently accepted  practices. Additionally, while NLS\u2019s new outreach efforts have the  potential to enhance awareness of its services among some eligible  groups, NLS\u2019s failure to evaluate these efforts means officials are unable  to target funds to those efforts determined to be the most cost-effective,  or make adjustments to those that are less effective.", "Looking ahead, NLS is considering emerging technologies to meet user  needs. Yet there are factors both beyond and within NLS\u2019s control that  may prevent the adoption of potentially cost-saving alternatives. For  example, without a change in federal law, NLS will have to forego the  opportunity to provide braille in a more modern and potentially cost- effective manner by distributing refreshable braille devices to its users.  Further, in the area of audio materials, NLS lacks the information it needs  to make informed choices about whether and how to proceed with  adopting certain new technologies. For example, if NLS continues its plan  to design a specialized audio player that connects to the Internet, without  assessing the alternative of instead providing commercially available  devices to its users, the agency may potentially invest in a less cost- effective option. Similarly, absent a comprehensive comparison of adding  text-to-speech materials to its audio collection versus continuing to rely  only on human narration, NLS may not make an informed decision about  whether to move forward with a technology that has the potential to  decrease the time and costs of providing new materials to users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To give NLS the opportunity to provide braille in a modernized format and  potentially achieve cost savings, Congress should consider amending the  law to allow the agency to use federal funds to provide its users playback  equipment for electronic braille files (i.e., refreshable braille devices)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["1.
