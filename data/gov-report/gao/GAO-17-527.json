This is because DOD does not have a clearly defined process for the military services to provide USMEPCOM with all relevant medical records. Further, the database that USMEPCOM relies on to analyze these records is inoperable and no schedule has been developed to repair it. As a result, USMEPCOM has provided limited feedback to chief medical officers\u2014responsible for the medical qualification decisions\u2014that they could use to improve screening outcomes. Without addressing these issues, DOD has limited assurance that medically disqualifying conditions among new enlistees will be identified before the services invest substantial resources in their initial training.", "DOD has not implemented its new electronic health record system at the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) and its schedule to do so is uncertain. Known as MHS GENESIS, this new system is intended to give DOD the capability to electronically share more complete medical data with and between both federal and private sector medical facilities that are similarly equipped.

However, incomplete medical information or inadequate  medical screening of these enlistees may result in them not fulfilling their  initial terms of commitment, which often ranges from 4 and 6 years of  active duty. When early separation occurs, the military services lose their  investment in the enlistees and must recruit additional applicants to  replace them.", "In January 1997, we reported that DOD could save millions of dollars by  employing better screening procedures of enlistees. Specifically, we  reported that DOD did not have consistent and complete data to allow it  to assess attrition trends and the factors behind changes in the trends.  Additionally, we reported that applicants often conceal their medical histories and that the military services were waiving medical conditions  that, according to DOD directives, were disqualifying. In the1997 report,  we made seven recommendations to DOD to help reduce the attrition of  enlistees during the first 180 days of their initial terms of commitment. Of  these seven recommendations, DOD concurred with and implemented  changes that addressed all but one\u2014moving the review of the medical  early separation records away from the U.S. Military Entrance Processing  Command (USMEPCOM), which still requests and analyzes those  records. USMEPCOM operates under the direction of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy-Accession  Policy within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness. Its mission is to evaluate applicants by applying  established DOD standards during applicant processing for the military  service at 65 Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) locations  across the United States. To further address several of the  recommendations we made in our 1997 report, Congress enacted  changes in November 1997 to Title 10, the law governing the armed  forces, aimed at improving recruit quality and reducing recruit attrition.", "House Report 114-537, which accompanied a proposed bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, included a  provision for us to conduct a review of applicant medical screening issues  at the MEPS.

Fiscal year 2015 is the most recent year  for which an entire year\u2019s worth of attrition data are available and, for  relevancy purposes, we obtained data not more than 10 years old,  beginning in fiscal year 2005. We analyzed these data to show early  attrition due to medical reasons and overall early attrition over selected  intervals by military service for each fiscal year as well as for the leading  causes of early attrition. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing the data files and relevant data documentation and interviewing  knowledgeable officials, and found that the data were sufficiently reliable  for reporting the estimated number of accessions and attritions by military  service and time periods. We also interviewed DOD, USMEPCOM, and  military service officials to obtain their perspectives on early attrition rates.", "For the second objective, we reviewed DOD memorandums and  USMEPCOM regulations related to obtaining, analyzing, and using  information about enlistee early attrition due to medical reasons.

This included the importance of designing control activities  to achieve objectives and respond to risks and using quality information  by identifying information requirements, obtaining relevant data from  reliable internal and external sources in a timely manner, and processing  the obtained data into quality information. Additionally, we interviewed  officials at USMEPCOM and officials from basic training bases to further  understand the collection and reporting of early medical attrition  information. These bases were selected on the basis of geographical  dispersion and included one from each of the military services.", "For the third objective, we reviewed selected DOD, USMEPCOM, and  military instructions and regulations related applicant medical screening  processes. Additionally, we selected a convenience sample of four MEPS  that were located in large geographically dispersed U.S. cities that were  also near a military service recruiting office and a basic training base to  observe medical-related MEPS operations and to interview officials.  During our visits to the selected MEPS locations, we interviewed officials  from nearby military service recruiting organizations to discuss their  perspectives on challenges with medically screening applicants. We  supplemented our visits to the large MEPS locations with questionnaires  sent to MEPS command officials, chief medical officers, and military  service recruiting liaisons of a nongeneralizable sample of eight small or  medium-sized MEPS as determined first by workload level, then sorted  randomly, and then chosen to ensure distribution across all MEPS  battalions. Further, regarding DOD\u2019s effort to implement an electronic  health record system into MEPS locations, we interviewed officials from  Accession Policy within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness and USMEPCOM as well as contacted the  Program Executive Office Defense Healthcare Management System to  obtain information regarding the implementation status of DOD\u2019s new  electronic health record within USMEPCOM at the MEPSs locations.

Moreover, Air Force officials also are piloting the use of a questionnaire  called the Lackland Behavioral Questionnaire. Under this pilot, Air Force  enlistees complete a questionnaire with over 70 questions on mental and  behavioral health in an attempt to identify recruits with potential mental or  behavioral issues so they can be interviewed by medical professionals  and provided any necessary help or counseling early. Marine Corps  officials stated that they place enlistees who fail the Marine Corps\u2019 initial  strength test into a physical conditioning platoon for further physical  conditioning before they begin basic training to help improve physical  fitness and reduce injuries.

However, not all basic training bases provide  medical records in accordance with the memorandum. In fact, for fiscal  year 2015, the latest full fiscal year of data available, USMEPCOM  reported receiving medical records for only 2,017 of 8,592 EPTS  separations, a rate of 23 percent.", "USMEPCOM officials and basic training site officials we met with  provided four reasons as to why all EPTS medical records are not  provided to USMEPCOM. First, USMEPCOM officials stated that no  uniform, standardized process to collect the necessary documentation  from basic training sites has been established by any higher level  headquarters. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  state that management, in order to achieve its objectives, should design  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Moreover, the  standards state that management should document\u2014in policies for each  unit\u2014its responsibilities for all operational processes. Management  should also review related policies, procedures, and related control  activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving the  entity\u2019s objectives. Officials stated that no specific process or  instructions have been developed that clearly lay out the roles and  responsibilities of USMEPCOM and the military services as well as the  specific information that the services should provide to USMEPCOM. As  such, inconsistent information is sent to USMEPCOM, and in some  cases, certain medical records may not be sent at all, making analysis  difficult, if not impossible. For example, USMEPCOM officials told us that  Air Force officials were not sending medical records for psychological  EPTS separations and were told it was due to Air Force officials\u2019  confusion as to whether these cases were considered medical  separations because of their interpretation of DOD separation  classifications and coding.", "Second, language used in the 2001 memorandum has led to some  confusion by the military services as to whether the memorandum is  simply a request or a requirement for them to send medical records of  enlistees with EPTS separations at their training bases. Third, military  service officials stated that since the memorandum was very old, they  were unsure if it was still active or who was specifically responsible at the  training bases for sending the medical records to USMEPCOM\u2014 personnel officials or medical professionals. Fourth, USMEPCOM officials  stated that some military service officials cited Privacy Act and concerns  regarding their responsibilities for handling personal health information  and the ability of USMEPCOM to safeguard the information adequately as  reasons for their failure to send USMEPCOM the medical records for  EPTS separations. USMEPCOM officials acknowledge the reluctance to  send medical records because of the personal health information  contained. As such, they believe the use of electronic health records  would be useful in providing stronger safeguards that they believe should  mitigate concerns about the handling of enlistees\u2019 medical records to  USMEPCOM. For example, recent discussions between USMEPCOM  and Navy training base officials have led the Navy to draft a  memorandum of understanding to clarify responsibilities regarding  sending EPTS records and handling medical information. As of April  2017, the Navy had not completed this memorandum of understanding  with USMEPCOM, and USMEPCOM was still not receiving the Navy  EPTS separation medical records.", "DOD is planning to reissue a DOD instruction in July 2017 with changes  that would require basic training sites to forward EPTS medical  information to USMEPCOM, according to DOD officials. We obtained and  reviewed the draft instruction and noted that it does require the  submission of the medical records to USMEPCOM, but the draft  instruction does not contain specific instructions aimed at addressing  many of the reasons USMEPCOM and military service officials gave for  the current failure to provide records. Specifically, the draft instruction  does not identify a clear process with defined roles and responsibilities.  As a result, we were unable to determine if the draft instruction will  resolve any of the issues noted above, other than eliminating doubts  about the currency and mandatory nature of the direction to provide the  records to USMEPCOM. Without a clear process with defined roles and  responsibilities, USMEPCOM may continue to not receive the majority of  EPTS medical records for its review and analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USMEPCOM\u2019s Nonoperational Database Limits the Ability to Fully Analyze Medical Records for EPTS Separations", "paragraphs": ["USMEPCOM has been unable to fully analyze the medical records it does  receive because its internal EPTS database has been nonoperational  since September 2015 due to technical issues. Prior to September 2015,  USMEPCOM officials told us that they scanned the paper medical  records for EPTS separations that they received from basic training bases  into this internal database. This allowed them to use information from  these medical records to analyze specific data points, such as the cause  of the separation and the MEPS location where the enlistee was  medically qualified. This analysis allowed them to examine trends over  time, such as a trend in separations due to errors related to a specific  medical diagnosis or trends in processing errors to gain insight into  problem areas. Without an operational EPTS database, USMEPCOM  officials said that they can only conduct a limited, manual analysis of  EPTS separation medical records, and are not able to fully analyze and  utilize this information.", "Additionally, officials stated that the dependence on hard-copy medical  records requires a large amount of resources to perform the manual  analysis of these records and incurs large administrative costs associated  with organizing medical records as they arrive, scanning them, manually  coding results, and then repackaging the records. USMEPCOM officials  stated that they are currently in the process of repairing the database, but  they could not provide a schedule for its completion. We have previously  reported that having a well-planned schedule is a fundamental  management tool. In addition, the 2001 memorandum we previously  discussed states that the findings from EPTS analysis form an important  part of USMEPCOM\u2019s quality control process, particularly in identifying  and correcting physician errors and reducing the number of erroneous  enlistments. Analyzing these particular separations provides insight into  medical conditions that were not detected during the medical qualification  process at a MEPS, allows USMEPCOM officials to identify trends in  errors related to specific diagnoses, and provides information to improve  the medical qualification process. According to USMEPCOM\u2019s analysis of  the limited number of EPTS medical records it received for fiscal year  2015, 47 percent of all such separations occurred due to enlistees  concealing their medical history and 29 percent occurred due to the  enlistee being unaware of the medical condition. For the same year, only  3 percent of such separations occurred due to an error on the part of  MEPS personnel during the medical qualification process.", "Given the importance of the database to the analyses that USMEPCOM  conducts, as long as it is unavailable, USMEPCOM will be hampered in  its ability to conduct these analyses. The lack of a schedule for  implementing the repairs to the database raises concerns about the  timeliness of these repairs.

Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that management, in order to achieve its  objectives, should use quality information by identifying information  requirements, obtaining relevant data from reliable internal and external  sources in a timely manner, and processing the obtained data into quality  information. However, USMEPCOM officials stated individual feedback  regarding EPTS separations has been limited to cases in which  USMEPCOM alerted chief medical officers to an obvious error at their  MEPS location during the medical qualification process. For example, two  chief medical officers we contacted reported receiving feedback at least  once regarding EPTS separations that were classified as \u201cMEPS errors.\u201d", "While MEPS chief medical officers do receive feedback through other  methods, none of these methods are individually tailored to the  performance of MEPS chief medical officers as it relates to EPTS  separations. Specifically, USMEPCOM officials stated that feedback  regarding EPTS separations occurs during more general forums such as  the annual MEPS chief medical officer conference or during monthly  conference calls where USMEPCOM can discuss questions or concerns that could affect all MEPS. Additionally, USMEPCOM has implemented  its Peer Review Program where physicians at each MEPS review each  other\u2019s medical qualification decisions on a daily basis, if possible, as a  local means of quality control. USMEPCOM officials also stated that they  can provide feedback if a MEPS chief medical officer contacts  USMEPCOM requesting clarification on an EPTS issue. However, these  methods of feedback, while useful, do not provide individual feedback to  MEPS chief medical officers regarding their specific decisions to  medically qualify applicants who ultimately separated from military service  within 180 days due to a medical reason. Six of the twelve MEPS medical  officers that we contacted stated that they receive very limited to no  feedback regarding EPTS cases specific to their MEPS and each said it  would be helpful if they did. USMEPCOM officials acknowledge that it has  been difficult for them to provide a large amount of feedback to the MEPS  because of having to rely on paper medical records from the training  bases and because of the technical difficulties they have had in analyzing  what records they have received. The USMEPCOM officials believe that if  they had an electronic medical record rather than the voluminous paper  medical records, it would be easier to analyze information and share the  results.", "Receiving feedback on EPTS separations could allow MEPS chief  medical officers to refine and improve their performance during the  medical qualification process, thereby disqualifying applicants at the  MEPS rather than after the military services have invested significant  resources in enlistees at the basic training sites.

At the beginning of the accession process, an  applicant must self-disclose personal medical information by answering a  medical prescreening questionnaire with over 160 questions covering  major body systems along with sleep disorders; learning, psychiatric, and  behavioral issues; and medicine usage. When an applicant answers any  of these questions affirmatively, they are expected to obtain\u2014or authorize  others, such as their recruiter, to obtain\u2014additional documentation  regarding that medical condition to include with the medical prescreen  questionnaire. While current medical processing provides valuable  information, reliance is placed heavily upon applicant self-disclosure of  his/her medical history, leaving a potential void in details if the applicant  does not disclose any known medical conditions. This creates the  possibility that an applicant could conceal a potentially disqualifying  medical condition that should be considered during the medical  qualification process. According to a DOD review, reliance on applicants\u2019  self-disclosed material limits information for review, constrains analysis  and hampers efforts to identify applicants who do not meet standards  early in the military recruiting and accession process. As mentioned  previously, USMEPCOM analysis shows that, in 2015, about 75 percent  of early attrition due to medical reasons within the first 180 days of  service was attributed to either applicant concealment of known medical  conditions or due to the enlistee being unaware of the medical condition.", "Even if an applicant self-discloses that they have or previously had a  medical condition to either a recruiter or later to MEPS medical physicians  and provides their medical records for further review, the MEPS use a  largely paper-based documentation system that requires manual  processing of the medical information collected on applicants. DOD has  noted that enlistment across the military force requires processing 70 to  80 million pieces of paper every year\u2014a slow, duplicative, and expensive  process. Throughout the accession process for enlistees, paper is still  mailed, faxed, hand-carried, and scanned, often multiple times, to the  MEPS for use in processing the applicant for further review. In addition to  the applicants\u2019 hard copy medical prescreen questionnaire and any  supporting medical documents that are submitted to the MEPS, MEPS  medical personnel record on paper forms the additional medical history  and physical examination results and comments they obtain during their  evaluation of the applicant. Additionally, there may be numerous other  forms used during an applicant\u2019s medical processing that are not  captured electronically, including authorizations for medical testing,  consultation requests and results, and chain of custody documents.  Officials at each of the MEPS locations we visited or contacted  characterized the volume of paper they deal with on a daily basis as  being challenging, overwhelming, an administrative burden, or time- consuming. Further, they said that handling, transferring, and manual  processing of the paper records is often done multiple times in order to  advance an applicant through the medical qualification process. Figure 8  illustrates examples of the possible paper forms and documentation that  may be used for enlisted applicants and accession processing activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Schedule for Deploying the New Electronic Health Record System to Support Enlistee Accessions at MEPS Locations Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["DOD is in the process of implementing a new integrated electronic health  record system, but DOD\u2019s schedule for deploying this system at MEPs to  assist with the medical screening of enlisted applicants is uncertain. In  July 2015, the Program Executive Office, DOD Healthcare Management  System, under the authority and direction of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, awarded a $4.3 billion  contract for a new integrated electronic health record system known as  MHS GENESIS. This new system is intended to give DOD the capability  to electronically share more complete medical data with and between  both federal and private sector medical facilities that are similarly  equipped. More specifically, currently USMEPCOM has no electronic  interfaces to electronic medical information holders for it to independently  obtain medical history information on applicants including information held  by other DOD (e.g., Military Health System), government (e.g. Veterans  Affairs, Social Security Administration, etc.), and public/private sector  (e.g., medical insurance, pharmacy beneficiary, etc.) entities. If  implemented within USMEPCOM, this new electronic health record  system could provide this electronic interface as well as other capabilities  to improve USMEPCOM\u2019s ability to access data and share medical  information.", "A USMEPCOM concept of operations paper discusses how USMEPCOM  believes the use of an electronic health record system could reduce both  its reliance on applicant self-disclosure and its paper-based process of  recording applicant medical information. For example, with MHS  GENESIS\u2019 planned interoperability and data exchange capabilities,  USMEPCOM officials could reduce their reliance on applicant self- disclosure and improve the medical qualification decision-making process  by interfacing with and accessing applicant electronic medical records  that may exist to independently obtain and verify applicant medical history  information. Additionally, the ability to electronically exchange information  would allow USMEPCOM to share the information more quickly with other  accession stakeholders like service medical waiver review authorities.  Further, a transition to an electronic health record system would begin to  reduce the use of the paper-based system\u2014and its associated costs and  challenges\u2014for recording the medical information obtained or generated  during the accession process. Thus, integration of an electronic health  record system into the accession community could enhance DOD\u2019s ability  to obtain and document complete, accurate, detailed medical information  that is fully accessible, could be used to improve USMEPCOM officials\u2019  medical qualification decisions, and perhaps affect early attrition rates.", "Recognizing the potential for MHS GENESIS to support the MEPS, in  June 2016 the Acting Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness emphasized that the modernization of  accession processes is a priority and requested that the MHS GENESIS  program management office coordinate with the accession community to  include the MEPS in the deployment schedule for the new system. In  response to this request, in August 2016 the program management office  issued a memorandum stating it fully intends to work with USMEPCOM to  ensure MEPS locations are included in the implementation of MHS  GENESIS. Subsequently, officials from Accession Policy within the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  and USMEPCOM stated that they had initial coordination meetings in  January and April 2017 with MHS GENESIS program management  officials to discuss the inclusion of MEPS locations into the system  deployment plans. According to USMEPCOM officials, the latest meeting  produced an expectation that MHS GENESIS will meet its initial operating  capability at one MEPS location in the fall of 2018. However, according to  a MHS GENESIS program management official, detailed plans for  deploying MHS GENESIS to the MEPS are in the earliest stages of  development and no deployment decisions or timelines have been  established. Thus, DOD\u2019s schedule for deploying MHS GENESIS at  MEPS locations and ensuring that the system supports its accession  programs is uncertain.", "We have previously reported that projects such as MHS GENESIS can  benefit from the effective use of project planning and management  practices. These practices can significantly increase the likelihood of  delivering promised capabilities on time and within budget. Additionally,  we and others have issued guidance calling for the development of  essential documentation needed for project planning execution and  management. According to this guidance, project planning involves,  among other things, establishing a schedule of actions required to attain  project objectives. We have also reported that a well-planned schedule is  a fundamental management tool that can help government programs use  public funds effectively by specifying when work will be performed in the  future and measuring program performance against an approved plan.  Moreover, an integrated and reliable schedule can show when major  events are expected as well as the completion dates for all activities  leading up to them, which can help determine if the program\u2019s parameters  are realistic and achievable. Further, a reliable schedule can contribute  to an understanding of the cost impact if the program does not finish on  time.", "Until DOD completes development of a schedule that includes dates for  MHS GENESIS\u2019 deployment to MEPS locations, the department will not  have assurance that its efforts to modernize the department\u2019s medical  screening process through reducing its reliance on self-disclosure and the  processing of paper files is moving forward expeditiously and as planned."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The military services enlist thousands of new servicemembers each year,  but if incomplete medical information is gathered or if inadequate medical  screening is performed, the military services may increase the likelihood  that some of these enlistees may leave the military before their initial  terms of commitment are fulfilled. Early separation is costly, and enlistee  early attrition during their initial term of commitment due to medical  reasons\u2014many of which may be either not disclosed or unknown\u2014 constitutes a significant loss to the military services. Even when an  enlistee separates from military service within the first 180 days due to a  medical reason, DOD can use information from those cases to improve its  accession medical qualification process; however, DOD does not have a  clear process to ensure that complete medical information is available  about early separation cases from the military services. Moreover, it has  not set a schedule to repair a key database at USMEPCOM to analyze  this information. As a result, DOD may not be able to review and analyze  information that could help improve the medical qualification decision  process and ensure that MEPS are adequately identifying medically  disqualifying conditions among applicants for military service.", "Further, DOD primarily relies on the self-disclosure of medical information  by enlisted applicants and a paper-based system to process and obtain  medical information for new enlistees. As DOD begins its planning efforts  for integrating a new multibillion dollar electronic health record system  and transforming the current manual accession medical process to an  automated one, it is important that DOD have a clear and complete  schedule and plan in place to effectively manage this effort.

In its comments, DOD  stated that the database is being reviewed as part of a multi-year  information technology modernization effort that includes the use of  business intelligence tools found within DOD\u2019s new electronic health  record system known as MHS GENESIS. DOD stated that once these  tools are available, USMEPCOM will be able to conduct the EPTS  medical record reviews and provide detailed feedback to the MEPS chief  medical officers. We believe that having access to MHS GENESIS\u2019  business intelligence tools should improve USMEPCOM\u2019s ability to  conduct a more thorough analysis of EPTS separation medical records.  However, the MHS GENESIS implementation schedule within  USMEPCOM has not been finalized and is not expected to be approved  until a Full Deployment Decision certification is issued some time in 2018.  This means that the phased implementation of MHS GENESIS at the  MEPS is likely to be several years away at a minimum.

We  analyzed these data to show overall early attrition and early attrition due  to medical reasons over selected intervals by military service for each  fiscal year. We also analyzed DOD separation codes assigned to each  separation to examine the leading categories of early attrition. We  reviewed the data to check for their completeness and for obvious errors  such as out-of-range date values.
