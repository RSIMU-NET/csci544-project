In light of possible competitive effects of the capital rules, GAO was asked to examine (1) the markets in which banks compete, (2) how new capital rules address U.S. banks' competitive concerns, and (3) actions regulators are taking to address competitive and other potential negative effects during implementation. Among other things, GAO analyzed data on bank products and services and the final and proposed capital rules; interviewed U.S. and foreign bank regulators, officials from U.S. and foreign banks; and computed capital requirements under varying capital rules."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Large and internationally active U.S.-based banks (core banks) that will adopt the Basel II advanced approaches compete among themselves and in some markets with U.S.-based non-core banks, investment firms, and foreign-based banks. Non-core banks compete with core banks in retail markets, but in wholesale markets core banks often compete with investment firms and foreign-based banks. Because holding capital is costly for banks, differences in regulatory capital requirements could influence costs, prices, and profitability for banks competing under different capital requirements. The new U.S. capital rules addressed some earlier competitive concerns of banks; however, other concerns remain. By better aligning the advanced approaches rule with the international accord and proposing an optional standardized approach rule, U.S. regulators reduced some competitive concerns for both core and non-core banks. For example, the U.S. wholesale definition of default for the advanced approaches is now similar to the accord's. Core banks continue to be concerned about the leverage requirement (a simple capital to assets calculation), which they believe places them at a competitive disadvantage relative to firms not subject to a similar requirement. Foreign regulators have been working with U.S. regulators to coordinate Basel II implementation for U.S. banks with foreign operations. The proposed standardized approach addresses some concerns non-core banks raised by providing a more risk sensitive approach to calculating regulatory requirements. But other factors likely will reduce differences in capital for banks competing in the United States; for example, the leverage requirement establishes a floor that may exceed the capital required under the advanced and standardized approaches. Many factors have affected the pace of Basel II implementation in the United States and, while the gradual implementation is allowing regulators to consider changes in the rules and reassess banks' risk-management systems, regulators have not yet taken action to address areas of uncertainty that could have competitive implications. For example, the final rule provides regulators with considerable flexibility and leaves open questions such as which banks may be exempted from the advanced approaches. Although the rule provides that core banks can apply for exemptions and regulators should consider these in light of some broad categories, such as asset size or portfolio mix, the rule does not further define the criteria for exemptions. Some industry participants we spoke with said that uncertainties about the implementation of the advanced approaches have been a problem for them. Moreover, regulators have not fully developed plans for a required study of the impacts of Basel II before full implementation. Lack of specificity in criteria, scope, methodology, and timing will affect the quality and extent of information that regulators will have to help assess competitive and other impacts, determine whether there are any material deficiencies requiring future changes in the rules, and determine whether to permit core banks to fully implement Basel II."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring that banks maintain adequate capital is essential to the safety  and soundness of the banking system. Basel II, the newly revised risk- based capital framework, aims to better align minimum capital  requirements with enhanced risk-measurement techniques and to  encourage banks to develop a more disciplined approach to risk  management. Basel II rests on an international accord (the New Basel  Accord) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel  Committee) in June 2004. The New Basel Accord includes a standardized  approach and advanced approaches, more complex approaches that large,  internationally active banks are encouraged to use. U.S. federal banking  regulators have been working to finalize capital rules based on this accord.  Since our February 2007 report on Basel II, U.S. federal banking regulators  have finalized the advanced approaches rules that are required for some of  the largest and most internationally active banking organizations (core  banks), which account for about half of U.S. banking assets. Some other  banks may choose to comply with the advanced approaches rule as well.  These rules lay out a phased implementation schedule, which generally  requires core banks to have Basel II implementation plans approved by  their boards of directors by October 1, 2008. In addition, in July 2008, U.S.  banking regulators published for comment a proposed rule on the  standardized approach, a simpler version of the new regulatory capital  framework that could be adopted by banks that were not required to adopt  the advanced approaches (non-core banks).", "Though the goal of Basel II was to improve the safety and soundness of the  banking system through better risk management and create a level playing  field for internationally active banks, the development of Basel II has  generated concerns among banks, banking regulators, and other interested  parties that potentially different capital requirements and implementation  costs for various categories of U.S. and foreign banks could have  competitive effects. These concerns arose, in part, because U.S. banks  that all have been operating under the same risk-based capital rules\u2014 known as Basel I\u2014may be operating under different capital rules in the  future\u2014Basel II advanced approaches, Basel II standardized approach, or  Basel I. In addition, because the New Basel Accord identified certain areas  for national discretion, the capital regimes being adopted in various  countries differ from that being implemented in the United States.", "The risk-management systems for financial institutions and the  information systems on which they rest have been called into question by  the failure of some of these systems during the market turbulence that  began with subprime mortgages in 2007. While this turmoil is not the focus  of this report, it is an important factor that is leading banking  organizations and their regulators to reassess capital requirements and  other aspects of bank regulation and supervision. These assessments  could lead to changes in the Basel II rules or could influence the  implementation of those rules in the United States. In addition, as a result  of concerns about the ability of U.S. financial institutions to compete with  institutions based in foreign countries, the U.S. Department of the  Treasury has proposed a restructuring of the complex U.S. regulatory  system. Various congressional committees have held hearings that  addressed this issue and in the past, we have recommended that the U.S.  regulatory system be restructured.", "In light of concerns about possible competitive effects, you requested that  we review the competitive implications of Basel II for non-core U.S. banks  in comparison to core banks adopting the advanced approaches and how  differences in the implementation of Basel II in foreign countries might  affect the competitiveness of internationally active banks operating in the  United States. Specifically, this report examines (1) the nature of the  competitive environment in which U.S. banking organizations operate,   (2) the extent to which the new capital rules address competitive concerns  of U.S. banking organizations internationally and domestically, and (3)  actions regulators are taking to address competitive and other potential  negative effects of the new capital rules during implementation.", "To meet our objectives, we reviewed the New Basel Accord, the U.S.  proposed rules on the advanced approaches and standardized approach,  the U.S. final advanced approaches rule, supervisory guidance, and related  materials.

We interviewed officials at  the federal bank regulatory agencies responsible for implementing Basel  II, including examination and policy staff. We also interviewed officials  from all of the core banks and other domestic and foreign banks with  operations in the United States. In addition, we interviewed officials from  several foreign bank regulatory agencies; domestic and foreign trade  associations; credit rating agencies; and several academics and  consultants with banking expertise. To describe the competitive  environment in which U.S. banking organizations operate, we analyzed  various data sources on the products and services that U.S. and foreign  banking organizations offer domestically and internationally.

Some of the core banks are active in  retail markets, some in wholesale markets, and some in the full range of  banking activities. As illustrated in table 1, which is based on publicly  available information, five core banking organizations\u2014including one that  is foreign-based\u2014have at least 25 percent of their assets in retail markets  and one of these, the only thrift that is a core banking organization  (Washington Mutual Bank), has more than 60 percent of its assets in retail  markets, while a few institutions have almost no activity in these markets.  In addition, two core banks that appear less active in retail markets\u2014with  about 15 percent of their assets in these markets\u2014may still have a major  presence there because of their overall size. In wholesale markets, table 1  shows that some banks are active in making commercial and industrial  loans while others hold a larger percentage of their assets as trading  assets\u2014assets held to hedge risks or speculate on price changes for the  bank or its customers. However, the thrift institution has very little activity  in these markets. The three smaller U.S.-based core banks, which are  classified as core banks because they have large foreign exposures, engage  primarily in custodial activities where they manage the funds of their  clients. In this area they compete with the largest U.S. banks that are also  engaged in these activities.", "Core banks are in some ways similar to non-core banks. For example,  banks of all sizes continue to participate in some activities historically  associated with banking, such as taking deposits and making loans. As  table 2 shows, bank holding companies of different sizes hold similar  proportions of certain loans such as residential mortgages and commercial  and industrial loans.", "According to research conducted by Federal Reserve staff and other  experts, banks of different sizes compete with each other for retail  products such as residential mortgages. As illustrated in table 2, bank  holding companies in all size ranges hold a relatively large percentage of  their assets\u2014from 15.5 to 23.1 percent\u2014in residential mortgages.  Customers can obtain mortgages from banks across the United States and  generally can obtain pricing information from brokers or directly through  the Internet or financial publications. For small thrifts, which make up a  portion of the small non-core banking institutions in the United States but  are not included in table 2, the proportion of mortgages is much higher.  Unlike residential mortgages, only a few banks, including several core  banks, are active in the credit card market, but some non-core banks are  active in this market as well; and all credit card issuers generally compete  for the same customers.", "For wholesale products, the competitive landscape is more complex. As  table 2 illustrates, in some areas core banks differ substantially from non- core banks and are thus not likely to compete with them in those markets.  For example, non-core banks hold a very small percentage of their assets  as trading assets, an area where some core banks are very active, and core  banks hold a relatively small proportion of their assets in commercial real  estate, an area where non-core banks are very active. While table 2 shows  that core and non-core banks are both active in the commercial and  industrial loan markets, the market for loans from large banks may be  quite different from those for smaller banks. According to a bank official  and other experts, larger banks do not price commercial and industrial  loans individually; instead, these loans generally are part of a package of  products and services offered to major corporate clients. Financial market  experts told us that often these loans are discounted to establish a  relationship with the customer. Because smaller banks do not offer a full  range of products and services, they likely are not competing for the same  customers as larger banks. In addition, we and others have shown that  smaller banks tend to serve the needs of smaller businesses with which  they can establish a personal relationship. Because obtaining credit  information on small businesses is difficult, community banks often have  an advantage with these customers in that they may have better  information about small businesses in their local market than do large  national or internationally active banks. As a result, the largest banks are  unlikely to be competing with community banks in these markets.

Depending on the  structure of markets, these higher costs could be passed on to bank  customers in the form of higher prices\u2014interest rates on loans or fees for  services\u2014or absorbed as reduced lending and profits. For example, higher  capital costs driven by higher capital requirements could result in a  competitive disadvantage for banks that compete for similar customers  with banks subject to different capital rules. Conversely, lower capital  requirements that allow banks to reduce the capital they hold for a  particular asset could allow them to price those assets more aggressively,  thereby increasing market share or earning higher returns at existing  prices.", "Bank officials with whom we spoke and some empirical evidence we  reviewed suggested that regulatory capital requirements are one of several  key factors banks consider in deciding how much capital to hold. Other  factors include management views on the amount of capital the firm needs  internally and market expectations. These multiple and overlapping  motivations for holding capital make it difficult to isolate the impact of  regulatory capital on the amount of capital banks hold. Nevertheless,  there is some evidence that banks hold more than the minimum required  capital\u2014a buffer\u2014in part to reduce the risk of breaching that minimum  requirement. For example, one study of United Kingdom banks found that  an increase in required capital was followed by an increase in actual  capital, although the increase was only about half the size of the increase  in required capital. Thus, changes in minimum required capital could  cause banks to change the amount of capital they hold to maintain a  similar buffer of capital, consistent with the other goals of the bank. The  study also found that banks with small buffers reacted more to a given  change in individual capital requirements\u2014and banks with larger buffers  reacted little, if at all\u2014supporting the view that the capital buffer is a form  of insurance against falling below regulatory minimums.", "Differences in the implementation costs of capital requirements also could  have competitive effects. In principle, higher implementation costs could  lead to a one-time increase in costs or ongoing costs associated with  compliance. One-time costs would influence profitability directly, while  ongoing costs also could influence the cost of lending for banks in the  same way that higher capital costs could influence pricing and  profitability. Significant implementation costs are likely to be easier to  bear the larger the institution\u2014the costs of implementing regulation are  on average higher (as measured by cost per employee) for smaller firms.", "The possible effects of differences in regulatory capital requirements on  implementation and capital costs also could influence incentives for  consolidation by making acquisitions more or less advantageous for banks  operating under different capital rules. Such advantages would imply that  those banks under a given capital regime might be able to use the capital  resources of banks under a different regime more effectively, making it  profitable for the former banks to acquire the latter ones.

These studies  were limited by the availability of data and by a lack of information on the  impact regulatory capital has on bank behavior.

In addressing competitive issues in this  analysis, OCC relied primarily on the studies conducted at the Federal  Reserve. In its regulatory impact analysis, OTS incorporated OCC\u2019s  analysis adding appropriate material specifically related to the thrift  industry. For example, OTS noted that because thrifts have high  concentrations of assets in residential mortgages, the leverage  requirement would be more likely to impose greater capital requirements  on these firms than would the Basel II requirements and, as a result, would  have a negative impact on the ability of thrifts to compete with other  banking organizations. OTS also pointed out that interest rate risk for  those mortgage-related assets that a bank is planning to hold rather than  trade is particularly important to thrifts. However, the adequacy of capital  held for these risks is being assessed in Pillar 2 rather than in Pillar 1,  where the risks associated with changes in interest rates on mortgage  related assets that are being actively traded are assessed.

U.S.  regulators also noted that the SME treatment in the Accord might give rise  to a domestic competitive inequity between core banks and banks subject  to other regulatory capital rules, such as Basel I. Officials at one rating  agency with whom we spoke said that a lower capital requirement for  SME loans in the New Basel Accord was not reflective of the risk for these  exposures, and the rating agency did not treat these loans differently from  other business loans in their own assessments of capital adequacy. In  addition, several experts with whom we spoke noted that this difference in  capital requirements for SME loans would likely not have any immediate  or major impact on competition between U.S. and foreign banks.", "In addition to the technical differences discussed above, the final rule  addressed one concern related to a prudential safeguard U.S. regulators  introduced in the 2006 NPR, but some core banks remain concerned about  the implementation schedule. The NPR contained a benchmark\u2014a 10  percent reduction in aggregate minimum capital among core banks\u2014that  would have been viewed as a material reduction in capital requirements  that warranted modification in the rule. Core banks had commented that  this safeguard could affect them negatively because of the uncertainty  surrounding its application. In the final rule, U.S. regulators eliminated the  benchmark. However, retention of the implementation schedule proposed  in the 2006 NPR continues to raise concerns for some core banks because  it will lead to a longer transition period in the United States than in other  countries and delay any possible capital reductions. European banks and  most Canadian banks on the advanced approaches most likely will exit  their transitional periods by January 2010. In contrast, U.S. core banks  cannot exit their transitional periods before April 2012 and could do so in  2014 or later. Furthermore, European banks will be able to reduce capital  to 90 percent of Basel I requirements in 2008 and to 80 percent of Basel I  requirements in 2009 while Canadian banks will be able to apply for   approval to reduce their capital by similar amounts under the same  timeframes. Under the final rule, U.S. core banks will have three distinct  transitional periods during which required risk-based capital may be  reduced to only 95 percent, 90 percent, and 85 percent of Basel I  requirements respectively. The different implementation schedules and  maximum capital reductions may provide foreign competitors of U.S. core  banks an earlier opportunity to make use of any decreases in capital costs  associated with lower required capital for certain assets or activities.  Therefore, by making the transition to Basel II lengthier for U.S. core  banks, foreign competitors may be able to take better advantage of  strategic opportunities, such as a mergers or acquisitions. Though several  core bank officials with whom we spoke remained concerned about the  time difference, officials at one core bank explained that the current  market environment may limit the competitive implications of that  difference.", "Several core bank officials with whom we spoke mentioned that they  would have wanted to have the option to select the standardized approach  with some officials suggesting that the lack of a choice may lead to higher  implementation costs. In the United States, the final rule requires all core  banks to adopt the advanced approaches for both credit and operational  risk, but affords opportunities for the primary federal supervisor to  exercise some flexibility when applying the final rule to core banks. The  advanced approaches rule specifically allows for the exemption of  subsidiary depository institutions from implementing the advanced  approaches, and, under the reservation of authority, the primary  federal regulator can require a different risk weighted asset amount for  one or more credit risk exposures, or for operational risk, if the regulators  determine that the requirement under the advanced approaches is not  commensurate with risk. However, some U.S. regulatory officials with  whom we spoke noted the potential risk of a piecemeal approach and  emphasized that they do not want banks to apply the advanced approach  for credit risk to their least risky portfolios and to apply Basel I or the  proposed standardized approach for their riskier portfolios.", "In contrast, some foreign banks have not been explicitly required to adopt  the advanced approaches for credit and operational risk. For example,  Canadian regulators told us that they have an expectation for their  domestic banks with significant global operations to move to the advanced  approach for credit risk and that there is no such expectation for domestic  banks to use the advanced approach for operational risk. Furthermore, all  other banks in Canada can decide to adopt the advanced approaches with  the condition that the bank must adopt the advanced approach for credit  risk before adopting the advanced approach for operational risk. In  addition, regulatory officials from the United Kingdom told us that all  banks were required to adopt the standardized approach in 2007, but some  banks applied for a waiver to allow them to adopt the advanced  approaches for determining capital requirements for credit risk or for  operational risk.

Foreign banks based  in other industrialized countries are generally not subject to a leverage  requirement. Some U.S.-based core banks are concerned about the  impact of the leverage requirement for bank holding companies on their  operations abroad. That is, in meeting the leverage requirement, a U.S.  bank holding company must include the assets of its foreign operations,  potentially increasing the amount of required regulatory capital in  comparison with the regulatory capital requirements for foreign-based  bank holding companies. For example, the additional capital needed to  meet the leverage requirement may exceed the additional capital required  under the advanced approaches for certain corporate loans that are  estimated by banks to be relatively low-risk, as demonstrated in figure 3.  Most core bank officials with whom we spoke also said that by  maintaining the leverage requirement, U.S. regulators were preserving a  regulatory capital requirement that was not aligned with the improved  risk-management practices promulgated by the final rule on the advanced  approaches. Officials from one trade association said that because the  leverage requirement does not require additional capital as risk increases,  banks may have an incentive to increase their return on equity by holding  assets with higher risk and return, but no additional capital required by the  leverage requirement. In contrast, regulatory officials have stated that risk- based and leverage requirements serve complementary functions in which  the leverage requirement can be seen as offsetting potential weaknesses or  supplementing the risk-based capital requirements.", "In terms of potential competitive effects domestically, some core bank  officials with whom we spoke expressed concerns that certain financial  firms, primarily the CSEs, offer similar wholesale products but lack similar  regulatory capital requirements, while other core bank officials were no  longer concerned. As noted previously, CSEs are required to compute and  report to SEC capital adequacy measures consistent with the standards in  the New Basel Accord, and SEC expects them to maintain certain capital  ratios, though they are not required to do so. SEC has said that it will make  modifications in light of the final rule adopted by U.S. bank regulators and  subsequent interpretations. In addition, bank holding companies are  subject to a leverage requirement, but CSEs do not have a similar  requirement.

This is in contrast to the single risk  weight for corporate credits and most mortgages in Basel I. Figure 5  demonstrates that the minimum required capital under the standardized  approach for the credit risk associated with externally-rated corporate  loans will be much more similar to that required under the advanced  approaches than that required under Basel I. In addition, the standardized  approach expands incentives for better risk management in that it allows  banks to reduce capital in light of certain additional practices that could  reduce risk, such as the use of collateral or third-party guarantees, and  explicitly requires banks to set aside capital for operational risk. The  added risk sensitivity of the standardized approach proposal should  reduce some differences in risk-based capital requirements, as compared  with the advanced approaches, for adopting banks.", "Once the standardized approach rule becomes final, non-core banks will  have the option of choosing it or the advanced approaches, or remaining  on Basel I. Presumably, non-core banks will take into consideration a wide  range of issues when deciding what regulatory capital framework to adopt,  including potential competitive effects. For example, a growing non-core  regional bank that competes principally with core banks in wholesale and  retail lending may find it beneficial to adopt the advanced approaches in  order to model and receive lower risk-based capital requirements for  certain lower-risk credits. Similarly, a smaller non-core bank that found  itself increasingly competing with regional banks might opt for the  additional risk-sensitivity of the standardized approach. However, one  trade association representing some of the smallest non-core banks with  whom we spoke said the standardized approach may not fully address the  competitive concerns of these banks because the capital relief associated  with holding some lower risk assets might be offset by additional capital  required for operational risk.

As already  discussed, banks hold capital based on management views on the amount  of capital the bank needs internally and market expectations, in addition  to regulatory requirements.

Differences in required capital for credit risk across multiple risk-based  regimes would likely have a competitive impact only to the extent that  banks retain the credits they originate on their balance sheets or retain a  significant portion of the credit risk off their balance sheets. Banks may  securitize residential mortgages and other types of loans into other  marketable investments in order to raise further funds to originate  additional loans. This is also known as an originate-to-distribute model  where revenues are derived from the sale of assets rather than an ongoing  stream of interest payments.

One area where uncertainty could be reduced is in clarifying  which core banking institutions would be exempt from the application of the  advanced approaches rule. The rule allows for exempting any core bank\u2014a  bank that meets the size or foreign exposure criteria for core banks or a  depository institution that is a core bank because it is a subsidiary of a core  bank that meets those criteria. Although the rule outlines a mechanism for  certain banks to be exempted and provides some broad factors regulators will  use in making these determinations (asset size, level of complexity, risk  profile, or scope of operation), the regulators have not been specific in the  current rule about whether they will grant these exemptions and under what  circumstances. The regulators have said that they will not grant many  exemptions and did not specify these exemptions because they believe it is  important for them to retain supervisory flexibility as they move forward with  implementation of the final rule. As such, they said each decision is to be  made on a case-by-case basis.", "Throughout the development of the rules, regulators had introduced  uncertainty about the extent to which foreign-based banks with  subsidiaries that are U.S. bank holding companies will be subject to the  advanced rules in the United States and the current rule continues to  provide the Federal Reserve, the regulator of bank holding companies,  considerable flexibility in making these decisions. The Federal Reserve  has not answered the question of which specific bank holding companies  that are subsidiaries of foreign-based banks and qualify as U.S. core banks- \u2014they have assets of $250 billion or greater\u2014will be exempted from using  the advanced approaches in the United States. When the advanced  approaches NPR was issued in 2006, some foreign-based institutions with  large bank holding companies in the United States but relatively small  depository institutions were surprised to find that they would be treated as  core banks in the United States. The final rule acknowledged the concerns  of those institutions and noted that the Federal Reserve may exempt them,  but it does not make it clear that they will be exempt. Because the Federal  Reserve, the regulator of bank holding companies, has not issued more  specific criteria or guidance for reviewing requests for exemptions, these  banks (at least one bank has requested an exemption) may have to devote  resources to complying with the U.S. final rule until they receive an  answer on whether they will be exempted. On the other hand, while only  one banking organization is affected, the rule specifically exempts bank  holding companies with significant insurance underwriting operations that  otherwise would meet the requirements to be a core bank.", "Similarly, the rule states that regulators will consider the same factors\u2014 asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations\u2014in  making a determination as to whether depository institutions that are  subsidiaries of U.S. core banks can be exempted. As a result, institutions  have little guidance concerning the likelihood that some of their depository  institutions will be exempt and will need to prepare for a full  implementation of the advanced approaches in each entity until they receive  a response from their regulator on whether they will be exempted.  Moreover, because the factors are so broad, if different regulators use  different specific criteria to exempt entities, they may set up the potential  for regulatory arbitrage. For example, a U.S. banking organization could  hold higher-risk assets in subsidiary banks that are exempt and remain on  Basel I and could hold lower-risk assets in subsidiary banks that are not  exempt from the advanced approaches. And banks that do not currently  have a structure that would allow them to reduce capital in this way could  change their structure accordingly by acquiring or changing bank charters.  The overall result could be lower capital held in the bank or resources being  devoted to reducing capital that do not properly align capital with risk.  However, officials from the Federal Reserve noted that regardless of the  structure of the bank, at the holding company level, all material bank assets  would be consolidated and subject to the advanced approaches rule.", "This continuing uncertainty could make it difficult for banking organizations  to pursue the most cost-effective route to complying with Basel II and could  create more risk for the banks at a time when risks are already high because  of the turmoil in financial markets. For example, some industry participants  told us that those parts of Basel II that do not improve risk management  divert resources that banks otherwise would use to better manage risk. In  addition, resources devoted to circumventing certain aspects of the rule  through regulatory arbitrage will divert the attention of bank officials from  improving banks\u2019 risk-management systems.", "Finally, the uncertainty over which banking institutions ultimately will have to  adopt the advanced approaches continues because the advanced approaches  rule says all core banks will be required to adopt detailed implementation plans  for the complex advanced approaches by October 1, 2008, and the proposed  standardized approach rule, which will not be finalized by that time, contains a  question about whether and to what extent core banks should be allowed to  use the simpler proposed standardized approach. The advanced approaches  rule generally requires core banks to comply with the advanced approaches  and adopt an implementation plan no later than October 1, 2008. Under this  rule, the Federal Reserve can exempt bank holding companies from meeting  the requirements of the final rule for the advanced approaches and primary  federal regulators can exempt depository institutions that meet the definition of  a core bank from the advanced approaches requirements. Given the authority  of the primary federal regulator, once the standardized approach rule is  finalized, those regulators would be able to require that exempt banking  organizations adopt that approach. However, the proposed standardized  approach rule, which will not be finalized by the time the core banks must  adopt their implementation plans, asks whether core banks should be allowed  to use the standardized approach instead of the advanced approaches.", "In the press release accompanying the proposed standardized approach rule,  the FDIC Chairman stated, \u201cGiven the turbulence in the credit markets, I take  some comfort with the fixed risk weights established under the standardized  approach as they provide supervisors with some control over unconstrained  reductions in risk-based capital.\u201d However, the interagency statement on U.S.  implementation of the advanced approaches issued in July 2008, stressed the  existing timelines for the advanced approaches. The continued discussion on  whether core banks should be exempt from the advanced approaches and  permitted to adopt the standardized approach indicates that the primary  federal regulators continue to have questions about whether the advanced  approaches are the best risk-based capital requirements for core banks. Thus,  it is difficult to tell whether the regulators have found a solution to difficulties  that resulted from the differing perspectives they brought to negotiations  during the development of the advanced approaches. We recommended in  our February 2007 report on Basel II that regulators take actions to jointly  specify the criteria they will use to judge the attainment of their goals for  Basel II implementation and for determining its effectiveness for regulatory  capital-setting purposes.

In its regulatory impact analysis,  OCC said that the regulators will consider any egregious competitive  effects associated with implementation of Basel II, whether domestic or  international in context, to be a material deficiency.", "Among the items the rule specifies that the study will cover, several are  important first steps in studying the competitive effects of the rule. These  include  the level of minimum required regulatory capital under U.S. advanced  approaches compared to the capital required by other international and  domestic regulatory capital standards;    comparisons among peer core banks of minimum regulatory capital  requirements;  the processes banks use to develop and assess risk parameters and  advanced systems, and supervisory assessments of their accuracy and  reliability; and    changes in portfolio composition or business mix.", "Some of these steps are similar to the calculations the regulators  performed as part of QIS-4. The advantage of the future study over QIS-4 is  that it will be based on actual data provided by banks whose risk  management and data systems have been reviewed by regulators as part of  the approval process for banks to enter the first two transitional periods.  In addition, one regulator noted that the study will also benefit from the  stresses of the recent market turmoil. This study should allow the  regulators to determine the extent to which total regulatory capital  changes in the short run, the specific behavior in which banks engage to  comply with some aspects of the rule, and how the rule affects the capital  of different banks.", "However, plans for the study do not address a number of factors including the  establishment of shared overall goals and criteria for Basel II that will help  delineate the study\u2019s scope, methodology, and timing. For example, while  OCC in its impact study said that the evaluation of competitive impacts will  be an important part of the study, the rule does not specify how this will be  measured and the scope and methodology of the study are not clearly  designed to achieve this objective. Because regulators design the study to  evaluate Basel II in light of clearly specified overall objectives or criteria for  Basel II, it will be difficult to jointly determine the extent to which the rules  need to be modified or whether implementation of Basel II should proceed. If  some regulators object to the full implementation of Basel II while others do  not, the rule specifies that a regulator can permit the banking organizations  for which it is the primary federal regulator to move forward with the  advanced approaches if it first provides a public report explaining its  reasoning. However, such an outcome would not provide confidence in the  current regulatory system and could allow for regulatory arbitrage.", "Further, the scope of the study has not been well defined. While the study  contemplates calculations of capital using the standardized approach,  Basel I, and other international rules as well as the actual data on the  banks following the advanced approaches, regulators have not said that  they plan to collect comparable data on financial entities not adopting  these approaches\u2014specifically, those banking institutions that will adopt  the standardized approach or remain on Basel I. In addition, the regulators  have not explicitly included the CSEs in the study. The effectiveness of the  study will be limited if the CSEs are not included because information on a  major segment of competitors of core banks that has had significant  experience with some aspects of the advanced approaches will have been  excluded. The agreement signed on July 7, 2008, between the Federal  Reserve and SEC regarding coordination and information sharing in areas  of common regulatory interest should facilitate the inclusion of the CSEs  in any study of the advanced approaches. Finally, the regulators have  conducted little research on international differences that could have  competitive effects in the past, and the study\u2019s design does not explicitly  include research on international differences that could have competitive  effects. However, since U.S. regulators participate in the Capital  Monitoring Group, Accord Implementation Group, and other similar  groups, they will have some perspective on Basel II implementation in the  other countries in that group including some European Union countries  and Canada that they will be able to use for this purpose. OCC officials  explained that the Capital Monitoring Group will collect and analyze  information on the implementation of Basel II in other countries and  suggested that this information will inform the U.S. study. In addition,  some U.S. regulators noted that the study outlined in the rule will not  preclude them from looking at a broad range of data.", "The methodology the study will use to evaluate competitive impacts  initially is not fully developed, although from a methodological perspective  Basel II affords an opportunity to consider the impacts of regulatory  capital on bank behaviors and among groups of banks adopting different  requirements at different times. While the measurements and comparisons  envisioned for the study are a necessary first step for evaluating  competitive impacts among the core banks and between the core banks  and other groups, they do not take full advantage of the opportunities to  better understand the impact of regulatory capital on a range of bank  behavior. Because banks in the United States and around the world are  adopting a range of capital requirements at different times, Basel II affords  a unique opportunity to consider whether event studies could contribute  to a better understanding of the impact of regulatory capital on a variety of  bank behaviors. While regulators at OCC noted that with banks on  different capital regimes, academics and other researchers, including  those at the regulatory agencies, will have data available to study the  impact of regulatory capital on bank behavior, they said that they had not  thoroughly considered the use of event studies as part of the study  planned by the regulators. Because regulators have not clearly specified  how they will evaluate the competitive impacts of Basel II, there is an  increased likelihood that the kinds of data needed to complete an effective  study will not be available.", "In addition, the advanced approaches rule does not specify a methodology for  the study to analyze the extent to which the new rules provide opportunities for  regulatory arbitrage that could limit the effectiveness of the rules in promoting  improved risk management throughout the banking system. Several industry  participants noted that having multiple capital requirements with different  levels of risk sensitivity provides incentives for core banks to hold less risky  assets and leave more risky assets in banks using the standardized approach or  Basel I. Higher risk-based capital requirements for high-risk assets at core  banks may increase their cost of holding these assets. Greater costs would  reduce the supply of credit for these types of loans, and thus returns would  increase. As a result, banks with less risk-sensitive capital requirements under  Basel I or the standardized approach might find some higher risk credits more  attractive at these higher rates of return. (As illustrated earlier in fig. 2, there  may be different amounts of capital required for the same asset across the  different risk-based rules.) Officials at one regulatory agency said that all of the  regulators were aware of this potential outcome and planned to look at changes  in the portfolios of core banks in the study. Further, for non-core banks,  regulators at another agency said they would become aware of non-core banks  increasing their holdings of high-risk assets through their normal oversight  duties. However, the advanced approaches rule does not specify how the study  would more fully explore this potentially important outcome of the new rules.  If this arbitrage took place, the rules could require less capital overall in the  banking system and would leave banks with the least well-developed risk  management systems with the riskiest assets, thus exposing the U.S. banking  system to greater systemic risk.", "Finally, the timing of the study is unclear. The rule specifies that the study  will be published after the second transitional period, but core banks  could begin the four intermediate phases required for full implementation  in 2008, 2009, or 2010 and different banks (as well as different types of  banks) could enter the second transitional period in different years. The  phased implementation produces uncertainty about timing and could  throw into question how many banks will be included in the study, and  whether the results of the study will provide relevant information for all of  the banks. For example, if the banks in the second transitional period in  2011 are primarily retail banks, the results are not likely to be applicable  for the custodial banks, or vice versa. As a result of this and other factors  discussed, the use of the study for taking actions that would improve risk  management or reduce competitive concerns may be limited.", "Some regulators told us that they have not yet focused on plans for the  study, in part, because it is early in the Basel II implementation process  and they and the banks they supervise have been dealing with the financial  turmoil. In addition, some regulators said that the language and factors  laid out in the final rule should be viewed as a starting point, and officials  at one regulatory agency said that the study will benefit from the data that  will be available from the financial turmoil in the world\u2019s credit markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A global effort is underway to implement the New Basel Accord, which  aims to improve the risk-management practices of banks, in part, by  aligning the capital banks hold more closely with the risks they face.  Capital\u2019s role becomes more important in periods of economic uncertainty  because banks rely on capital to weather unexpected losses. Although the  impact of regulatory capital on a bank\u2019s ability to compete is not always  obvious because banks often hold more than their minimum required  capital, regulatory capital is one of many factors that affects competition.  And, the adoption of Basel II in the United States has raised concerns  about competitive effects it could have on banks of varying sizes and in  various locations. In addition, regulators have made clear that in light of  the current market turmoil further revisions will be made in Basel II.", "Uncertainty about how to implement Basel II, to whom the rules will  apply, and the effects the rules will have may lead banks to devote  resources to information gathering and implementation that could  otherwise be dedicated to improving risk management or other purposes.  In our 2007 report, we noted that the rulemaking process for Basel II could  benefit from increased transparency to respond to broader questions and  concerns about transitioning to Basel II in the United States. The  regulators referred to the recommendation in the advanced approaches  rule and, with that rule and the proposed standardized approach rule, they  have provided greater clarity about some aspects of Basel II. We recognize  that the time table for Basel II implementation in the United States has  slowed since we issued our earlier report and that both the regulators and  the banks have been dealing with the market turmoil that began in mid- 2007. This gradual implementation is allowing bank regulators to reassess  banks\u2019 risk-management systems and consider changes in the rules before  any banks begin their Basel II implementation. As part of this preparation  period, regulators have taken and are planning some actions to reduce  uncertainty, but could take further actions to address remaining  uncertainties about the implementation of the rules and facilitate banks\u2019  planning and preparation for their implementation of a new capital regime.", "Regulators have taken actions to reduce some of the uncertainty  surrounding implementation of Basel II by providing information to aid  examiners and banks in interpreting the rules. Regulators have updated  some publicly available information on the process they will use to qualify  banks for the advanced approaches and examine them under Pillar 2.  Regulators have also engaged in discussions among themselves  concerning posting additional information in a question and answer format  on their Web sites. The timely issuance of additional information on the  advanced approaches and a final standardized approach rule, which is in  process, will enable banks to best prepare to meet the new risk-based  capital requirements and will help to ensure regulatory consistency across  the banks. As a result, we encourage the regulators to continue providing  joint information in a timely manner on both the advanced and  standardized approaches.", "We recognize that regulators have taken steps to reduce some uncertainties  related to Basel II; however, the regulators could take additional steps to  address uncertainties that are not related to their need for flexibility to  respond to innovation in the industry and to unintended consequences that  the rules may have. For example, in the final rule, the regulators did not  specify which banks technically met the definition of core banks. Although,  the rule specifically says that certain banks may be exempted by their primary  regulator from the advanced approaches requirements, it does not provide  well-defined criteria for evaluating requests for exemptions. Because this  clarity has not been provided and specific criteria have not been laid out,  regulators may not provide exemptions in a consistent manner. The issuance  of more specific guidance on which banks will be exempt from applying the  advanced approaches would provide clarity and enable banks to plan  accordingly. Also, the question in the NPR for the standardized approach  about whether core banks should be able to use the proposed standardized  approach indicates that the primary federal regulators continue to have  questions about whether the advanced approaches are the best risk-based  capital requirements for core banks. Regulatory differences on these issues  can lead to increased costs for the banks, inefficiencies for their regulators,  and may weaken the overall effectiveness of the regulatory system by  creating opportunities for banks to engage in regulatory arbitrage.", "In our 2007 report, we recommended that regulators issue public  reports on the progress and results of implementation efforts and that  this reporting should include an articulation of the criteria by which  they would assess the success of Basel II. While the regulators have  proposed a study of the core banks after the second transitional year  of the implementation of the advanced approaches, they have not yet  developed the criteria on which to base the study\u2019s design and  objectives. These are needed for a determination of whether Basel II  is effective for regulatory capital-setting purposes and whether to  ultimately allow banks to move past the third transitional period to  full Basel II implementation. As delineated in the advanced  approaches rule, the study will measure the changes in capital and  portfolios held by the core banks and will look at the differences in  required capital for these banks if they were under the standardized  approach rule or Basel I\u2014necessary steps for evaluating the  competitive impact of Basel II\u2014but it does not explicitly describe  components needed to determine if there are material deficiencies in  the rule or for regulators to reach agreement on whether banks should  be permitted to fully implement the advanced approaches. However,  the gradual implementation of the advanced approaches in the United  States affords regulators time to jointly establish criteria for  evaluating Basel II and to fully develop a study that flows from those  criteria\u2014including (1) a broad enough scope\u2014inclusion of non-core  banks, CSEs, and foreign-based banks\u2014to capture competitive  effects; (2) consideration of a number of methodologies; and (3) the  resolution of the timing issue. Such actions would help the regulators  make better-informed decisions on an interagency basis about  whether changes to the rules were necessary and whether to permit  banks to fully implement Basel II.

In their planning, they should consider such issues as the objectives,  scope, methodology, and timing needs for the future evaluation of Basel II.

In a somewhat related matter, the regulators said that the report emphasizes  the cost to banks of holding capital but did not discuss how a bank\u2019s strong  capital base confers competitive strength and create strategic opportunities.  While we describe some of the costs to banks of holding additional capital  because this is an important channel through which the new capital rules  could affect the competitiveness of U.S. banking organizations, we also note  that more capital reassures creditors and reduces the cost of borrowing. In  addition, as noted in the draft, banks hold capital for this and other reasons  including the ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities such as  acquiring other banking institutions.", "As we detailed in the draft, the banking regulators highlighted the actions  they have taken to address many of the concerns that bankers and others  have raised about the potential competitive equity effects of the  implementation of Basel II and said that they are in general agreement  with our recommendations. Specifically, they said that they will work  together to resolve, at the earliest possible time, the question posed for  comment in the proposed standardized approach rule regarding whether  and to what extent core banks should be able to use the standardized  approach. With regard to clarifying how they will decide whether to grant  requests from core banks to be exempt from the requirement to adopt the  advanced approaches, the regulators said they will assess each exemption  request in light of the specific facts and circumstances applicable to the  institution seeking the exemption and that they have already commenced  discussions to ensure a clear and consistent interpretation of these  provisions is conveyed to U.S. banks.", "Regarding the need to jointly plan the required study, the regulators  commented that they will work together to develop \u201cplans for the required  study of the impact of the advanced approaches of Basel II.\u201d Specifically, they  said that they will begin to develop more formal plans for the study once they  had \u201ca firmer picture of banks\u2019 implementation plans\u201d but noted the  difficulties concerning drawing definitive conclusions about the effects of  changes in regulatory capital rules. They also said that they would consider  including in their analysis the potential competitive effects with CSEs and  foreign banks as we recommended. While we are encouraged by the  regulators\u2019 recognition of the need for more formal plans and consideration of  the scope of the study to include CSEs and foreign banks, we noted a number  of additional factors that also should be considered, such as developing  criteria that will help them determine whether there are material deficiencies  that can be attributed to the new rules and what changes, if any, could  address those deficiencies. Finally, because Basel II affords an opportunity to  consider the impacts of regulatory capital on bank behaviors and among  groups of banks adopting different requirements at different times, we noted  in the draft that it is important that regulators consider a number of  methodologies for evaluating the new capital rules and potential competitive  effects to determine which are the most appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly release its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date of issue.

We used data from the  Federal Reserve\u2019s Structure and Share Data for U.S. Banking Offices of  Foreign Entities, and Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding  Companies (i.e., FR Y-9C). These data include the amount of assets in  particular products that bank holding companies hold on and off of their  balance sheets. For banks and thrifts that do not report assets in particular  products at the consolidated level to their regulator, we used data on  banks and thrifts in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council\u2019s (FFIEC) Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC  031 or Call Report) and OTS\u2019s Thrift Financial Reports, respectively. We  also used data from FFIEC\u2019s Country Exposure Lending Survey.", "To compare activities across banks of different sizes, we used data at the  consolidated level because banks generally compete on an enterprisewide  basis. For bank holding companies, we used data provided by the Federal  Reserve. Almost all bank holding companies that have assets greater than  $500 million report assets in particular product categories on a  consolidated basis to the Federal Reserve using the Y-9C form; however, a  large proportion of those with assets under $500 million about 80 percent  of the bank holding companies and a few larger bank holding companies  do not report consolidated assets on a product basis to the Federal  Reserve. We included these bank holding companies that have few assets  outside their chartered commercial banks in our analysis, by having staff  at the Federal Reserve group the commercial banks by bank holding  company and sum the assets reported in the Call Reports accordingly.  Thrift holding companies do not report data on assets by product category  to OTS on a consolidated basis. Because thrift holding companies are  often engaged in a wide variety of activities outside of banking, we could  not rely on the thrift financial report data on individual thrifts to  approximate the holding company for some thrifts as we did in the case of  some bank holding companies. However, we were able to have OTS staff  provide thrift financial report data that we used to approximate the thrift  holding companies for those thrift companies primarily in banking. We did  this by having OTS staff group the thrifts by holding company for those  where thrifts make up 95 percent of the assets of the holding company and  where they make up 75 percent of the assets of the holding company. The  allocation of assets across product lines was substantially the same for  these two categories, which allowed us to conclude that the data gave us a  good approximation of differences between thrift holding companies that  are primarily in the business of banking and bank holding companies. We  concluded that they do differ in that thrifts that are engaged primarily in  the business of banking hold a much larger percentage of their assets in  residential mortgages than do bank holding companies across all size  categories.

Banks use the results of these rating systems to estimate  several risk parameters that are inputs to supervisory formulas. Figure 7  illustrates how credit risk will be calculated under the Basel II A-IRB.  Banks must first classify their assets into exposure categories and  subcategories defined by regulators: for wholesale exposures those  subcategories are high-volatility commercial real estate and other  wholesale; for retail exposures those subcategories are residential  mortgages, qualifying revolving exposures (e.g., credit cards), and other  retail. Banks then estimate the following risk parameters, or inputs: the  probability a credit exposure will default (probability of default or PD),  the expected size of the exposure at the time of default (exposure at  default or EAD), economic losses in the event of default (loss given default  or LGD) in \u201cdownturn\u201d (recession) conditions, and, for wholesale  exposures, the maturity of the exposure (M). In order to estimate these  inputs, banks must have systems for classifying and rating their exposures  as well as a data management and maintenance system. The conceptual  foundation of this process is that a statistical approach, based on historical  data, will provide a more appropriate measure of risk and capital than a  simple categorization of asset types, which does not differentiate precisely  between risks. Regulators provide a formula for each exposure category  that determines the required capital on the basis of these inputs. If all the  assumptions in the supervisory formula were correct, the resulting capital  requirement would exceed a bank\u2019s credit losses in a given year with 99.9  percent probability. That is, credit losses at the bank would exceed the  capital requirement with a 1 in 1,000 chance in a given year, which could  result in insolvency if the bank only held capital equal to the minimum  requirement.", "Banks may incorporate some credit risk mitigation, including guarantees,  collateral, or derivatives, into their estimates of PD or LGD to reflect their  efforts to hedge against unexpected losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Risk", "paragraphs": ["To determine minimum required capital for operational risk, banks will  use their own quantitative models of operational risk that incorporate  elements required in the advanced approaches rule.
