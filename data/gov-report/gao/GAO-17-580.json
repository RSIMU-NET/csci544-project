According to the National Institute  of Standards and Technology, mission-critical information systems,  such as DOD ABIS, should have a back-up capability located in a  geographic area that is unlikely to be affected by the same hazards as  the primary site. The Army, which has responsibility for operating  and maintaining DOD ABIS, considered geographic dispersal as part  of the 2015 DOD ABIS follow-on system analysis of alternatives.  However, according to DOD officials, the Army has not included  geographic dispersal as part of the selection criteria for the DOD ABIS  follow-on system.", "When the Army fielded DOD ABIS in 2004 it was responding to a  CENTCOM urgent need to support military operations, and therefore it  focused on rapidly fielding an initial capability, according to DOD  officials. At that time the Army did not develop a geographically  dispersed DOD ABIS back-up capability, and it has not subsequently  developed such a capability because of anticipated costs and the  assumption that the existing back-up system suffices, according to  DOD officials. However, DOD officials stated that the Army has an  opportunity to consider the pros and cons of developing a  geographically dispersed capability as part of the DOD ABIS follow-on  system acquisition program. For example, one of the options under  consideration entails transitioning DOD ABIS\u2019s data to a virtual cloud  format. According to DOD officials, doing so could reduce the  operational risk associated with having limited geographic dispersal.", "DOD\u2019s contractors face challenges in hiring and retaining  qualified personnel to operate and maintain DOD ABIS. DOD  ABIS\u2019s operational risk is exacerbated by DFBA\u2019s challenges in hiring  and retaining qualified personnel to operate and maintain the system.  DFBA\u2019s Biometrics Operations Division is responsible for managing  DOD ABIS\u2019s day-to-day operations and uses contractors to support  several services, including information technology security, staffing an  around-the-clock watch desk to support warfighter requirements, and  providing latent fingerprint examiners to adjudicate potential  fingerprint matches when automated determinations are not definitive,  according to officials. However, DFBA officials stated that its  contractors have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining staff for  these functions because the current support contracts were issued  using a lowest-price technically acceptable source selection  process\u2014that is, awarding contracts to the lowest bidder deemed  technically qualified. This contracting approach limits DOD\u2019s ability to  attract bids from companies with less restrictive compensation,  according to DOD officials. In contrast, a tradeoff contracting  approach permits tradeoffs among cost and non-cost factors and  allows a contract to be awarded to a contractor that is not the lowest  bidder. According to DOD officials, a tradeoff approach could enhance  the quality of contract offers and improve contractor hiring and  retention through better compensation. According to DOD acquisition  officials, a lowest-price technically acceptable approach should be  used for basic services, such as sanitation and landscaping, and not  for technical, highly-skilled services, such as information technology  security and latent fingerprint examination.", "DFBA pursued a tradeoff approach for its DOD ABIS mission-critical  functions, but a lowest- price technically acceptable approach was  settled upon by Army Contracting Command, according to DFBA and  Army Contracting Command officials. Specifically, DFBA\u2019s inability to  attain a tradeoff approach was caused by difficulty in completing  required documentation, such as detailed job position descriptions, in  a timely manner, despite DFBA\u2019s and Army Contracting Command\u2019s  combined efforts.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for 2017 directs DOD to avoid  the use of lowest- price technically acceptable selection criteria to  acquire knowledge-based professional services such as information  technology, cybersecurity, systems engineering, and technical  assistance to the maximum extent practicable. Although the current  DOD ABIS support contracts pre-date the passage of the Act,  USD(AT&L) and DFBA officials stated that daily operation and  maintenance of DOD ABIS are considered knowledge-based  professional services that require highly skilled personnel to perform  and therefore, consistent with the Act, the department should consider  pursuing a tradeoff contracting approach when it is practicable to do  so, such as during future contract solicitations. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the importance of  recruiting, developing, and retaining competent personnel. DFBA\u2019s  ability to provide timely and authoritative match/no-match responses  to U.S. forces engaged in ongoing operations might be negatively  affected if its contractors cannot hire and retain sufficient numbers of  highly skilled personnel to operate and maintain DOD ABIS\u2019s mission- critical functions."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Implemented Almost All of Our Prior Biometric- and Forensic-related Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In our prior reports on DOD\u2019s biometric and forensic activities issued  since 2011, we made 16 recommendations to enhance the biometric and  forensic enterprises. As of May 2017, DOD had implemented 15 of the 16  recommendations and was making progress toward implementing the  remaining recommendation, as shown in table 3. The 15 closed  recommendations and additional steps DOD has taken since they were  closed are summarized in appendix IV.", "In March 2011 we found that a biometric collection device used primarily  by the Army did not meet DOD-adopted standards; and that DOD did not  have a finalized biometric information-sharing agreement with the  Department of Homeland Security; and we identified concerns that DOD  ABIS might be unable to meet the search demands of non-DOD biometric  systems. We made five recommendations addressing DOD\u2019s process  and policies for updating and testing collection devices and improving  information-sharing across federal agencies. DOD has implemented each  of these recommendations. For example, in January 2016 DOD updated  its biometric directive that, among other things, now assigns responsibility  for ensuring that its biometric-related systems conform to federal  standards. In addition, in January 2016 the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security, in coordination with  the Department of Homeland Security, updated guidance to further  improve the sharing of biometric, biographical, and identity-management  data between the two departments for screening and identity-verification  purposes.", "In April 2012 we found that biometric training for leaders did not provide  instruction on the effective use of biometrics; several factors during the  data transmission process limited the use of biometrics in Afghanistan;  and requirements did not exist for DOD to disseminate biometric lessons  learned across the department. We made seven recommendations to  address these findings, six of which the department has implemented. For  example, between February 2015 and January 2017 DOD approved 25  new universal joint tasks that relate to biometric and forensic training.  This action is one of the first steps DOD must take in order to  institutionalize biometric-related training and education to support its  operational requirements. With respect to the recommendation that is not  implemented, DOD officials told us that the department is taking actions  to address several data transmission factors that hindered the Army\u2019s and  Marine Corps\u2019 ability to identify (and capture) enemy combatants in  Afghanistan in a timely manner. These factors include mountainous  terrain, competing demands for communications infrastructure, and  delays in updating hand-held biometric collection devices with the most  current biometrically enabled watchlist. During this review, USD(AT&L)  and military service officials told us that these data transmission factors  will be analyzed and potentially addressed through the DOD ABIS follow- on system acquisition program and the CENTCOM Near Real Time  Identity Operations solution. We believe that these actions will address  the intent of our 2012 recommendation. DOD officials also stated that  they have improved the reliability and responsiveness of DOD ABIS.  From fiscal years 2014 through 2016, DOD ABIS was available more than  98 percent of the time, excluding brief scheduled periods of unavailability  for system updates and planned maintenance actions. Additionally, in  fiscal year 2016 DOD ABIS\u2019s average match/no-match response time  was generally between 1 and 11 minutes, depending on the prioritization  level assigned to the biometric submission.", "In June 2013 we found that DOD\u2019s draft forensic strategic plan was  missing important elements such as milestones and metrics to gauge  progress; that USD(AT&L) had not reviewed and evaluated military  service and SOCOM budget estimates, as required by DOD\u2019s forensic  directive; and that DOD had not provided guidance to the military services  on how they were to collect and report forensic budget data to  USD(AT&L). We made four recommendations addressing DOD\u2019s  forensic strategic plan and the review and evaluation of forensic budget  estimates. DOD has implemented each of these recommendations. For  example, DOD issued a forensic enterprise strategy in March 2015 and a  supporting implementation plan in September 2015. The strategic plan  and implementation plan, when viewed together, contain several  important elements for effective strategic planning, including goals,  milestones, and metrics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD relies on its deployable biometric and forensic capabilities to support  a range of military operations, including the identification and targeting of  enemy combatants and terrorists. Since 2011 DOD has made  considerable progress in institutionalizing these capabilities, the majority  of which were developed through rapid acquisition processes and funded  with OCO funds to meet urgent and emergent warfighter needs in Iraq  and Afghanistan. For example, DOD has validated a number of non- materiel and materiel enduring requirements, and several of the resulting  capabilities have transitioned, or are in the process of transitioning, from  OCO to base funding. Furthermore, DOD has implemented almost all of  our prior biometric- and forensic-related recommendations that we believe  are consistent with the department\u2019s efforts to institutionalize its  deployable biometric and forensic capabilities. However, DOD\u2019s  continued success could be diminished by gaps in strategic planning  documents and acquisition management challenges. Specifically, without  a current biometric strategic plan and supporting implementation plan,  DOD is not well positioned to prioritize and focus enterprise-wide  activities. Furthermore, without a milestone decision authority to oversee  DOD\u2019s development of a Near Real Time Identity Operations solution,  and a disposition analysis to recommend a path forward, DOD risks  facing continued cost, schedule, and performance issues. Lastly, the  ability of DOD ABIS to support future warfighter needs could be adversely  impacted by not having a geographically dispersed back-up capability and  challenges in hiring and retaining qualified personnel to operate and  maintain the system. Addressing these strategic planning and acquisition  management challenges will help DOD sustain the progress it has made  toward establishing enduring deployable biometric and forensic  capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance enterprise-wide biometric strategic planning, we recommend  that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics take the following two actions:  1.

We did not assess digital; multimedia; cyber; or chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear forensic requirements and  capabilities.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has validated enduring  requirements for deployable biometric and forensic capabilities since  2011, we identified and analyzed non-materiel requirements documents  drafted by the Army, as DOD\u2019s executive agent for biometrics and  forensics, and validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council;  and compared them to DOD\u2019s requirements validation process. We met  with officials from the Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA)  and the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command to obtain greater  specificity on the objective of each non-materiel requirement. We also  identified biometric and forensic materiel requirements by analyzing  relevant Office of the Secretary of Defense, military service, and  combatant command strategies, plans, acquisition and sustainment  documents, as well as written responses to question sets provided to  each of the geographic combatant commands through the Joint Staff.  This included reviewing and assessing the Army\u2019s 2015 analysis of  alternatives and 2016 draft capability production document for DOD\u2019s  authoritative biometric database to identify key performance requirements  for the department\u2019s follow-on biometric database. We discussed the  materiel biometric and forensic requirements with Joint Staff, military  service, combatant command, and DFBA officials responsible for  requirements planning and oversight to understand the requirements  validation process for materiel solutions.
