At the end of 1996, people on the waiting list for a transplant numbered 50,047. The supply of organs, however, has not kept pace with the increasing number of transplant candidates, continuing to widen the gap between transplant demand and organ supply. With the passage in 1984 of the National Organ Transplant Act, the Congress sought to increase the organ supply. The number of cadaveric organ donors increased 33 percent between 1988 and 1996\u2014from 4,083 to 5,416 annually, although not enough to meet the demand. More dramatically, the number of organs transplanted from cadaveric donors rose from 10,964 to 16,802 in the same time period.", "Organ procurement organizations (OPO) play a crucial role in procuring and allocating organs. OPOs provide all the services necessary in a geographical region for coordinating the identification of potential donors, requests for donation, and recovery and transport of organs. OPOs work with the medical community and the public through professional education and public awareness efforts to encourage cooperation in and acceptance of organ donation. Although they have similar responsibilities, OPOs vary widely in the geographic size and demographic composition of their service areas as well as in number of hospitals, transplant centers, and patients served. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) administers section 1138 of the Social Security Act, which requires, among other things, that (1) the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) designate one OPO per service area and (2) OPOs meet standards and qualifications to receive payment from Medicare and Medicaid. Section 371(b)(3)(B) of the Public Health Service Act provides that an OPO should \u201cconduct and participate in systematic efforts, including professional education, to acquire all usable organs from potential donors.\u201d", "HCFA regulations set performance standards for OPOs. These standards assess OPOs according to their achieving numerical goals in five categories based on 1 million population in the OPO service area. The five categories include number of (1) organ donors; (2) kidneys recovered; (3) kidneys transplanted; (4) extrarenal organs, that is, hearts, livers, pancreata, and lungs recovered; and (5) extrarenal organs transplanted. HCFA assesses OPOs\u2019 adherence to the standards and qualifications every 2 years. Each OPO must meet numerical goals in four of the five categories to be recertified by HCFA as the OPO for a particular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payment. Without HCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate. In 1996, HCFA assessed OPOs for the first time using the population-based standard with 1994 and 1995 procurement and transplant data.", "You raised concerns about whether the HCFA population-based standard appropriately measures the extent to which OPOs are maximizing their ability to identify, procure, and transplant organs and tissue. This report responds to your request that we (1) determine the strengths and weaknesses of the current standard and (2) identify and assess alternatives to the current standard.", "To conduct this study, we interviewed HCFA headquarters and regional officials and an official with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Division of Transplantation. We also interviewed representatives of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO) and the American Congress for Organ Recovery and Donation. We met with representatives of several OPOs and the Partnership for Organ Donation. We reviewed and analyzed relevant documents and data and identified alternative measures that we used to rank OPO performance using 1994 and 1995 data. We conducted our work between March and October 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (App. I further describes the scope and methodology for this report.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Although the number of donors is not growing as quickly as the demand for organs, the number of donors has steadily increased since 1988. The major reason for this increase is because many more older people are becoming organ donors than in the past. Nearly two-thirds of cadaveric donors were between the ages of 18 and 49 in 1988, but, by 1996, only about one-half of donors were in this age group. The proportion of donors aged 50 and older doubled from about 12 percent in 1988 to about 26 percent in 1996. Another reason for the increase in donors is because more minorities are consenting to donate organs. Between 1988 and 1996, the percentage of organ donors who belonged to racial and ethnic minority groups increased from about 16 to 23 percent.", "The organ donation process usually begins at a hospital when a patient is identified as a potential organ donor. Only those patients pronounced brain dead are considered for organ donation. Most organ donors either die from nonaccidental injuries, such as a brain hemorrhage, or accidental injuries, such as a motor vehicle accident. Other causes of death appropriate for organ donation are drowning, gunshot or stab wound, or asphyxiation.", "Once a potential organ donor has been identified, a staff member of either the hospital or the OPO typically contacts the deceased\u2019s family, which then has the opportunity to donate the organs. If the family consents to donation, OPO staff coordinate the rest of the organ procurement activities, including recovering and preserving the organs and arranging for their transport to the hospital where the transplant will be performed.", "One donor may provide organs to several different patients. Each cadaveric donor provides an average of three organs. In 1996, OPOs procured kidneys from 93 percent of organ donors and livers from 82 percent of them; other organs were procured at lower rates (see fig. 1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Role of OPOs", "paragraphs": ["The national system of 63 OPOs currently in operation coordinates the retrieval, preservation, transportation, and placement of organs. For Medicare and Medicaid payment purposes, HCFA certifies that an OPO meets certain criteria and designates it as the only OPO for a particular geographic area. OPOs must meet service area and other requirements. As of January 1, 1996, each OPO must meet at least one of the following service area requirements: 1. Include an entire state or official U.S. territory. 2. Either procure organs from an average of at least 24 donors per calendar year in the 2 years before the year of redesignation or request and receive an exception to this requirement. 3. If it operates exclusively in a noncontiguous U.S. state, territory, or commonwealth, procure organs at the rate of 50 percent of the national average of all OPOs for both kidneys procured and transplanted per million population. 4. If it is a new entity, demonstrate that it can procure organs from at least 50 potential donors per calendar year.", "In addition, each OPO must have a board of directors or an advisory board with the authority to recommend policies on donating, procuring, and distributing organs. The board must have a transplant surgeon from each transplant center in the OPO\u2019s service area and representation from hospital administrations, tissue banks, voluntary health associations, and either intensive care or emergency room personnel, the public, and physicians or people skilled in human histocompatibility and neurology.", "OPOs must also meet other requirements. Among these, an OPO must be a nonprofit entity and have accounting and other procedures to ensure its fiscal stability. It must also have the appropriate staff and equipment to obtain organs from donors in its service area and have working relationships with at least 75 percent of the hospitals in its service area that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. OPOs must also conduct systematic efforts to acquire all usable organs from potential donors. Furthermore, OPOs must have arrangements to cooperate with tissue banks to ensure that they obtain all usable tissues from donors.", "To ensure the fair distribution and safety of organs, OPOs must have a system to equitably allocate organs to transplant patients. OPOs must also arrange for appropriate tissue typing of organs and ensure that donor screening and testing for infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are performed.", "OPOs use a variety of methods for increasing donation such as raising public awareness of organ donation and developing relationships with hospitals. The goal of public education is to promote the consent process, giving people the information they need to make decisions about organ and tissue donation and encouraging them to share their decisions with their families. Such public education campaigns include mass media advertising; presentations to schools, churches, civic organizations, and businesses; and informational displays in motor vehicle offices, city and town halls, public libraries, pharmacies, and physician and attorney offices.", "The racial and ethnic makeup of an OPO\u2019s service area can affect its ability to procure organs because minority families often do not consent to organ donation. One study found that African American families\u2019 refusal rate for organ donation was 60 percent compared with 29 percent for white families. Organ donation among minority populations, however, has increased over time. For example, African Americans accounted for 8.9 percent of organ donors in 1988 and 12 percent in 1996. The OPOs realize the need to emphasize organ donation by minorities and are focusing on increasing donation by minority populations. To help increase minority donation, OPOs have staff sensitive to the needs of and accepted by the minority population to conduct outreach and request donations and have established ethnic task forces. These efforts have increased the number of minority organ donors. (See fig. 2.)", "In addition, education efforts help hospital staff clarify organ and tissue recovery policies to ensure that potential donors are consistently recognized and referred. Such activities as educating staff both in seminars and informally and featuring hospital newsletter articles about organ donation help OPOs educate hospital staff.", "OPOs also conduct hospital development activities to build strong relationships with service area hospitals to promote organ donation. OPOs try to have representatives at their larger hospitals so that they can facilitate donation when a potential donor becomes available. In addition, OPOs encourage hospital staff to get involved in the organ donation process through such activities as post-donor recovery conferences to brief staff on the results of transplantations, inform them of recipients\u2019 status, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the organ recovery process. Most OPOs, as part of their hospital development activities, conduct medical records reviews to determine their procurement process\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and to share data on missed potential donors and donation consent rates with donor hospitals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Identified Potential Donors Do Not Become Organ Donors", "paragraphs": ["Many potential donors referred to OPOs do not meet OPO acceptance criteria; for others, the donors\u2019 families do not consent to donation. In addition, sometimes after donation consent is obtained, doctors find that potential donors have diseases or physical conditions that make their organs unusable. As figure 3 shows, a high proportion of potential donors do not become organ donors. These data, from an AOPO annual survey of member OPOs, indicate that in 1995 about two-thirds of patients identified as potential donors were eliminated either because the family refused consent or because the donor was ultimately judged to be unsuitable for such reasons as HIV or hepatitis infection or poor condition of the organs upon inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA\u2019s OPO Oversight Role", "paragraphs": ["HCFA\u2019s regional offices oversee the entire OPO certification process.Regional offices handle the OPO application process, conduct on-site reviews of OPOs, redesignate or terminate OPOs, and settle OPO territory disputes.

HCFA has recently reorganized the headquarters staff, however, and assigned overseeing OPO performance to the Division of Integrated Delivery Systems within the Center for Health Plans and Providers and the Clinical Standards Group in the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality.

Starting on January 1, 1996, OPOs were required to achieve at least 75 percent of the national mean in four of the five performance categories averaged over the 2 calendar years before the year of redesignation. During the 1996 transition period, OPOs meeting numerical goals in three of the five categories were recertified if they submitted an acceptable corrective action plan to increase organ donation. Recertification was granted to five OPOs that met numerical goals in three categories and submitted corrective action plans. In addition, five OPOs met goals in fewer than three categories, failing the performance standard. Of these OPOs, adjacent OPOs took over the service areas of two and a portion of the third\u2019s. The fourth OPO merged operations with another OPO, and the fifth, determined to be a new entity, was exempt from meeting the performance standard. Recent legislation allows HCFA to change the cycle time from 2 to 4 years for OPOs meeting the standard during the previous cycle. The five performance categories for which OPOs must achieve numerical goals based on 1 million population in the OPO service area are number of actual organ donors; kidneys recovered; kidneys transplanted; extrarenal organs (heart, liver, lung, and pancreas) recovered; and extrarenal organs transplanted.", "HCFA may grant exceptions from its performance standard for OPOs operating exclusively outside the contiguous United States such as in a U.S. territory or commonwealth. Because distance from the U.S. mainland can make transporting organs difficult, the procurement rate for such areas tends to be lower. OPOs typically do not recover organs unless they can identify suitable recipients.

Furthermore, the population data can be adjusted to account for hospitals that deal with OPOs outside the designated OPO service area. Another reason HCFA chose population data is that OPOs pay little if anything for these data and they are relatively easy to obtain. HCFA officials also said that the organ procurement industry, mainly AOPO, agreed with using a population-based standard.", "In addition, HCFA officials said that population, unlike other measures, such as number of deaths, would not pose a disadvantage for OPOs serving urban areas. Although urban areas may be more likely to have more violent deaths than other areas, the higher incidence of HIV and other diseases would limit the number of donors. In comparing the use of population data with other alternatives, HCFA officials believe that OPOs failing to meet a population-based standard would likely fail to meet other standards such as ones based on the number of service area deaths."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Population Data Were Not Timely", "paragraphs": ["In the last performance cycle, HCFA allowed OPOs to use either 1990 or 1992 census data to count their service area populations.

The northeast and midwest states\u2019 population increased by 1.2 and 2.9 percent, while the southern and western states\u2019 population increased by about 6.1 and 7.7 percent, respectively.

Age and disease, for example, influence the acceptability of individuals as organ donors. These characteristics vary by region and by OPO and can pose advantages or disadvantages to an OPO\u2019s ability to procure donors.", "About 72 percent of cadaveric organ donors in 1994 and 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 64. Although this age group constitutes 61 percent of the nation\u2019s overall population, among the states and the District of Columbia, this group constitutes from about 56 to 66 percent. Not considering other demographic factors, OPO service areas with proportionately fewer individuals between the ages of 18 and 64 may have a disadvantage in procuring organs. Conversely, OPOs with a greater proportion of individuals in this age group may have an advantage in procuring organs over other OPOs because a greater proportion of their population would be eligible to become organ donors.", "The rate of diseases, such as HIV, also varies by region, and HIV-infected individuals are not acceptable as organ donors. Annual rates of AIDS ranged from a low of 2.8 cases per 100,000 population in South Dakota to a high of 246.9 cases per 100,000 population in the District of Columbia in 1994.

The rates of these accidents in an OPO\u2019s service area can pose an advantage or a disadvantage to an OPO\u2019s ability to procure donors.
