Initially, an employee files his or her appeal at one of MSPB\u2019s regional or field offices. The appeal is then to be heard and decided by an administrative judge. The decision becomes final in 35 days unless one of the parties to the appeal files a petition for review to the board members or MSPB reopens the appeal on its own motion. In such cases, the petition for review is to be processed at MSPB headquarters. The board members\u2019 decision constitutes the final administrative action unless the appeal involves allegations of discrimination, in which case the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may become involved. An employee who is dissatisfied with the board members\u2019 final decision may appeal it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or, if allegations of discrimination are involved, bring the case before a U.S. district court.", "MSPB\u2019s three-member bipartisan Board consists of a chairman, a vice chairman, and a member, all of whom are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate to serve overlapping, nonrenewable 7-year terms.", "MSPB\u2019s fiscal year 1994 appropriation was $24.7 million.

The results of our survey can be projected to the populations from which the survey respondents were selected. We analyzed MSPB\u2019s case processing performance reports to determine whether MSPB met its case processing guidelines at the regional and headquarters levels in fiscal years 1991 through 1994. Additionally, we analyzed data on the extent to which MSPB\u2019s final decisions were appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the court\u2019s disposition of these appeals.", "To determine what accountability mechanisms MSPB had in place to provide its employees the merit system protections that MSPB was created to uphold, we reviewed the agency\u2019s EEO and internal oversight activities designed to protect its employees against workplace discrimination, mismanagement, abuse, and improper personnel practices. In doing so, we reviewed MSPB\u2019s EEO policy, procedures, and processes and compared its provisions for internal oversight to those of 10 other federal entities that are roughly comparable to MSPB in budget and staff size. Further, we developed and mailed a questionnaire to all MSPB employees as of May 12, 1994, asking for their views on selected aspects of the agency\u2019s EEO operations and internal oversight activities (see app. II).", "To determine what actions MSPB had taken to foster a work environment that is based on trust, respect, and fairness, we interviewed MSPB\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, EEO director, and members of a task force charged with proposing actions for implementing MSPB\u2019s 1992 vision statement. Further, our MSPB employee questionnaire asked employees for their views on how successful their agencies had been in fostering such an environment (see app. II). We compared MSPB employees\u2019 views of their work environment to those reported by federal employees in a 1992 OPM governmentwide survey.", "More information on our scope and methodology is presented in appendix III.", "MSPB\u2019s chairman provided us written comments on a draft of this report by letter dated July 14, 1995.

As shown in table 1, the percentages varied among the practitioner groups. For example, the responses from agency general counsels were the most favorable: 89 percent of the general counsels responding to our survey believed MSPB has been very or generally successful in accomplishing its mission; none of these respondents believed MSPB has been very or generally unsuccessful. By comparison, the responses from union officials were the least favorable: 45 percent of the union officials expressing an opinion indicated that MSPB has been very or generally successful in accomplishing its mission, while 23 percent indicated that it has been very or generally unsuccessful.", "The responses from the practitioner groups reflect a general view that MSPB has been fair in processing federal employee appeals at the regional and headquarters levels. As shown in table 2, the percentage of respondents who indicated that MSPB\u2019s appellate process at the regional level was almost always or generally fair ranged from a high of 93 percent among agency general counsels to a low of 59 percent among union officials. The percentage of respondents who viewed the process at the regional level as very or generally unfair ranged from a low of 0 percent among agency general counsels and employee and labor-management relations representatives to a high of 26 percent among union officials.", "As for the fairness of MSPB\u2019s appellate process at the headquarters level, table 3 shows that the percentage of respondents indicating that the process was almost always or generally fair ranged from a high of 95 percent among employee and labor-management relations representatives to a low of 46 percent among private attorneys. The percentage of respondents indicating that the appellate process at the headquarters level was very or generally unfair ranged from a low of 0 percent among agency general counsels to a high of 29 percent among private attorneys.", "Another measure of MSPB\u2019s fairness in processing employee appeals is the rate at which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has affirmed MSPB\u2019s final decisions. As shown in table 4, during the 4-year period ending September 1994, 1,422 MSPB final decisions were appealed to the court and adjudicated on the merits. Of that amount, 1,287 cases (91 percent) were affirmed, while 116 cases (8 percent) were either reversed (3 percent) or remanded (5 percent) to MSPB for further processing.", "According to a recognized expert on the administrative redress system for federal employees, the affirmation rate of MSPB\u2019s decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is much higher than the rate at which other federal circuits affirm the decisions of other federal administrative tribunals.", "Guidelines for the length of time MSPB should take to process cases differ at the regional and headquarters levels. Guidelines at the regional level stipulate that cases be processed in no more than 120 days. This guideline was imposed by MSPB itself and is identical to the time limit in the statute (5 U.S.C. 7702(a)(1)) requiring MSPB to decide appeals that involve allegations of discrimination within 120 days of the filing of the appeal. At the headquarters level, cases are to be processed within 110 days. This guideline also is self-imposed; the chairman explained that the 110-day guideline at the headquarters level represents a goal to strive toward rather than a hard and fast requirement for processing petitions for review (PFR). Further, MSPB\u2019s written policy states that \u201cit will attempt to complete action on petitions for review of initial decisions within 110 days.\u201d", "Over the 4-year period ending September 1994, the regional offices took an average of 78 days to process initial employee appeals and almost always met their 120-day case processing guideline. Most survey respondents were either very satisfied or generally satisfied with the actual amount of time MSPB took to process cases at the regional level (see app. I, question 22). Satisfaction with actual processing time ranged from 87 percent for employee and labor-management relations representatives to 67 percent for agency general counsels. Dissatisfaction with processing time among the five practitioner groups ranged from a high of 18 percent for agency general counsels to a low of 7 percent for agency attorneys and representatives. As shown in table 5, of the initial appeals processed at the regional office level in fiscal years 1991 through 1994, 3 percent, on average, were not processed within the 120-day guideline.", "During the same 4-year period, headquarters took an average of 170 days to process PFR cases. Although headquarters met its guideline less often than the regional offices met theirs, its processing time had been improving until fiscal year 1994. Most survey respondents were very or generally satisfied with the actual processing time at headquarters (see app. I, question 26). Satisfaction with actual processing time ranged from 68 percent for the agency attorneys and representatives to 44 percent for agency general counsels. Dissatisfaction among the five practitioner groups with actual processing time at the headquarters level ranged from a high of 31 percent for private attorneys and agency general counsels to a low of 20 percent for agency attorneys and representatives. As shown in table 6, the percentage of PFR cases processed within the 110-day guideline at the headquarters level over the 4-year period steadily increased from 52 percent in fiscal year 1991 to 78 percent in fiscal year 1993, but it dropped to 61 percent in fiscal year 1994.", "According to an MSPB headquarters official, the decline during 1994 in the percentage of PFR cases decided within 110 days was caused by an increase in workload due to Postal Service reorganization cases. Also, the chairman cited two additional reasons for the drop in the fiscal year 1994 PFR processing time: a conscious effort by headquarters to reduce the backlog of PFR cases over 1 year old and a decrease in staff occurring simultaneously with an increase in PFR caseload.", "In explaining the generally longer headquarters processing times, an MSPB official cited the complexity of cases reaching the PFR stage and the fact that individual cases may have been kept pending for various reasons, such as related cases being held to allow MSPB to decide a lead case. Also, cases have been held because they involved issues under consideration by the courts or because the contending parties failed to provide necessary information within the 110-day period. Further, according to the MSPB official, complex cases occasionally take more than 110 days because they require more time for research, analysis, and drafting, and for a majority of the board members to agree on a decision.", "MSPB recently expanded its commitment to improving the appellate process by further encouraging the settlement of appeals. In June 1994, in accordance with National Performance Review (NPR) recommendations encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, MSPB established a program to help parties resolve their disputes at the PFR level. From June 1994 through the end of September 1994, MSPB headquarters settlement attorneys attempted to settle 52 cases and succeeded in settling 17 cases\u2014a success rate of 33 percent.

To facilitate implementation of its EEO policy, MSPB has (1) provided EEO training opportunities to supervisors, managers, and EEO staff; (2) evaluated supervisors and managers and rewarded some for their EEO performance; and (3) taken steps to inform employees about the EEO complaint process and their rights under it.", "MSPB\u2019s EEO manual, distributed in April 1994, states that \u201cas part of its commitment to equal opportunity in all management actions and decisions, training will be given to managers, supervisors and other personnel as a way of furthering EEO objectives.\u201d According to an MSPB official, all office directors, managers, and supervisors are responsible for identifying and obtaining the necessary EEO training for themselves, and the EEO director is responsible for ensuring that EEO counselors are knowledgeable of current federal EEO rules and regulations. MSPB training data provided to us showed that during the 2-year period ending September 1993, MSPB managers and supervisors were provided opportunities for training and were encouraged to attend various internal and external EEO training courses. The MSPB training data also showed that 10 of MSPB\u2019s 21 EEO staff, which consists of 2 full-time staff and 19 collateral-duty staff (mostly EEO counselors) received some type of EEO training during the 2-year period.", "In November 1993, the chairman informed MSPB employees of his strong commitment to diversity and equitable treatment in the workplace. To demonstrate his commitment, he established a new performance element under which to review and evaluate employees\u2019 performance in valuing and respecting diversity in the workplace. An MSPB official told us that top management takes its commitment to EEO very seriously, as demonstrated by the fact that only one MSPB manager has received an outstanding rating under the new performance element. MSPB\u2019s senior executives and other managers and supervisory employees are also evaluated on their adherence to EEO and affirmative action principles under the performance element on human resources management.", "To reward EEO performance, MSPB established the Chairman\u2019s Award for Excellence in EEO. An employee is eligible for this award under eight criteria, one of them being whether his or her leadership in achieving EEO goals and objectives serves as a model for others. Since October 1990, three MSPB employees have received the award\u2014one manager and one nonsupervisory employee in January 1992 and another manager in November 1994.", "MSPB\u2019s EEO director told us that MSPB has taken various actions to communicate MSPB\u2019s EEO policy, program, and complaint process to employees and to make them aware of their EEO rights. For example, offices and employees were provided information on the names and locations of the agency\u2019s EEO counselors and special emphasis program managers and on the circumstances under which EEO counseling should be sought. Also, in April 1994, MSPB\u2019s EEO manual was distributed to all MSPB offices for their employees\u2019 reference and use. As shown in table 7, most of the survey respondents indicated that they had received or seen posted information that described MSPB\u2019s EEO program, their EEO rights, and procedures for contacting MSPB\u2019s EEO counselors; less than one-half of the respondents indicated that they had received or seen posted information that described the details of the EEO complaint process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Internal Oversight Policies and Procedures Recently Implemented", "paragraphs": ["MSPB abolished its nonstatutory OIG in February 1994 because of concerns about its effectiveness and efficiency and in accordance with NPR\u2019s governmentwide goal of streamlining agency operations. Since then, MSPB has assigned the former OIG\u2019s internal oversight functions to its OGC. Also, to provide its employees with an avenue for reporting their concerns should they become aware of mismanagement, abuse, or improper personnel practices, MSPB has entered into an oral agreement with USDA\u2019s Inspector General for hotline and investigative services.", "MSPB\u2019s OGC is responsible for planning and directing internal audits of MSPB\u2019s programs and operations. However, OGC is to contract for the actual performance of the audits, either with other agencies through interagency agreements or with private firms. MSPB has contracted with a certified public accounting firm to help develop a 5-year audit plan and to establish procedures for handling the agency\u2019s internal oversight functions. OGC also is responsible for arranging, as necessary, for investigations into allegations of wrongdoing and for coordinating the hotline and investigative services provided by USDA\u2019s Inspector General. Any complaints or allegations received by USDA\u2019s Inspector General hotline are to be forwarded to MSPB\u2019s OGC for appropriate action. USDA\u2019s Inspector General has agreed to provide investigative services to MSPB on an as-needed basis. As of November 1994, USDA\u2019s OIG hotline had received two allegations; both allegations involved complaints about MSPB appellate decisions rather than instances of mismanagement, abuse, or improper personnel practices.", "We found that by placing its oversight functions in a staff office in lieu of an OIG, MSPB is administering these functions in a manner comparable to those of 10 other federal entities we studied of roughly comparable budget and staff size (see app. IV). Like MSPB, 8 of the 10 federal entities we studied do not have their own audit or investigative offices but obtain audit or investigative services through contracts with private firms or agreements with other agencies\u2019 OIGs. Such arrangements do not ensure the same level of objectivity or independence as do statutory inspector general offices. However, if MSPB\u2019s arrangements are implemented as planned, MSPB should be able to comply with federal audit requirements set by the Office of Management and Budget and with investigative requirements set by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency. Since MSPB\u2019s arrangements are new, data on usage and results are not yet available, and it is too early to assess their effectiveness in ensuring that MSPB employees are provided an avenue for reporting their concerns should they become aware of mismanagement, abuse, or improper personnel practices.", "Despite the provisions MSPB has made to protect its employees against workplace discrimination, mismanagement, abuse, and improper personnel practices, a sizeable portion of survey respondents indicated concerns about becoming involved in the processes established for handling EEO complaints and for reporting wrongdoing. About 40 percent of the respondents indicated they would be either uncertain about or unwilling to participate in EEO counseling or to file a formal EEO complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against; the most common reason was fear of reprisal (see app. II, questions 19 through 22). Fifty-one percent of the survey respondents indicated they would be either uncertain about or unwilling to report waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement of which they became aware; the most common reasons were a concern over maintaining anonymity and a fear of retaliation (see app. II, questions 24 and 25)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Employees Described the MSPB Workplace as Impartial, but Perceptions Varied Among Groups", "paragraphs": ["As shown in figure 1, nearly two-thirds of the MSPB employees responding to our survey described the work environment as impartial.

Sixty-nine (29 percent) of the MSPB employees responding to our survey suggested various actions for MSPB top management to take to further promote an impartial work environment. Employees\u2019 suggestions generally related to promoting more diversity in management; treating everyone fairly; making promotion and hiring decisions only on the basis of merit and not on such factors as race, gender, or political affiliation; and providing counseling and training to supervisors who are repeatedly the subject of EEO complaints.", "Regarding actual numbers of EEO cases, our analysis of MSPB data on the EEO complaint process showed that during the 5-year period ending September 1994, 34 employees received EEO counseling, and 10 employees filed a total of 21 formal EEO complaints. We have no basis on which to infer from these numbers the extent to which MSPB has been effective in establishing a fair and impartial workplace.", "We recognize that the responses of MSPB employees to our survey represent perceptions rather than proven instances of discrimination or indicators of wrongdoing going unreported. Nevertheless, we believe the fact that, overall, 24 percent of MSPB employees view their workplace as discriminatory, and that 45 percent of the agency\u2019s minority employees concur, should be of concern to the agency because of (1) its role as protector of the merit system; and (2) the standard it set for itself in its 1992 vision statement, \u201cTo promote and protect, by deed and example, the Federal merit principles in an environment of trust, respect and fairness.\u201d We believe that in light of MSPB\u2019s mission and the standard adopted in its vision statement, it is important that MSPB\u2019s own employees feel confident that they are fairly treated regardless of their race, religion, color, sex, national origin, political affiliation, marital status, disability, or age."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Employees\u2019 Perceptions Varied Regarding MSPB\u2019s Efforts to Foster an Environment of Trust, Respect, and Fairness", "paragraphs": ["In November 1992, MSPB announced as its vision, \u201cTo promote and protect, by deed and example, the Federal merit principles in an environment of trust, respect and fairness.\u201d Although the vision statement was developed and adopted prior to the current chairman\u2019s appointment, he supports it, according to MSPB officials.

OPM\u2019s survey also showed that although 30 percent believed their organizations treated all employees equally regardless of position or rank, 47 percent did not.
