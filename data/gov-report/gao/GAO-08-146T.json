Many cite positive outcomes associated with specific types of residential treatment. There are also allegations regarding the abuse and death of youth enrolled in residential treatment programs. Given concerns about these allegations, particularly in reference to private programs, the Committee asked the General Accountability Office (GAO) to (1) verify whether allegations of abuse and death at residential treatment programs are widespread and (2) examine the facts and circumstances surrounding selected closed cases where a teenager died while enrolled in a private program. To achieve these objectives, GAO conducted numerous interviews and examined documents from closed cases dating as far back as 1990, including police reports, autopsy reports, and state agency oversight reviews and investigations.

Allegations included reports of abuse and death recorded by state agencies and the Department of Health and Human Services, allegations detailed in pending civil and criminal trials with hundreds of plaintiffs, and claims of abuse and death that were posted on the Internet. For example, during 2005 alone, 33 states reported 1,619 staff members involved in incidents of abuse in residential programs. GAO could not identify a more concrete number of allegations because it could not locate a single Web site, federal agency, or other entity that collects comprehensive nationwide data. GAO also examined, in greater detail, 10 closed civil or criminal cases from 1990 through 2004 where a teenager died while enrolled in a private program. GAO found significant evidence of ineffective management in most of the 10 cases, with program leaders neglecting the needs of program participants and staff. This ineffective management compounded the negative consequences of (and sometimes directly resulted in) the hiring of untrained staff; a lack of adequate nourishment; and reckless or negligent operating practices, including a lack of adequate equipment. These factors played a significant role in the deaths GAO examined."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss residential treatment programs  for troubled youth. In the context of this testimony, we are using the term  residential treatment program to refer to entities across the country and  abroad calling themselves wilderness therapy programs, boarding schools,  academies, behavioral modification facilities, and boot camps, among  other names. While some of these programs are funded publicly by state  and local government agencies, others are privately owned and operated.  Private residential treatment programs typically market their services to  the parents of troubled teenagers\u2014boys and girls with a variety of  addiction, behavioral, and emotional problems\u2014and provide a range of  services, including drug and alcohol treatment, confidence building,  military-style discipline, and psychological counseling for illnesses such as  depression and attention deficit disorder.", "Many cite positive outcomes associated with specific types of residential  treatment. There are also allegations regarding the abuse and death of  youth enrolled in residential treatment programs. Given concerns about  these allegations, particularly in reference to private programs, you asked  us to (1) verify whether allegations of abuse and death at residential  treatment programs are widespread and (2) examine the facts and  circumstances surrounding selected closed cases where a teenager died  while enrolled in a private program.", "To verify whether allegations of abuse and death at residential treatment  programs are widespread, we gathered available information about  allegations made over the last 17 years by performing interviews with  relevant experts, reviewing relevant studies and documents, conducting  Internet searches for Web sites making allegations, reviewing data from  the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), and  reviewing relevant state and federal court documents. We were unable to  disaggregate information on public and private programs; consequently,  the information we present includes allegations against both types.", "To select our case studies, we identified numerous closed civil and  criminal cases in which a court was asked to decide whether a private  residential treatment program was responsible for the death of an enrolled  teenager. When identifying our cases, we specifically excluded teenager  deaths at public programs such as state-sponsored foster programs,  juvenile justice programs for delinquent youth, or programs that  exclusively treat psychological disorders or substance abuse in a hospital  setting. We focused on deaths between the years 1990 and 2004 to  illustrate the long-standing issues presented by private residential  treatment programs. We limited our cases to closed cases and, thus,  ongoing cases from the last several years were not included in our work.  We selected these 10 cases based on several factors including victim age,  program location, type of program the victim attended, and date of death.", "We then examined, in more detail, the facts and circumstances of the  death and any related abuse of the victim. To validate the facts and  circumstances of each case, and to the extent possible, we conducted  interviews with related parties, including current and former program staff  and officials, attorneys and law enforcement officials involved in the  cases, and the parents of the victims. Further, we reviewed available  documentation to support the facts of each case including (but not limited  to) marketing materials, police reports, autopsy reports, and state agency  oversight reviews and investigations. In addition, we conducted site visits  at nine residential treatment programs to obtain a firsthand perspective on  how residential treatment programs operate. Five of these nine programs  were related to the still-operational programs discussed in our cases\u2014 either because they were the same program or represented a permutation  of the original program operating under a different name or in a new  location.  Where we obtained financial information about the programs,  we converted this information to 2007 dollars so that the information was  comparable.", "It is important to emphasize that residential treatment programs are  intended to help youth with serious problems\u2014in some cases, these  problems constitute life-threatening addictions and diseases. We did not  attempt to evaluate the benefits of residential treatment programs in  dealing with these serious problems. Moreover, it is not possible to  generalize the results of our investigation as applying to all residential  treatment programs, whether privately or publicly funded. We found it  difficult to obtain an overall picture of the extent of the residential  treatment program industry. For example, while states often regulate  publicly funded programs, a number of states do not license or otherwise  regulate private programs. Because programs determine how to describe  themselves, especially in their marketing materials, there is no standard  definition for \u201cwilderness therapy program,\u201d \u201cboot camp,\u201d or other terms  used to describe the types of programs and facilities considered to be part  of this industry. GAO is completing a comprehensive review of state and  federal oversight of residential treatment programs for youth with  behavioral and emotional challenges and expects to report next year.", "We performed our work from June through September of 2007 in  accordance with the quality standards for investigations set forth by the  President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1990s, hundreds of residential treatment programs and  facilities have been established in the United States by state agencies and  private companies. Many of these programs are intended to provide a less- restrictive alternative to incarceration or hospitalization for youth who  may require intervention to address emotional or behavioral challenges.  As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to obtain an overall picture of the  extent of this industry. According to a 2006 report by the Substance Abuse  and Mental Health Services Administration, state officials identified 71  different types of residential treatment programs for youth with mental  illness across the country. A wide range of government or private entities,  including government agencies and faith-based organizations, can operate  these programs. Each residential treatment program may focus on a  specific client type, such as those with substance abuse disorders or  suicidal tendencies. In addition, the programs provide a range of services,  either on-site or through links with community programs, including  educational, medical, psychiatric, and clinical/mental health services.", "Regarding oversight of residential treatment programs, states have taken a  variety of approaches ranging from statutory regulations that require  licensing to no oversight. States differ in how they license and monitor the  various types of programs in terms of both the agencies involved and the  types of requirements. For example, some states have centralized licensing  and monitoring within a single agency, while other states have  decentralized these functions among three or more different agencies.  There are currently no federal laws that define and regulate residential  treatment programs. However, three federal agencies\u2014the Departments of  Health and Human Services, Justice, and Education\u2014administer programs  that can provide funds to states to support eligible youth who have been  placed in some residential treatment programs. For example, the  Department of Health and Human Services, through its Administration for  Children and Families, administers programs that provide funding to states  for a wide range of child welfare services, including foster care, as well as  improved handling, investigation, and prosecution of youth maltreatment  cases.", "In addition to the lack of a standard, commonly recognized definition for  residential treatment programs, there are no standard definitions for  specific types of programs\u2014wilderness therapy programs, boot camps,  and boarding schools, for instance. For our purposes, we define these  programs based on the characteristics we identified during our review of  the 10 case studies. For example, in the context of our report, we defined  wilderness therapy program to mean a program that places youth in  different natural environments, including forests, mountains, and deserts.  Figure 1 shows images we took near the wilderness therapy programs we  visited.", "According to wilderness therapy program material, these settings are  intended to remove the \u201cdistractions\u201d and \u201ctemptations\u201d of modern life  from teens, forcing them to focus on themselves and their relationships.  Included as part of a wilderness training program, participants keep  journals that often include entries related to why they are in the program  and their experiences and goals while in the wilderness. These journals,  which program staff read, are part of the individual and group therapy  provided in the field. As part of the wilderness experience, these programs  also teach basic survival skills, such as setting up a tent and camp, starting  a fire, and cooking food. Figure 2 is photo montage of living arrangements  for youth enrolled in the wilderness programs we visited.", "Some wilderness therapy programs may include a boot camp element.  However, many boot camps (which can also be called behavioral  modification facilities) exist independently of wilderness training. In the  context of our report, a boot camp is a residential treatment program in  which strict discipline and regime are dominant principles. Some military- style boot camp programs also emphasize uniformity and austere living  conditions. Figure 3 is a photo montage illustrating a boot camp which  minimizes creature comfort and emphasizes organization and discipline.", "A third type of residential treatment program is known as a boarding  school. Although these programs may combine wilderness or boot camp  elements, boarding schools (also called academies) are generally  advertised as providing academic education beyond the survival skills a  wilderness therapy program might teach. This academic education is  sometimes approved by the state in which the program operates and may  also be transferable as elective credits toward high school. These  programs often enroll youth whose parents force them to attend against  their will. The schools can include fences and other security measures to  ensure that youth do not leave without permission. Figure 4 shows some  of the features boarding schools may employ to keep youth in the  facilities.", "A variety of ancillary services related to residential treatment programs  are available for an additional fee in some programs. These services  include:    Referral services and educational consultants to assist parents in  selecting a program.", "Transport services to pick up a youth and bring him or her to the  program. Parents frequently use a transport service if their child is  unwilling to attend the program.", "Additional individual, group, or family counseling or therapy sessions  as part of treatment. These services may be located on the premises or  nearby.", "Financial services, such as loans, to assist parents in covering the  expense of residential treatment programs.", "These services are marketed toward parents and, with the exception of  financial services, are not regulated by the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Widespread Allegations of Abuse and Death at Residential Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["We found thousands of allegations of abuse, some of which involved  death, at public and private residential treatment programs across the  country between the years 1990 and 2007. We are unable to identify a more  concrete number of allegations because we could not locate a single Web  site, federal agency, or other entity that collects comprehensive  nationwide data related to this issue. Although the NCANDS database,  operated by the Department of Health and Human Services, collects some  data from states, data submission is voluntary and not all states with  residential treatment programs contribute information. According to the  most recent NCANDS data, during 2005 alone 33 states reported 1,619 staff  members involved in incidents of abuse in residential programs. Because  of limited data collection and reporting, we could not determine the  numbers of incidents of abuse and death associated with private  programs.", "It is important to emphasize that allegations should not be confused with  proof of actual abuse. However, in terms of meeting our objective, the  thousands of allegations we found came from a number of sources besides  NCANDS. For example:    We identified claims of abuse and death in pending and closed civil or  criminal proceedings with dozens of plaintiffs alleging abuse. For  instance, according to one pending civil lawsuit filed as recently as July  2007, dozens of parents allege that their children were subjected to  over 30 separate types of abuse.", "We found attorneys around the country who represent youth and  groups of youth who allege that abuse took place while these youth  were enrolled in residential treatment programs. For example, an  attorney based in New Jersey with whom we spoke has counseled  dozens of youth who alleged they were abused in residential treatment  programs in past cases, as has another attorney, a retired prosecutor,  who advocates for abuse victims.", "We found that allegations are posted on various Web sites advocating  for the shutdown of certain programs. Past participants in wilderness  programs and other youth residential treatment programs have  individually or collectively set up sites claiming abuse and death. The  Internet contains an unknown number of such Web sites. One site on  the Internet, for example, identifies over 100 youth who it claims died  in various programs. In other instances, parents of victims who have  died or were abused in these programs have similarly set up an  unknown number of Web sites. Conversely, there are also an unknown  number of sites that promote and advocate the benefits of various  programs.", "Because there are no specific reporting requirements or definitions for  private programs in particular, we could not determine what percentage of  the thousands of allegations we found are related to such programs. There  is likely a small percentage of overlapping allegations given our inability to  reconcile information from the sources we used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cases of Death at Selected Residential Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["We selected 10 closed cases from private programs to examine in greater  detail. Specifically, these cases were focused on the death of a teenager in  a private residential treatment program that occurred between 1990 and  2004. We found significant evidence of ineffective management in most of  these 10 cases, with many examples of how program leaders neglected the  needs of program participants and staff. In some cases, program leaders  gave their staff bad advice when they were alerted to the health problems  of a teen. In other cases, program leaders appeared to be so concerned  with boosting enrollment that they told parents their programs could  provide services that they were not qualified to offer and could not  provide. Several cases reveal program leaders who claimed to have  credentials in therapy or medicine that they did not have, leading parents  to trust them with teens who had serious mental or physical disabilities  requiring proper treatment. These ineffective management techniques  compounded the negative consequences of (and sometimes directly  resulted in) the hiring of untrained staff; a lack of adequate nourishment;  and reckless or negligent operating practices, including a lack of adequate  equipment. These specific factors played a significant role in most of the  deaths we examined.", "Untrained staff. A common theme of many of the cases we examined  is that staff misinterpreted legitimate medical emergencies. Rather than  recognizing the signs of dehydration, heat stroke, or illness, staff  assumed that a dying teen was in fact attempting to use trickery to get  out of the program. This resulted in the death of teenagers from  common, treatable illnesses. In some cases, teens who fell ill from less- common ailments exhibited their symptoms for many days, dying  slowly while untrained staff continued to believe the teen was \u201cfaking  it.\u201d Unfortunately, in almost all of our cases, staff only realized that a  teen was in distress when it was already too late.", "Lack of adequate nourishment. In many cases, program philosophy  (e.g., \u201ctough love\u201d) was taken to such an extreme that teenagers were  undernourished. One program fed teenagers an apple for breakfast, a  carrot for lunch, and a bowl of beans for dinner while requiring  extensive physical activity in harsh conditions. Another program forced  teenagers to fast for 2 days. Teenagers were also given equal rations of  food regardless of their height, weight, or other dietary needs. In this  program, an ill teenager lost 20 percent of his body weight over the  course of about a month.  Unbeknownst to staff, the teenager was  simultaneously suffering from a perforated ulcer.", "Reckless or negligent operating practices. In at least two cases,  program staff set out to lead hikes in unfamiliar territory that they had  not scouted in advance. Important items such as radios and first aid  kits were left behind. In another case, program operators did not take  into account the need for an adjustment period between a teenager\u2019s  comfortable home life and the wilderness; this endangered the safety of  one teenager, who suddenly found herself in an unfamiliar  environment. State licensing initiatives attempt, in part, to minimize the  risk that some programs may endanger teenagers through reckless and  negligent practices; however, not all programs we examined were  covered by operating licenses. Furthermore, some licensed programs  deviated from the terms of their licenses, leading states, after the death  of a teen, to take action against programs that had flouted health and  safety guidelines.", "See table 1 for a summary of the cases we examined."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Case One", "paragraphs": ["The victim was a 15-year-old female. Her parents told us that she was a  date-rape victim who suffered from depression, and that in 1990 she  enrolled in a 9-week wilderness program in Utah to build confidence and  improve her self-esteem. The victim and her parents found out about the  program through a friend who claimed to know the owner. The parents of  the victim spoke with the owner of the program several times and  reviewed brochures from the owner. The brochure stated that the  program\u2019s counselors were \u201chighly trained survival experts\u201d and that \u201cthe  professional experience and expertise\u201d of its staff was \u201cunparalleled.\u201d The  fees and tuition for the program cost a little over $20,600 (or about $327  per day).

However, the parents were not informed that the  program was completely new and that their daughter would be going on  the program\u2019s first wilderness trek. Program staff were not familiar with  the area, relied upon maps and a compass to navigate the difficult terrain,  and became lost. As a result, they crossed into the state of Arizona and  wandered onto Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land. According to a  lawsuit filed by her parents, the victim complained of general nausea, was  not eating, and began vomiting water on about the third day of the 5-day  hike. Staff ignored her complaints and thought she was \u201cfaking it\u201d to get  out of the program. Police documents indicate that the two staff members  leading the hike stated that they did not realize the victim was slowly  dehydrating, despite the fact that she was vomiting water and had not  eaten any food.", "On the fifth day of the hike, the victim fell several times and was described  by the other hikers as being \u201cin distress.\u201d It does not appear that staff took  any action to help her. At about 5:45 p.m. on the fifth day, the victim  collapsed in the road and stopped breathing. According to police records,  staff did not call for help because they were not equipped with radios\u2014 instead, they performed CPR and attempted to signal for help using a  signal fire. CPR did not revive the victim; she died by the side of the road  and her body was covered with a tarp. The following afternoon, a BLM  helicopter airlifted her body to a nearby city for autopsy. The death  certificate for the victim states that she died of dehydration due to  exposure. Although local police investigated the death, no charges were  filed. Utah officials wanted to pursue the case, but they did not have  grounds to do so because the victim died in Arizona. The parents of the  victim filed a civil suit and settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.", "Soon after the victim\u2019s death and 6 months after opening, the founder  closed the program and moved to Nevada, where she operated in that state  until her program was ordered to close by authorities there. In a hearing  granting a preliminary judgment that enjoined the operator of the program,  the judge said that he would not shelter this program, which was in effect  hiding from the controls of the adjoining state. He chastised the program  owner for running a money-making operation while trying to escape the  oversight of the state, writing, \u201c wishes to conduct a  wilderness survival program for children for profit, without state  regulation\u201d and she \u201chide the children from the investigating state  authorities and appear uncooperative towards them.\u201d He expressed  further concerns, including a statement that participants in the program  did not appear to be receiving \u201cadequate care and protection\u201d and that  qualified and competent counselors were not in charge of the program.  The judge also noted that one of the adult counselors was \u201can ex-felon and  a fugitive.\u201d After this program closed, the program founder returned to  Utah and joined yet another program where another death occurred 5  years later (this death is detailed in case seven). We found that the founder  of this residential treatment program had a history in the industry\u2014prior  to opening the program discussed in this case, she worked as an  administrator in the program covered in another case (case two).

Several days into the  multiday hike, while camping under permit on BLM land, the victim  refused to return to the campsite after being escorted by a counselor about  200 yards to relieve himself. Two counselors then attempted to lead him  back to the campsite. According to an account of the incident, when he  continued to refuse, they tried to force him to return and they all fell to the  ground together. The two counselors subsequently held the victim face  down in the dirt until he stopped struggling; by one account a counselor  sat on the victim for almost 45 minutes.

The  cause of death was listed as a homicide.", "In September 2000, after the boy\u2019s death, one of the counselors was  charged with criminally negligent homicide. A grand jury subsequently  declined to indict him. The victim\u2019s mother told us that at the grand jury  hearing, she found out from parents of other youth in the program that  they had been charged different amounts of money for the same program,  and that program officials had told them what they wanted to hear about  the program\u2019s ability to meet each of their children\u2019s special needs. In  early 2001, the mother of the victim filed a $1.5 million wrongful death  lawsuit against the program, its parent company, and its president. The  lawsuit was settled in 2002 for an undisclosed amount.", "Due in part to the victim\u2019s death, in early 2002, Oregon implemented its  outdoor licensing requirements.

In an incident unconnected to this  case, the program was also charged with child abuse related to frostbite.  As a result of these complaints, in February of 2002, the program entered  into agreement with the state\u2019s attorney general to modify program  operations and pay a $5,000 fee. The program continued to work with the  State of Oregon throughout 2002 to comply with the agreement.

To identify a suitable school,  the family hired an education consultant who said he was a member of an  educational consultants\u2019 association and that he specialized in matching  troubled teens with appropriate treatment programs. The parents  discussed their son\u2019s personality, medical history (including his previous  suicide attempts), and treatment needs with the consultant.

After cutting himself, the victim  approached a counselor and showed him what he had done, pleading with  the counselor to take the knife away before he hurt himself again. He also  asked the counselor to call his mother and tell her that he wanted to go  home. The counselor spoke with the victim, elicited a promise from him  not to hurt himself again, and gave the knife back. The next evening the  victim hung himself with a cord not far from his tent. Four hours passed  before the program chose to notify the family about the suicide.

The family also learned that the owner and another counselor had  visited their son\u2019s campsite, as previously scheduled, the day he died.  During this visit, field staff told them about the self-inflicted injury and  statements the victim had made the night before.

According to the transcript, the  judge who was assigned to the case pushed the parties not to choose a  bench trial to avoid a lengthy and complicated trial. The program owner  pleaded no contest to the charge of child neglect resulting in death with a  fine of $5,000 in exchange for dismissal of charges. The state conducted an  investigation into the circumstances and initially planned to close the  program. However, the program owners negotiated an agreement with the  state not to shut down the program in exchange for a change of ownership  and management.
