The Department reported that during fiscal year 1997, $43.3 billion in student financial aid was awarded to 8.1 million recipients. Concerns over unreliable data in the Department\u2019s student loan database as well as its ability to effectively manage its student loan programs led the Congress in 1986 to authorize the Secretary of Education to develop a national student loan database. Recognizing the complex nature of its multiple loan and grant programs and the need for good data to ensure program funds are awarded appropriately and loans are repaid promptly, the Department responded by developing the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).", "NSLDS has three main goals: (1) improve the quality and accessibility of student financial aid data, (2) reduce the burden of administering the Department\u2019s student financial aid programs, and (3) minimize fraud and abuse in these programs. The Department intended for NSLDS to be used by schools, lenders, third-party servicers, and guaranty agencies to help determine student eligibility for aid, identify the status of borrowers\u2019 loans, update student information, and serve as an overall financial aid history file on program participants. As of February 1997, the Department requires all schools to use NSLDS to report, confirm, and update enrollment dates and status of borrowers\u2014key information in determining student eligibility for federal aid.", "The need for improved controls in the Department\u2019s student financial aid systems is well documented. In 1995, we reported and testified that the Department had, in general, ineffectively used available student financial aid data to enforce compliance with federal requirements. For example, Department data indicated that approximately 43,500 ineligible students had received more than 58,000 loans, totaling over $138 million. Furthermore, according to data in both the loan and grant systems, more than 101,000 students who had loans and subsequently became ineligible for additional aid may have received more than 139,000 Pell grants totaling approximately $200 million. In July 1997, we found that several schools we visited chose to use paper transcripts to obtain student financial aid histories because they considered NSLDS\u2019 electronic data unreliable. In addition, the Department could not obtain complete, accurate, and reliable FFELP data necessary for reporting on its financial position.", "As a result of continuing concerns about the Department\u2019s ability to improve the reliability and efficiency of student financial aid information and delivery systems and school officials\u2019 concerns about unreliable electronic data, you asked that we report on schools\u2019 use of NSLDS. Specifically, you requested that we (1) determine the extent to and purposes for which schools are using NSLDS; (2) identify any problems these schools are having and the benefits they are getting from using the system; (3) determine why some schools are not using NSLDS; and (4) describe the extent to which the Department is taking or plans to take steps to ensure that schools are fully using NSLDS.", "To respond to your request, we surveyed a random sample of 600 of the nearly 6,200 postsecondary schools that participated in federal student financial aid programs as of August 1997 on their use of NSLDS. (For school responses to our survey, see app. I.) We defined use of NSLDS as accessing its on-line or batch processing functions to perform specific tasks. To focus on school personnel\u2019s direct use of these functional capabilities, we instructed survey respondents not to consider their use of student eligibility information reports generated from the NSLDS database and sent by the Department as accessing NSLDS. Similarly, if schools only used the National Student Loan Clearinghouse to process Student Status Confirmation Reports (SSCR) and did not use any of the system\u2019s other functional capabilities, we did not consider those schools to be NSLDS users. We asked schools to have the person or persons on their staff who are the most knowledgeable in using NSLDS to complete the survey instrument and obtain any needed input from servicers.", "In developing and pretesting our survey instrument, we met with officials from the Department of Education, the contractor responsible for developing and maintaining NSLDS, and representatives from the higher education community. The survey instrument was administered in November 1997; with an 83-percent response rate, our survey results represent the universe of schools. We did not verify data provided by the schools; however, we did examine responses for extreme values and inconsistencies. The results we report are based on experiences reported by schools and reflect the self-assessments of the officials who completed the survey instrument. We did not make judgments about the importance of the tasks or interpret or draw conclusions about the significance of these results or their implications for NSLDS\u2019 implementation. We conducted our review and analyses between May 1997 and July 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (For a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology, see app. II.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Education administers four major student financial aid programs under title IV of HEA: FFELP, the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program (FDLP), the Federal Pell Grant Program, and the Federal Campus-Based Programs. These programs together will make available an estimated $47 billion to about 8 million individuals during the 1998-99 academic year\u2014about 80 percent of it in student loans.", "Schools are responsible for obtaining and evaluating the financial aid history of students to ensure that students are eligible for aid. During our review, we identified 10 tasks inherent to administering federal student aid programs through NSLDS or other methods. These tasks are related to four general processes and functions operational at the time of our survey that the Department made available to schools through NSLDS to help them administer the student financial aid programs more effectively. (See table 1.)", "Once the school determines that a student is eligible, financial aid funds are disbursed to the student according to program requirements.", "To support\u2014as well as monitor\u2014these student loan programs, the Department has developed a number of automated processing systems, including NSLDS. The budget for these systems is expected to be about $378 million for fiscal year 1999. (See app. III for descriptions of the major student financial aid systems.) Prior to NSLDS, the Department relied on a system\u2014commonly referred to as the guaranty agency tape dump\u2014to collect selected information from guaranty agencies on each federal student loan. The tape dump, developed in the late 1970s, was initially intended to be used by the Department primarily as an annual source of data for analysis of program trends. According to the Department, it did not expect that every guaranty agency would have historically collected all the data requested because each agency\u2019s system was designed to meet the needs of that individual guaranty agency. The tape dump, according to the Department, was not designed to be used, for example, to prevent awarding loans to ineligible borrowers.", "Under 1986 HEA amendments, the Secretary of Education was authorized to replace the tape dump and develop a computer system that would make national student loan data accessible to guaranty agencies; however, the Department could not require guaranty agencies to use the database before approving new loans. As a result, planning for the development of the new NSLDS was delayed for several years, when the Department was allowed, under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, to require guaranty agencies to use the system in determining student eligibility.", "The scope of the database expanded when 1992 HEA amendments required the Department to integrate a national student loan database with other financial aid data systems. The 1992 amendments also stated that the Secretary of Education, in establishing a national database, should give priority to providing information on student enrollment and status, current loan holders, and servicers. In response to these legislative mandates, in January 1993, the Department awarded a 5-year, $39 million contract to develop and maintain NSLDS. As of March 1998, the costs for developing, implementing, and maintaining the system have totaled $96.5 million.", "According to the Department, NSLDS contained about 118 million loan and grant records as of February 1998. These records were provided by guaranty agencies for the FFELP loans they guaranteed, by the contractor that services FDLP loans for the Department, and by schools for Pell grants and campus-based aid they awarded. As figure 1 illustrates, a significant portion of data stored in NSLDS\u2014about 70 percent\u2014related to FFELP loans as of March 1998.", "The Department\u2019s student financial aid data systems have suffered from data quality problems. For example, in 1996, the Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found in its review of the September 30, 1992, tape dump that the number of FFELP loans in repayment was overstated by approximately 5.9 million loans. OIG also found that a significant number of loans that were incorrectly recorded in the tape dump remained incorrect in NSLDS, affecting the reliability of the new system. As we reported in 1997, poor quality and unreliable FFELP loan data remain in the Department\u2019s systems, and inaccurate loan data were being entered into NSLDS. As a result, the Department cannot obtain complete, accurate, and reliable FFELP data, which, according to its OIG, hinders the Department\u2019s effort to monitor borrowers and properly award aid to those who are eligible. The Department acknowledges that its student financial aid data systems have suffered from data quality problems and has initiated a number of actions to address data accuracy and integrity issues.", "Regardless of its weaknesses, NSLDS is the most comprehensive departmental database on federal student loans that schools, lenders, and guaranty agencies can use. The Department has stated that it expected NSLDS to significantly reduce schools\u2019 and students\u2019 administrative burden of applying for and accounting for financial aid. With the exception of mid-year transfer students, the Department has not required schools to obtain paper financial aid transcripts since the 1996-97 award year. The Department also envisioned that NSLDS would simplify and enhance the process of updating SSCR information for schools. Prior to NSLDS, schools, for their FFELP loans, received SSCR rosters from every guaranty agency that guaranteed their student loans and had to manually verify and resubmit the rosters to the guaranty agencies. In addition, the Department believes that NSLDS has led to considerable improvements in identifying ineligible student aid recipients. It estimates that since the 1994-95 academic year, for example, NSLDS\u2019 improved default matching capabilities may have prevented over $1 billion from being awarded to ineligible students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schools\u2019 Use of NSLDS\u2019 On-Line and Batch Processing Functions Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Our survey results indicate that a significant proportion\u201442 percent\u2014of the schools participating in federal student financial aid programs were not using NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions, which first became available in November 1994. In addition, of the schools that were using these functions, most were not routinely using them for many of the tasks they were capable of performing.", "Based on our survey results, we estimate that 58 percent of the 6,181 schools participating in student financial aid programs used NSLDS\u2019 on-line or batch processing functions. (See fig. 2.) Of the schools that were not using these functions, they either had the ability to use it and simply had not done so (19 percent) or did not have the ability to use the system (23 percent).", "When we asked schools about their use of NSLDS to accomplish the 10 tasks we identified as inherent to program administration, we found that schools were not routinely using NSLDS for most of them. As shown in figure 3, more than half of the schools rarely or never performed 7 of the 10 tasks using NSLDS.", "The only task that a majority of schools routinely used NSLDS to accomplish was providing or updating SSCR information, which since February 1997, the Department has required schools\u2014or third-party servicers on their behalf\u2014to perform on the system. Specifically, our survey data show that 69 percent of the schools always or most of the time use NSLDS for SSCR processing. An additional 11 percent occasionally use NSLDS for SSCR processing, and another 5 percent rarely use the system for this task. Of the remaining schools\u2014those that never use NSLDS for SSCR processing\u201413 percent process SSCRs through the Clearinghouse or other third-party servicers; the last 2 percent appear not to be meeting the requirement. The schools\u2019 next most common uses of NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions were for correcting or updating student information (33 percent) and determining prior loan defaults (30 percent).", "However, 43 and 47 percent of schools responded that they rarely or never use NSLDS for these two tasks, respectively.", "The reason schools most frequently gave for rarely or never using NSLDS to perform any of the 10 tasks was that they use the Department\u2019s Student Aid Reports (SAR) or Institutional Student Information Records (ISIR).Schools can identify loan status and determine student eligibility from information contained in SAR or ISIR, including prior defaults, types of loans, default dates, and outstanding balances.

As we reported in 1997, some FDLP student loan borrowers have not started to repay their student loans after they are no longer enrolled in school. Reasons given were schools\u2019 failing to report enrollment changes to the Department or the Department\u2019s failing to accurately or promptly record the reported enrollment changes. Failure to record a borrower\u2019s enrollment changes or status may result in borrowers not promptly repaying their student loans or in the loans becoming delinquent, increasing the likelihood of defaulting.", "Although less than 10 percent of the schools found inaccuracies in NSLDS data fields always or most of the time, 7 to 29 percent of the schools occasionally found inaccuracies in these fields.

The Department believes the report should convey such results.", "Our meetings were supplemented by an August 14, 1998, letter from the Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education, which appears at the end of this appendix. Our responses to the comments raised in this letter are provided in the body of the report. Summaries of the comments Department officials provided during our meetings and our responses to these comments follow. 1. The Department said all schools use NSLDS, and that we were incorrect in reporting that almost half of the schools do not use NSLDS at all. In addition to accessing NSLDS through the on-line and batch processing functions, they said all schools (1) routinely use NSLDS for prescreening because the SAR or ISIR data they receive for this purpose are generated by NSLDS and (2) must submit SSCR data to NSLDS regardless of whether they do so themselves or use a servicer, such as the Clearinghouse. When such a servicer provides this service, it submits SSCR data to NSLDS in lieu of the schools doing so directly. Department officials said we failed to point out in our discussion of the 23 percent of schools that do not access the system at all that (1) this is due to limitations or constraints the schools face that are beyond the Department\u2019s control and (2) schools use servicers or a third party to access NSLDS in order to meet SSCR processing requirements or receive ISIRs. The officials believe that the report should have stated that all schools use NSLDS (including those that access NSLDS indirectly) and schools do not need to use batch or on-line functions (except SSCR) if they are satisfied that the information provided by SARs or ISIRs in prescreening meets their needs.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We recognize that all schools use SAR and ISIR data generated by NSLDS and that in this way, all schools use NSLDS. Our review focused on schools\u2019 use of NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions, and we have revised the report to further clarify this focus. As pointed out elsewhere in our report, the topic of NSLDS use was discussed extensively during our study design\u2014with schools, Department officials, and others in the education community. To help school representatives in completing the survey, we explained on page 1 of the instrument that we defined \u201caccess\u201d as on-line and batch processing functions (see app. I).", "With regard to the number of schools we identified that were not accessing NSLDS at all, we have revised the report to clarify that these are schools that do not use the on-line or batch functions either themselves or through a servicer. As figure 8 shows, limitations and constraints at schools were among the more frequently cited reasons given by schools for not having this access. Figure 8 also shows that using servicers and the Clearinghouse for SSCR processing were frequently given as reasons for schools not using NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions. We did not independently obtain evidence on the extent of the Department\u2019s ability to influence these factors and did not draw conclusions about the Department\u2019s role. Our report, however, discusses how the surveyed schools are meeting the SSCR reporting requirement.", "With regard to the Department\u2019s comment that schools may not need on-line and batch processing functions when SAR or ISIR data meet their needs, we did not ask schools for details about their use of these or any other sources of financial aid data for determining student eligibility. It was our intent to find out from schools the extent of their use of NSLDS\u2019 on-line or batch processing capabilities to perform a variety of tasks, such as borrower tracking or updating student information. We did not draw conclusions about the reported level of schools\u2019 use of these capabilities. 2. The Department said that favorable responses we received to the survey instrument were not adequately reported. Department officials believe that there were numerous instances throughout our draft report where we deemphasized favorable results that reflect the majority of schools and emphasized corresponding unfavorable results. They cited as an example a statement in the draft that about one-fourth of schools had problems using NSLDS to correct or update SSCR information, and 20 to 30 percent of schools encountered occasional or frequent inaccuracies in certain data fields. They believe a more accurate portrayal of the survey results would be to state that 75 percent of the schools did not have any problems using NSLDS for SSCR processing and that 70 to 80 percent rarely or never encountered data inaccuracies.", "GAO\u2019s Response: Overall, we believe our draft report reasonably presented the results of our analysis. However, we made minor revisions, where appropriate, to further clarify our objectives and ensure the fairest possible presentation of our results. For example, in our discussion of schools\u2019 views of the training and training materials they received, we added a statement that the Department mailed training materials to every school. However, we decided to continue to focus the reader\u2019s attention on those responses that show the extent to which schools encountered shortcomings in using NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions because we believe it is important to note potential problem areas so the source of the problems may be explored and improvements to the program or operation can be identified. 3. Department officials said that the tone and balance of the draft were not true to the schools\u2019 survey answers. For example, they said we cite a number of previous reports and studies illustrating data problems that they believe are outdated and are not relevant to the objectives of our review. If we feel strongly that these studies should be cited, the officials said we should also report more recent statistics on default matching, as well as numerous increases in the functional uses of NSLDS that have been developed. In addition, they believe the draft did not adequately address the work undertaken or under way to improve the quality of NSLDS data.", "GAO\u2019s Response: Our purpose in discussing prior GAO and OIG audit reports is to provide general background information, establish a historical context and significance for creating NSLDS, and discuss the basis for congressional interest in our review. As Department officials suggested, we have included more recent statistics on the Department\u2019s use of NSLDS for conducting student loan default matches and expanded our discussion about its efforts to improve the quality of student financial aid data. 4. Department officials said that the draft report did not fully discuss the purposes and advantages of NSLDS, and that our treatment of original NSLDS goals needed clarification. They believe that it is important for us to distinguish between the original purpose of NSLDS and current efforts to expand its functionality. They suggested that the report should note that NSLDS was set up as a research database and that the Department is expanding its use to help improve the accuracy and availability of student aid data. More importantly, they said these improvements will ensure better accountability for student financial aid monies.", "GAO\u2019s Response: The report identifies the three main goals of NSLDS as they were presented and distributed to schools in the NSLDS users\u2019 guide. Our study focused on schools\u2019 use of NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions; we did not review the full spectrum of NSLDS\u2019 purposes and functions. The Department\u2019s explanation of these new functions is informative, and it appears that the Department is enhancing NSLDS to take advantage of many of its expanded capabilities. But many of these new functions were either not available to schools at the time we administered our survey instrument, were not related to on-line and batch processing functions, or were not designed to be used by schools. 5. Department officials were concerned about the development and timing of the survey instrument we administered. They said that it is not clear which school official completed the survey and that this is important because different offices in a school may use NSLDS for different purposes. Also, since the instrument was administered in late 1997, they believe some of the results may now be outdated and inaccurate. Finally, they believe that the report should note that the instrument was administered at a time when NSLDS was only 3 years old and that some portion of schools were not using it as a result of the time lags that occur in getting all schools to adapt to and welcome its use.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We made a concerted effort to direct the survey instrument to those school officials who were most knowledgeable about their school\u2019s use of NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions. As discussed in appendix II, before we mailed the survey instrument, we sent a postcard to the student financial aid administrator of each school in our sample asking him or her to provide the name, title, and complete address of the school official who was best suited to complete the survey. About half of the schools provided this information; for those that did not, we mailed the survey to the director of student financial aid. In a letter accompanying the survey instrument, we further requested schools to ensure that those persons most knowledgeable about using NSLDS be involved in responding to the survey instrument.", "The purpose of the survey was to record schools\u2019 use of NSLDS at the time the survey was administered in November 1997, and this is noted in the report. We recognize that not all schools had access to NSLDS when they completed the survey instrument; as our results showed, many schools were still in the process of obtaining access. We would expect that, at this writing, more schools would be accessing NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing functions, but the report is intended to assess schools\u2019 use of NSLDS\u2019 on-line and batch processing capabilities and document the extent of this use at a point in time. We do not, nor did we intend to, draw any conclusions as to whether the level of school use is sufficient or indicative of the long-term utility of NSLDS as an administrative tool for federal student aid programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: Paula Denman and Joan A.
