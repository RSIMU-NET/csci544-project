The program also provides educational benefits to an eligible officer's spouse and children. GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which claimants receive PSOB program benefits and how long the claims process takes, (2) any issues raised by state and local agencies and others who assist claimants in seeking benefits, and (3) the extent to which the PSOB program follows recognized government standards and guidelines for effective program management. To address these objectives, we reviewed PSOB claims that were opened during fiscal years 2006 to 2008 for all three types of claims, reviewed relevant agency documents, and interviewed PSOB program officials, representatives of advocacy organizations, and state and local officials in five selected states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that all education claims and over three-quarters of death claims opened in fiscal years 2006 through 2008 were closed and approved as of April 2009, while only about 31 percent of disability claims initiated during that period had determinations. The majority of disability claims remained pending because they took significantly longer to process than other claims--while education and death claims were generally processed in under a year, disability claims took between 17 and 26 months. GAO was unable to pinpoint which steps of the claims process were most time-consuming because claims files that GAO reviewed did not consistently document the date when claims passed through each step of the process. State and local officials GAO interviewed were generally concerned about their lack of awareness of certain PSOB program benefits, challenges with establishing eligibility, and the perceived long wait time for benefits. Specifically, officials were generally more aware of death than disability and education benefits. Officials also stated that submitting all the necessary paperwork to prove eligibility was difficult and time-consuming due, in part, to how long it took to obtain necessary documents from other organizations. Officials most frequently expressed concern about perceived long wait times for receiving benefits and also reported difficulties obtaining information about claims status. While it is taking steps to improve, the PSOB program does not follow government guidelines for performance monitoring. Specifically, according to Justice officials, the PSOB program has not set strategic goals and measures, monitored performance, or reported results because it is a payment program, and its budget is largely mandatory. However, other federal programs that provide benefits after work-related injury and illness have established performance measures, such as ones for claims-processing timeliness, and report their results publicly. Also, while the PSOB program has initiated several outreach and assistance efforts to claimants and state and local agencies in recent years, these efforts are not monitored, resulting in uncertainty as to whether they are adequate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public safety officers, including law enforcement officers, firefighters, and  emergency medical technicians, are among the first to respond to  potentially dangerous and life-threatening situations, putting themselves at  risk of catastrophic injury or death. The acute dangers these workers can  face have been highlighted in recent years following the terrorist attacks  of September 11, 2001, and the natural disasters of Hurricanes Katrina and  Rita in 2005. Over 1.8 million people have served as public safety officers  since 2006, and this population has averaged about 200 work-related  deaths a year. In appreciation for the service of public safety officers and  in recognition of the potential inadequacy of state and local benefits for  officers and their survivors, Congress established the Public Safety  Officers\u2019 Benefits (PSOB) program in 1976.", "The PSOB program, administered by the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ)  Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), provides three types of benefits:  death, disability, and education. In cases of line-of-duty death or injuries  that result in permanent and total disability preventing the performance of  any gainful work, public safety officers and their beneficiaries are  currently eligible to receive a onetime lump-sum payment of $315,746. In  addition to the lump-sum death and disability benefits, the officer\u2019s spouse  and children may also qualify to receive postsecondary education benefits  up to $915 a month. Typically, the officer\u2019s employer (i.e., the state or local  agency for which the officer worked at the time of death or disability)  assists with filing death and disability claims on the officer\u2019s behalf, while  claimants generally file for education benefits on their own.", "Questions about DOJ\u2019s administration of the PSOB program have  increased in recent years, in part because of the time required by the  agency to implement the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of  2003, which expanded program eligibility requirements to include public  safety officers whose work under certain conditions results in death by  heart attack or stroke while on duty or within 24 hours thereafter. DOJ  took nearly 3 years after the law was enacted to publish final regulations  and, in the meantime, did not finalize any Hometown Heroes-related  claims, resulting in a backlog of about 200 claims filed under this law.", "In light of these issues, we examined the following questions:  (1) To what extent do claimants receive PSOB program benefits and how  long does it take to process claims?  (2) What issues, if any, were raised by state and local agencies and  advocacy organizations seeking benefits on the behalf of claimants?  (3) To what extent does the PSOB program follow recognized government  standards and guidelines for effective program management?", "For all three questions, we reviewed claims outcomes, stakeholder  concerns, program management, and relevant federal laws and regulations  related to the PSOB program. To determine receipt of program benefits  and length of the processing time, we drew a stratified random probability  sample of 233 out of the 1,632 PSOB death, disability, and education  claims that were opened during fiscal years 2006 to 2008. Our sample of  cases is generally of a sufficient size to allow us to project our findings to  the universe of death, disability, and education claims for this time period.  All of our percentage estimates are within a margin of error of plus or  minus 10 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level for claims  approval and denial outcomes, and 95 percent confidence intervals are  reported for estimates of time, unless otherwise noted. To determine what  aspects of the program raised issues among agencies that assist with  benefit applications, we interviewed PSOB program officials and state and  local officials that serve both larger urban and smaller, more rural  communities in the following five states\u2014California, Iowa, Louisiana,  Maryland, and New York. We selected these states based on a range in the  number of public safety officer deaths in recent years, geographic  location, and other characteristics. The officials we interviewed  represented local police and firefighting departments; employee advocacy  groups, such as chapters of Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. (COPS); and  the Fraternal Order of Police; state firefighters associations; and unions.  We also interviewed the national affiliates of these state and local  organizations, including the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation  (NFFF) and the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). Finally,  to evaluate the effectiveness of the PSOB program\u2019s management, we  interviewed program officials and reviewed and analyzed available  documents on performance monitoring, program outreach, assistance for  those seeking benefits, and current and future plans for automating the  claims process. We analyzed this information based on criteria set forth in  GAO\u2019s and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidelines for  internal controls, strategic planning and reporting, and information system  development and acquisition. We conducted this performance audit from  September 2008 to October 2009 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

While Congress established that  funding for death claims is mandatory, funding for the disability and  education portions of the program is discretionary. As such, in fiscal year  2009, Congress appropriated \u201csuch sums as are necessary\u201d for death  benefits (approximately $119 million), $5 million for disability benefits,  and $4.1 million for education benefits. In fiscal year 2009, after adjusting  for inflation, the onetime lump-sum death and disability benefits were  $315,746, and the maximum education benefit was $915 per month.", "By law, PSOB death and disability benefits are provided in addition to  other benefits to which the officer is entitled and generally should not  affect the receipt of other benefits, including state and local benefits.

In addition, if  officers qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (DI), their DI  benefits are not affected by the receipt of PSOB benefits.", "The PSOB program is administered by the PSOB Office, a unit of BJA  within DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP).

In fiscal years 2006 through 2008, a total of  1,632 PSOB claims were filed.

The Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of 2003 expanded  program eligibility to include public safety officers who die as a direct and  proximate result of heart attacks or strokes while on duty or within 24  hours after engaging in a nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical public  safety activity or training. To qualify for disability benefits, the public  safety officer has to be permanently and totally disabled as the direct  result of catastrophic injury sustained in the line of duty that permanently  prevents the individual from performing any gainful work. An officer\u2019s  spouse or children may also qualify for education benefits only after the  officer\u2019s eligibility for death or disability benefits has been established.  Spouses may receive education benefits at any point during their lifetime,  while children generally may receive benefits until the age of 27. In  addition, educational assistance is provided for a maximum of 45 months  of full-time enrollment and students must maintain a cumulative C  average.

By statute, the  BJA director is authorized to use no less than $150,000 of appropriated  program funds to maintain and enhance national peer support and  counseling programs to assist families of public safety officers who have  died in the line of duty. To that end, the PSOB program funds two  organizations, COPS and NFFF, and expects them to use a portion of the  money to assist claimants and agencies with filing PSOB program claims.", "Before the PSOB Office drafts an initial determination about whether a  claimant will receive program benefits, it requires claimants to submit  documentation for each type of claim, some of which must be signed by  the officer\u2019s employer.

Furthermore,  some death claims are reviewed by a contracted pathologist and all  disability claims are reviewed by independent medical reviewers of  various medical specialties and subspecialties who provide additional  information as to whether claims meet medical standards for eligibility. A  claim may go through different phases of the process multiple times if at  any phase DOJ officials determine that more information may be needed  to make a determination. If a claim is denied, claimants have a right to  appeal to a hearing officer, who reviews the claim and makes a second  determination, which is independent of the initial denial. If the hearing  officer denies the claim, the claimant may appeal to the director of BJA.  And finally, claimants can appeal claims denied by the director of BJA to  the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Similarly, of the closed claims we reviewed, 100 percent of  education claims and about 80 percent of death claims were approved.

In general, the  most frequently cited causes of death were motor vehicle accidents, heart  attacks, and gunshot wounds. The average age of the officers at the time of  death was 46 years.

The overall  length of time from occurrence of death or disability to the claimant\u2019s  receipt of a final determination from the PSOB Office is the sum of two  phases. The first is from occurrence of death or disability to when the  PSOB Office begins to process the claim (prefiling phase), and the second  is from when the PSOB Office begins to process the claim to when it sends  the final determination letter to the claimant (program processing time).  Specifically, we found that while the prefiling phase varied significantly by  type of claim, it took the PSOB office approximately 1 year or less to  process death and education claims and about 2 years to process disability  claims after receiving a claim.", "The prefiling phase was the shortest for death claims and longest for  education claims. For death claims filed in fiscal years 2006 through 2008,  the prefiling phase took an average of 7 to 12 months from the date of  death to when the PSOB Office started to process the claim. Disability  claims took an average of 49 to 68 months (or about 4 to 6 years), between  the date of disability to when the PSOB Office began to process the claim.

(See fig. 5.) The relatively lengthy prefiling phase for education  claims is not unusual given that an officer\u2019s children may not reach college  age until years after the officer\u2019s death or disability.", "PSOB officials told us that several factors may affect the length of the  prefiling phase during which claimants wait to file death and disability  claims, including claimants\u2019 difficulty with obtaining necessary  documentation to prove eligibility and potential lack of awareness about  the program. According to PSOB officials, obtaining this documentation  may take months or years. We found that less than 40 percent of the death  claims filed in fiscal year 2008 utilized the online application that the  PSOB Office has recently made available to speed up the application  process.", "For the second phase of the process, during which the PSOB Office and  OJP\u2019s OGC actually processed the claim, processing times averaged 4 to 6  months for education, 9 to 13 months for death, and 17 to 26 months for  disability claims. (See fig. 6.)", "PSOB officials told us that disability claims are generally more challenging  and may take longer to process than death and education claims, in part  because eligibility may be less easily established. To prove eligibility for a  disability claim, officials must ensure that claimants submit adequate  medical documentation and that all disability claims undergo an  independent medical review by BJA contractors. Both these steps could  increase the time needed to process these claims. PSOB officials also  noted that, unlike death claims, some disability claims encounter  processing delays caused by the reluctance of former employers to  provide necessary documents to support the claim, many of which must be  approved by the employer. In addition, according to our sample, disability  claims were more likely to be appealed than death or education claims\u2014 about 27 percent of disability claims initiated in fiscal years 2006 through  2008 were appealed, compared with about 8 percent of death claims\u2014 which contributed to longer processing times for disability claims. Given  all of these factors that contributed to the relatively longer processing  times, most disability claims initiated in fiscal years 2006 through 2008  were still awaiting an agency determination. At the time of our review,  program processing time for these pending disability claims was already  23 to 28 months, on average, since the PSOB Office started to process the  claim.", "For each type of closed claim, the agency processing phase included the  time required for PSOB Office staff to review the claim and draft an initial  determination and for attorneys in OJP\u2019s OGC to complete legal review of  the claim. However, we could not determine how long the attorney review  portion of the process took because of the PSOB Office\u2019s inconsistent  claim file documentation on the dates during which the reviews occurred.  Furthermore, we were unable to determine how long the independent  medical reviews by BJA contractors took because the dates the reviews  began were often missing from the file documentation. However, on the  basis of our sample, we found that the overall length of time from  occurrence of death or disability to the claimant\u2019s receipt of a final  determination was an average of 16 to 21 months for death claims, 60 to 92  months (or 5 years to about 7.5 years) for disability claims, and 96 to 126  months (or about 8 to 10.5 years) for education claims.", "Once the program had made its final determination to approve the claim, it  took an average of a few days to about 10 weeks from the date of the final  determination to the date that the payment was sent to the claimant,  regardless of type of claim.

Additionally, some local officials we met with did not recall receiving any  information or program materials from the PSOB Office explaining the  program\u2019s benefits. In particular, representatives of 15 of the 44  organizations we spoke with mentioned a lack of awareness about  disability or education benefits, while officials from another 6  organizations were concerned that their constituents had a general lack of  knowledge of the PSOB program. The general lack of awareness posed a  particular problem among smaller rural and volunteer departments. In  some cases, officials we interviewed from small local departments were  not aware of the program benefits until a line-of-duty death occurred. At  that time, they were contacted by unions or larger departments to let them  know about the PSOB death benefit and to assist them with the  application process. For example, one official from a local fire department  in California noted that although he was put in charge of assisting the  family of a firefighter who died in the line of duty, he did not know about  the PSOB program until one of the city\u2019s volunteer firefighters, the former  chief of a large city fire department, informed him about the program.", "The lack of awareness had an adverse effect for some claimants. For  instance, an official representing a police officers\u2019 union in Louisiana  recalled a case in which a local police department unfamiliar with the  PSOB disability benefits did not seek benefits on behalf of a severely and  permanently disabled officer until the officer happened to seek  educational assistance for his child, who was preparing to attend college.  Likewise, an official from a police officers\u2019 employee association in  Louisiana recalled an accident in which one officer was killed and another  was permanently injured. However, while the local police department  applied for PSOB death benefits for the deceased officer, a corresponding  disability claim was not filed for the disabled officer for 1 year because of  lack awareness of PSOB disability benefits.", "Officials from some public safety officer unions and the PSOB program  said that they are more focused on promoting awareness of death benefits  than the other two types of benefits. According to officials from a  firefighters union, they do not see a reason to promote awareness of the  disability benefits because few officers would meet the very stringent  eligibility criteria for disability. Several officials told us that the types and  levels of disabilities that would qualify claimants to receive PSOB benefits  (i.e., permanent and total injury preventing any type of work) tend to be  rare, which may be a factor in the public safety officer community\u2019s  general lack of awareness of such benefits, resulting in the relatively few  number of disability claims filed. Additionally, local departments did not  always know about education benefits, which may be due in part to  education claims often being filed by family members many years after a  death occurs. Furthermore, PSOB officials told us that they made a  conscious decision to focus the 2008 PSOB program awareness outreach  materials\u2014the first of their kind to be produced\u2014on death benefits.  Therefore, although the outreach materials the PSOB Office provided  contained program information about all three types of benefits\u2014death,  disability, and education\u2014an application checklist only for death benefits  was included."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Said That Submitting All Necessary Paperwork to Prove Eligibility Was Difficult and Time-consuming", "paragraphs": ["Officials in all five states we visited also told us that when applying for  benefits, submitting all the necessary paperwork to prove eligibility was  difficult and can be time-consuming. Specifically, officials mentioned that  it was sometimes difficult for smaller local departments that may not have  experienced line-of-duty deaths and would be unfamiliar with the process,  further complicating their experience with gathering required documents.  For example, officials from firefighters\u2019 employee associations in  Louisiana and Iowa mentioned how difficult generating the toxicology  report for a fallen officer can be if the agency does not know to draw a  blood sample from the officer as soon as possible. The Iowa official  stated that because of this lack of knowledge, the claimants in one case  had to locate donated organs of the officer in order to create a toxicology  sample for the PSOB report.", "Gathering the required documentation can also be time-consuming, and  our review of claims showed that it took about as much time (7 to 12  months on average) to file a death claim as it took for the program to  process the claim (9 to 13 months on average). According to local officials,  the application process can be delayed by long wait periods to obtain  necessary documents, including accident reports and medical and birth  records, from other state, local, and private organizations. For example,  one official from a firefighters\u2019 employee association in New York  described a recent case in which it took several months to obtain  necessary documents from a hospital, resulting in the officer\u2019s family  having to wait 6 months before they could submit the death claim.  Similarly, an official from a local police department in California explained  that he had been waiting about 4 months for an accident report for a line- of-duty death, which hinged on an investigation being conducted by a  different department. This process of obtaining documents can be even  more time-consuming for smaller departments, which may not have  enough staff to systematically follow up with beneficiaries and coordinate  with other local agencies.", "State and local officials in Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, and New York and  PSOB officials also stated that a significant amount of time is often  required to collect the information needed by the PSOB Office to  determine eligible beneficiaries. State and local officials told us that public  safety officers tend not to update their beneficiary information following a  life change, such as a divorce or birth of a child, and this can lead to  complications when determining who should receive benefits. Outdated  beneficiary information could affect the time it takes to process the claim  and determine which beneficiaries should receive payment.", "Furthermore, some of the officials we interviewed had mixed experiences  in receiving assistance from COPS and NFFF, two national organizations  tasked by the PSOB program with helping claimants and departments  navigate the application process. While several officials in the firefighting  community mentioned receiving assistance from NFFF with the PSOB  application process, many officials we interviewed from state and local  police departments and agencies that work with police officers said they  have not received application assistance from COPS. A July 2008 report  from COPS to BJA noted that COPS provided training to its liaisons to  local departments in January 2008 to assist agencies with applications.  Following the training, COPS contacted 56 agencies with known line-of- duty deaths, and 20 of them accepted assistance from the organization,  while the remaining 36 did not, according to the COPS progress report. A  COPS grant report from January 2009 stated that the low take-up rate of  COPS assistance by local agencies may be due to local police departments\u2019  reluctance to share department matters with an external organization.", "Moreover, several officials from national, state, and local organizations  mentioned that the PSOB Office has occasionally lost claimants\u2019  documents that then have to be resubmitted, or that PSOB officials have  asked that the same documents be submitted multiple times. For example,  an official from a local fire department in California described a situation  in which a claimant did not hear from the PSOB program officials for  almost a year after submitting a claim. When the claimant inquired about  the claim status, she learned that the PSOB program had lost her file. OJP  officials acknowledged that this happens sometimes. While they were not  entirely certain why documentation is lost or misplaced, program officials  noted that there are times when required pieces of documentation may be  lost or misplaced by the PSOB Office, and times when claimants send  documents to another agency or incorrect address, making it more likely  that the PSOB Office will unintentionally misplace documents. PSOB  officials added that they plan to address this concern through automation  of the claims process and anticipate that with more frequent use of the  online application form, the likelihood of misplaced documents will  diminish. PSOB officials told us that the ability to fully submit death  claims electronically, including supporting documentation, has been  available to the public since the spring of 2006, but the vast majority of  claims are still submitted on paper. Further, to better facilitate document  collection, the PSOB Office will be hiring additional staff to proactively  outreach to claimants and local agencies to obtain missing documentation  for pending claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Most Frequently Expressed Concerns about Perceived Long Wait Times for Benefits while Not Knowing Claim Status", "paragraphs": ["Officials most frequently expressed concerns about what they perceived  as long wait times for PSOB benefits, cited by just over half of the 44  organizations we interviewed. While our claims file review indicated that  the average total time from date of death to date of a final determination  was about 1 \u00bd years (an average of 16 to 21 months), some of the officials  we interviewed mentioned that they experienced much longer waits. For  example, officials from a national police employees\u2019 organization and a  Louisiana police union said that they assisted claimants who had waited 2  or more years to receive PSOB benefits. Furthermore, officials from four  states\u2014California, Louisiana, Maryland, and New York\u2014noted that  sometimes they do not receive requests from PSOB Office staff for missing  or additional documentation for claims until long after initial paperwork  has been submitted, contributing to the wait time.", "State and local officials generally said that, in contrast, the application  process for state and local onetime death benefits was much faster and  that benefits were provided much quicker than for federal PSOB benefits.  Some local officials also mentioned that they were concerned about the  effects that relatively long PSOB wait times can have on families in need of  the financial assistance and that are seeking closure on the officer\u2019s death.  An official from a local police department in California explained that  relatively long wait times for PSOB benefits can impose a financial burden  on families that often count on federal benefits.", "In addition, officials from two COPS chapters and a local police officers\u2019  agency expressed concern about the PSOB program practice of not  informing claimants or agencies of how long claims processing is expected  to take. Officials from Maryland and California noted that without this  information, claimants may develop unrealistic expectations about how  soon they will receive benefit payments. A few local and state officials told  us that the lack of information from PSOB Office staff on expected  processing times restricts the local department\u2019s ability to provide clear  answers and good customer service to the claimants they are assisting.  The PSOB program director explained that the program does not provide  estimated time frames for processing claims because the average  processing time varies widely based on the circumstances surrounding  each claim (e.g., how complex the documentation is, how long the PSOB  Office has to wait for additional documentation, and legal issues). The  office instead provides survivors and agencies with information on the  PSOB claims review process, and shares at what stage their claim is in the  review process, even though PSOB benefit specialists do not tell a  claimant how long it will take to process any one claim.", "Further, some state and local department officials experienced difficulty in  getting through to PSOB Office staff for information on claims status. One  official from a local police department in California reported that despite  several attempts to contact the PSOB program office, he has never spoken  to a staff member or received any return calls. In contrast, a few local and  state officials cited positive interactions with PSOB Office staff, and one  state official noted that in her experience, PSOB benefit specialists were  always responsive and gave timely and clear answers to questions on  claim status. The PSOB program director acknowledged that all calls and  e-mails from claimants or agencies are not always returned and stated that  addressing issues regarding claims status is a priority for the PSOB  program. PSOB officials anticipate having staff dedicated to providing  claims status information to claimants and agencies as early as November  2009."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While It Is Taking Steps to Improve, the PSOB Office Does Not Yet Follow Government Guidelines for Performance Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["Overall, we found that while it is taking steps to improve, the PSOB Office  does not follow government standards and guidelines for setting goals and  monitoring performance. All federal executive branch agencies are  required by GPRA to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report  on the degree to which goals have been met in an effort to ensure  government accountability and enhance public awareness about agencies\u2019  accomplishments. GAO\u2019s previous work has noted that measuring  performance allows organizations to track progress in meeting their goals  and gives managers crucial information to identify gaps in program  performance and plan any needed improvements. However, DOJ has not  established strategic goals or performance measures related to GPRA for  the PSOB Office and therefore does not track or report such information  to the public. OJP officials who are responsible for overseeing PSOB\u2019s  strategic efforts said the program is not subject to strategic planning and  goal setting because it is considered a payment program, and a  significant portion of the program\u2019s budget is mandatory. According to  OJP, it was OMB\u2019s practice under the previous administration to n subject mandatory programs, such as PSOB\u2019s death benefits, and small OJP accounts, such as the PSOB disability and education programs to  Program Assessment Review Tool (PART) assessments, which are used byfederal executive branch agencies to help develop and identify mean ingful  performance measures to support GPRA reporting, among other purposes.  Furthermore, the PSOB program director told us that the office decided  not to establish performance measures specifically for timeliness because  the measures could create disincentives for staff to work on claims that  may require more time to process, such as those for which documentation  is pending. However, we found that other federal programs that provide  benefits after work-related injury and illness have been able to set  strategic goals and monitor performance. For example, the Department of  Labor\u2019s Black Lung and Energy Employees Occupational Illness  Compensation programs, which require workers or their survivors to  prove their eligibility after the workers become ill or die because of  exposure to hazardous working conditions, both have GPRA performance  measures related to claims-processing times and publicly report their  results.", "While the PSOB program lacks GPRA-related strategic goals and  performance measures, there are two claims-processing goals established  under a 2004 Attorney General memorandum, but neither the PSOB Office  nor OJP\u2019s Office of General Counsel tracks these goals for their respective  offices. The PSOB program director stated that the PSOB Office did not  track the first goal of processing a claim within 90 days of receiving all  necessary documentation because it lacked automated data that would  have enabled the program to establish a baseline and gauge progress. As a  result, the PSOB Office is not fully aware of how long the claims review  process takes. Likewise, an OGC official told us that OGC has not  established mechanisms for monitoring the second goal to review claims  within 45 days of receiving all necessary documentation. Even if the  program were to track progress toward its timeliness goals using currently  available information in the claims files, we found problems with the  quality and consistency of documentation pertaining to key processing  dates during our review, including when the file initially went to the  attorneys or the medical reviewers. In addition, the timeliness goals  established in the memorandum may be outdated and inappropriate given  that the PSOB Office had no data with which to establish and monitor  them and that the goals do not reflect the potentially time-consuming step  of collecting documentation.", "While most claims are still processed on paper, the PSOB Office is  implementing a new automated information management system, known  as Workflow, to help ensure efficient claims processing and improve the  available data on claims. According to the PSOB program director, BJA  has been planning the Workflow system since 2004 and according to  program officials, as of July 2009, was transitioning toward processing all  three types of PSOB claims using the completed claims-processing  components of the system. In addition, the PSOB program plans to use  data from this system to establish programwide performance measures  and generate public reports. To ensure that Workflow is addressing agency  needs, success metrics\u2014including reducing application processing times  and improving the program\u2019s ability to provide data on pending or closed  claims\u2014were articulated in the system\u2019s planning document. However, the  PSOB program does not have plans for how it will monitor Workflow\u2019s  success metrics, but program officials had planned to revisit these metrics  with stakeholders in conjunction with planning future components of the  system. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the program has no baseline  information on claims-processing times, precluding it from determining  whether the capabilities of the new system will have enhanced timeliness.", "In addition, the PSOB program has initiated several efforts in an attempt to  address concerns about the lack of program awareness, the burdensome  application process, and obtaining claims status. Since 2007, the PSOB  program has conducted several outreach activities, including sending a  mailing about its benefit programs to about 60,000 law enforcement and  fire fighting organizations identified by the National Criminal Justice  Reference Service and NFFF. The PSOB director has also attended several  conferences, by invitation, to provide information on the program to  relevant constituencies, such as the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association and the  Police Conference of New York. Furthermore, PSOB\u2019s national partners,  COPS and NFFF, assist claimants and local agencies with filing for the  benefits. With respect to communicating claims status, PSOB benefits  specialists are expected to respond to claims status inquiries in a timely  manner\u2014defined as within 72 hours of the inquiry, according to the PSOB  director.", "Although the program has taken steps to enhance its external  communications, it has not systematically monitored these efforts to help  ensure that relevant external parties understand the agency\u2019s mission and  objectives and that PSOB Office staff provide the quality of customer  service expected by the program office. Regarding the difficult application  process, COPS has reported that it has not been successful in providing  direct claims assistance to law enforcement officers even though this  group makes up the bulk of PSOB\u2019s claims workload. However, the PSOB  program has not established criteria to evaluate this external assistance  effort to better understand the problems and develop ways to address  them. In addition, the PSOB program director is aware, based on  complaints received directly from claimants and agencies, that PSOB  Office staff do not always address some inquiries regarding claims status  in a timely manner. However, the program does not systematically track  when inquiries are received and when responses are provided, nor is the  72-hour guideline formally incorporated into staff\u2019s performance  expectations. As a result, the PSOB Office cannot ensure that all claims  status inquires are addressed in a consistent and timely manner.  Furthermore, although the program director has provided information at  several conferences, the PSOB program has not systematically solicited  feedback from conference attendees that could be used to determine  whether the information met their needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The PSOB Office has had a long history of serving law enforcement  officers, firefighters, and others who, in turn, serve their communities and  face potentially dangerous circumstances every day. To effectively manage  this program, the PSOB Office would need to know its clients\u2019 needs,  target efforts to address those needs, and monitor its performance on an  ongoing basis. While the office has established goals related to its key  activities, (i.e., claims processing, outreach, and claimant assistance), lack  of performance monitoring in these areas diminishes the agency\u2019s ability  to pinpoint problems and take corrective action accordingly. Additionally,  the PSOB Office strives to help the public safety officer community  understand the program and its benefits, yet does not systematically set  goals or collect information on its claims-processing, outreach, and  assistance efforts. Thus, the PSOB Office has no way of knowing whether  these efforts are appropriate or effective. In addition, without reliable  claims data, the PSOB Office will not be able to obtain a complete and  accurate picture of how quickly claims are being processed and whether  the process can be made more efficient. Without this information, the  program office cannot communicate with claimants and other public  stakeholders about how long the claims process is expected to take and  whether program constraints, such as required procedures and limited  resources, are affecting the process. The PSOB director has acknowledged  that there are some gaps in management of the program and is taking  steps to address them.

(2) What issues, if any, were raised by state and local agencies and  advocacy organizations seeking benefits on the behalf of claimants?  (3) To what extent does the PSOB program follow recognized government  standards and guidelines for effective program management?", "For all three questions, we reviewed claims outcomes, stakeholder  concerns, program management, and relevant federal laws and regulations  related to the PSOB program. Specifically, to determine receipt of program  benefits and length of processing time, we drew a stratified random  probability sample of 233 of the 1,632 PSOB death, disability, and  education claims that were opened during fiscal years 2006 to 2008.  Because education benefits can be provided over multiple years, the  education claims in our sample were ones that were paid during fiscal  years 2006 to 2008, although they may have been first opened several years  prior to our time frame. With this probability sample, each member of the  study population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any member. Each sample element  selected was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically  for all the members of the population. Table 2 provides details about the  number of claims in our sample by type compared with the total number  opened in fiscal years 2006 to 2008.", "We collected most of the data for our sample by manually reviewing paper  claims files from February to April 2009 using a data collection instrument  (DCI). The only data for our sample that were not contained in the paper  claims files pertained to payment dates for all approved claims and  payment amounts for the approved education claims. These data were  obtained from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) finance office and were  determined to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report after  we reviewed the data for any discrepancies and information on how they  were collected and maintained.", "In general, our sample of claims is of a sufficient size to allow us to project  our estimates to the population of death, disability, and education claims  for fiscal years 2006 to 2008 within a margin of error of plus or minus 10  percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level for claims approval  and denial outcomes, and 95 percent confidence intervals are reported for  estimates of time, unless otherwise noted. However, in specific instances,  we were not able to project to the population when the number of claims  in the sample that met a certain criterion for our analysis was too small.  For example, only 20 disability cases in our sample were closed at the time  of our review, and therefore this sample size was too small to create  reliable estimates of the extent to which all disability cases were approved  or denied. Also, the sample size prohibited us from estimating the  proportion of all three types of claims that came from any single state.", "In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of collecting data  may introduce other errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors.  As mentioned above, we collected most of the data for our sample by  manually reviewing paper claims files. Variation in the quality or  completeness of the entries in these claims files or in our ability to  correctly interpret or transcribe the entries onto our DCI can introduce  unwanted variability into the results. We took steps in developing our DCI,  collecting the data, and analyzing the results to minimize such errors. For  example, the instrument was developed by a survey specialist in  collaboration with GAO subject matter experts. The DCI was also  reviewed by relevant DOJ officials prior to our use to help ensure that we  maximized the information that could be collected by using it. A sample of  completed DCIs was reviewed by another GAO analyst to ensure that  entries were being interpreted and entered correctly. Completed DCIs  were then entered into an electronic database by a contract data entry  service and a sample of entries was verified. Finally, data were analyzed by  a GAO data analyst, and a second independent data analyst checked all  computer programs for accuracy.", "To determine what aspects of the program raised issues among agencies  that assist with benefit applications, we interviewed PSOB program  officials and a judgmentally selected sample of state and local officials that  serve both larger urban and smaller, more rural communities in the  following five states\u2014California, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, and New  York. These interviews were held with representatives from a total of 44  organizations. As shown in table 3, the states were selected based on  geographic location, the percentage of the national total number of public  safety officers that was in a state for calendar years 2006 to 2008, the  number of work-related deaths among public safety officers in a state for  calendar years 2005 to 2007, variation in the amount of state workers\u2019  compensation benefits, variation in the availability and amount of state  lump-sum death benefits, and recommendations from advocacy groups  and employee organizations.

II and III.)", "We focused on interviewing local officials who assisted with filing PSOB  claims during fiscal years 2006 to 2008, but in a few cases, in order to  ensure we were obtaining a variety of perspectives, we interviewed  officials who assisted with claims associated with deaths that occurred in  2005. The officials we interviewed represented local police and firefighting  departments; employee advocacy groups, such as chapters of Concerns of  Police Survivors, Inc.
