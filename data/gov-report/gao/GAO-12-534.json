To identify the amount of U.S.  government funding made available for foreign police training and  equipment activities, we examined past GAO reports; congressional  budget submissions, including the Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureau  of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs\u2019 (State/INL)  program and budget guides for fiscal year 2011; the Afghanistan Security  Forces Fund fiscal year 2012 congressional budget justification; and the  Department of Defense (DOD) fiscal year 2012 congressional budget  justification and other budget documents. To identify countries and police  assistance activities, we reviewed funding amounts reported to GAO by  agencies, the fiscal year 2012 budget appendix, congressional budget  submissions, agency annual reports, interagency agreements, and other  program documents. We also interviewed officials from the Departments  of Defense, State, and Energy (DOE); the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID; and the Departments of the Treasury, Justice  (DOJ), and Homeland Security (DHS). We collected data for fiscal year  2010 and fiscal year 2011 to update foreign police assistance funding  information provided in our prior report.", "We used the same definition of police assistance that we used in the  previous report. We defined police training and equipment activities (which  we referred to as \u201cpolice assistance\u201d) as all training\u2014regardless of its  content\u2014and equipment provided to law enforcement units or personnel  with arrest, investigative, or interdiction authority. Officials from the Office of  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global  Threats (DASD-CN>) updated information on DOD police assistance  from fiscal year 2009 for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 using the definition we  developed with State. DASD-CN> has oversight of program funding  through a web-based database. However, specific funds for police  assistance are managed at the combatant command level. The data  DASD-CN> compiled included allotments for fiscal years 2010 and  2011 that were provided by combatant commands for training and  equipping activities. Using our definition, DOD\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction  Agency provided funding data based on allotments from DOD\u2019s  defensewide operations and maintenance account. We also obtained total  amounts made available after reprogramming for Afghanistan, Iraq, and  Pakistan from the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, Iraq Security Forces  Fund, and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund from the Comptroller\u2019s Office  in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. We reviewed these figures along  with congressional budget justifications and DOD\u2019s fourth quarter, fiscal  year 2011 report to Congress on the Iraqi, Afghan, and Pakistan Security  Forces, as required by Section 9009 of DOD\u2019s Appropriation Act for fiscal  year 2011. We combined data from all funding sources to derive the DOD  total. We included funding for equipment and transportation, training, and  sustainment. We excluded any infrastructure costs because such costs are  not typical of most police assistance activities. We compared the DOD data  for reasonableness of the reported information and questioned DOD  officials about their methodology and the reliability of the data. Some of the  data may have included both military and civilian police personnel, which  might result in overestimating DOD funding. However, for fiscal years 2010  and 2011, the majority of DOD funds (over 90 percent) were provided  through the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, Iraq Security Forces Fund,  and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund, which separate funds provided to  military and civilian personnel. To identify any discrepancies in the funding  data, we compared the data from fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 with  that provided for fiscal year 2009. We reconciled discrepancies with the  agencies and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "State/INL analyzed data reported in its annual program and budget  guides to provide allocations for police-assistance activities that fit our  definition. The funding data covered all country programs funded through  the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE)  account directed to law enforcement, stabilization operations,  counternarcotics, border control, and transnational crime. State also used  the definition to identify police assistance funded through other foreign  assistance accounts. State analyzed appropriations and obligations  funding data from the Foreign Assistance Coordination and Tracking  System database, which tracks data on U.S. foreign assistance  programs. Allotments or allocations were provided for the Assistance for  Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia account and the Nonproliferation,  Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs account. State also  provided obligations for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund,  which received funds transferred from DOD\u2019s Pakistan  Counterinsurgency Fund, and allotments from funding transferred from  DOD to State under Section 1207 authority of the fiscal year 2006  National Defense Authorization Act. We compared State\u2019s data for fiscal  year 2009 with data for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 for reasonableness.  We also questioned State officials about their methodology, reviewed the  program and budget guides, reviewed other GAO reports that used the  same data sources, and discussed data reliability with agency officials.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We combined the data from the various funding accounts to derive the  State total. The State data included funding provided to Treasury, DOJ,  and DHS. It excluded funding provided to State from other agencies, with  the exception of Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund  and 1207  funds transferred from DOD.

DOE\u2019s funds were made available from its Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation account. USAID reviewed the Foreign Assistance  Coordination and Tracking System database by program element to  identify programs that might have a civilian policing component. USAID  then consulted with its geographic bureaus and its overseas missions to  obtain detailed data not available at headquarters. USAID provided us  with funding data based on allotments for activities that included civilian  police training. We reviewed the data for reasonableness and discussed  their reliability with agency officials. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We excluded programs that did not  meet our definition, such as judicial exchanges. Treasury provided  appropriations funding for police assistance from its Economic Crimes  division for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 in response to our request for  funding data based on our definition. Funds were made available from the  Treasury International Affairs Technical Assistance account and included  supplemental funding provided during fiscal year 2010.", "For DOJ, we used funding data provided by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The  FBI explained that the primary purpose of its foreign police training is not  to provide \u2018foreign assistance. Rather, the primary purpose of such  training is to further the FBI\u2019s statutorily authorized mission to detect,  investigate, and prosecute crimes against the United States, which  include federal crimes of terrorism and other crimes that the FBI is  authorized to investigate extraterritorially. FBI provided funding data using  its definition of police assistance: any activity, including the provision of  equipment in association therewith, that is intended to develop or  enhance foreign law enforcement capabilities to prevent, deter, detect,  investigate, or respond to criminal or terrorist acts or support public safety  and security. Such training occurs both in the United States and abroad.  FBI officials explained that our definition would exclude some types of law  enforcement personnel, such as crime lab technicians, who do not have  arrest authority, and that they could not isolate such individuals from their  submission. FBI provided data on obligations that were also disbursed  based on its definition. This definition did not materially affect the total  amount of U.S. funding. We reviewed the data for reasonableness and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. DEA  provided data on obligations that were also disbursed in response to our  request for data based on our definition. DEA provided funding data by  country for Afghanistan, Colombia, and Mexico, but neither DEA nor FBI  provided total funding data by country.", "We combined the funding data provided by DOD, State, DOE, USAID,  Treasury, and DOJ to obtain total U.S. government funds made available.  The amounts are estimates because, according to agency officials,  agencies do not generally track funding by a category specifically for  activities to train and equip foreign police. In addition, to estimate funding  for all elements of police training, the agencies relied on project code  reports, manual estimates, and data calls to overseas posts. On the basis  of our review of the data and discussions with agency officials, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for a broad estimate of  U.S. government funding.", "To assess the extent to which DOD and State/INL report on the results of  their police assistance activities for countries with their largest programs,  we reviewed GAO reports, including those that examined the capabilities  of the Iraqi Security Forces and Afghan National Security Forces,  including the Iraqi national police and Afghan National Police (ANP).
