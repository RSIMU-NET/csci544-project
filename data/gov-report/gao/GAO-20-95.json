The agency uses these data to manage its efforts and assess progress in meeting the agency's strategic objectives. In an August 2018 memorandum, EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) reported a key strategic change to increase compliance assistance activities (e.g., training) and informal enforcement actions (e.g., warning letters). However, the agency does not consistently collect or maintain data on either type of action (see figure). Specifically, OECA has not directed regional offices to collect or report data on compliance assistance activities since 2012 and, consequently, does not have guidance instructing regional offices to collect such data and specifying which mechanism offices should use to maintain these data. Also, the agency did not provide guidance to those offices defining informal enforcement actions or how to maintain data on them until September 30, 2019, but the guidance does not specify how to collect data on such actions. By clearly documenting in guidance how the offices should use the definition to collect data on such actions, EPA could more consistently collect these data.", "As the figure shows, OECA does not require regional offices to collect data on compliance assistance or complete data on informal enforcement actions. Having complete information about its compliance assistance activities and informal enforcement is essential because EPA has elevated the role of such activities in its overall enforcement efforts.

A central part of EPA\u2019s mission to  protect human health and the environment is enforcing environmental  laws and regulations, including those related to water, air, and hazardous  waste. In many instances, EPA has delegated authority to, or authorized,  states to implement and enforce federal environmental requirements.  EPA, in partnership with these states, oversees about 800,000 entities\u2019  compliance with these requirements. According to EPA, these regulated  entities include petroleum refineries, factories, small businesses, sewage  treatment plants, and local governments. EPA decides how to promote  compliance with regulations, deter noncompliance by taking enforcement  actions, tailor efforts to encourage voluntary compliance, and inform  regulated entities of regulatory requirements. In its most recent strategic  plan, issued in 2018, EPA described a change in its approach to the  agency\u2019s overall compliance and enforcement program that included,  among other things, a goal of increasing the agency\u2019s use of compliance  assistance activities\uf8e7for example, training and technical assistance\uf8e7to  help regulated entities comply with laws and regulations.", "EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) carries  out the agency\u2019s environmental compliance and enforcement  responsibilities. OECA\u2019s headquarters provides overall direction to the agency\u2019s regional offices and authorized states on compliance monitoring  and enforcement policies and sometimes takes enforcement action.  OECA carries out much of its compliance monitoring, compliance  assistance, and enforcement responsibilities through its 10 regional  offices around the country. OECA staff in headquarters and in regional  offices are responsible for monitoring compliance by inspecting regulated  entities and tracking violations; taking enforcement actions, such as  sending notices of violation and developing administrative, civil, and  criminal cases against violators; providing compliance assistance, such  as training and technical assistance to regulated entities; and overseeing  the enforcement programs of authorized states, where applicable. OECA  collects data to monitor compliance and track enforcement actions and to  manage and assess the performance of its overall compliance and  enforcement program.", "EPA recently made some changes to its compliance and enforcement  approach, including refocusing its efforts from enforcement to compliance  and working more closely with states in planning a range of compliance  and enforcement efforts to increase compliance among regulated  entities. Specifically, in EPA\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through  2022, the agency stated that its priorities and goals include ensuring  compliance with the law and developing a more collaborative partnership  with authorized states. To meet the goals in EPA\u2019s strategic plan, every  few years OECA has developed national initiatives to focus its  compliance and enforcement resources, including staff and funding, on its  strategic objectives.", "In 2018, to help EPA achieve the strategic plan\u2019s goal of ensuring  compliance with the law, OECA refocused how it describes its national  initiatives from national enforcement initiatives to national compliance  initiatives. In OECA\u2019s 2019 policy memorandum announcing the national  compliance initiatives for fiscal years 2020 through 2023, OECA stated  that this change in focus conveys the overarching goal of increased  compliance and the use of not only formal enforcement actions (e.g., civil  actions), but also other compliance tools that include compliance  assistance, self-audits by regulated entities, and informal enforcement  actions (e.g., warning letters). OECA also stated in this 2019 policy  memorandum that while compliance assistance would be a feature in  increasing compliance, formal enforcement would remain important for  addressing serious noncompliance and creating general deterrence.  Furthermore, to address the goal in EPA\u2019s strategic plan of developing a  more collaborative partnership between the agency and authorized  states, OECA in 2019 issued final guidance to regional offices,  superseding interim guidance it issued in 2018. This guidance included  expectations for regional offices to, among other things, enhance  communication and jointly plan the enforcement actions EPA or a state  will initiate.", "We last reported on EPA\u2019s overall enforcement efforts in July 2007 when  we reported on the EPA\u2013state partnership to enforce environmental  laws. At that time, we found that EPA had improved its oversight of state  enforcement programs by implementing a consistent approach for  overseeing states. However, we also found that EPA could take additional  steps to ensure more consistent state performance and oversight of state  enforcement programs. We recommended that the agency take a number  of actions regarding its review of state programs. EPA generally agreed  with these recommendations and implemented them. We also  recommended that EPA conduct a comprehensive review of its regional  enforcement programs to address inconsistencies among the regional  offices in enforcement actions. EPA generally agreed with this  recommendation, but the agency has not yet taken actions to implement  it.", "You asked us to review EPA\u2019s enforcement efforts, and this report is the  first in response to your request. Our objectives were to examine (1) the  types of information EPA collects on its compliance monitoring,  compliance assistance, and enforcement actions; and (2) the ways in  which EPA communicates, to the public and Congress, the results of its  compliance activities and enforcement actions.", "To address both objectives, we reviewed EPA guidance and policy  memoranda, past GAO and EPA Office of Inspector General reports,  EPA\u2019s enforcement and compliance annual results reports, annual  performance reports, and other agency documents. We focused the scope of this report on the four primary laws OECA is responsible for  enforcing: Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.", "To examine the types of information EPA collects on its compliance  activities and enforcement actions, we collected information about the  databases and websites EPA uses to maintain and present its  enforcement data. Specifically, we reviewed EPA documents and  interviewed EPA officials about the purpose, uses, and limitations of the  data in the Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) database,  which contains compliance and enforcement data, and the Enforcement  and Compliance History Online (ECHO) website, a public access website  that stores and integrates data from multiple EPA databases. We also  interviewed relevant EPA officials about statute- and regional office- specific databases. However, we did not make a determination about the  reliability, completeness, and accuracy of specific data in these  databases because we present an analysis of the types of data that EPA  collects rather than an analysis of the compliance or enforcement data  themselves. Although we did not make a determination about the  reliability of specific data in ICIS or on the ECHO website, EPA has  publicly reported on limitations to the data. Specifically, EPA\u2019s ECHO  website includes a section that describes known data problems. For  example, the website states that EPA and the state agencies that report  data to EPA have identified some data issues that may impact the  completeness, timeliness, or accuracy of the data shown in ECHO.", "We interviewed OECA headquarters staff about the type of data the  agency collects and the primary ways the agency uses these data. We  sent a list of questions to all 10 EPA regional offices about their collection  and use of compliance and enforcement data as well as limitations in the  use of these data, and we analyzed their written responses. We also  conducted telephone or in-person interviews with officials in all 10  regional offices to further explore their collection and use of compliance  and enforcement data, among other things, and to follow up on their  written responses to our questions.", "We interviewed representatives of five organizations representing some  of the regulated entities to obtain their perspectives on a range of issues  related to enforcement. We selected these organizations based on  EPA\u2019s public information about the types of entities it regulates, and used  the information to help develop topics for regional interviews. Because  this was a nonprobability sample of such organizations, the  representatives\u2019 views are not generalizable to all such organizations but  provide examples of the views of regulated entities. Finally, we compared  EPA\u2019s efforts for collecting data against federal standards for internal  control related to the design of control activities and the use of quality  information and against a selection of our leading practices for regulatory  approaches.", "To examine the ways in which EPA communicates to the public and  Congress, the results of its compliance activities and enforcement  actions, we reviewed OECA\u2019s annual reports and presentations on data  describing annual results. We compared EPA\u2019s efforts in reporting data  against a selected leading practice for transparently reporting government  data and EPA guidance on communicating environmental data.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to January 2020  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

OECA has developed policies and guidance for EPA staff that  describe the agency\u2019s recommended responses to noncompliance based  on a number of factors and the escalation of enforcement responses to  continuing noncompliance. EPA guidance on informal and formal  enforcement actions provides an example related to the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act. In that example, if a regulated entity  does not return to compliance or notify the state or EPA that it cannot  return to compliance within a certain number of days after an informal  enforcement action, the state or EPA may take a formal enforcement  action. Generally, according to this same 2010 EPA guidance, informal  enforcement actions address small or isolated problems, and formal  enforcement actions can address bigger problems.", "OECA stores and manages a range of compliance monitoring and  enforcement data in ICIS. For example, ICIS includes descriptive  information about regulated entities, violations, and the outcome of  enforcement actions. ECHO, the public access website that integrates  data from multiple agency databases, has an internal component for staff  and other federal agencies and publicly available components. Staff in  EPA\u2019s 10 regional offices, OECA headquarters staff, and states input data  into ICIS, which feeds data into ECHO.

For example, officials in one regional office told us that regional  managers typically review ICIS data (for example, the number of  inspections conducted) to monitor their progress toward meeting strategic  objectives at the regional level. These regional officials said that staff in  their office conduct monthly reviews of ICIS data to understand how their  current efforts on certain indicators compare to prior years.", "OECA headquarters officials told us that the agency had begun to pilot a  mechanism to collect data that can help measure agency progress in  coordinating with states, one of the agency\u2019s strategic objectives.  Specifically, OECA officials told us that in 2018 the agency began a pilot  effort to track instances in which regional office staff provide assistance  with state enforcement actions, also characterized as \u201cstate assists.\u201d  According to agency guidance issued in June 2019, a state assist is  defined as any instance in which the state could not or would not take the  action without OECA\u2019s help or any instance in which a state explicitly  requests that OECA take over a case after OECA has identified a  violation. During the pilot effort, state assists are documented as such  when a regional office has expended substantial resources to identify a  violation, develop the injunctive relief, or help the state take an action to  obtain a remedy for the violation.", "According to OECA guidance, the pilot effort, which OECA officials expect  to continue through 2021, will help the agency better track its efforts in  this area. As of June 2019, according to our analysis of written  responses, officials in eight of the 10 regional offices described having  documented a state assist as defined by OECA. For example, officials in  one regional office stated in their written response to our questions that  one specific case against a company located in three different states  would have been handled by the regional office. Instead, the regional  office agreed to let two of the states take the lead for the cases in those  states, and the regional office handled the case in the third state and  documented this as two state assists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Regional Offices Do Not Consistently Collect or Maintain Data on Informal Enforcement Actions", "paragraphs": ["OECA collects data on some informal enforcement actions, such as the  number of warning letters sent to regulated entities, but EPA regions do  not always collect data about these actions, according to EPA  headquarters officials.

In a 2010  document, EPA explained how the various agency policy guidance and  ECHO define formal and informal enforcement actions differently. For  example, the document states that policy guidance for the Clean Air Act  defines notices of violation as formal enforcement actions, but that policy  guidance for the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act defines notices of violation as informal enforcement  actions. Similarly, this same 2010 document states that administrative  penalty orders of field citations are considered informal enforcement  actions in the policy guidance for the Clean Water Act, but formal  enforcement actions in the policy guidance for the Clean Air Act and  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, the document  states that ECHO characterizes notices of violations under the Clean Air  Act as informal enforcement actions even though the policy guidance  defines them as formal enforcement actions.", "OECA headquarters officials highlighted two issues that affect the  agency\u2019s ability to consistently maintain data on informal enforcement  actions: (1) using different definitions of informal enforcement actions  across programs and (2) maintaining data on such actions inconsistently.  OECA headquarters officials said that they were addressing the first issue  of not having one clear definition of informal enforcement actions that  applies across all of the air, water, and hazardous waste programs. In  September 2019, OECA headquarters officials said EPA was finalizing a  single definition of informal enforcement actions for the purpose of  collecting more consistent information. In January 2020, EPA provided us  with a September 30, 2019, memorandum that defines enforcement  response tools, including a definition of informal enforcement action  across all programs.", "Regarding maintaining data inconsistently, while most of the regional  offices collect data on some informal enforcement actions, they use  different mechanisms to maintain these data. According to our analysis of  written responses, officials in nine of the 10 regional offices stated that  their offices collect data on some informal enforcement actions such as  warning letters, notices of noncompliance, notices of violation, and  notices of determination. However, the officials described using different  mechanisms for maintaining the data they collect on informal  enforcement. For example, officials in five of the nine regional offices that  collect data on some informal enforcement actions stated that they  maintain the data in ICIS. As we described, ICIS data feeds into ECHO,  which has components available to the public. In three of the nine  regional offices that collect data on some informal enforcement actions,  staff collect data on such actions in a database other than ICIS, such as a  statute- or office-specific database, according to our analysis of written  responses.

As described earlier, EPA changed the focus of its national priorities from  enforcement to compliance and increased its use of informal enforcement  actions to achieve its regulatory objectives. Having complete information  about informal enforcement actions is essential because EPA has  elevated the role of such activities in its overall enforcement efforts. EPA  often works informally with regulated entities to help them comply with  environmental laws and regulations, according to its 2018 EPA  Enforcement Annual Results report. However, the agency does not  have complete information on those actions for evaluating its compliance  monitoring and enforcement performance. Moreover, more complete and  consistent information about OECA\u2019s informal enforcement actions would  provide a fuller picture of EPA\u2019s overall enforcement efforts. This, in turn,  would better enable EPA and OECA to assess whether they are  achieving the agency\u2019s regulatory objectives and improve the  transparency of OECA\u2019s informal enforcement actions for Congress and  the public.", "Guidance can help agencies communicate expectations and ensure  consistency with a standard. While EPA has issued guidance on how  various agency policies and ECHO define formal and informal  enforcement actions, the agency has not provided guidance to regional  offices on how they should collect or maintain data on informal  enforcement actions. According to federal standards for internal control,  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks, such as by clearly documenting internal control in  management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals.  On September 30, 2019, EPA issued a memorandum that provides  definitions for enforcement response tools, including informal  enforcement actions, and instructions on how to report such actions. Now  that the agency has finalized its definition of informal enforcement actions  and specified which mechanisms to use to maintain data on such actions,  by clearly documenting in guidance to the regional offices how they  should use the definition to collect data on these actions, EPA would have  better assurance that the regional offices consistently collect and maintain  these data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Does Not Require Its Regional Offices to Collect and Maintain Data on Compliance Assistance Activities", "paragraphs": ["According to EPA headquarters officials, OECA stopped requiring  regional offices to collect data and report on their compliance assistance  activities around 2012.

OECA\u2019s Assistant Administrator has discussed the known limitations of  EPA\u2019s data in the annual reports. In a February 26, 2019, testimony  before Congress, OECA\u2019s Assistant Administrator stated that the  averages for some of the metrics used in EPA\u2019s annual results report  cannot be interpreted to represent a statistical trend. OECA\u2019s Assistant  Administrator also stated that changes in the number of enforcement  actions may be a function of changes in programmatic decisions and may  not be reflective of changes in the underlying compliance of regulated  entities with environmental statutes. By including the known limitations of  data in its annual reports and providing information on the intended use of  EPA\u2019s data, as called for by leading practices for transparently reporting  government data and as exemplified in existing EPA guidance for  environmental data, EPA would have better assurance that Congress and  the public are informed about the data presented and how the data  should be interpreted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["EPA collects a range of information and uses the information to manage  its enforcement and compliance program and assess how well its efforts  are meeting the objectives outlined in the agency\u2019s strategic plan and  other documents. However, while most of the regional offices collect data  on some informal enforcement actions, they use different mechanisms to  maintain these data, and the agency has not provided guidance to  regional offices on how they should collect or maintain the data. Without  documenting in guidance to the regional offices how they should collect  data on informal enforcement actions and specifying which mechanism to  use to maintain the data, EPA lacks assurance that the regional offices  will consistently collect and maintain these data. On September 30, 2019,  EPA issued a memorandum that provides definitions for enforcement  response tools, including informal enforcement actions and instructions  on how to report such actions. We view this as a step in the right  direction. Now that the agency has finalized its definition of informal  enforcement actions and provided instructions on how regional offices  should report such actions, by clearly documenting in guidance on how  regional offices should use the definition to collect data on these actions,  EPA would have better assurance that the regional offices consistently  collect and maintain these data.", "Similarly, EPA does not have complete information on its compliance  monitoring and enforcement activities because the agency does not  require the collection of data on compliance assistance activities. As a  result, the agency has not issued guidance instructing regional offices to  collect such data and specifying which mechanism to use to maintain  them. Without clearly documenting in guidance to the regional offices that  they should collect data on compliance assistance activities and  specifying which mechanism to use to maintain the data, such as ICIS,  EPA will lack key information. Such information is needed to track  progress toward its strategic objective of increasing the agency\u2019s use of  compliance assistance activities to help regulated entities comply with  laws and regulations.", "While EPA communicates the results of its compliance monitoring  activities and enforcement actions through its website and annual reports,  neither of its 2018 annual reports includes a readily identifiable section or  appendix that discusses the known limitations of the data. The 2018  annual results report also does not fully describe how the data in the  report should be interpreted, given the known data limitations the report  contains.

This memorandum provides guidance on EPA definitions for  enforcement response tools, to promote consistency and clarity in the use  of enforcement terms, according to EPA. EPA also said that the guidance  defines \u201cinformal enforcement action.\u201d The guidance includes instructions  on how to report such actions. The guidance states that, with two  exceptions, headquarters and regional offices are expected to report, in  ICIS, all informal enforcement actions across all programs that meet the  new definition. In addition, the guidance states that because it is only a  definitional document and does not include guidance on appropriate use  of the enforcement response policy tools, the agency will work to identify  the specific changes in practice needed (i.e., changes in use and  reporting). The guidance states that EPA anticipates that informal  enforcement actions meeting the new definition will be included in the  agency\u2019s certified annual enforcement results beginning in fiscal year  2020. We view EPA\u2019s guidance as a step in the right direction, and the  guidance states that EPA will provide training and additional guidance for  enforcement staff to ensure consistent implementation across regional  offices and headquarters. Additional guidance will provide EPA with an  opportunity to specify how regional offices are to use the definition of  informal enforcement to collect data on these actions. We modified our  recommendation because EPA\u2019s recent guidance specifies mechanisms  for EPA employees to maintain data on informal enforcement actions.", "In response to our second recommendation to clearly document in  guidance that regional offices should collect data on compliance  assistance activities and specify a mechanism to maintain the data, EPA  said that it would collect data on compliance assistance for each of the  National Compliance Initiatives and maintain those data in ICIS. In  response to our third recommendation to include known data limitations in  annual reports and provide information on intended use of its data, EPA  stated that it acknowledges the importance of providing information about  a dataset to facilitate proper interpretation. For that reason, EPA said that,  in time for its fiscal year 2020 report, the agency will create a webpage to  describe how best to interpret the data presented in the agency\u2019s Fiscal  Year EPA Enforcement and Compliance Annual Results report and  include a reference to that webpage in the report itself as well as the Year  in Review report.", "In technical comments related to our third recommendation, EPA stated  that several of the limitations we identified in the report do not affect the  data included in its Fiscal Year EPA Enforcement and Compliance Annual  Results report.
