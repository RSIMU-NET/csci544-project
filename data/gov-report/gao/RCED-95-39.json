You asked us to review recent regulatory changes affecting three aspects of the industry\u2014gathering (the collection of gas from wells for delivery to a processing plant or pipeline); storage (the holding of gas, normally in underground reservoirs, for later use); and market hubs (interconnection points among several pipelines where gas and transportation services can be obtained easily). Specifically, you requested that we ascertain how producers, pipeline companies, and end-users view these changes.

Compared with transportation pipelines, gathering lines are generally smaller in diameter and shorter in length, and require relatively lower pressure to push the gas through the line. According to a recent report, over 2,100 companies perform gathering services in the states that produce natural gas.", "Natural gas storage involves the transfer of natural gas from the production field to a depleted underground reservoir or other holding facility for later use. Gas is generally injected into storage facilities during warmer months, when demand is lower, and withdrawn during winter months. Traditionally, pipeline companies use storage to manage and balance the movement of gas throughout their systems. Local distribution companies\u2014the companies that deliver gas from the interstate pipeline to the ultimate end-user\u2014have a critical need for storage because they must provide gas on demand to residential end-users and other customers who lack the ability to switch to another fuel when gas is not available. According to the Energy Information Administration, as of December 31, 1993, a total of 103 operators were providing storage service in the United States. These operators included pipeline companies, local distribution companies, and independent marketers.", "Market hubs are areas where several pipelines connect, generally near a production area, storage field, or major market area. A relatively new phenomenon in the industry, hubs create central points where many buyers and sellers can come together to obtain natural gas and a variety of services. These services can be physical, such as transportation, storage, or the transfer of gas from one pipeline to another, or they can be contractual, such as the trading of titles to gas supplies. In theory, market hubs can improve the efficiency and flexibility of the interstate gas market by increasing producers\u2019 and end-users\u2019 access to each other and by reducing transaction costs when they make deals. According to FERC, as of July 1994, there were 19 market centers operating in the United States, and another 11 are scheduled to be opened by the end of 1995. Each of these hubs has an administrator who oversees its operation and performs a variety of functions, such as tracking the exchange of titles to gas supplies, invoicing customers for services, and allocating pipeline capacity and services at the hub when they are in short supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry\u2019s Reaction Is Mixed to FERC\u2019s New Policy on Gathering", "paragraphs": ["In May 1994, FERC announced its policy on interstate pipeline companies\u2019 gathering affiliates. In a series of seven orders, the Commission concluded that it does not have the authority to regulate the rates charged by affiliates. However, FERC added that it could use its authority to regulate the rates charged by interstate pipeline companies for gathering, transportation, and other services to regulate a gathering affiliate if the affiliate and its parent pipeline company act together in a collusive and anticompetitive manner. This policy has generally been accepted by pipeline companies, local distribution companies, and end-users. While producers are generally reserving judgment on the new policy, several are concerned about its effect on their ability to negotiate fair agreements with gathering affiliates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FERC\u2019s Regulation of Gathering Services", "paragraphs": ["FERC has traditionally included the costs of gathering services provided by interstate pipeline companies in the rates it approves for such companies.

Most of these unregulated gatherers, who provide almost 70 percent of the gathering services in the United States, are free to negotiate with their customers on the rates, terms, and conditions of service.", "Since the early 1990s, several interstate pipeline companies have created affiliates to provide their gathering services. These pipeline companies asked FERC for permission to sell their gathering facilities to the new affiliates. The requests created a need for FERC to clarify its policy on gathering affiliates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1994 Orders Clarify FERC\u2019s Policy on Gathering", "paragraphs": ["On May 27, 1994, FERC issued a series of seven orders that, taken together, define its new policy on gathering. In these orders, FERC elaborating that it does not have the authority to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of the gathering services provided by interstate pipeline companies\u2019 affiliates. As a result, when pipeline companies sell their gathering facilities to their affiliates, the rates these affiliates charge will no longer be under FERC\u2019s regulation.", "However, FERC also said it would do the following:", "Require pipeline companies, before they sell their gathering facilities to an affiliate or unregulated third party, to negotiate new contracts with existing customers. If the pipeline company is unable to reach agreement with a customer, it must offer a \u201cdefault contract\u201d that reflects the rates, terms, and conditions of service offered by the independent gatherers in the region. If the customer refuses the default contract, it loses its guarantee of continued service. FERC imposed this condition to protect existing customers that had entered into arrangements with pipeline companies for gathering services expecting that these services would be regulated by FERC.", "Assert jurisdiction over gathering affiliates if it finds, upon a customer\u2019s complaint, that the affiliate and its parent pipeline company have acted together in a collusive and anticompetitive manner. For example, FERC could assert its jurisdiction, as part of its regulation of the pipeline company, if a gathering affiliate requires a customer to transport gas on the parent company\u2019s pipeline. Under the new policy, FERC will regulate a gathering affiliate only if the affiliate acts with its parent company in an anticompetitive manner.", "In analyzing its jurisdiction, FERC asserted that sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act give it the authority to regulate gathering performed by natural gas companies (i.e., interstate pipeline companies) \u201cin connection with\u201d interstate transportation. Gathering affiliates, because they perform only a gathering function, are not natural gas companies as defined by the act. Thus, FERC reasoned that gathering affiliates are not under its jurisdiction. FERC determined, however, that it may assert jurisdiction when the pipeline company and its gathering affiliate act together to discriminate because they are then effectively acting as a single natural gas company involved in the interstate transportation of natural gas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reaction to FERC\u2019s Gathering Policy Is Mixed", "paragraphs": ["The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, the trade association that represents interstate pipeline companies, has stated that it is pleased with FERC\u2019s new policy and believes the policy will promote competition and regulatory certainty. As a result of this policy, pipeline companies will be able to sell their gathering facilities to affiliates, which, in turn, can set rates that are competitive with those set by unregulated gatherers. According to an association official responsible for policy issues, many pipeline companies plan to sell their gathering facilities to either affiliates or independent third parties in response to the new policy.", "The representatives of local distribution companies and end-users we interviewed expressed little concern about FERC\u2019s new policy on gathering. An official of the American Gas Association, which represents, among others, larger distribution companies, stated that the association has received no complaints from the local distribution companies among its members about the new policy. According to a representative of municipal distributors, smaller distribution companies have little interest in the issue of gathering. Distribution companies and the residential, commercial, and industrial end-users to whom they deliver gas are more concerned about the price of gas supplies, which is determined by the market. Because gathering rates affect the division of proceeds from gas sales, they concern only producers and gatherers.", "In contrast to other segments of the industry, producers generally believe that it is too early to determine the effects of FERC\u2019s new policy. According to a representative of the Natural Gas Supply Association, the trade association representing major producers, several producers are concerned that they will not be able to get fair rates, terms, and conditions of service in their negotiations with pipeline companies or in default contracts. Although producers are generally pleased that FERC will review the sale of gathering facilities to affiliates on a case-by-case basis, several believe that unless FERC establishes clearer guidelines on the terms of the default contracts, the affiliates that have market power could impose significantly higher rates for gathering services for existing wells. In cases in which a producer and a gathering affiliate cannot reach a new agreement, producers would like to continue the rates, terms, and conditions of service that existed when they originally drilled the well.", "Some producers have asked FERC to reconsider its new gathering policy. A group of six major producers, known as the \u201cIndicated Parties,\u201d and the Independent Petroleum Association of America have filed motions with FERC objecting to the new policy and requesting a new hearing. In the grounds for rehearing, the Indicated Parties and the association contend, among other things, that (1) FERC should regulate gathering affiliates, (2) FERC erred in approving pipeline companies\u2019 sale of gathering facilities to their affiliates without showing that the relevant gathering markets were competitive, and (3) the provision requiring default contracts needs reconsideration or clarification. In addition, the Indicated Parties provided FERC with an offer of settlement in one of the seven cases. In this offer, the Indicated Parties agree to accept the sale of gathering facilities by the pipeline company to its affiliates if, among other things, FERC retracts its determination that it lacks jurisdiction over gathering affiliates. On November 30, 1994, FERC denied the requests for rehearing, but it also amended the requirements of default contracts. According to the new guidelines, when a pipeline company sells its gathering facilities to an affiliate or independent gatherer, existing customers will be able to purchase gathering services from the new provider at the current cost-of-service rates for a period of up to 2 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FERC Has Approved Market-Based Rates for Storage", "paragraphs": ["FERC\u2019s jurisdiction over storage is limited to the storage of gas transported in the interstate market. As a result, FERC has regulatory authority primarily over storage facilities owned by interstate pipeline companies. According to the Energy Information Administration, these facilities hold about 61 percent of the total gas stored in the United States. As in the case of gathering and transportation, FERC has traditionally set the rates for storage according to a storage operator\u2019s cost of providing service.", "Since 1992, however, FERC has approved the use of market-based rates for storage services in six orders. In each case, FERC has required the storage provider to show that it lacks the power to set rates above competitive levels in the local storage market. To do so, the storage provider must demonstrate that there are good alternatives to its service. FERC has defined a \u201cgood alternative\u201d as one that \u201cis available soon enough, has a price that is low enough, and has a quality high enough to permit customers to substitute the alternative\u201d for the storage provider\u2019s service.", "None of the industry representatives we interviewed expressed concern over FERC\u2019s use of market-based rates in areas where the storage market is competitive.

According to an official with FERC\u2019s Office of Pipeline Regulation, as of October 1994, a few pipeline companies have asked FERC to let them vary from these rates so that they can compete more effectively at market hubs. However, the rates they seek to use are not market-based. Instead, these rates, known as \u201cmarket center rates,\u201d are still derived from the existing cost-of-service rates. However, they are generally lower than the full cost-of-service rates.", "FERC officials believe that it is too early in the development of hubs to determine what, if any, regulatory role the Commission should play or what rates it should approve. The structure and workings of market hubs are still evolving. As a result, according to FERC\u2019s Director of the Office of Pipeline Regulation, FERC has not dealt with the issue.", "Most of the industry representatives with whom we spoke agreed that it is too early to determine how market hubs should be regulated, if at all.

Moreover, the association maintains that FERC should generally rely on market forces unless it finds compelling evidence of market failures.", "However, some marketers have expressed concern that some hubs are being administered by competing marketers. According to those concerned, these hub administrators may have an incentive to use their access to information about competitors\u2019 deals at hubs to their competitive advantage.

FERC, a federal appeals court interpreted the act so that FERC\u2019s authority extends to regulating the gathering services provided by interstate pipeline companies if the gathering is performed in connection with the interstate transportation of natural gas. According to a report sponsored by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, interstate pipeline companies and their affiliates provide about 30 percent of all the gathering services in the United States.", "FERC sets the rates for transportation and gathering services on the basis of a pipeline company\u2019s cost of providing those services, which consists of the cost of facilities, expenses for operation and maintenance, and a reasonable return on investment. This approach is known as cost-of-service regulation. Before FERC\u2019s Order 636 (described below), the costs of gathering services were incorporated into the rates that pipeline companies charged for sales and transportation service. In contrast, the rates charged for the gathering services provided by producers and other entities are not under FERC\u2019s regulation. Generally, these providers can negotiate contracts with customers that state the rates, terms, and conditions of their gathering services. Unregulated gatherers provide most of the remaining 70 percent of the gathering services performed in the United States.", "In a 1992 order, FERC articulated a policy on pipeline companies\u2019 gathering affiliates. In Northwest Pipeline Corporation, the Commission relied on an interpretation by the federal appeals court in Northern Natural Gas Company v. FERC to assert that its jurisdiction extended to pipeline companies\u2019 gathering affiliates if the affiliates perform the services in connection with the interstate transportation of natural gas. However, the Commission added that it would not exercise its jurisdiction to regulate the rates charged by gathering affiliates except in response to a customer\u2019s complaint that an affiliate was acting in an anticompetitive manner. This approach was referred to in the industry as \u201clight-handed\u201d regulation.", "According to an official representing pipeline companies, as a result of this decision, many pipeline companies petitioned FERC to be allowed to sell their gathering operations to affiliates so that they could set their own rates and better compete with unregulated gatherers. However, some pipeline companies were reluctant to sell their gathering facilities because they believed FERC did not clearly define when it would assert jurisdiction under its new policy of light-handed regulation. Pipeline companies and their affiliates could not be sure what rates and practices would be acceptable to FERC. In addition, gas producers that purchased gathering services from pipeline companies were concerned that, under light-handed regulation, pipeline companies would transfer their gathering facilities to affiliates to escape FERC\u2019s regulation and then raise their rates substantially. In contrast to pipeline companies, which support the deregulation of gathering, producers wanted FERC to regulate the rates charged by affiliates in the same manner as it regulates pipeline companies\u2019 transportation and gathering rates.", "Also in 1992, FERC announced Order 636, which required all pipeline companies to separate, or \u201cunbundle,\u201d the rates they charge for various services, including gathering. This separation was designed to increase competition and efficiency in the industry by enabling customers to purchase only the services they desire. As a result of this order, pipeline companies for the first time began to charge rates for gathering services that were independent of the rates they charged for interstate transportation. This heightened the pipeline companies\u2019 desire to sell their gathering operations to affiliates that could set their own rates. According to industry officials, because of Order 636 and concerns about FERC\u2019s Northwest Pipeline decision, both pipeline companies and producers wanted FERC to review and clarify its regulatory authority over gathering affiliates.", "On May 27, 1994, FERC restated its policy on gathering affiliates in a series of seven orders. In these orders, FERC consistently stated that it regulates the rates charged for gathering services only for gathering performed by pipeline companies or when the pipeline company and its affiliate engage in collusive and anticompetitive practices.
