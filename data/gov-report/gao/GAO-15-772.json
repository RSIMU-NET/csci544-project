One key change was the issuance of agency guidance in 2009 that provided managers with more flexibility in responding to wildland fires. This change allowed managers to consider different options for response given land management objectives and the risk posed by the fire. The agencies also worked with nonfederal partners to develop a strategy aimed at coordinating wildland fire management activities around common goals. The extent to which the agencies' steps have resulted in on-the-ground changes varied across agencies and regions, however, and officials identified factors, such as proximity to populated areas, that may limit their implementation of some changes.", "The agencies assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs in several ways, including through performance measures and reviews of specific wildland fires. The agencies are developing new performance measures, in part to help better assess the results of their current emphasis on risk-based management, according to agency officials. However, the agencies have not consistently followed agency policy regarding fire reviews, which calls for reviews of all fires resulting in federal suppression expenditures of $10 million or more, nor have they used specific criteria for the reviews they have conducted. GAO has previously found that it is important for agencies to collect performance information to inform key management decisions and to identify problems and take corrective actions. Forest Service and Interior officials said focusing only on suppression costs does not allow them to identify the most useful fires for review, and they told GAO they are working to improve their criteria for selecting fires to review and conducting these reviews. Forest Service officials did not indicate a time frame for their efforts, and while they provided a draft update of their policy manual, it did not contain specific criteria. Interior officials told GAO they expect to develop criteria by the end of 2015, but did not provide information about how they planned to develop such criteria or the factors they would consider. By developing specific criteria for selecting fires to review and conducting reviews, and making commensurate changes to agency policies, the agencies may enhance their ability to help ensure that their fire reviews provide useful information about the effectiveness of their wildland fire activities.", "The Forest Service and Interior determine the distribution of fire management resources for three primary wildland fire activities of suppression, preparedness, and fuel reduction in part on the basis of historical funding amounts. For suppression, the Forest Service and Interior manage suppression funding as needed for responding to wildland fires, estimating required resources using the average of the previous 10 years of suppression obligations. For preparedness and fuel reduction, the Forest Service and Interior distribute resources based primarily on historical amounts. Both are working to distribute resources in ways that better reflect current conditions, including developing new systems that they stated they plan to begin using in fiscal year 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the agencies develop specific criteria for selecting wildland fires for review and conducting the reviews, and revise agency policies accordingly.

However, over the past century, various land management practices,  including fire suppression, have disrupted the normal frequency of fires in  many forest and rangeland ecosystems across the United States,  resulting in abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation. According to  scientific reports, this altered landscape, combined with drought and other  climate stressors, has contributed to larger and more severe wildland  fires, and many scientists and researchers expect fires to become even  larger and more severe in the future. In addition, continued development  occurring in and around wildlands, an area often called the wildland-urban  interface (WUI), has placed more people, businesses, and other valuable  infrastructure at risk from wildland fire. Wildland fires cost billions of  dollars every year and have resulted in loss of life, both of residents as  well as firefighters, and damage to homes and infrastructure. Wildland  fires have also destroyed or damaged important cultural resources and  critical natural resources, such as watersheds that provide drinking water  to communities.", "Five federal agencies\u2014the Forest Service within the Department of  Agriculture and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land  Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park  Service (NPS) within the Department of the Interior\u2014are responsible for  managing wildland fires on federal lands.

In recent decades, increased wildland fire intensity has placed  greater demands on federal wildland fire management programs and  prompted new policies and efforts aimed at implementing more effective  management strategies to manage wildland fire. These efforts take on  greater importance in light of constrained budgets and the amount spent  by federal agencies on wildland fire management; in fiscal years 2009  through 2014, for example, federal agencies reported obligating a total of  $8.3 billion to suppress wildland fires.

To further our understanding  of these issues, we interviewed agency headquarters and regional  officials about these changes. In particular, we asked about the extent to  which changes to the agencies\u2019 wildland fire management approaches  have occurred or are planned and how the regions implemented national  direction and policy. We analyzed the responses provided to us during  the interviews to identify prominent changes since 2009 and challenges  associated with implementing them.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed documents, such as  agency strategic plans and budget justifications, and interviewed officials  to identify key performance measures and other mechanisms the  agencies use to determine the effectiveness of their wildland fire  management programs, as well as any changes they are making in this  area. We also reviewed legislative and agency direction related to fire  reviews, including agency policies and the Interagency Standards for Fire  and Fire Aviation Operations, and we reviewed reports resulting from fire  reviews conducted by the agencies since 2009. We compared agency  practices for conducting fire reviews to direction contained in relevant  agency policy.

These fires have long shaped  the composition of forests and grasslands, periodically reduced  vegetation densities, and stimulated seedling regeneration and growth in  some species. Wildland fires can be ignited by lightning or by humans  either accidentally or intentionally. As we have described in previous  reports, however, various land use and management practices over the  past century\u2014including fire suppression, grazing, and timber  harvesting\u2014have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many forest  and rangeland ecosystems. These practices contributed to abnormally  dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation, which in turn can fuel  uncharacteristically severe wildland fires in certain ecosystems.", "According to scientific reports, several other factors have contributed to  overall changes to ecosystems and the landscapes on which they  depend, altering natural fire regimes and contributing to an increased  frequency or intensity of wildland fire in some areas. For example, the  introduction and spread of highly flammable invasive nonnative grasses,  such as cheatgrass, along with the expanded range of certain flammable  native species, such as western juniper, in the Great Basin region of the  western United States\u2014including portions of California, Idaho, Nevada,  Oregon, and Utah\u2014 have increased the frequency and intensity of fire in  the sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Changing climate conditions,  including drier conditions in certain parts of the country, have increased  the length and severity of wildfire seasons, according to many scientists  and researchers. For example, in the western United States, the  average number of days in the fire season has increased from  approximately 200 in 1980 to approximately 300 in 2013, according to the  2014 Quadrennial Fire Review. In Texas and Oklahoma this increase  was even greater, with the average fire season increasing from fewer  than 100 days to more than 300 during this time. According to the U.S.  Global Change Research Program\u2019s 2014 National Climate Assessment,  projected climate changes suggest that western forests in the United  States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur  more frequently. Figure 1 shows the wildfire hazard potential across the  country as of 2014.", "In addition, development in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) has  continued to increase over the last several decades, increasing wildland  fire\u2019s risk to life and property. According to the 2014 Quadrennial Fire  Review, 60 percent of new homes built in the United States since 1990  were built in the WUI, and the WUI includes 46 million single-family  homes and an estimated population of more than 120 million. In addition  to increased residential development, other types of infrastructure are  located in the WUI, including power lines, campgrounds and other  recreational facilities, communication towers, oil and gas wells, and  roads.

The primary purpose of acquiring these assets is to respond  to fires before they become large\u2014a response referred to as initial  attack. The agencies fund the assets used for initial attack primarily  from their wildland fire preparedness accounts.", "Suppression. When a fire starts, interagency policy calls for the  agencies to consider land management objectives\u2014identified in land  and fire management plans developed by each land management  unit\u2014and the structures and resources at risk when determining  whether or how to suppress the fire. A wide spectrum of strategies is  available to choose from, and the land manager at the affected local  unit is responsible for determining which strategy to use\u2014from  conducting all-out suppression efforts to monitoring fires within  predetermined areas in order to provide natural resource benefits.  When a fire is reported, the agencies are to follow a principle of  closest available resource, meaning that, regardless of jurisdiction,  the closest available firefighting equipment and personnel respond. In  instances when fires escape initial attack and grow large, the  agencies respond using an interagency system that mobilizes  additional firefighting assets from federal, state, and local agencies,  as well as private contractors, regardless of which agency or agencies  have jurisdiction over the burning lands. The agencies use an incident  management system under which specialized teams are mobilized to  respond to wildland fires, with the size and composition of the team  determined by the complexity of the fire. Federal agencies typically  fund the costs of these activities from their wildland fire suppression  accounts.", "Fuel reduction. Fuel reduction refers to agencies\u2019 efforts to reduce  potentially hazardous vegetation that can fuel fires, such as brush and  \u201cladder fuels\u201d (i.e., small trees and other vegetation that can carry fire  vertically to taller vegetation such as large trees), in an effort to  reduce the potential for severe wildland fires, lessen the damage  caused by fires, limit the spread of flammable invasive species, and  restore and maintain healthy ecosystems. The agencies use  multiple approaches for reducing this vegetation, including setting  fires under controlled conditions (prescribed burns), mechanical  thinning, herbicides, certain grazing methods, or combinations of  these and other approaches. The agencies typically fund these  activities from their fuel reduction accounts.", "Risk is an inherent element of wildland fire management. Federal  agencies acknowledge this risk, and agency policies emphasize the  importance of managing their programs accordingly. For example, Forest  Service guidance states that \u201cthe wildland fire management environment  is complex and possesses inherent hazards that can\u2014even with  reasonable mitigation\u2014result in harm.\u201d According to a 2013 Forest  Service report on decision making for wildfires, risk management is to be  applied at all levels of wildfire decision making, from the individual  firefighter on the ground facing changing environmental conditions to  national leaders of the fire management agencies weighing limited  budgets against increasingly active fire seasons.

The report  noted that this has come at the cost of other land management programs  within the agency, such as vegetation and watershed management, some  of which support activities intended to reduce future wildfire damage.

According to wildland fire historians, in the late 1800s and early 1900s,  the nation experienced a series of large and devastating fires that burned  millions of acres, including highly valued timber stands. In May 1908,  federal legislation authorized the Forest Service to use any of its  appropriations to fight fires. During the following decades, the Forest  Service and Interior agencies generally took the view that fires were  damaging and should be suppressed quickly, with policies and practices  evolving gradually. For example, in 1935, the Forest Service issued the  \u201c10 a.m. policy,\u201d which stated that whenever possible, every fire should  be contained by 10 a.m. on the day after it was reported. In more remote  areas, suppression policies had minimal effect until fire towers, lookout  systems, and roads in the 1930s facilitated fire detection and fire  deployment. The use of aircraft to drop fire retardants\u2014that is,  chemicals designed to slow fire growth\u2014began in the 1950s, according to  agency documents. Subsequent to the introduction of the 10 a.m. policy,  some changes to agency policies lessened the emphasis on suppressing  all fires, as some federal land managers took note of the unintended  consequences of suppression and took steps to address those effects. In  1943, for example, the Chief of the Forest Service permitted national  forests to use prescribed fire to reduce fuels on a case-by-case basis. In  1968, NPS revised its fire policy, shifting its approach from suppressing  all fires to managing fire by using prescribed burning and allowing fires  started by lightning to burn in an effort to accomplish approved  management objectives. In 1978, the Forest Service revised its policy to  allow naturally ignited fires to burn in some cases, and formally  abandoned the 10 a.m. policy.", "Two particularly significant fire events\u2014the Yellowstone Fires of 1988, in  which approximately 1.3 million acres burned, and the South Canyon Fire  of 1994, in which 14 firefighters lost their lives\u2014led the agencies to  fundamentally reassess their approach to wildland fire management and  develop the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy of 1995. Under the  1995 policy, the agencies continued to move away from their emphasis  on suppressing every wildland fire, seeking instead to (1) make  communities and resources less susceptible to being damaged by  wildland fire and (2) respond to fires so as to protect communities and  important resources at risk while considering both the cost and long-term  effects of that response. The policy was reaffirmed and updated in 2001,  and guidance for its implementation was issued in 2003 and 2009.", "In 2000, after one of the worst wildland fire seasons in 50 years, the  President asked the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to submit a  report on managing the impact of wildland fires on communities and the  environment. The report, along with congressional approval of increased  appropriations for wildland fire management for fiscal year 2001, as well  as other related activities, formed the basis of what is known as the  National Fire Plan. The National Fire Plan emphasized the importance of  reducing the buildup of hazardous vegetation that fuels severe fires,  stating that unless hazardous fuels are reduced, the number of severe  wildland fires and the costs associated with suppressing them would  continue to increase. In 2003, Congress passed the Healthy Forests  Restoration Act, with the stated purpose of, among other things, reducing  wildland fire risk to communities, municipal water supplies, and other at- risk federal land through a collaborative process of planning, setting  priorities for, and implementing fuel reduction projects.", "Along with the development of policies governing their responses to fire,  the agencies developed a basic operational framework within which they  manage wildland fire incidents. For example, to respond to wildland fires  affecting both federal and nonfederal jurisdictions, firefighting entities in  the United States have, since the 1970s, used an interagency incident  management system. This system provides an organizational structure  that expands to meet a fire\u2019s complexity and demands, and allows entities  to share firefighting personnel, aircraft, and equipment. Incident  commanders who manage the response to each wildland fire may order  firefighting assets through a three-tiered system of local, regional, and  national dispatch centers. Federal, tribal, state, and local entities and  private contractors supply the firefighting personnel, aircraft, equipment,  and supplies which are dispatched through these centers.

In collaboration with nonfederal  partners such as tribal and state governments, they have also developed  a strategy aimed at coordinating federal and nonfederal wildland fire  management activities around common goals, such as managing  landscapes for resilience to fire-related disturbances. In addition, Interior,  and BLM in particular, have placed a greater emphasis on wildland fire  management efforts in the sagebrush steppe ecosystem by issuing  guidance and developing strategies aimed at improving the condition of  this landscape. The agencies have also taken steps to change other  aspects of wildland fire management, including changes related to  improving fire management technology, line officer training, and firefighter  safety.

The extent to which  the agencies\u2019 actions have resulted in on-the-ground changes varied  across agencies and regions, however, and officials identified factors,  such as proximity to populated areas, that may limit their implementation  of some of these actions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Issued Guidance That Provided Greater Flexibility in Responding to Wildland Fire", "paragraphs": ["The agencies have increased their emphasis on using wildland fire to  provide natural resource benefits rather than seeking to suppress all fires,  in particular through issuing the 2009 Guidance for Implementation of  Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy. Compared with interagency  guidance issued in 2003, the 2009 guidance provided greater flexibility to  managers in responding to wildland fire to achieve natural resource  benefits for forests and grasslands, such as reducing vegetation densities  and stimulating regeneration and growth in some species. The 2003  guidance stated that only one \u201cmanagement objective\u201d could be applied  to a single wildland fire\u2014meaning that wildland fires could either be  managed to meet suppression objectives or managed for continued  burning to provide natural resource benefits, but not both. The 2003  guidance also restricted a manager\u2019s ability to switch between full  suppression and management for natural resource benefits, even when  fire conditions changed. In contrast, under the 2009 interagency  guidance, managers may manage individual fires for multiple objectives,  and may change the management objectives on a fire as it spreads  across the landscape. For example, managers may simultaneously  attempt to suppress part of a fire that is threatening infrastructure or  valuable resources while allowing other parts of the same fire to burn to  achieve desired natural resource benefits. According to agency  documents, the 2009 guidance was intended to reduce barriers to risk- informed decision making, allowing the response to be more  commensurate with the risk posed by the fire, the resources to be  protected, and the agencies\u2019 land management objectives.", "However, agency officials varied in their opinions about the extent to  which this guidance changed their management practices, with some  telling us it marked a departure from their past practices, and others  telling us it did not significantly change the way they managed wildland  fire. Several headquarters and regional agency officials told us the  guidance improved managers\u2019 ability to address natural resource needs  when managing a fire, rather than simply suppressing all fires. For  example, BIA officials told us that the flexibility provided through the  guidance allowed managers on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in  southeastern Arizona to use a variety of management strategies to  manage the 2014 Skunk Fire. According to a BIA fire ecologist, managers  were able to maximize firefighter safety while fostering desirable  ecological benefits, including helping to restore the historical fire regime  to the area. In addition, Forest Service officials from several regions,  including the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regions, told us they  have used the full range of management options in the guidance more  frequently over the last 5 years, and they credited the 2009 guidance for  giving them the ability to manage fires and their associated risks. For  example, during the 2011 Duckett Fire on the Pike-San Isabel National  Forests in Colorado, managers attempted to contain part of the fire to  protect a subdivision while allowing the portion of the fire uphill from the  subdivision to burn into wilderness. Officials told us that, prior to the 2009  guidance, they would likely have responded to this fire by attempting full  suppression, which could have put firefighters at risk at the upper part of  the fire because of the steep and rugged terrain.", "In contrast, other officials told us the effect of the guidance was minimal  because certain factors\u2014including proximity to populated areas, size of  the land management unit, and concerns about resources necessary to  monitor fires\u2014limit their ability to manage wildland fire incidents for  anything other than suppression. For example, Forest Service officials  from the Eastern Region told us that they try to use fire to provide natural  resource benefits where possible, but they have fewer opportunities for  doing so because of the smaller size of Forest Service land units in this  region, which makes it more likely the fires will cross into nonfederal land,  and their proximity to many areas of WUI. Similarly, Forest Service  officials from the Pacific Southwest Region told us they are limited in  using the added flexibility provided through the 2009 interagency  guidance in Southern California, in part because the forests there are so  close to major cities. However, in other more remote areas of California,  these officials said they have managed wildland fires concurrently for one  or more objectives, and objectives can change as the fire spreads across  the landscape. Officials from BLM\u2019s Utah State Office also told us that  their changed landscape is a limiting factor in responding to wildland fire.  Specifically, cheatgrass, a nonnative, highly flammable grass, has  replaced much of the native vegetation of the sagebrush steppe  ecosystem that used to exist on the lands they manage in western Utah.  As a result, introducing fire into this area could be detrimental rather than  helpful because cheatgrass\u2019s flammability makes fires difficult to control.", "Several officials also told us that managing wildland fires for objectives  beyond full suppression, as provided for in the 2009 guidance, is highly  dependent on circumstance. Officials told us that allowing fires to burn  requires the agencies to devote assets to monitoring the fires to prevent  them from escaping, which\u2014especially for long-duration fires\u2014can  reduce the assets available to respond to other fires that may occur. For  example, in 2012, in response to what it predicted to be an expensive and  above-normal fire season, the Forest Service issued guidance to its  regions limiting the use of any strategy other than full suppression (i.e.,  any strategy that involved allowing fires to burn for natural resource  benefits) for the remainder of that year. The Forest Service noted that it  was issuing this guidance because of concerns about committing the  assets necessary to monitor long-duration fires that were allowed to burn  in order to provide natural resource benefits. In 2015, during the Thunder  Creek fire in North Cascades National Park, concerns about the  resources needed to monitor the fire if it were allowed to burn to provide  natural resource benefits led NPS managers instead to order full  suppression efforts to help ensure that the resources would be available  for other fires. In a press release about the fire, NPS noted that experts  anticipated a very high potential for wildfire in 2015, leading to agency  concerns that significant fire activity throughout the west could leave few  available firefighting resources later in the season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Made Changes Intended to Formalize Collaboration with Nonfederal Partners", "paragraphs": ["Another change since 2009 was the completion in 2014 of the National  Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (Cohesive Strategy),  developed in collaboration with partners from multiple jurisdictions (i.e.,  tribal, state, and local governments, nongovernmental partners, and  public stakeholders) and aimed at coordinating wildland fire management  activities around common wildland fire management goals. The  agencies have a long history of collaboration with nonfederal partners in  various aspects of wildland fire management, including mobilizing  firefighting resources during wildland fire incidents and conducting fuel  reduction projects across jurisdictions. The Cohesive Strategy is  intended to set broad, strategic, nationwide direction for such  collaboration.", "Specifically, the Cohesive Strategy provides a nationwide framework  designed to more fully integrate fire management efforts across  jurisdictions, manage risks, and protect firefighters, property, and  landscapes by setting \u201cbroad, strategic, and national-level direction as a  foundation for implementing actions and activities across the nation.\u201d  The vision of the Cohesive Strategy is \u201cto safely and effectively extinguish  fire, when needed; use fire where allowable; manage our natural  resources; and as a nation, live with wildland fire.\u201d The Cohesive Strategy  identified three goals: (1) landscapes across all jurisdictions are resilient  to fire-related disturbances in accordance with management objectives;  (2) human populations and infrastructure can withstand wildfire without  loss of life or property; and (3) all jurisdictions participate in developing  and implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire  management decisions. According to a senior Forest Service official, the  Wildland Fire Leadership Council is responsible for providing a national,  intergovernmental platform for implementing the strategy. In September  2014, an interim National Cohesive Strategy Implementation Task Group  completed an implementation framework that included potential roles,  responsibilities, and membership for a \u201cnational strategic committee\u201d that  is intended to provide oversight and leadership on implementing the  strategy.", "Agency officials differed in the extent to which they viewed the Cohesive  Strategy as having a significant effect on their wildland fire management  activities. On the one hand, several headquarters and regional agency  officials told us the Cohesive Strategy has improved wildland fire  management. For example, Forest Service officials from the Southern  Region told us the Cohesive Strategy has reinforced existing work that  better enabled them to collaborate on new projects, which they told us is  important because nearly 85 percent of the land base in the region is  privately owned, and little could be achieved without collaboration. Forest  Service officials cited one instance in which they signed a regional level  agreement that will cover several state chapters of The Nature  Conservancy to exchange resources for fuel reduction treatment and to  promote public understanding of its benefits\u2014an action they said was  supported by the Cohesive Strategy. Similarly, Forest Service officials  from the Intermountain Region told us about several efforts that have  been implemented across their region that they attribute to the Cohesive  Strategy. For example, in 2014, the Forest Service, the state of Utah, and  other stakeholders collaborated on the implementation of Utah\u2019s  Catastrophic Wildfire Reduction Strategy, which aims to identify where  fuel treatment across the state would be most beneficial. In contrast,  many officials told us they have collaborated with partners for years and  did not find the additional direction provided through the Cohesive  Strategy to be much different than how they already operated. For  example, several regional BLM, FWS, and NPS officials told us they have  long worked with nonfederal partners on issues related to wildland fire  management and that the Cohesive Strategy did not change those  relationships.", "However, implementation of collaborative actions stemming from the  Cohesive Strategy may be limited by such factors as differences in laws  and policies among federal, tribal, state, and local agencies. For example,  while the 2009 federal interagency guidance provided federal managers  with additional flexibility in managing a single fire for multiple purposes,  laws and regulations at the state and local levels typically require full  suppression of all fires, according to the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review.

Several changes, including urbanization and  increased infrastructure built in support of various activities (e.g., roads  and power lines associated with oil, gas, or renewable energy projects),  have altered the sagebrush steppe ecosystem in the Great Basin region  of the western United States. In addition, the introduction and spread of  highly flammable invasive nonnative grasses such as cheatgrass have  altered this ecosystem by increasing the frequency and intensity of fire.  As of July 2015, FWS was evaluating whether to list the greater sage- grouse, a species reliant on the sagebrush steppe ecosystem, as a  threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species  Act. FWS has noted the importance of fire and fuel management  activities in reducing the threat to sage-grouse habitat. Beginning in  2011, BLM issued guidance to its state offices emphasizing the  importance of sage-grouse habitat in fire operations and the need for fuel  reduction activities to address concerns about the habitat, more than half  of which is located on BLM-managed lands. In 2014, the agency issued  guidance reiterating this importance and stating that it would make  changes in funding to allow field units to place greater focus on reducing  fire\u2019s threats in sage-grouse habitat areas.", "In January 2015, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order  to enhance policies and strategies \u201cfor preventing and suppressing  rangeland fire and for restoring sagebrush landscapes impacted by fire  across the West.\u201d The order established the Rangeland Fire Task Force  and directed it to, among other things, complete a report on activities to  be implemented ahead of the 2016 Western fire season.

In a report issued in May 2015,  An Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy, the task force called  for prepositioning firefighting assets where priority sage-grouse habitat  exists, including moving assets from other parts of the country as  available. The goal is to improve preparedness and suppression  capability during initial stages of a wildfire to increase the chances of  keeping fires small and reduce the loss of sage-grouse habitat.", "The report also identified actions aimed at improving the targeting of fuel  reduction activities, including identifying priority landscapes and fuel  management priorities within those landscapes. These actions are to be  completed by the end of September 2015 and continuously improved  upon in subsequent years. According to BLM state officials, the increased  emphasis on sage-grouse habitat will significantly change how they  manage their fuel reduction programs. BLM officials from states that  include sage-grouse habitat said they expect a large increase in fuel  reduction treatment funding and increased project approvals.

Prominent among  them is the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS), a Web- based decision-support tool that assists fire managers and analysts in  making strategic and tactical decisions for fire incidents. WFDSS replaced  older tools, some of which had been used for more than 30 years and  were not meeting current fire management needs, according to the  system\u2019s website. According to this site, WFDSS has several  advantages over the older systems, such as enabling spatial data  layering, increasing use of map displays, preloading information about  field units\u2019 management objectives, and allowing for use in both single  and multiple fire situations. Officials from several agencies told us that  using WFDSS improved their ability to manage fires by allowing  information from fire management plans to be loaded into WFDSS and  providing substantial real-time fire information on which to make  decisions. For example, one Forest Service official told us that, at one  point in a recent particularly active fire season in the Pacific Northwest  Region, the system processed information on approximately 20  concurrent fires that managers could monitor in real time. As a result,  they were able to make strategic and risk-informed decisions about the  resource allocations needed for each fire, including decisions to let some  fires burn to meet natural resource benefit objectives. According to Forest  Service reviews of several fires that occurred in 2012, however, some  managers said WFDSS did not provide effective decision support for  firefighters because the system underestimated fire behavior or did not  have current information.", "According to officials from several agencies, another example of updated  wildland fire technology has been the replacement of traditional paper- based fire management plans with electronic geospatial-based plans.  Federal wildland fire management policy directs each agency to develop  a fire management plan for all areas they manage with burnable  vegetation. A fire management plan, among other things, identifies fire  management goals for different parts of a field unit. According to an  interagency document describing geospatial-based plans, agency officials  expect such plans to increase efficiency because the plans can more  easily be updated to account for changes in the landscape resulting from  fires, fuel reduction treatments, and other management activities. In  addition, the electronic format is designed to allow plans to more easily be  shared across multiple users, including personnel responding to wildland  fires. Agency officials mentioned other technological improvements, such  as the development of an \u201cEnterprise Geospatial Portal\u201d providing  wildland fire data in geospatial form using a Web-based platform,  although many officials also told us that additional improvements are  needed in wildland fire technology overall.", "In addition to specific technologies, in 2012 the Forest Service and  Interior issued a report titled \u201cWildland Fire Information and Technology:  Strategy, Governance, and Investments,\u201d representing the agencies\u2019  efforts to develop a common wildland fire information and technology  vision and strategy. The agencies signed a Memorandum of  Understanding later that same year intended to establish a common  management approach for information and technology services.  Nevertheless, the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review concluded that the  wildland fire management community does not have an agenda for  innovation and technology adoption or a list of priorities, stating that the  wildland fire community \u201csometimes struggles to define common  technology priorities and implement integrated, enterprise-level solutions\u201d  and noting that there are more than 400 information technology systems  in use by the wildland fire community. The report provides  recommendations on actions the agencies could consider for  improvement; however, because it was issued in May 2015, it is too early  to determine what, if any, actions the agencies have taken.

During a wildland fire, staff  from \u201cincident management teams\u201d with specific wildland firefighting and  management training manage the response, and line officers associated  with the land unit where the fire is occurring must approve major  decisions that incident management teams make during the response.  Officials at BLM\u2019s Oregon/Washington State Office, for example, told us  they provide line officers with day-long simulation exercises, as well as  shadowing opportunities that give line officers experience on actual  wildland fires.

For example, several performance measures for both agencies use  a \u201cstratified cost index\u201d to help analyze suppression costs on wildfires.  The index is based on a model that compares the suppression costs of  fires that have similar characteristics, such as fire size, fuel types, and  proximity to communities, and identifies the percentage of fires with  suppression costs that exceeded the index. We found in a June 2007  report, however, that the index was not entirely reliable and that using the  index as the basis for comparison may not allow the agencies to  accurately identify fires where more, or more-expensive, resources than  needed were used. The agencies continue to use the index, but have  acknowledged its shortcomings. The Forest Service reported in its fiscal  year 2016 budget justification to Congress that improvements were  forthcoming. In April 2015, Forest Service officials told us they have  incorporated detailed geospatial information into the model on which the  index is based to help yield more accurate predictions of suppression  expenditures and have submitted the model for peer review.

It may  also incorporate factors measuring the relative importance of these  resources and the expected effects that might occur from fire. The Forest  Service plans to establish a national baseline measure for this index in  2015 and then periodically remeasure it, likely every 2 years, to determine  if overall risk has been reduced, according to Forest Service officials.

Without such  information, we concluded that the agencies could not ensure that fuel  reduction funds were directed to the areas where they can best minimize  risk to communities and natural and cultural resources. Accordingly, we  recommended that the agencies take actions to develop additional  information on fuel treatment effectiveness. While the agencies took  steps to address this recommendation, they are continuing efforts to  improve their understanding of fuel treatment effectiveness. For example,  the Forest Service and Interior agencies use a system called Fuel  Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring to document and assess fuel  reduction treatment effectiveness. The Forest Service began requiring  such assessments in 2011 and Interior requested such assessments be  completed starting in 2012. Under this approach, the agencies are to  complete a monitoring report whenever a wildfire interacts with a fuel  treatment and enter the information into the system.

However, the agencies have not developed specific  criteria for selecting fire incidents for review. Forest Service officials told  us that, rather than selecting all fires with federal expenditures of  $10 million or more, they changed their approach to selecting fires to  review. These officials told us that focusing exclusively on suppression  costs when selecting fires limits the agency in choosing those fires where  it can obtain important information and best assess management actions  and ensure they are appropriate, risk-based, and effective. Forest Service  officials told us the agency judgmentally selects incidents to review based  on a range of broad criteria, such as complexity and national significance,  taking into account political, social, natural resource, or policy concerns.  Using these broad selection criteria, the Forest Service reviewed 5  wildland fires that occurred in 2012 and 10 that occurred in 2013.  However, with these broad criteria it is not clear why the Forest Service  selected those particular fires and not others. For example, the 2013 Rim  Fire, which cost over $100 million to suppress\u2014by far the costliest fire to  suppress that year\u2014and burned over 250,000 acres of land, was not  among the 2013 fires selected for review.

Nevertheless, Forest Service officials also acknowledged the need to  develop more specific criteria for selecting fires to review and conducting  the reviews and, in July 2015, told us they are working to update their  criteria for doing so.

Interior  headquarters officials told us that FWS and NPS have continued to follow  the direction provided through their policies regarding reviews of fires that  met the $10 million threshold. Interior headquarters officials, however,  acknowledged the need to improve Interior\u2019s approach to selecting fires  for review to focus more on information about decision making rather than  fire costs. In July 2015, the officials told us they plan to develop criteria  other than cost for use by all Interior agencies in selecting fires to review,  and that they plan to develop standard criteria for implementing the  reviews. They stated that they expect this department-wide effort to be  completed by the end of calendar year 2015 but did not provide  information about how they planned to develop such criteria or the factors  they would consider.", "Agency reports have likewise cited the need to improve both the  processes for selecting fires for review and the implementation of the  reviews.

As noted,  both agencies have acknowledged the need to improve their criteria for  selecting fires to review and conducting the reviews. By developing  specific criteria in agency policies for selecting fires for review and  conducting the reviews, the agencies may enhance their ability to help  ensure that their fire reviews provide useful information and meaningful  results. This is consistent with our previous body of work on performance  management, which has shown that it is important for agencies to collect  performance information to inform key management decisions, such as  how to identify problems and take corrective actions and how to identify  and share effective approaches.

That system, however, was terminated in  the early 2000s, according to agency officials. Relying on the results from  the last year NFMAS was used, and making only incremental changes  from year to year, the Forest Service and Interior have not made  significant shifts in the funding distribution across their respective regions  and agencies over time, and they have generally maintained the same  number and configuration of firefighting assets (e.g., fire engines and  crews) in the same geographic areas from year to year. Several agency  officials, however, told us that these amounts no longer reflect current  conditions, in part because of changes to the landscape resulting from  increased human development, climate change, and changes to land  management policies that consider natural resource values differently  than they did when NFMAS was in use.", "Beginning in 2002, the agencies attempted to replace NFMAS with an  interagency system designed to help them determine the optimal mix and  location of firefighting assets and distribute funds accordingly. In  developing this system, known as the Fire Program Analysis system, the  agencies\u2019 goal was to develop \u201ca comprehensive interagency process for  fire planning and budget analysis identifying cost-effective programs to  achieve the full range of fire management goals and objectives.\u201d  According to agency documents, this effort proved problematic because  of the difficulty in modeling various aspects of wildland fire management.  In addition, agency officials told us it is difficult to design a system that  could account for multiple agencies\u2019 different needs and varying missions.  After more than a decade of work, and investment that Forest Service  officials estimated at approximately $50 million, the agencies terminated  the system\u2019s development in September 2014. At that time, they stated  that it \u201conly delivered inconsistent and unacceptable results.\u201d", "Since the termination of the Fire Program Analysis system, the agencies  have continued to rely on results based on the terminated NFMAS, but  have begun working on new tools to help them distribute funding and  assets based on current conditions and updated information. Forest  Service headquarters officials told us the agency is developing a new tool  called the Wildland Fire Investment Portfolio System. According to these  officials, this proposed system is intended to model scenarios such as  large shifts in firefighting assets, various potential dispatch procedures,  and changes in fire behavior due to climate change, which will allow  managers, both at the national and individual unit level, to conduct  resource trade-off analyses and assess whether assets are being used  effectively. Forest Service officials told us that the agency is in the early  stages of developing this proposed system and anticipates using it for  planning and analysis purposes in fiscal year 2016.", "Interior documents state that Interior is developing a system called the  Risk-Based Wildland Fire Management model, which Interior will use to  help support funding distribution decisions to the four Interior agencies for  both preparedness and fuel reduction. The proposed system will assess  the probability and likely intensity of wildland fire, values at risk, and the  expected value of acres likely to burn. A key element of this system will  be the development of strategic business plans by each of the four  Interior agencies, detailing how each agency intends to distribute its  preparedness and fuel reduction funding to reduce the risks from wildland  fire on its lands. Interior officials said that, once the agencies provide  these business plans, Interior will assess them in making funding  distribution decisions among the agencies. According to several Interior  agency officials, identifying priority values at risk across Interior\u2019s four  agencies may be challenging given the variation in agency missions and  the types of lands they manage. For example, a threatened species  located primarily on BLM lands may be among BLM\u2019s highest priorities,  but a forested area relied upon by an Indian tribe for its livelihood may be  among BIAs\u2019 highest priorities. Interior officials told us that they expect to  identify the prioritized values and issue guidance on the proposed system  by the end of calendar year 2015, and then use its results to inform their  fiscal year 2016 funding distributions to the four agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service Regions\u2019 Distribution to Individual National Forests", "paragraphs": ["Once the Forest Service distributes preparedness funding to regions, it  gives regions discretion to determine how to subsequently distribute  funding to individual national forests, as long as those determinations are  consistent with policy and annual budget program direction. Forest  Service headquarters officials told us they do not plan to direct regions to  use any specific system to help inform distributions to national forests, so  that regions can have flexibility in distributing their funds and take into  account local conditions and priorities. According to agency officials, most  regions distribute funding to individual national forests based on historical  amounts resulting from NFMAS. However, two regions have changed the  way they determine funding distribution to individual national forests to  better reflect current landscape conditions. The Rocky Mountain Region  uses a new system that ranks each of its forests according to a \u201crisk  priority score.\u201d According to regional officials, use of the system has  resulted in shifts in funding across forests in the region; for example, the  officials told us they have provided additional resources to forests along  Colorado\u2019s Front Range because of increased development in the WUI.  The Pacific Northwest Region also uses its own funding distribution tool,  which considers elements such as fire occurrence and the number of  available assets to develop a weighted value for each forest in the region.

The fourth agency, BIA, generally uses  historical-based amounts (i.e., NFMAS results), but has made some  changes to reflect updated priorities. The regions subsequently distribute  funding to individual land units, typically using the same systems. The  four agencies\u2019 approaches are described below.", "BLM. Since 2010, BLM officials told us they have used results from  the Fire Program Decision Support System to help determine funding  distributions to state offices. The system analyzes BLM\u2019s fire workload  and complexity using four components: fire suppression workload,  fuel types, human risk, and additional fire resources, and assigns  scores to state offices accordingly. Based on the resulting analyses,  BLM has shifted funding across state offices to help better reflect  current conditions. BLM officials told us that most states use the new  system to help inform the distribution of funding to their units. BLM is  also developing an additional component of the Fire Program  Decision Support System to help offices determine the appropriate  number of firefighting assets needed in each area. Officials expect to  apply the new component with their overall system in the fall of 2015.", "FWS. In 2014, FWS began distributing its preparedness funding to  regions using the Preparedness Allocation Tool. Officials told us that  the tool uses information such as historical wildland fire occurrence,  proximity to WUI areas, and other information, to inform preparedness  funding distributions to regions. Agency officials told us that results  from this tool did not generally identify the need for large funding shifts  across units, but rather helped identify some smaller shifts to better  reflect current landscape conditions. Officials with one FWS region  told us that the tool has helped the agency provide better assurance  that funding amounts are risk-based and transparent.", "NPS. Since 2013, primarily in response to their overall wildland fire  management program funding reductions, NPS began using a system  called the Planning Data System to determine what level of firefighting  workforce the agency could afford under different budget distribution  scenarios. The system generates personnel requirements for each  NPS unit by establishing a minimum number of people for any unit  that meets certain criteria. Those results are rolled up to also provide  regional workforce requirements. The results generated from this  system showed that some NPS regions, as well as individual park  units, had existing wildland fire organizations that they could no longer  adequately support in light of reduced budgets.", "BIA. BIA relies primarily on historical funding amounts derived from a  system similar to NFMAS. However, BIA officials told us they have  made adjustments to the historical amounts using professional  judgment. BIA officials told us that the regions also still primarily use  historical-based amounts to distribute funding to their units. The  officials told us they will wait until Interior finalizes its Risk Based  Wildland Fire Management model before they develop a new funding  distribution tool."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Are Working to Distribute Fuel Reduction Funding to Better Account for Current Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 2009, the Forest Service and Interior both used systems  collectively known as the Hazardous Fuels Prioritization and Allocation  System (HFPAS) to distribute fuel reduction funds. Officials told us  these systems, based on similar concepts and approaches, were  developed by the agencies to provide an interagency process for  distributing fuel reduction funding to the highest-priority projects.  Starting in 2014, the Forest Service instead began using a new system,  which, according to officials, allows the agency to more effectively  distribute fuel reduction funds. Interior continues to distribute fuel  reduction funding to the four agencies based on funding amounts derived  from HFPAS, but it plans to develop a new system for distributing funds to  reflect more current conditions and risks. Overall fuel reduction  obligations in 2014 totaled about $302 million for the Forest Service and  about $147 million for the Interior agencies. (See app. II for detailed  information on the agencies\u2019 fuel reduction obligations for fiscal years  2004 through 2014.)", "Forest Service officials told us their new system identifies locations where  the highest probability of wildland fire intersects with important resources,  such as residential areas and watersheds critical to municipal water  supplies. These officials told us the new system allows the agency to  invest its fuel reduction funds in areas where there are both a high  probability of wildland fires and important resources at risk. In contrast,  according to officials, HFPAS in some cases prioritized funding for areas  where important resources, such as extensive WUI, existed but where the  potential for wildland fires was low. The new system has identified  locations for funding adjustments to Forest Service regions. For example,  in 2015 the agency\u2019s Eastern and Southern Regions received a smaller  proportion of fuel reduction funding than they had previously received,  and some western regions saw increases, because results from the  system showed that the western regions had more areas with both  important resources and high wildland fire potential.", "The Forest Service directs its regions to distribute fuel reduction funding  to national forests using methods consistent with national information, as  well as with specific local data. A senior Forest Service official told us  that, as a result, most regions distribute funding to individual national  forests based on information generated using HFPAS, augmented with  local data. One region has developed a more updated distribution  approach. Specifically, in 2012, the Rocky Mountain Region, in  conjunction with the Rocky Mountain Research Station and Forest  Service headquarters, developed a fuel reduction funding distribution tool  that generates a risk priority score for each forest in the region. The risk  priority score is based on fire probability, resources at risk from fire,  potential fire intensity, and historical fire occurrence. Each forest\u2019s risk  priority score is used to inform the region\u2019s distribution of funding to the  national forests.", "Interior currently distributes fuel reduction funding to its agencies based  on the funding amounts derived from HFPAS results that were last  generated in 2013. Interior officials also told us they plan to stop using  HFPAS results and are planning to use the new system they are  developing, the Risk-Based Wildland Fire Management model, to reflect  current information on conditions and risks in distributing fuel reduction  funds.", "Within Interior, officials from the four agencies told us they have  developed, or are in the process of developing, funding distribution  systems and tools while they wait for Interior to complete the Risk-Based  Wildland Fire Management model. BLM, for example, uses a fuel  reduction funding distribution tool that maps values at risk, including WUI,  critical infrastructure, sagebrush habitat, and invasive species data. BLM  combines this information with data on wildland fire probability to create a  spatial illustration of the values at risk relative to potential fire occurrence.  BLM then uses the results of this analysis to fund its state offices. BIA  uses its own tool to distribute fuel reduction funding to its regions based  on wildland fire potential data generated by the Forest Service. That  information is then combined with fire occurrence history and workload  capacity to generate a model that shows potential fire risk and capacity  across BIA units. FWS officials told us they are developing a fuel  reduction funding distribution tool, expected to be used for fiscal year  2016, which considers fire risks associated with each FWS unit. FWS  officials told us this tool will identify risk reduction over longer periods of  time, contain an accountability function to monitor results, and will share  many attributes with FWS\u2019 preparedness allocation tool. NPS officials told  us the agency will continue to rely on historical amounts, based largely on  HFPAS. Similar to the previous Interior distribution approach, NPS  distributes funding for specific projects identified at the headquarters  level. However, if a unit is not able to implement an identified project, the  unit can substitute other projects, as necessary."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Faced with the challenge of working to protect people and resources from  the unwanted effects of wildland fire while also recognizing that fire is an  inevitable part of the landscape, the federal wildland fire agencies have  taken steps aimed at improving their approaches to wildland fire  management. Their 2009 update to interagency guidance, for example,  was designed to continue moving away from the agencies\u2019 decades-long  emphasis on suppressing all fires, by giving fire managers more flexibility  in responding to fires. In addition, the agencies are working to develop  more up-to-date systems for distributing wildland fire resources. A central  test of such changes, however, is the extent to which they help ensure  appropriate and effective agency responses to fires when they occur. The  agencies have acknowledged the importance of reviewing their  responses to individual wildland fires to understand their effectiveness  and identify possible improvements. However, the agencies have not  systematically followed agency policy regarding such fire reviews and, in  the reviews they have conducted, they have not used specific criteria in  selecting fires and conducting the reviews. Officials from both the Forest  Service and Interior told us cost alone should not be the basis for such  reviews and have acknowledged the need to improve their criteria for  selecting fires and conducting reviews. Draft guidance provided by the  Forest Service did not contain specific criteria for such reviews, however,  and Interior officials did not provide information about how they planned  to develop criteria or the factors they would consider. By developing  specific criteria for selecting fires to review and conducting the reviews,  and making commensurate changes to agency policies to help ensure the  criteria are consistently applied, the agencies may enhance their ability to  ensure that their fire reviews provide useful information and meaningful  results.

Our review focuses on changes  since 2009 because we last completed a comprehensive review of  wildland fire management in that year, and because the agencies\u2019 last  significant change to interagency wildland fire management guidance for  implementing the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy also  occurred that year. To further our understanding of these issues, we also  asked about these changes in our interviews with agency headquarters  officials. In particular, we asked about the extent to which changes to the  agencies\u2019 wildland fire management approaches have occurred or are  planned, the effects of these changes, and associated challenges. In  addition, we relied on the semistructured interviews of regional officials  described above to understand how the regions implemented national  direction and policy.
