In  addition, the officials stated that, relying on this hardware has the  potential to expose IRS to equipment failures that could preclude its  systems from supporting the annual tax filing season and expanding the  systems and tools for enforcement approaches, among other things.", "The three selected investments\u2014IMF, MSSS, and IDRS\u2014are also facing  risks due to the attrition of key personnel. For example, IMF program  officials noted that developers are responsible for maintaining taxpayer  accounts and applying business rules associated with the tax process for  a given situation or tax year, and thus require skills beyond creating or  updating lines of code. However, according to an internal staffing report  for IMF for 2011 to 2017, the agency experienced attrition of developers  skilled in legacy programming languages and tax processing, exposing  the investment to increased risks of not being able to successfully  process tax information. For example:", "According to the report, from 2011 to 2017, 24 developers responsible  for performing work on the IMF investment retired or were transferred  to other positions. In addition, as a result of this attrition, 32  developers were available to perform IMF system updates for the  2017 tax filing season, which was about 4 developers (5,840 work  hours) less than needed to perform the work. Further, as of July 2017,  IMF projected a shortage of 3 developers (4,042 work hours) needed  for the 2018 tax filing season.", "In an internal document identifying options to address the loss of  knowledge caused by the attrition of staff for IMF, IRS reported that it has  taken various actions as a result of the ongoing attrition of developers.  Among others, these actions include: (1) cancelation of planned system  enhancements; (2) training and transfer of developers from other projects  to perform work on IMF; and (3) reduction in the amount of development  work being completed for CADE 2 to address a financial material  weakness.", "According to IMF risk logs, the investment also reported potential impacts  on tax processing as a result of the attrition. These impacts include (1)  the agency\u2019s delay in implementing modifications to IMF for the filing  season to reflect changes in the tax law, (2) tax processing delays due to  the lack of adequate institutional knowledge to resolve complex issues,  and (3) a lack of necessary data from IMF, which the agency uses as  input for other tax processing systems.", "Further, according to the agency\u2019s CIO, it takes 4 to 5 years to train  developers performing work on the IMF investment. The agency,  however, is facing challenges with such training and development. For  example, IMF program staff stated that the agency has historically  recruited and trained future developers from within the agency, where  staff had an understanding of IRS business processes and concepts.  However, according to the program staff, budgetary reductions limiting  travel, moving costs, or stipends, have prevented the agency from  continuing such efforts.", "According to our analysis of an IRS report showing staffing allocations  for MSSS, as of April 2017, IRS reported that there were 12 COBOL  developers supporting the MSSS investment. Agency officials noted  impacts as a result of attrition among its developers, such as the loss  of historical knowledge and expertise required to ensure proper  maintenance of systems and prevent disruptions during the tax filing  season.", "With regard to IDRS, IRS officials reported the attrition of 30  developers from January 2012 through January 2017. In addition,  these officials noted that, as of March 2017, the attrition had resulted  in a shortage of 20 developers required to complete work on the  investment. In addition, the agency identified 10 \u201csingle points of  failure\u201d for this investment, meaning that only one staff is available to  support a function. Further, the officials noted that attrition of staff may  result in (1) a delay in updating systems to reflect tax law changes  and (2) IRS\u2019s inability to complete critical IDRS project activities on  time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Three Selected Legacy Investments Did Not Fully Implement Key Practices for Managing Risks", "paragraphs": ["We established an evaluation framework based on leading practices from  The Software Engineering Institute and OMB guidance.

Table 5 provides our assessment of the extent  to which IRS implemented key risk management practices for the  selected three legacy investments.", "IRS fully implemented one key risk management practice for IMF.  Specifically, IRS officials responsible for managing IMF risks stated that  the agency continuously identified risks through, among other things,  monthly meetings. Further, these risks were documented using the Item  Tracking Reporting and Control tool, IRS\u2019s risk and issue repository.", "In addition, we determined that IRS partially implemented the remaining  five key risk management practices for IMF. Specifically, the agency  prepared for risk management by using IRS\u2019s Application Development  organization risk management strategy along with the Item Tracking  Reporting and Control tool, which describe how projects are to identify,  analyze, prioritize, mitigate, and monitor risks and issues. However, the  risk management strategy did not address risk constraints or risk  assumptions. In addition, IRS\u2019s risk analysis for IMF included criteria for  evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity, but it did not  address residual risk, which is the exposure remaining after action has  been taken to manage a risk. Further, the agency\u2019s prioritization of risks  for IMF included consideration of risk criticality, but did not include the  creation of a risk profile, which documents the highest priority risks.", "With respect to risk mitigation, IRS developed a Stabilization Plan in  December 2016 for IMF, and used the Item Tracking Reporting and  Control tool. The Stabilization Plan and tool addressed risk mitigation  plans, which included specific actions to be taken, as well as an  assignment of responsibility and commitment of resources. Further, the  agency documented the rationale for accepted IMF risks and established  a schedule or period of performance for risk handling activities. However,  IRS did not meet the activities for developing alternative courses of action  for all critical risks, and establishing threshold values for acceptability of  risks, or threshold values for each risk category.", "Finally, regarding monitoring, IRS reviewed risks at least annually, but did  not implement a strategy to escalate and monitor unresolved risks, even  though the Application Development risk management strategy outlined a  process for doing so. Further, the agency did not compare risks status to  acceptability thresholds to determine the need for implementing a risk  mitigation plan. Officials responsible for overseeing risk management  activities for the investment also did not review its risk management  process at least annually to ensure that the process remains appropriate  and effective.", "IRS fully implemented two of the key risk management practices for  IDRS.

Further, the agency partially analyzed IDRS risks by  including criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and  severity; however, it did not include residual risks and, thus, may not be  aware of additional risk mitigation actions that are needed.", "Further, IRS did not implement the remaining two practices. With respect  to risk mitigation, as of March 2017, the agency did not include risk  mitigation plans, as required, for 15 of the 20 risks identified for IDRS.  Further, the agency did not maintain dates for risk handling activities for  the investment, as the majority of completion dates and projected impact  dates for identified risks had passed and these dates were not updated.  The agency also did not meet any of the key activities for monitoring  identified risks for the investment. For example, it did not compare risk  status to acceptability thresholds to determine the need for implementing  a risk mitigation plan. Further, the agency did not provide evidence that  executive leadership is monitoring all top risks for IDRS. For example,  while IRS officials closed 19 of 20 identified risks noting that these risks  were tracked by the Applications Development Risk Review Board, the  meeting minutes that we received from this board did not show that the  risks were being monitored. Lastly, IRS did not review the IDRS risk  management process at least annually.", "IRS fully addressed one key risk management practice for MSSS.  Specifically, the agency prioritized risks in the MSSS risk log by assigning  \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow,\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d indicators to identified risks. Further, IRS  identified the most significant risks for the MSSS investment in a weekly  status report which is intended to address the agency\u2019s readiness to  support the tax filing season.", "IRS partially implemented three practices for MSSS. The agency  continuously identified the investment\u2019s risks via several processes. For  example, the agency uses its Sustaining Infrastructure Program to  address infrastructure components in need of replacement. According to  IRS officials and documentation on the Sustaining Infrastructure Program,  the program includes (1) an identification of aging infrastructure  components; and (2) risk scoring and ranking of the components based  on age, the extent to which the asset is associated with critical IRS  processes, and the asset\u2019s impact on operations. IRS officials stated that  this process results in a prioritized list of assets that are candidates for  replacement. In addition, the agency documents MSSS risks via a risk  log; however, the risk log does not include all risks for the investment. For  example, while officials responsible for managing the MSSS investment  told us about human resource risks, these risks were not included in the  risk log.", "The agency also partially mitigated the investment\u2019s risks by developing  risk mitigation plans and specific actions for the items identified in its risk  log; however, the actions did not include a schedule or period of  performance. IRS also did not establish threshold values for MSSS risk  categories, or alternative courses of action for critical risks.", "The agency partially monitored MSSS risks by reviewing risks regularly,  providing executive monitoring of top risks, and implementing a strategy  to escalate unresolved risks. However, the agency did not compare risk  status to acceptability thresholds to determine the need for implementing  a risk mitigation plan. In addition, an IRS official responsible for managing  risk and issue data for the MSSS investment stated that IRS did not  review the risk management process for MSSS annually. Instead, the  officials only updated the date and version number on the document that  captures this process.", "In addition, IRS did not implement two key practices. First, the agency did  not prepare the MSSS investment for risk management.

In addition, the agency did not meet key activities for  analyzing MSSS risks. For example, the agency used criteria for  evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood but it did not document criteria to  analyze the severity of all of its risks or consider inherent and residual  risks.", "IRS cited various reasons for the inconsistent implementation of risk  management key practices for the three selected investments. For  example, IDRS officials responsible for risk management stated that their  current guidance did not clearly address some of the key practices.  Further, MSSS officials responsible for risk management stated that the  majority of the risk management activities for the investment are not  documented. In addition, MSSS officials stated that selected risks were  not documented due to their perception that a reduced budget and hiring  freeze would not allow the agency to mitigate the risks. However,  documenting these risks would ensure that IRS appropriately forms a  baseline for initiating risk management activities.", "Until IRS fully implements all of the key practices for managing risks, it  will be challenged to successfully identify and mitigate risks before they  adversely impact the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its mission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Not Implemented Key IT Workforce Planning Practices", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, implementing effective IT workforce  planning practices can better position agencies to address human capital  risks.
