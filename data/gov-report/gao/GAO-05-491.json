Currently, the Department of Labor (Labor) requires about 3 years to provide certain usable Form 5500 information to the public, leading to complaints that the information is not timely. We have prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority, and it is intended to assist Congress in improving the timeliness and content of Form 5500 information. This report is addressed to the congressional committees of jurisdiction. It examines: (1) the information reported on the form and how it is used, (2) factors that affect the timeliness of Form 5500 information, and (3) issues affecting the content of the form."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Detailed information on private pension plans is reported on the Form 5500, and Labor, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) use the information for compliance, research, and public disclosure purposes. Information collected on the form includes basic plan identifying information as well as detailed information including assets and liabilities, insurance, and financial transactions. The principal users of Form 5500 Reports--Labor, IRS, and PBGC--use the reports primarily as a compliance tool to identify actual and potential violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Other federal agencies and policy researchers also use Form 5500 information. Statutory reporting requirements, processing issues, and current Labor practices affect the timeliness of the release of Form 5500 information, resulting in a 3 year lag, in some cases, in releasing certain usable computerized Form 5500 information to the non-principal federal agencies and others. First, under the current statutory reporting requirements, filers can have up to 285 days after the end of the plan year to file their Form 5500. Second, 98 percent of filings are in a paper format. These take more than three times as long as electronic filings to process and have twice as many errors. Third, the release of the Form 5500 information in the research file--the Form 5500's most practical form--is further delayed because Labor waits until all filings for that plan year are processed, which can take up to 2 years. Despite the efforts of Labor, IRS, and PBGC to improve its content, the Form 5500 lacks key information. These agencies have taken certain steps to improve the content of the Form 5500, such as reviewing the Form 5500 annually to ensure that the form is collecting all the information required by law. However, the form still lacks key information that could better assist Labor, IRS, and PBGC in identifying and tracking all plans over time and monitoring multiemployer plans. Federal and private sector researchers also told us the form could collect better plan financial information, such as 40l(k) plan fees. In addition, federal agency officials told us certain information could be reported earlier than the current filing deadline, such as information on a plan's funding status, as well as its assets and liabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Form 5500 Report is the primary source of information for both the  federal government and the private sector regarding the operation,  funding, assets, and investments of private pension plans and other  employee benefit plans.

As it may prove helpful in the  deliberations of committees with jurisdiction over pension issues, we have  addressed this report to each of these committees. Recent changes in  private pension finance have highlighted the need for timely and useful  Form 5500 information. Since 2000, private pension underfunding in  defined benefit plans has increased dramatically, and additional severe  losses may be on the horizon. Consequently, we placed PBGC\u2019s single- employer insurance program on our high-risk list of programs that present  significant vulnerabilities to the federal government, and policy makers  have given their attention to ways to strengthen and stabilize plan  funding.", "In 1999, Labor, IRS, and PBGC implemented a new computerized system  called the ERISA Filing Acceptance System (EFAST) to improve the  processing of the forms. Because it is important that pension information  be both timely and useful, we are reporting on (1) the information  reported on the Form 5500 and how it is used, (2) the factors that affect  the timeliness of Form 5500 information, and (3) issues affecting the  content of the Form 5500.", "To complete this work, we reviewed the Form 5500 and its filing  requirements and the laws that require the filing of regulatory reports on  pensions. We also interviewed officials from Labor, IRS, PBGC, and other  federal agencies as well as pension experts that use this information. In  addition, we analyzed documents regarding the Form 5500 information  federal agencies collect and their reasons for obtaining it. As a basis for  our analysis of the factors that affect the timeliness of Form 5500  information, we examined the Form 5500 statutory reporting requirements  as well as the preparation and processing procedures for the Form 5500.  We interviewed representatives of the contractor that operates EFAST to  determine the amount of time needed to process Form 5500 Reports.  Further, we reviewed EFAST operating procedures, contracts, and  performance reports, and conducted a site visit to the EFAST processing  center to examine how Form 5500 Reports are processed. We also  conducted interviews with parties involved in preparing and filing Form  5500 Reports, including plan sponsor representatives, actuaries,  accountants, service providers, insurance companies, and financial  institutions to determine the time and effort that is needed to prepare and  file the forms.", "To determine the factors affecting the release of usable Form 5500  information to the public, we interviewed Labor officials responsible for  releasing Form 5500 information products to the public and to government  users. We also interviewed the government contractors that participate in  the preparation of these Form 5500 products. To determine the issues  affecting the content of the Form 5500, we reviewed current initiatives  aimed at improving its content and conducted interviews with federal  agency officials, industry association representatives, service providers,  and pension experts that either use or prepare Form 5500 Reports.

Labor, IRS, and PBGC jointly developed the Form 5500  so that plan administrators can satisfy this annual reporting requirement.  The requirements for completing the form vary according to the type of  plan. If a company sponsors more than one plan, it must file a Form 5500  for each plan. Additionally, ERISA and the IRC provide for the assessment  or imposition of penalties by Labor and IRS for plan sponsors not  submitting the required information when due.", "Form 5500 Reports are shared among Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security  Administration (EBSA), IRS, PBGC, and the Social Security Administration  (SSA), and each agency uses the Form 5500 to meet its statutory  obligations. EBSA is responsible for the administration and enforcement  of ERISA, and its primary purpose is to protect the pension, health, and  other benefits of participants in private sector employee benefit plans. IRS  oversees the tax code provisions of the law. PBGC is a federal government  corporation that guarantees the payments of pension plan benefits to  participants in the event that covered defined benefit pension plans  terminate while underfunded. SSA is responsible for notifying each new  Social Security or Medicare claimant for whom it has pension benefit  information. Form 5500 Reports are also made available to other federal  agencies and researchers through Labor. Once the forms for a given plan  year are processed by EFAST they are available for enforcement and  public disclosure purposes. In addition, after the forms are edited by  Labor, the information is compiled into a database of usable computerized  Form 5500 information, known as the research file, which includes  information from all plans with over 100 participants and a 5 percent  sample of all of the smaller plans. The research file is used by various  federal agencies and pension researchers for conducting policy research  and developing government statistics.", "Beginning with plan year 1999, EBSA assumed the administrative  responsibility for accepting all Form 5500 filings, electronic and otherwise,  which had previously been filed with IRS. As part of the switch, Labor, IRS  and PBGC adopted EFAST, which was designed to expedite the receipt  and processing of Form 5500 filings by relying on paper forms and  electronic filing technologies. Collectively, all three agencies have  authority to mandate the electronic filing of the Form 5500.", "There are various types of Form 5500 filers. Filers are classified as either  single-employer plans, multiemployer plans, multiple-employer plans, or  direct filing entities (DFEs). In general, a separate Form 5500 must be filed  for each plan or DFE. Single-employer plans are plans that are maintained  by one employer or employee organization. Multiemployer plans are  established pursuant to collectively bargained pension agreements  negotiated between labor unions representing employees and two or more  employers, and are generally jointly administered by trustees from both  labor and management. Multiple-employer plans are plans maintained by  more than one employer and are typically established without collective  bargaining agreements. DFEs are trusts, accounts, and other investment or  insurance arrangements that plans participate in and that are required to  or allowed to file the Form 5500.", "Filers have a normal deadline of 210 days after the end of the plan year to  submit their Form 5500 Reports. For example, under the filing deadlines  for plan year 2001, a calendar year filer must file its Form 5500 by July 31,  2002. However, a non-calendar year plan, for example, that has a plan year  that runs from October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002 would have until  April 30, 2003 to file its Form 5500.", "When the Form 5500 was first developed, nearly 30 years ago, more  participants were covered by defined benefit plans than by defined  contribution plans. As shown in figure 1, in 2000, defined contribution  plans had about 62 million participants, while defined benefit plans had  about 41 million participants.", "As shown in figure 2, as of 1997, assets held by defined contribution plans  exceed those held by defined benefit plans.", "As shown in figure 3, as of 2000, employers sponsored over 687,000  defined contribution plans compared with about 49,000 defined benefit  plans.", "Unlike defined contribution plans, where benefits are based on investment  returns on individual accounts, benefits provided by defined benefit  pension plans are partially insured by PBGC. In the case of a single- employer defined benefit plan, PBGC guarantees benefits when an  underfunded plan terminates. For multiemployer defined benefit pension  plans, the agency guarantees benefits when a plan becomes insolvent,  which is when a plan\u2019s available resources are not sufficient to pay the  level of benefits at PBGC\u2019s guaranteed level. PBGC\u2019s insurance programs  and its operations are financed through premiums paid annually by plan  sponsors, investment returns on PBGC assets, assets acquired from  terminated single-employer plans, and recoveries from employers  responsible for underfunded terminated single-employer plans. Premium  revenue totaled about $1.485 billion in 2004, of which $1.458 billion was  paid into the single-employer insurance program and $27 million paid to  the multiemployer insurance program. This is the highest premium  revenue PBGC has ever received. In contrast, in 2004 PBGC paid $3.007  billion in benefit payments and provided over $10 million in financial  assistance to insolvent multiemployer pension plans.", "The termination of several large, underfunded defined benefit pension  plans of bankrupt firms in troubled industries has worsened the single- employer program\u2019s net financial position. After fluctuating over the last  decade, the single-employer insurance program now has a large and  growing accumulated deficit and has moved from a $9.7 billion  accumulated surplus in 2000 to a $23.3 billion accumulated deficit in 2004.  Additionally, the agency\u2019s multiemployer insurance program has a current  deficit of $236 million.

The main part of the form  provides basic information to identify the plan and type of plan. The form\u2019s  schedules provide more specific information about the plan, such as  financial information, actuarial information, and insurance information.", "Form 5500 schedules are used to collect more in-depth information,  including data on assets, liabilities, insurance, and financial transactions.  These schedules can be separated into two distinct groups: those that  contain financial information on the plan and those that contain  information on the benefits that the plan expects to pay out. For example,  the Schedule H is a key financial schedule and includes an accountant\u2019s  report along with an audited financial statement of the plan\u2019s operations.  Information from the financial schedules helps to provide a picture of a  plan\u2019s financial condition, while the benefit schedules collect information  on the contributions to and distributions made from the plan in the current  and future years. Information collected on the benefit schedules helps to  provide a picture of the pension plan\u2019s benefits and benefit promises.", "Different sizes and types of plans must meet different requirements. (See  table 2.) For example, small defined benefit and defined contribution plans  must file a Schedule I rather than the more detailed Schedule H required  for a large pension plan.

Labor is currently using plan  year 2002 and 2003 Form 5500 information for computer targeting. Labor  officials told us that they open about 4,000 investigations into actual and  potential ERISA violations annually. Labor officials said an early step  when opening an investigation is to review the available Form 5500  Reports to identify names and contact information for the plan, its  corporate sponsor, and its plan administrator. Labor officials said they use  Form 5500 data to enforce ERISA reporting and disclosure provisions and  fiduciary standards.", "IRS officials told us that they use Form 5500 data to examine plan financial  transactions and to target plans for examination. Pension law provides  significant tax benefits for sponsors of certain retirement plans and the  employees that participate in them. IRS enforces certain minimum funding  requirements of ERISA and the IRC. IRS officials said the purpose of IRS  examinations is to ensure plan sponsors are making contributions to the  plan as required, the assets truly exist to satisfy the liabilities and are  classified properly, and that plans are operating in accordance with plan  design. IRS can levy penalties, taxes, and interest charges as well as  completely disqualify a tax-exempt plan from tax-exempt status if major  violations are found.", "In fiscal year 2004, IRS examined more than 10,700 plans and 91 percent of  these examinations were based solely on Form 5500 information, and an  additional 5 percent were based in part on Form 5500 information. IRS  uses its Returns and Inventory Classification System (RICS) to select plans  for review based on Form 5500 Reports. For example, after IRS had  determined that a pension practitioner was involved with tax-abusive  schemes, it used available contact information listed on the Form 5500 to  create a list of over 400 sponsors who had filed their Form 5500 Reports  using the address of the practitioner who allegedly designed these  schemes.", "PBGC uses Form 5500 information to monitor both single-employer and  multiemployer defined benefit pension plan activities, focusing on assets,  liabilities, number of participants, and funding levels. Form 5500  information is also used to forecast PBGC\u2019s potential liabilities. PBGC\u2019s  data on multiemployer plans currently come only from Form 5500 Reports,  while single-employer plan data are supplemented with information  obtained from other filings and submissions with the government and  from corporate annual returns. PBGC officials said the agency is  particularly interested in single-employer and multiemployer plans with  financial problems. For both types of plans, PBGC officials said they  maintain a database of financial information about such plans drawn from  Form 5500 Reports, premium filings, and other data in order to determine  which plans may be at risk of requiring PBGC financial assistance.", "PBGC officials also said they use the Form 5500 for participant notice and  PBGC insurance premium compliance. For example, PBGC reviews Form  5500 filings to ensure that plan sponsors of underfunded plans report  sending required participant notices to plan participants notifying them of  the plan\u2019s funding status and the limits of PBGC\u2019s guarantee benefits. If a  participant notice is not issued as required, agency officials said they may  assess penalties. PBGC officials also said they use Form 5500 information  on plan type and level of underfunding to help ensure that plans are  making the appropriate premium payments (which vary by type of plan  and the extent of underfunding). They also said the agency has an  \u201cintercept program\u201d arrangement with the EFAST processor.

Thus, plan sponsors can take up to 285 days from the  end of the plan year to file their Form 5500 reports. For example, as shown  in figure 4, for a calendar year plan that ends on December 31, a plan  sponsor has until July 31 to file the Form 5500.

Plan sponsors are ultimately responsible for filing the Form  5500. However, industry association representatives told us that many plan  sponsors are relying heavily on service providers to help them prepare the  form. In addition, there are numerous parties that must provide  information to the plan sponsor or service provider in order to complete  the Form 5500.

Service providers  said that it can be difficult to receive timely information from insurance  companies, which is needed to complete the Schedule A. Service providers  also said that receiving complete census data from plan sponsors can be  difficult and often leads to delays in form preparation because of such  problems as merging information from different databases, dealing with  non-computerized retiree data, and identifying vested participants who  have left the company. The data collection and the analysis of census data  are further complicated when companies go through mergers,  acquisitions, or divestitures, which can result in further delays. In addition,  service providers said that many plan sponsors have outsourced their  payroll function, which means that they have to get data from another  party, which adds additional time.", "Actuaries said they face certain obstacles that can affect the timeliness of  Schedule B preparation for defined benefit plans. These officials said the  biggest delay is due to funding rules that allow plan sponsors to make  contributions up to 8 \u00bd months following the close of a plan year.  Actuaries said they need to know all of the contributions that have been  made in order to certify Schedule B of the form. In addition, actuaries said  they must wait for plan sponsors to give them information such as asset  valuations, which can take a long time to prepare; as a result, they are  generally unable to begin preparing the Schedule B until May or June at  the earliest for calendar year plans. In general, actuaries said that once  they have all the information they need, it typically takes them up to 2  months to complete the Schedule B.", "Audits are typically the last step in the preparation of the Form 5500 and  can hold up submission of the form in many cases. Auditors said that  scheduling a pension plan audit is often delayed because auditors are busy  performing corporate year-end audit work and preparing corporate tax  filings, and therefore they lack the time and resources to begin auditing  pension plans until after April at the earliest. Officials from the larger  auditing firms said that once they start working on pension plan audits,  corporate work still takes precedence and if issues relating to a corporate  audit arise, the pension plan audit will be put on hold. In addition,  depending on any issues uncovered during the pension plan audit, auditors  said they may need to go back to the plan sponsors, service providers,  actuaries, or even the insurance companies and financial institutions to  seek clarification or additional information. Auditors also said that this  back and forth can be very time consuming, and sometimes small issues  can hold up an entire audit. Once the audit is completed, it is typically sent  back to the service provider, and then the completed Form 5500 Report is  signed by the plan sponsor and submitted to EFAST for processing.", "Figure 7 shows an example of the preparation timeline for all the parties  involved in providing information to the service providers in order to  prepare Form 5500 Reports, as well as the other requirements that the  various parties must meet during this time frame.", "All of the service providers, actuaries, and auditors we talked to said that  given all the various commitments of the parties involved in preparing the  Form 5500, it would be very difficult to shorten the Form 5500 filing  deadline. Even given the current time frame, filings can get held up past  the deadline and sponsors may be forced to file late. For example, if the  actuarial report is not prepared in time to finish the plan audit by the  October 15 deadline, a plan will have no choice but to file late or file an  incomplete filing. According to statistics provided by Labor, 11 percent of  all filers in 2001 filed late."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Paper Filings and EFAST Processes Further Affect the Timeliness of Form 5500 Information", "paragraphs": ["The submission of numerous paper filings and certain EFAST processes  limit the timeliness of Form 5500 report processing. Labor officials  reported that the EFAST system processes approximately 25 million paper  pages annually and that 98 percent of filers used paper forms in 2001, the  most recent year for which data are available; this figure is consistent with  prior years. EFAST officials said that under the current system, all filings  are sent by the filers to a central processing facility in Lawrence, Kansas,  operated by an outside contractor. Paper filings, once received and  properly sorted, are scanned using advanced data capture software, and  in some cases must be entered manually if the software is unable to  process the form. After the forms are processed and scanned, they are run  through edit checks and any errors are corrected. When the processing of  the form is considered final, meaning any necessary corrections have been  made, the information from the form is posted to the EFAST database.  From there the information is then distributed to Labor, IRS, and PBGC on  digital media. According to Labor officials, paper filings take more than  three times as long as electronic filings to process and have nearly twice  as many errors. As shown in figure 8, the abundance of paper filings  results in long processing times, which delay the availability of the forms  to the agencies.", "According to Labor officials and the ERISA Advisory Council\u2019s working  paper on electronic reporting, the electronic filing option of the current  EFAST system has been underutilized by plan sponsors largely because of  the fact that electronic filing is entirely voluntary. In addition, service  providers told us there are some obstacles to electronic filing. First, they  said the current process of obtaining an electronic signature and personal  identification number (PIN) is burdensome and time consuming. For  example, in order to receive a PIN, a plan sponsor must file a paper  application with Labor, a process that takes from 3 to 4 weeks. Second,  plan sponsors also reported that currently there is little economic benefit  to filing electronically because purchasing the software needed for  electronic filing can be more costly than generating paper filings, with no  corresponding benefit. Third parties such as actuaries and accountants  must sign certain portions of the Form 5500 filings, which complicates the  electronic filing process. These officials said they want to ensure that any  information developed by them and attributed to them is not changed or  altered after it leaves their control. Labor and others have made attempts  to address these issues. In 2002, the ERISA Advisory Council issued a  report recommending the use of Web-based technologies and requiring  that Form 5500 Reports be filed electronically.", "Resolving errors on Form 5500 filings, another paper-based process, can  add up to 120 days to the processing of a form. EFAST officials said that  whether a form is submitted in a paper format or electronically, the  process for resolving errors or problems is paper based. We found that the  EFAST system locates errors only after a form has been processed and  seeks to resolve the error by mailing letters to plan sponsors. Labor will  send up to two letters to receive clarification, providing plan sponsors up  to 30 days to respond to each letter. In addition, Labor officials estimate  that it takes roughly 30 days for mailing and processing, thereby adding up  to 60 days in total for each letter to the overall processing time of Form  5500 Reports. Once two letters are sent, a filing is marked complete  whether a resolution was achieved or not. As shown in figure 9, a Form  5500 Report can be initially processed by January 15, but if there are  errors it may not be completed until May 14.", "Labor officials said they initiated EFAST with the hope of achieving  certain advantages provided by an electronic system, including better  dissemination of information to the public, better access to data for  regulatory agencies, and availability of more current data for participants  and beneficiaries. Currently, Labor is looking into a new system to replace  EFAST when its contract ends. The new system would build on the gains  achieved through EFAST, utilizing Web-based technologies and mandatory  electronic filing, as recommended by the 2002 ERISA Advisory Council  Working Group report on electronic filing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Need for Complete and Accurate Filing Records for a Plan Year Also Delays the Release of Certain Form 5500 Information", "paragraphs": ["We found that currently Labor waits until EFAST has processed all filings  for a plan year before finalizing work on the Form 5500 research file\u2014 Form 5500 information in its most practical form for producing aggregate  statistics and conducting policy research. Labor officials said that waiting  for all processing to be completed allows Labor to be more accurate and  not be forced to use estimates for information in the research file. Under  EFAST, the processing cycle for a plan year lasts 2 years to account for all  types of filings, including non-calendar year plan filings. Since non- calendar year plan filings can be due up to a year later than calendar year  plan filings, the research file is often not available to end users until  about 3 years after the end of the plan year. For example, in plan year  2001, 74 percent of all filings were calendar year plans, and for those plans  that were filed on time, processing under the EFAST contract standards  was to be completed by May 13, 2003. Labor began work on the 2001  research file in mid-2004. The long delay in releasing the research file  results in a lack of timely information on the current state of pension plans  for policy makers and researchers.", "The need for adjustments to the EFAST system and the switch to an  outside contractor, Actuarial Research Corporation (ARC), to prepare the  research file have also delayed the release of the research file. Officials  from ARC told us that part of the recent delays in releasing the 1999 Form  5500 research file is that the switch to EFAST in 1998 resulted in changes  to the way that the data are collected and therefore new processes were  required to develop the research file. In addition, Labor has included new  variables that are not in the raw dataset, adding more time. Plan year 2000  marks the first year that the research file will be produced by ARC;  previously the file was produced within Labor. Because of the long delay  in releasing the 1999 research file, ARC has gotten off to a delayed start on  subsequent years. ARC officials said that they are currently working on the  2000, 2001, and 2002 research files. ARC officials also said that there is a  significant learning curve associated with preparing the research file, and  therefore they expect the time frame needed to prepare the research file to  be shorter in the future. They estimated that once the processes for  developing the file are in place, it should take roughly 4 months to produce  a preliminary version.

As stipulated in the EFAST contract, IRS and PBGC receive  weekly updates of processed Form 5500 information, while Labor and SSA  receive updated information on a monthly basis. These agencies are also  able to view images of the forms immediately after being scanned by  EFAST. However, agency officials told us that as with the release of the  Form 5500 research file, they still have to wait for a sufficiently complete  universe of plan filings from any given plan year to be processed in order  to begin their compliance targeting programs.", "Federal agency officials said that old Form 5500 information may paint a  distorted picture of the current financial condition of defined benefit  pension plans. The value of plan assets can change significantly over a  period of time, and the value of plan liabilities can also change because of  changes in interest rates, plan amendments, layoffs, early retirements, and  other factors. For plans that experience a rapid deterioration in their  financial condition, the funding measures may not reveal the true extent of  a plan\u2019s financial distress to relevant federal agencies and plan  participants.", "Federal agency officials also said that it would be useful to have certain  Form 5500 information reported prior to the lengthy Form 5500 filing  deadline. For example, Labor, IRS and PBGC officials told us that Form  5500 Schedule B information, including information about a defined  benefit pension plan\u2019s funding status, is outdated by the time it is filed. As  a result, these agencies are not notified of a plan\u2019s funding status until  almost 2 years after the actual valuation date. These officials said this  makes the Form 5500 an unreliable tool for determining a plan\u2019s current  funding financial condition. They also told us other information could be  reported earlier than the filing deadline, including Schedule H and I  information, which would provide them with more timely plan financial  information, including plan assets and liabilities.", "Labor, IRS, and PBGC officials told us that because of the timeliness of the  information received, their ability to carry out various statutory  responsibilities is hampered. Labor officials said that, in some cases,  untimely Form 5500 Reports affects their ability to identify financially  troubled plans whose sponsors may be on the verge of going out of  business and abandoning their pension plans, because these plans may no  longer exist by the time that Labor receives the processed filing or is able  to determine that no Form 5500 was filed by those sponsors. IRS officials  said the timeliness of Form 5500 Reports also affects their enforcement  efforts, because the IRS has a 3 year statute of limitations. These officials  said that working with older Form 5500 information raises the time and  cost required to complete an investigation because retrieving the required  information becomes more difficult with each passing year. Finally, the  timeliness of Form 5500 reporting affects PBGC\u2019s ability to monitor  multiemployer plans. PBGC officials said that it is a challenge to get  current information on the stability of defined benefit pension plans,  especially multiemployer plans, because of the unavailability of current  Form 5500 data. Multiemployer plan data come only from Form 5500  Reports and are much less current and complete than single-employer  plan data\u2013such data are generally 2 to 3 years older. According to PBGC  officials, a major reason for this is that PBGC can identify the corporate  sponsor of a single-employer plan from the Form 5500 and is often able to  obtain financial information from the sponsor\u2019s corporate 10-K filing. They  said obtaining such data is not possible for multiemployer plans because  participating corporate employers cannot be identified from Form 5500  information.", "Officials from other federal agencies that use Form 5500 information also  told us that the information is not current, a fact that affects their ability to  use the information to conduct program activities, inform policy makers,  and evaluate the condition of the private pension plan universe.

Revisions to the form can also result from  recommendations from entities such as the ERISA Advisory Council. After  the triggering event, if the respective agency deems that a change is  appropriate, it starts the process of developing the proposed change. The  proposed change then goes through an approval, public comment, and  clearance process at the agency level and the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB). The process provides the general public and federal  agencies an opportunity to comment on the proposed changes as well as  helping to ensure, among other things, that any additional information can  be reported in a way that minimizes respondent reporting burden (time  and financial resources). The process to change the Form 5500 can take  anywhere from 1 to 2 years, depending on the nature of the revisions.", "Efforts to minimize plan sponsors\u2019 reporting burden may limit the  collection of Form 5500 information. Legislation requires OMB to review  forms before they are used to collect data. The Paperwork Reduction Act  of 1995 (Pub. L. No. 104-13) and similar previous legislation are designed  to minimize the paperwork burden on the public while at the same time  recognizing the importance of information to the successful completion of  agency missions. The act requires OMB to approve all existing and new  collections of information by federal agencies. In approving agency  collection efforts, OMB must weigh the burden to the public against the  practical utility of the information to the agency. Revisions to the Form  5500 can also include eliminating duplicate or obsolete items. Agency  officials said that they were reluctant to propose additional Form 5500  data collection unless they could clearly establish that the benefit  outweighed the perceived burden. They also said that efforts to reduce  existing data collection requirements sometimes result in a loss of  information.", "Over the years Labor, IRS, and PBGC have made revisions to the Form  5500.

This  resulted in these three agencies, in an effort to streamline the form,  replacing the Form 5500, Form 5500-C, and Form 5500-R with one Form  5500 (the current form) to be used by all filers as well as more detailed  schedules customized to each filer\u2019s type of plan. In addition, the revisions  eliminated duplicate or obsolete items. Since 1999, other annual revisions  have included clarifying the Form 5500, its schedules, and instructions;  adding items on Employee Stock Ownership Plans, frozen plans, and floor  offset plans; removing items concerning delinquent participant  contributions and fringe benefit plans; and changing the small plan audit  requirements.", "Other changes have been proposed that relate to information associated  with the Form 5500.

The  proposal presented three areas of change, one of them to increase the  disclosure of information about private, single-employer defined benefit  pension plans to workers, investors, and regulators. The proposal would  increase disclosure in four ways: (1) reporting ongoing and at-risk liability  on the Form 5500, (2) shortening the deadline for the Schedule B report of  the actuarial statement, (3) publicly disclosing Section 4010 information,  and (4) expanding the information reported on the SAR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Form 5500 Still Lacks Key Information", "paragraphs": ["The Form 5500 lacks key information that could better assist Labor, IRS,  and PBGC in monitoring plans and ensuring that they are in compliance  with the law.

Although these agencies have a process in place to identify  and track plans filing a Form 5500 from year to year, problems still arise  when plans change employer identification numbers (EIN) and/or plan  numbers. Currently, Labor, IRS, and PBGC use the EINs and plan numbers  listed on the form to identify and track individual plans from one year to  the next. However, officials from these agencies reported they are having  problems using EINs and plan numbers to consistently and accurately  track all plans because many employers have numerous plans and each  plan files Form 5500 Reports using the same EIN. As a result, only the  three-digit plan number assigned by the plan administrator uniquely  identifies plan filings that have identical EINs. However, when plan  administrators do not file their Form 5500 with the same plan number each  year, absent a unique EIN, it is difficult for federal agencies to track the  same plan from year to year. Identifying plans is further complicated when  plan sponsors are acquired, sold, or merged. In these cases, agency  officials said that there is an increased possibility of mismatching of EINs,  plans, and their identifying information.", "Agency officials also told us that without a reliable way to identify and  track plans a number of problems occur. For example, Labor officials said  they are unable to (1) verify if all required employers are meeting the  statutory requirement to file a Form 5500 annually, (2) identity all late  filers, and (3) assess and collect penalties from all plans that fail to file or  are late. IRS officials said that EINs reported on the Form 5500 do not  always match EINs listed on a corporate tax return of a business; this  makes it difficult for IRS to individually match businesses\u2019 Form 5500  Reports with their corporate tax returns. PBGC officials said they must  spend additional time each year trying to identify and track certain defined  benefit pension plans so that they can conduct their compliance and  research activities. Furthermore, other federal agencies and researchers  said that the inability to identify and track plans limits their ability to  effectively identify all of the pension plans associated with a particular  company, track changes over time in certain types of pension plans, and  match Form 5500 information with other data sources. Labor, IRS, and  PBGC officials said they are considering measures to better track and  identify plans but have not reached any conclusions.", "We were also told that the Form 5500 lacks certain information on  multiemployer plans that would enable PBGC, other federal regulators,  and pension researchers to (1) identify all of the participating employers in  a particular multiemployer plan; (2) determine a multiemployer plan\u2019s  basis for making contributions; and (3) determine the amount of unfunded  liabilities attributable to each participating employer. Currently, the form  does not collect information that identifies the employers participating in  a particular multiemployer plan. Thus, PBGC and other regulators are  unable to identify all the employers upon whose financial health  multiemployer plans depend or link the financial health of these  employers to the condition of the particular multiemployer plans that  these employers are participating in. PBGC officials said they are unable to  gauge the full impact that events such as employer bankruptcies,  withdrawals, and labor strikes would have on multiemployer plans, their  participants, and the agency\u2019s multiemployer insurance program, which  they emphasized as important, given that with multiemployer plans, an  employer\u2019s pension liabilities can be affected by the financial health of  other employers in the plan. The form also lacks information that shows a  multiemployer plan\u2019s basis for employer contributions, which means that  PBGC cannot determine the impact that events, such as labor strikes,  would have on an employer\u2019s ability to make plan contributions and its  effect on the financial condition of that particular plan. Finally, the Form  5500 does not capture information on each participating employer\u2019s  responsibility for unfunded liabilities. Thus, PBGC is unable to assess the  financial risk to an insured multiemployer plan posed by the financial  collapse or withdrawal of one or more contributing employers, which  PBGC officials said is an important piece of information because of its role  in monitoring multiemployer plans for financial problems, providing  financial and technical assistance to troubled plans and guaranteeing a  minimum level of benefits to participants in insolvent multiemployer  plans. PBGC officials said that the agency needs relevant information on  multiemployer plans to fully assess the financial health of and potential  risks faced by multiemployer plans, and they said that this information is  currently lacking on the Form 5500. PBGC officials also said they are  exploring ways to obtain more useful information on multiemployer plans.", "However, their plans are still in the developmental stages.

They also said  that the form could collect better information to determine the true cost of  administering a defined contribution plan and 401(k) plan fees. For  example, the ERISA Advisory Council Working Group recently reported  that the Form 5500, as currently structured, does not reflect the way that  the defined contribution plan fee structure works. The Advisory Council  concluded that Form 5500s filed by defined contribution plans are of little  use to policy makers, government enforcement personnel, plan sponsors,  and participants in terms of understanding the cost of a plan.

We agree and did note  that in the appropriate section of the report. We have also revised our  report in various sections to state that Form 5500 information is available  for enforcement and public disclosure purposes prior to the release of the  Form 5500 research file.", "PBGC proposed an additional recommendation regarding the timeliness of  defined benefit pension plan funding information reported on Form 5500  Schedule B. The Administration\u2019s pension reform proposal includes a  provision that would advance the reporting date for the Schedule B to  February 15 for certain large defined benefit plans. We agree with PBGC  that advancing the reporting date for the Schedule B to provide more  timely information on such plans to Labor, IRS, and PBGC could be an  important piece of comprehensive pension reform.", "IRS specifically stated that, with electronic filing, EFAST can validate  filings as received, reject filings with errors or incomplete responses, and  minimize or eliminate error correction using electronic correspondence.  IRS also stated its support for our recommendations to require the  electronic filing of Form 5500 Reports, evaluate ways to better identify and  track plans from year to year, and to modify the Form 5500 to collect  additional information on multiemployer pension plans.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Labor, the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Executive Director of the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Commissioner of Social Security,  appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties. We  will also make copies available to others on request. In addition, the report  will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you have any questions concerning this report please contact me at  (202) 512-7215 or Tamara Cross at (202) 512-4890.
