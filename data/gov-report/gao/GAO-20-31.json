Primary sponsors generally assess the value of S&A Center  research through annual performance reviews (through performance  evaluation questionnaires to solicit feedback from work sponsors) and  comprehensive reviews.", "To monitor the execution of research projects, primary sponsors regularly  solicit work sponsor input regarding S&A Centers\u2019 performance, including  the value, technical quality, responsiveness, and timeliness of the work  performed. Time frames for soliciting this input vary by primary sponsor  but most do this annually. These questionnaires include one or more  sections for work sponsors to add comments about S&A Center work and  allow work sponsors to rate S&A Center performance. Some of these  questionnaires use a numerical scale. For example, the Air Force  questionnaire sent to RAND PAF work sponsors asks respondents to rate  project value using a scale from 1 through 10, with 1 indicating \u201cvery  poor\u201d and 10 \u201cvery good.\u201d The OUSD(A&S) questionnaire sent to IDA  work sponsors asks respondents to rate the value of IDA\u2019s work and  results using a scale from 1 through 5, where 1 symbolizes either  \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201coutstanding performance\u201d and 5 symbolizes \u201cstrongly  disagree\u201d or \u201cpoor performance.\u201d", "FFRDC primary sponsors conduct comprehensive reviews at least every  5 years to, among other things, identify the accomplishments made by  each FFRDC. In August 2014, we reported that DOD officials described  the comprehensive review process as an opportunity to take a broad  assessment of the FFRDC and its key competencies beyond the annual  assessments of FFRDCs. Included in these comprehensive reviews is a  summary of FFRDC accomplishments and effectiveness in meeting work  sponsors\u2019 needs since the last comprehensive review.", "In our examination of the most recent comprehensive reviews for each of  the five S&A Centers, we found that the comprehensive reviews  summarize the results from the performance evaluation questionnaires  and assessed the value of the research in varying ways. For example, the  Army questionnaire to RAND Arroyo Center work sponsors assessed  value in terms of whether a project was worth the investment monetarily.  OUSD(A&S) questionnaires sent to work sponsors assessed the value of  IDA work in relation to whether the results were useful, consistent with the  level of effort, and if IDA brought competence, expertise, and helpful  perspectives to the issues. The Army reported in the 2014 comprehensive  review of RAND Arroyo Center that between fiscal years 2010 through  2013, work sponsors provided overwhelmingly positive results that RAND  Arroyo Center performance was \u201cworth the level of effort.\u201d DOD\u2019s Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions, Technology, and  Logistics\u2014RAND NDRI\u2019s primary sponsor prior to the DOD  reorganization in 2018\u2014reported in the 2014 comprehensive review of  RAND NDRI that in fiscal year 2013, work sponsors provided  overwhelmingly positive results that RAND NDRI performance provided  long-term value.", "We also found that comprehensive reviews included anecdotal examples  of how DOD used S&A Center research. For example, the Army 2014  comprehensive review of RAND Arroyo Center highlighted 53 of 114  research projects completed between fiscal years 2010 through 2013 to  demonstrate how RAND Arroyo Center work met Army research  requirements. Likewise, the Air Force primary sponsor\u2019s 2015  comprehensive review of RAND PAF highlighted 28 of 207 research  projects completed between fiscal years 2010 and 2014 to demonstrate  how the Air Force leveraged RAND PAF work to improve efficiency in the  department.

While  primary sponsors are not tracking recommendations, in 2015 one of the  S&A Centers\u2014RAND PAF\u2014began tracking recommendations made to  the Air Force. According to a RAND PAF representative, the tracking  system captures the issue, approach, conclusions, opportunities, and  outcomes for each completed project. A RAND PAF representative told  us that tracking recommendations is useful for demonstrating the value  that RAND PAF provides the Air Force. In April 2019, a Navy official told  us that the Navy is working on a database to track CNA reports, including  recommendations, report topic, work sponsor, and project funding, among  other things, to prevent duplication of requests. The Navy official said this  effort is expected to be completed in 2019. Both OUSD(A&S) and Army  officials told us that while they do not currently track recommendations,  they are considering doing so as part of their oversight efforts. Further,  Army officials told us that it is important for the sponsor that implements  the recommendations to track how and whether that information was  used.", "While tracking recommendations is useful according to some primary  sponsors, some DOD officials cautioned that tracking recommendations  would not provide insights into the overall value across all S&A Center  research. DOD officials told us that recommendations are only one  potential outcome of S&A Center research and that the value of a study  may not be specifically linked to a recommendation. For example, Navy  officials said that CNA\u2019s projects may present the Navy with options and  associated courses of action rather than formal recommendations, and  DOD officials also told us that S&A Center work can provide value to  DOD that is not always represented by recommendations, such as  presentations or research aimed at contributing to the understanding of a  particular issue, but without specific recommendations.", "In February 2019, DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness issued a memorandum related to the oversight  of the Personnel and Readiness Studies and Analysis program. The  memorandum tasked the program director with developing a studies and  analysis program framework that improves accountability for project  results and the implementation of study recommendations. Personnel and  Readiness also issued a template \u201caction memo\u201d providing for an  executive summary of completed projects as well as implementation  plans delineating recommendations made, implementation approach, and  plan of action for each recommendation. According to a senior Personnel  and Readiness official, work sponsors with reports that were completed or  published since September 2018 are subject to these actions. This official  noted that the purpose is to increase accountability of the Personnel and  Readiness staff regarding the use of FFRDCs and to develop an overall  picture of the value proposition of FFRDC research.

A Personal Conflict of Interest exists when an  individual employed by an organization is in a  position that could materially influence  research findings or recommendations and  may lack objectivity due to their financial  interests, personal activity, or relationships.  An Organizational Conflict of Interest exists  when, because of other interests or  relationships, an entity is unable or potentially  unable to render impartial assistance or  advice to the government or the entity might  have an unfair competitive advantage.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires an FFRDC to conduct  its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the  government and to be free from conflicts of interest. To perform its  responsibilities to the sponsoring agency, an FFRDC and its employees  have access beyond that which is common in a normal contractual  relationship, including access to sensitive and proprietary data and  information, equipment, and property. To accomplish this, the FAR and  DOD instruction state that an FFRDC must be free from conflicts of  interest and fully disclose financial and outside interests to the sponsoring  agency. Conflicts of interest can be personal or organizational. Personal  conflicts of interest can be, but are not limited to, financial interests of the  employee or close family members, other employment, gifts, consulting  relationships, other forms of research funding or support, investment in  the form of stock or bonds ownership, real estate, or business ownership.  Additionally, the DOD instruction outlines steps FFRDC parent  organizations should take to prevent and mitigate conflicts of interest.  These steps include, but are not limited to, having procedures in place to  screen employees for potential conflicts of interest; requiring disclosure of  financial and other interests that might affect the employee\u2019s objectivity;  establishing policies and procedures to protect proprietary, privileged, and  sensitive information from disclosure; and reporting any conflicts of  interest to the applicable contracting officer or contracting officer\u2019s  representative and the primary sponsor as soon as it is identified.

Generally, representatives we spoke with from the  five S&A Centers address conflicts of interest annually or task-by- task, which is an option outlined in the DOD instruction. For instance,  RAND representatives said they perform task-by-task, instead of  annual, conflict of interest reviews because staff do not know which  projects they will be working on during the year. In addition, IDA and  RAND representatives told us they screen employees upon hire as  well as when an employee initiates a new project, and both IDA and  RAND have automated their screening processes. IDA  representatives explained that their automated tool screens personnel  at the initiation of each project, by including, for example, a process to  determine if staff assigned to a project have any affiliations with  industry or companies and competitors in the particular field of study.  If staff or members of their households do have affiliations, IDA may  issue a waiver if the financial interest (such as but not limited to  stocks, stock options, and bonds) in a single company is below  $15,000, the threshold for disclosure outlined in the DOD instruction.  IDA representatives also told us that IDA staff are required to self- report any changes to previous financial interest disclosures during  the year. In another example, RAND representatives said their  automated conflict of interest tool screens for conflicts of interest by  comparing areas of work RAND performs to similar areas in the  private sector. Additionally, the system will identify any staff that have  not submitted a conflict of interest statement within a year.", "Providing initial and annual conflict of interest training for all  personnel. S&A Center representatives told us that they perform  training related to or specifically covering conflicts of interest in  varying ways. IDA\u2019s corporate-wide conflict of interest policy includes  initial and annual conflict of interest training elements, as outlined in  the DOD instruction. For example, IDA\u2019s policy states that all  employees are to participate in conflict of interest training upon initial  hire, and in annual refresher training thereafter. The other four S&A  Centers did not explicitly include annual conflict of interest training in  corporate-wide policies, but representatives told us they provide  annual ethics training, which includes training on conflicts of interest,  to their employees. For example, CNA representatives told us they  provide ethics and conflicts of interest training to staff, which is  required by their contract with the Navy. CNA representatives told us  that if CNA staff do not complete the required training, the staff will be  blocked from accessing CNA\u2019s time card system and will not receive  pay until the training is complete. In another example, RAND  representatives told us they have annual training that covers ethics,  conflicts of interest, and culture and discrimination issues for newly  hired staff.", "Representatives from each of the S&A Centers told us they attempt to  mitigate potential conflicts of interest as soon as the potential conflicts  become known and before they become a reportable conflict. For  example, CNA representatives told us that in one instance, a CNA  employee\u2019s spouse worked for the Navy and CNA mitigated this potential  conflict by transferring the employee to another project where the  relationship did not pose a potential conflict. In another example, when a  RAND employee inherited stock in the middle of a project, a potential  conflict of interest was mitigated by the employee selling the inherited  stock.
