These grants are designed to help states establish exchanges--new health insurance marketplaces through which individuals and small businesses can obtain insurance--and review issuers' proposed rate increases. The grant award process consists of a series of steps during which the agency solicits, screens, and evaluates grant applications, and then makes funding awards. Once HHS deems that applications meet program eligibility criteria, applications go through various reviews, including a review by independent experts and HHS officials. On the basis of these reviews, HHS determines whether states' proposed activities are allowable, and if so, whether the associated requests for grant funding are reasonable. Based on recommendations from the reviews, HHS determines whether to award grants to states, and if so, the amounts of any grants to be awarded.", "As of March 27, 2013, HHS had awarded about $3.8 billion in PPACA exchange and rate review grants that states have used or plan to use to develop exchanges and enhance rate review capabilities. This includes nearly $3.7 billion in exchange grants awarded to 49 states and the District of Columbia. Among states that have received exchange grants, the amount of funding provided to states ranges from $0.8 million (Wyoming) to about $911 million (California). Approximately half the states were awarded under $30 million in exchange grant funding, while 10 states were awarded over $100 million. As of February 2013, states had drawn down approximately $380 million of their exchange grant funds. GAO's review of a subset of exchange grantee financial reports indicated that nearly 80 percent of expenditures have been for contracts and consulting services, much of which states spent on key activities for developing exchange information technology systems. HHS also awarded about $159 million in rate review grants to 46 states and the District of Columbia, much of which has funded five key activities, including expanding the scope of rate review programs and enhancing the transparency of the rate review process.", "HHS's process for overseeing states' use of PPACA grant funds consists of several mechanisms. The agency regularly monitors states' grant activities though its review of program and financial information reported by states, as well as ongoing communication with grantees. HHS's process also includes mechanisms to periodically verify state-reported information, including its analysis of states' withdrawal of grant funds and site visits. To date, however, use of site visits has been limited. HHS has a number of mechanisms it can utilize, such as restricting a grantee's access to funds, if its monitoring identifies concerns or compliance issues, but agency officials indicated they have not identified any misuse of grant funds or compliance issues to date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),March 2010, contains a number of provisions that may influence the  availability and affordability of health insurance coverage.

Additionally, each month, project officers also  develop detailed narratives for exchange grants, which include  information on how much grant funding the state has spent, the states\u2019  progress, barriers they may face, and any action items to be taken over  the next 30 days. For rate review grants, project officers also prepare  weekly summaries of grantee activities, and quarterly they summarize  each state\u2019s progress in an Excel tracking sheet. This analysis includes  information on how much the grantee has spent, grantee  accomplishments, and issues requiring follow-up. Finally, on a quarterly  basis program staff provide briefings to CCIIO leadership, and issues  regarding grantees\u2019 progress are discussed.", "According to CCIIO officials, project officers routinely oversee and assess  exchange and rate review grantees\u2019 financial activities by monitoring the  amount and pace of the states\u2019 drawdown of grants. Each week, OAGM  staff provides project officers with reports from OAGM\u2019s financial system  on the amount of funding each grantee has withdrawn from the grant  account, according to officials. Project officers use the reports to look for  unusual events such as large drawdowns or no drawdowns. Withdrawals  are reported at the overall grant level, not by specific expenditures or  general categories of expenditures. According to CCIIO officials, if review  of these reports highlights potential issues, they will follow up with  grantees and determine whether further action is warranted.", "In addition to analysis of grantee drawdowns, CCIIO has other  mechanisms that can provide independent assessments of grantees\u2019 use  of funds. CCIIO officials also indicated that they conduct site visits\u2014on- site assessments of exchange and rate review grantees\u2019 activities\u2014and  that this provides a measure of independent verification of grantee  activities. CCIIO officials indicated that exchange grant site visits are in  their early stages and have been utilized to provide technical assistance  to help grantees establish their exchanges.  For example, CCIIO officials  indicated that as of April 11, 2013, they have conducted 26 technical  assistance site visits at exchange grantees. CCIIO\u2019s draft procedures for  conducting site visits indicate that they will ultimately conduct a site visit  to each state at least once prior to certification of a state\u2019s exchange. The  procedures indicate that the visit should be conducted by a team  consisting of a project officer and key CCIIO and CMS staff, and the site  visit team will review operational aspects of the proposed exchange  including its enrollment process and financial management. Within   4 weeks of completing the site visit, the project officer should prepare a  written report that will include a summary of the site visit, and  recommendations to the state, if applicable.", "For rate review grantees, CCIIO\u2019s procedures do not address the  frequency of site visits, but indicate site visits are used to further engage  grantees, monitor programmatic progress toward established milestones,  track fiscal performance, ensure compliance with programmatic and  statutory requirements, and mitigate programmatic risks. The procedures  indicate that selecting grantees for site visits will be determined by a  number of factors including the stage of programmatic implementation  and complexity of the grantee\u2019s rate review proposal, and the need for  more hands-on auditing or budget review, or both. CCIIO officials  indicated that as of April 11, 2013, CCIIO has conducted two site visits to  rate review grantees.", "CCIIO requires each state receiving exchange grants to undergo three  Establishment Reviews over the course of its grant period. CCIIO uses  these reviews to assess states\u2019 activities and provide systematic  feedback on their progress towards development of an exchange. The  reviews are conducted at certain readiness benchmarks, rather than  specific times.", "Planning. The first review is the planning review generally in the first  quarter after the grant is awarded. The state must demonstrate  preliminary progress towards establishing an exchange, and receives  feedback. The review results in a list of tasks for the state to complete  before the design review.", "Design. The second review is the design review, which occurs after  states have selected their key contractors for exchange  establishment, typically about 6 to 9 months after the planning review.", "States are expected to have established business requirements and  developed detailed plans and procedures for key activities for their  exchange.", "Operational. The final operational review occurs after exchange  development and implementation is complete, to test the exchange  and demonstrate that it is ready to begin operation.", "After each of these reviews, CCIIO\u2019s procedures require project officers to  prepare a postestablishment report describing deliverables by both CCIIO  and the grantee. These reports are designed to provide a summary of the  progress the state has made in meeting the necessary requirements  related to establishing an exchange. The report also serves as a guide in  identifying action items and next steps to ensure adherence to mandatory  timelines. According to CCIIO officials, in calendar year 2012 they  completed planning reviews for 24 grantees and design reviews for 28  grantees, covering 31 of the 38 states with Level 1 Exchange  Establishment grants. As of March 2013, they had not completed any  operational reviews, but planned to complete them between August and  September 2013.", "Finally, all recipients of these grants are required to obtain an A-133  Audit. According to CCIIO guidance, CCIIO reviews the audit for each  grantee. According to CCIIO officials, they plan to use the A-133 Audit  results as part of their Operational Establishment Reviews for exchange  grants and as part of future Annual reviews for rate review grants. The  guidance also calls for grantees to address any significant findings from  the audit and to develop plans for mitigating future problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019s Oversight Process Includes Several Mechanisms to Address Concerns or Noncompliance Identified through Routine Monitoring and Respond to State Change Requests for Exchange and Rate Review Grants", "paragraphs": ["CCIIO officials indicated that if CCIIO\u2019s regular oversight process  identifies instances when a grantee may not be complying with  requirements of the grant, CCIIO uses a five-tier response to address  them, in which CCIIO advances its response to the next tier if its earlier  responses did not address the issue (see fig. 5).", "In the first tier, CCIIO officials indicated they discuss compliance issues  with the exchange or rate review grantee and request a mitigation  strategy, which CCIIO documents in the project records. The second tier  calls for production of management assessment items by the state, such  as a documented business plan to address the compliance issue in a  specific time frame. In the third tier, CCIIO imposes conditions on the  grant award, which identifies the reason for the condition and limits the  grantee\u2019s access to funds, until the grantee provides requested  documentation. In the fourth tier, CCIIO restricts the grantee\u2019s access to  funds until it reviews and approves the grantee\u2019s corrective action.  CCIIO\u2019s final action in the fifth tier is to terminate the grant. According to  OAGM officials, to date they have not had to impose conditions or  restrictions on grants based on their regular oversight. Further, OAGM  officials said that so far they had not identified any misuse of grant funds  on the basis of established program criteria.", "If a state seeks to make certain changes to the terms of its exchange or  rate review grant, CCIIO requires that the state obtain prior approval, and  has established procedures to review the appropriateness of any such  requests. CCIIO refers to these as postaward actions, and they include  instances such as when a state wants to alter substantially the allocation  of funds between major activities funded by a grant (called a budget  revision), or extend the time frames for performing grant activities without  changing the award amount (called a no-cost extension). Eight types of  routine, grantee-initiated postaward actions are described in table 6  below.", "For example, if a state wants to reallocate more than 25 percent of an  exchange grant among budget categories, CCIIO requires the state to  work with the appropriate project officer to obtain approval by OAGM.  Under its procedures, CCIIO requires the state to provide supporting  documentation to justify the proposed rebudgeting. The project officer will  review the request and make a recommendation to the OAGM. If  approved, OAGM will amend the grant agreement to reflect the revised  budget. Officials indicated that the same general procedures apply to  other types of postaward actions.", "Officials indicated that CCIIO also requires states in which the anticipated  exchange type changes (e.g., from a state-based exchange to a federally  facilitated exchange) to obtain approval for a change in the scope of  services permitted under the state\u2019s original grant or to terminate the  grant. As of April 11, 2013, CCIIO officials indicated they are working with  11 states to determine the appropriate adjustments for their grants to  reflect changes in the scope of services they will provide. For example,  CCIIO officials indicated that Arizona was originally awarded funding to  establish a state-based exchange, but the state subsequently decided to  default to a federally facilitated exchange. CCIIO and the state are  currently determining the extent to which the state will continue to  participate in the grant program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for its review and comment.
