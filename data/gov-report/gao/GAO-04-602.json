Nationwide, basin-specific, and agency mission-specific laws create responsibilities for federal agencies to mitigate the impacts of federal activities that could potentially harm fish, wildlife, and their habitat. For example, the Endangered Species Act establishes nationwide responsibilities for agencies to protect listed species, while the Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) establishes responsibilities in the basin to mitigate the impacts of hydropower development, and each agency has mission-related responsibilities to fish and wildlife, such as the Forest Service's responsibilities under the National Forest Management Act. Regarding tribes, federal agencies must consult and collaborate with Indian tribes on fish and wildlife activities that may impact tribal rights established under various treaties and executive orders. Federal responsibilities and activities under these laws, treaties, and executive orders have been defined and clarified over the years through numerous court decisions. Federal agency fish and wildlife activities in the basin are guided by numerous plans and programs, but the majority of fish and wildlife activities are driven by the Northwest Power Act and the Endangered Species Act. Under the Northwest Power Act, the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program addresses all fish and wildlife impacted by the Federal Columbia River Power System, and under the Endangered Species Act, agencies are guided by the biological opinions developed by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the protection of threatened and endangered species, as well as two other related collaborative plans. Agency participation in these key efforts varies widely, from mandatory funding of fish and wildlife activities to voluntary collaboration on the design of activities, but interagency collaboration is essential to successful implementation of these activities. In addition, other laws and specific agency missions drive numerous other collaborative and individual fish and wildlife activities. We provided copies of our draft report to the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, the Interior, as well as Bonneville and the Environmental Protection Agency. Bonneville and the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce provided official written comments. The comments were generally technical in nature and we made changes to the report, where appropriate. The Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency had no comments on the report. The Department of the Interior did not provide comments in time to be included in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Columbia River Basin encompasses approximately 258,000 square  miles of mountains, forests, rangeland, and coastline extending  predominantly through the Western states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho,  and Montana and into Canada.

Endangered species include fish, such as some species  of salmon and steelhead; birds, such as the marbled murrelet; and certain  species of caribou, deer, and rabbit. The basin is also home to 13 Indian  tribes, some of which have treaties with the United States, dating from the  mid-1800s, that explicitly recognize hunting and fishing rights. The tribes  rely on the fish and wildlife of the basin for sustenance and to maintain  their cultural traditions.", "Numerous federal agencies conduct activities within the basin that affect  the fish and wildlife of the basin, as well as the tribes.

Bonneville collects the revenues from  the Federal Columbia River Power System and uses a portion of those  revenues to fund many of the fish and wildlife activities in the basin. The  Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service manages 81,000 square miles of  forest in the basin, and Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management manages  33,000 square miles of rangeland.", "Along with their primary water or land management responsibilities, these  agencies, as well as regulatory agencies such as the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service and the  Environmental Protection Agency, are responsible under various laws,  treaties, executive orders, and court decisions for protecting, mitigating,  and enhancing fish and wildlife resources in the basin, as well as involving  the tribes in the process. In addition, the Northwest Power and  Conservation Council, established pursuant to the Pacific Northwest  Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act),  develops the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program to mitigate  the effects of hydroelectric dams on basin wildlife.", "Recently, Bonneville\u2019s financial position deteriorated significantly, raising  questions about its ability to meet its fish and wildlife responsibilities.  Subsequently, several tribes in the basin challenged the legality of actions  by Bonneville and the Northwest Power and Conservation Council  regarding the funding of fish and wildlife activities in the United States  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In this context, we agreed to (1)  identify and describe the laws, treaties, executive orders, and court  decisions that define the responsibilities of Bonneville and other federal  agencies to perform activities benefiting fish and wildlife in the Columbia  River Basin and involve tribes in the process, and (2) describe the fish and  wildlife plans and programs that Bonneville and other federal agencies  have developed to guide these respective fish and wildlife activities. In  accordance with our policy to refrain from addressing matters that are in  litigation, we did not examine any issues that are before the court.

Endangered fish in the basin include certain species of  salmon, steelhead, and white sturgeon; bull trout are listed as threatened.  Threatened and endangered wildlife in the basin include birds such as the  marbled murrelet and northern spotted owl, and other animals such as  certain species of caribou, deer, lynx, and rabbit. The basin is also home to  13 Indian tribes, which by treaty, executive order, or other authority, reside  on reservation lands within the basin. As shown in table 1, nearly 45,000  members are enrolled in the tribes with reservation lands in the basin. Fish  and wildlife are of critical importance to these tribes, as the tribes rely on  them for sustenance as well as preservation of their cultural traditions. For  example, salmon are part of the spiritual and cultural identity of most of  the basin\u2019s tribes, and are frequently used in tribal religious services.", "Numerous federal agencies, including the following, conduct activities  within the basin that affect fish and wildlife, as well as the Columbia River  Basin Indian tribes.

For example, in 2002, Bonneville  decided that it should not be the primary source of funding for off-site  mitigation projects on federal lands, and placed a temporary hold on  funding for land purchases and easements for off-site mitigation while it  reviewed its financial condition and liquidity position. In addition,  Bonneville changed its budgeting and planning methods from obligations to  accruals in November 2002. Federal agencies, the Council, and some tribes  reported that Bonneville\u2019s processes for project submittal, approval, and  contract renewal and management are inconsistent and constantly  changing. As such, many project managers at the tribes who serve as  contractors to Bonneville reported spending as much time learning and  adapting to changing processes as implementing projects on the ground.  According to Bonneville, the changes were based in part on the  recommendations of a 1997 accounting firm review of program  implementation, and were necessary to improve program implementation,  keep Fish and Wildlife Program costs on target, and align its fish and  wildlife budgeting approach with its other program budgets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Endangered Species Act-Driven Plans and Programs", "paragraphs": ["Under the ESA, agencies must use their authorities to conserve endangered  and threatened species and make sure that their actions do not jeopardize  the continued existence of listed species.

The most recent Biological Opinion for  the FCRPS for salmon and steelhead was issued in 2000. In 2003, however,  a federal court remanded the 2000 Biological Opinion after ruling it  deficient, due to reliance on federal mitigation actions that had not  undergone section 7 consultations, as well as reliance on off-site  nonfederal mitigation activities that were not reasonably certain to occur.  A new salmon and steelhead Biological Opinion for the FCRPS is due in  June 2004. FWS developed a Biological Opinion for resident fish impacted  by the FCRPS, including bull trout and white sturgeon. The first FCRPS  Biological Opinion for white sturgeon was developed by FWS in 1995.", "To develop the reasonable and prudent measures/alternatives outlined in  the FCRPS Biological Opinions, FWS and NMFS rely on technical input  from several agencies, as well as information contained in other fish and  wildlife plans:  Bonneville, the Corps, and Reclamation consult with FWS and NMFS in  developing reasonable and prudent measures/alternatives for  hydropower operation that can reasonably be implemented;  Forest Service and BLM contribute information used to develop the  reasonable and prudent measures/alternatives that address off-site  habitat; and  To the extent possible, NMFS has incorporated information from the  Council\u2019s subbasin planning in their development of the Biological  Opinions due in June.", "Notwithstanding this collaboration, several agencies and groups, such as  the Council and tribes, expressed a desire for increased participation in  developing the Biological Opinions.

In fulfilling this  responsibility, the Action Agencies create Biological Opinion  Implementation Plans, which provide guidance on how the Biological  Opinions should be implemented. The Action Agencies create 1-Year  Implementation Plans, which outline annual goals for meeting reasonable  and prudent measures/alternatives, as well as 5-Year Implementation Plans,  which address longer-term goals for meeting the measures. The  development of Implementation Plans typically involves significant input  from other agencies. For example, Bonneville and the Council work  together to support ESA objectives by integrating the implementation of  the Biological Opinions with subbasin planning and the Fish and Wildlife  Program\u2019s administrative process. In addition, implementation of the  Biological Opinions has evolved as the Action Agencies continue to  incorporate new information from ESA recovery planning processes.", "Many basin agencies provide input to the Action Agencies on the  implementation of hydrosystem operations and configuration under the  Biological Opinions through the Regional Forum (Forum). Key members of  the Forum include Bonneville, the Corps, and Reclamation, as well as FWS  and NMFS, and the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The  Forum is composed of five committees that make decisions concerning the  FCRPS in accordance with the Biological Opinions, facilitating regional  communication and coordination towards fulfillment of the Biological  Opinions. Forum meetings are open to all entities, and interagency  collaboration is an essential element of the Forum. However, some tribal  representatives indicated that they would like to have more sovereign  representation on the Forum. They feel that the meetings neither provide  for a collaborative, balanced exchange of information between federal  agencies and the tribes, nor satisfy the requirement for  government-to-government consultation with tribes on matters that affect  them.", "As further required by the ESA, NMFS is currently developing recovery  plans for salmon (recovery plans) for various regions within the Columbia  River Basin, which outline programs for the recovery of endangered or  threatened salmon and steelhead in the basin. Specifically, the recovery  plans are designed to organize, coordinate, and prioritize recovery actions  for salmon and steelhead, as well as outline objective measurable criteria  that will be used to determine when they no longer need the protection of  the ESA. In addition, recovery plans communicate the vision for salmon  and steelhead recovery to other agencies and the public.", "NMFS\u2019 development of the recovery plans has been enhanced by  collaboration and information sharing with other agencies and groups,  including tribes. NMFS is using the Council\u2019s subbasin planning as a  framework for developing the various recovery plans.

Washington court  decisions ruled that certain Columbia River Basin tribes have a right to 50  percent of the annual harvestable catch of fish at all usual and accustomed  fishing areas. A subsequent court ruling in 1977 ordered FWS, NMFS, state  fish and wildlife agencies, and the tribes to develop a collaborative plan for  managing the annual harvest of the fisheries affected by United States v.  Oregon. In addition, BIA assists the tribes in negotiations with federal  agencies and development of the plan. Known as the Five Year Columbia  River Fish Management Plan, the plan sets forth harvest allocation terms,  as well as efforts to rebuild and enhance fish runs. Since that plan expired  in 1982, harvest allocation under United States v. Oregon has been  alternately managed by additional multiyear collaborative plans and annual  court-ordered negotiations that seek to balance tribal harvest, nontribal  harvest, and species protection. According to FWS and NMFS, their input  on United States v. Oregon negotiations must balance both their trust  responsibilities to tribes, as well as their responsibilities to endangered and  threatened species that are affected by the United States v. Oregon  decision. At present, United States v. Oregon harvest allocation is decided  by annual court-ordered negotiations, although the parties are seeking to  develop a new long-term collaborative plan, to be known as the Columbia  River Fish Management Agreement.   Otherwise, the parties will continue  to revisit harvest and fish management decisions for the Columbia River  through annual negotiations.", "Implementation of measures agreed to in United States v. Oregon  negotiations or plans is handled collaboratively by federal, state, and tribal  parties.   For example, FWS and NMFS are responsible for implementing  measures, such as hatchery enhancement, to rebuild depressed fish stocks.  State agencies are responsible for publishing and regulating annual harvest  levels. The five Columbia River Basin tribes that are parties to United  States v. Oregon are responsible for abiding by annual harvest levels.  According to NMFS, the implementation of United States v. Oregon  negotiations or plans affect fisheries in a number of important areas,  including habitat, production, and hatchery management. Furthermore, the  decisions reached during the negotiations serve as guidelines for the  various decisions made on the Regional Forum committees.

According to the Forest Service,  Forest Plans were the primary vehicle for integrating fish and wildlife  concerns with other management objectives. Forest Plans do not set forth  determinations on the type and number of actions to be implemented, but  provide sideboards and guidance for the design of site-level actions.  Development and implementation of these plans are primarily handled by  the Forest Service, although NMFS, FWS, and tribes provide some input.
