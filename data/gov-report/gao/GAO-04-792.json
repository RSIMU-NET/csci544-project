GAO was asked to describe the health resource sharing activities that are occurring at these sites. GAO also examined seven other sites that actively participate in sharing activities. Specifically, GAO is reporting on (1) the types of benefits that have been realized from health resource sharing activities and (2) VA- and DOD-identified obstacles that impede health resource sharing. GAO analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials at DOD and VA to obtain information on the benefits achieved through sharing activities. The nine sites reviewed by the Committee and reexamined by GAO are: 1) Los Angeles, CA; 2) San Diego, CA; 3) North Chicago, IL; 4) Albuquerque, NM; 5) Las Vegas, NV; 6) Fayetteville, NC; 7) Charleston, SC; 8) El Paso, TX; and 9) San Antonio, TX.

While all 16 sites are engaged in health resource sharing activities, some sites share significantly more resources than others. For example, at one site VA was able to utilize Navy facilities to provide additional sources of care and reduce its reliance on civilian providers, thus lowering its purchased care cost by about $385,000 annually. Also, because of the sharing activity taking place at this site, VA has modified its plans to build a new $100 million hospital and instead plans to build a clinic that will cost about $45 million. However, at another site the sharing activity was limited to the use of a nurse practitioner to assist with primary care and the sharing of a psychiatrist and a psychologist. GAO found that the primary obstacle cited by almost all of the agency officials interviewed was the inability of VA and DOD computer systems to communicate and exchange patient health information between departments. VA and DOD medical facilities involved in treating both agencies' patient populations must expend staff resources to enter information on the health care provided into the patient records in both systems. Local VA officials also expressed a concern that security screening procedures have increased the time it takes for VA beneficiaries and their families to gain entry to facilities located on Air Force, Army, and Navy installations during periods of heightened security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1982, Congress passed the Veterans\u2019 Administration and Department of  Defense Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act  (Sharing Act) to promote cost-effective use of health care resources and  efficient delivery of care.

DOD spends about $26.7  billion on health care for over 8.9 million beneficiaries, including active  duty personnel and retirees, and their dependents. Most DOD health care  is provided at more than 530 Army, Navy, and Air Force military treatment  facilities (MTF) worldwide, supplemented by civilian providers.", "To encourage sharing of federal health resources between VA and DOD, in  1982, Congress passed the Sharing Act. Previously, VA and DOD health  care facilities, many of which are collocated or in close geographic  proximity, operated virtually independent of each other. The Sharing Act  authorizes VAMCs and MTFs to become partners and enter into sharing  agreements to buy, sell, and barter medical and support services. The head  of each VA and DOD medical facility can enter into local sharing  agreements. However, VA and DOD headquarters officials review and  approve agreements that involve national commitments such as joint  purchasing of pharmaceuticals. Agreements can be valid for up to 5 years.  The intent of the law was not only to remove legal barriers, but also to  encourage VA and DOD to engage in health resource sharing to more  effectively and efficiently use federal health resources.", "VA and DOD sharing activities fall into three categories:    Local sharing agreements allow VA and DOD to take advantage of their  capacities to provide health care by being a provider of health services, a  receiver of health services, or both. Health services shared under these  agreements can include inpatient and outpatient care; ancillary services,  such as diagnostic and therapeutic radiology; dental care; and specialty  care services such as service for the treatment of spinal cord injury. Other  services shared under these agreements include support services such as  administration and management, research, education and training, patient  transportation, and laundry. The goals of local sharing agreements are to  allow VAMCs and MTFs to exchange health services in order to maximize  their use of resources and provide beneficiaries with greater access to  care.", "Joint venture sharing agreements, as distinguished from local sharing  agreements, aim to avoid costs by pooling resources to build a new facility  or jointly use an existing facility. Joint ventures require more cooperation  and flexibility than local agreements because two separate health care  systems must develop multiple sharing agreements that allow them to  operate as one system at one location.", "National sharing initiatives are designed to achieve greater efficiencies,  that is, lower cost and better access to goods and services when they are  acquired on a national level rather than by individual facilities\u2014for  example, VA and DOD\u2019s efforts to jointly purchase pharmaceuticals for  nationwide distribution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resource Sharing Activities Result in Better Access and Reduced Costs", "paragraphs": ["VA and DOD are realizing benefits from sharing activities, specifically  greater access to care, reduced federal costs, and better facility utilization  at the 16 sites we reviewed.

The joint venture  improved access for VA beneficiaries by providing an alternative source  for care other than traveling to VA facilities in Southern California. It also  improved access to specialized providers for DOD beneficiaries. Examples  of the types of services provided include vascular surgery, plastic surgery,  cardiology, pulmonary, psychiatry, ophthalmology, urology, computed  tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); nuclear medicine,  emergency medicine and emergency room, and respiratory therapy. The  site is currently in the process of enlarging the emergency room.", "In Pensacola, Florida, under a sharing agreement entered into in 2000, VA  buys most of its inpatient services from Naval Hospital Pensacola.  Through this agreement VA is able to utilize Navy facilities and reduce its  reliance on civilian providers, thus lowering its purchased care cost by  about $385,000 annually. Further, according to a VA official, the agreement  has allowed VA to modify its plans to build a new hospital and instead  build a clinic at significantly reduced cost to meet increasing veteran  demand for health care services. Using VA\u2019s cost per square foot estimates  for hospital and clinic construction, the agency estimates that it will cost  $45 million to build a new clinic compared to $100 million for a hospital.", "In Louisville, Kentucky, since 1996, VA and the Army have been engaged in  sharing activities to provide services to beneficiaries that include primary  care, audiology, radiology, podiatry, urology, internal medicine, and  ophthalmology. For fiscal year 2003, a local VA official estimated that VA  reduced its cost by $1.7 million as compared to acquiring the same  services in the private sector through its agreements with the Army; he  also estimated that the Army reduced its cost by about $1.25 million as  compared to acquiring the same services in the private sector. As an  example of the site\u2019s efforts to improve access to care and reduce costs, in  2003 VA and DOD jointly leased a MRI unit. The unit reduces the need for  VA and DOD beneficiaries to travel to more distant sources of care. A  Louisville VA official stated that the purchase reduced the cost by 20  percent as compared to acquiring the same services in the private sector.", "In San Antonio, Texas, VA and the Air Force share a blood bank. Under a  1991 sharing agreement, VA provides the staff to operate the blood bank  and the Air Force provides the space and equipment. According to VA, the  blood bank agreement saves VA and DOD about $400,000 per year.  Further, VA entered into a laundry service agreement with Brooke Army  Medical Center in 2002 to utilize some of VA\u2019s excess laundry capacity.  Under the contract VA processes 1.7 million pounds of laundry each year  for the Army at an annual cost of $875,000.", "Sites such as Las Vegas, Nevada; Pensacola, Florida; Louisville, Kentucky;  and San Antonio, Texas shared significant resources compared to sites at  Los Angeles, California and Charleston, South Carolina.

The inability of VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s patient record  systems to quickly and readily share information on the health care  provided at medical facilities is a significant obstacle to sharing activities.  One critical challenge to successfully sharing information will be to  standardize the data elements of each department\u2019s health records. While  standards for laboratory results were adopted in 2003, VA and DOD face a  significant undertaking to standardize the remaining health data.  According to the joint strategy that VA and DOD have developed, VA will  have to migrate over 150 variations of clinical and demographic data to  one standard, and DOD will have to migrate over 100 variations of clinical  data to one standard.", "The inability of VA and DOD computer systems to share information  forces the medical facilities involved in treating both agencies\u2019 patient  populations to expend staff resources to maintain patient records in both  systems. For example, at Travis Air Force Base, both patient records  systems have been loaded on to a single workstation in each department,  so that nurses and physicians can enter patient encounter data into both  systems. However, the user must access and enter data into each system  separately. In addition to VA and DOD officials\u2019 concerns about the added  costs in terms of staff time, this method of sharing medical information  raises the potential for errors\u2014including double entry and transcription\u2014 possibly compromising medical data integrity.", "VA and DOD have been working since 1998 to modify their computer  systems to ensure that patient health information can be shared between  the two departments. In May 2004, we reported that they have  accomplished a one-way transfer of limited health data from DOD to VA  for separated service members. Through the transfer, health care data for  separated service members are available to all VA medical facilities. This  transfer gives VA clinicians the ability to access and display health care  data through VA\u2019s computerized patient record system remote data views  about 6 weeks after the service member\u2019s separation. The health care data  include laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology records, and are available for  approximately 1.8 million personnel who separated from the military  between 1987 and June 2003.

Patients involved include  those who receive care and maintain health records at multiple VA or DOD  medical facilities within and outside the United States. Upon viewing the  medical record, a VA clinician would be provided access to clinical  information on the patient residing in DOD\u2019s computerized health record  systems. In the same manner, when a veteran seeks medical care at an  MTF, the attending DOD clinician would be provided access to the  veteran\u2019s health information existing in VA\u2019s computerized health record  systems.", "In May 2004, we reported that VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s approach to achieving the  two-way transfer of health information lacks a solid foundation and that  the departments have made little progress toward defining how they  intend to accomplish it. In March 2004 and June 2004, we also reported  that VA and DOD have not fully established a project management  structure to ensure the necessary day-to-day guidance of and  accountability for the undertaking, adding to the challenge and  uncertainties of developing two-way information exchange.
