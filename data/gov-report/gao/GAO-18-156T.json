This statement is based on GAO's July 2017 reports regarding USRAP. To conduct that work, GAO analyzed State, USCIS, and UNHCR policies; interviewed relevant officials; conducted fieldwork in 2016 at selected UNHCR offices, as well as at RSCs in Austria, Jordan, Kenya, and El Salvador, where GAO observed a nongeneralizable sample of refugee screening interviews (selected based on application data and other factors)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State (State) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have worked together on measures designed to ensure integrity in the refugee resettlement referral process and have established a framework to guide their partnership.

UNHCR also uses databases to help verify the identities of, and manage information about, refugees.", "State and the nine worldwide Resettlement Support Centers (RSC) have policies and procedures for processing refugee applications. Overseen by State, the organizations that operate RSCs hire staff to process and prescreen applicants who have been referred for resettlement consideration. GAO observed 27 prescreening interviews conducted by RSC caseworkers in four countries and found that, for example, RSCs generally recorded key information and submitted any required security checks. However, State has not established outcome-based performance indicators to evaluate whether RSCs were consistently and effectively prescreening applicants and preparing case files\u2014key RSC activities that have important implications for timely and effective adjudication and security checks. Developing outcome-based performance indicators would better position State to determine whether RSCs are meeting their responsibilities.", "The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has policies and procedures for adjudicating refugee applications for resettlement in the United States, including how officers are to conduct interviews and adjudicate applications. GAO observed 29 USCIS interviews and found that officers completed all parts of the required assessment. USCIS also provides guidance to help officers identify national security concerns in applications, which can be challenging to identify as country conditions evolve. In 2016, USCIS determined that its pilot to send officers with national security expertise overseas to support interviewing officers was successful. USCIS has taken steps to fill these positions, but it has not yet developed a plan for deploying these additional officers, whose expertise could help improve the effectiveness of the adjudication process.", "State, USCIS, and their partners have implemented antifraud measures to reduce the risk of staff and applicant fraud\u2014both of which have occurred\u2014but could further assess fraud risks. Officials from all nine RSCs stated that they assign staff fraud risk management responsibilities to designated individuals. However, not all RSCs reported complying with all required program integrity measures\u2014reported compliance at individual RSCs ranged from 86 to 100 percent. State has also not required RSCs to conduct regular staff fraud risk assessments tailored to each RSC or examined the suitability of related controls. Without taking additional steps to address these issues, State and RSCs may face challenges in identifying new staff fraud risks or gaps in the program's internal control system and implementing new control activities to mitigate them. Further, State and USCIS have not jointly assessed applicant fraud risk program-wide. Doing so could help them ensure that fraud detection and prevention efforts across USRAP are targeted to those areas that are of highest risk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made recommendations to State and USCIS to strengthen the implementation of USRAP.

Millions of people worldwide  have fled their home countries to seek asylum because of persecution. In  general, individuals determined to have a well-founded fear of  persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion,  or their membership in a particular social group can be registered as  refugees with the governments of the countries to which they have fled or  with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As of  June 2017, UNHCR reported there were approximately 22.5 million  refugees worldwide.", "In fiscal year 2016, the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees for  resettlement, the largest yearly number in more than 15 years, and  admitted about 52,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. Increases in the  number of USRAP applicants approved for resettlement in the United  States\u2014particularly from countries in the Middle East where terrorist  groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) operate\u2014have  raised questions about the adequacy of screening for refugee applicants  to prevent access by persons who may be threats to national security.", "There are also questions as to whether USRAP is vulnerable to fraud  because there have been past cases of fraud committed by both staff  involved in the processing of refugee applications (referred to hereafter as  staff fraud) and by refugee applicants. Given the potential consequences  that the outcomes of decisions on refugee applications can have on the  safety and security of both vulnerable refugee populations and the United  States, it is important that there is integrity in the resettlement process  and that the U.S. government has an effective refugee screening process  to allow for resettlement of qualified applicants while preventing persons  with malicious intent from using USRAP to gain entry into the country.", "The Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureau of Population, Refugees, and  Migration (PRM) manages USRAP. State works with the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS), which has responsibility for adjudicating applications for  resettlement in the United States as refugees. USCIS officers, in  adjudicating applications for resettlement, are to conduct individual, in- person interviews with applicants overseas and use the results of these  interviews in coordination with other relevant information, such as the  results of applicants\u2019 security checks, to determine whether USCIS will  approve the applicants for resettlement in the United States as refugees.  State receives applications and referrals for refugee resettlement from a  variety of sources, with most coming from UNHCR. UNHCR is mandated  to work with governments to provide \u201cdurable solutions\u201d to refugees so  that they may transition out of refugee status and rebuild their lives. This  may include their consideration to submit a refugee\u2019s case to the United  States or other country for resettlement. Both State and USCIS  coordinate with nine Resettlement Support Centers (RSC) worldwide to  manage applications and referrals to USRAP, interview applicants to  collect their information (referred to as prescreening), and prepare  approved refugee applicants for resettlement to the United States. State  oversees these RSCs, four of which are operated by the International  Organization for Migration (IOM), and four of which are operated by  nongovernmental organizations (NGO).

For those reports, we reviewed State, DHS, RSC, and UNHCR  policies and documents and interviewed relevant officials\u2014including  officials at all 9 RSCs. In addition, we conducted fieldwork at selected  UNHCR offices, as well as at RSCs in Austria, Jordan, Kenya, and El  Salvador. At the RSCs, we observed two nongeneralizable samples of  refugee screening interviews in 2016 (selected based on application data  and other factors).

Since 2000, State  and UNHCR have outlined their formal partnership using a Framework for  Cooperation. State and UNHCR signed the most recent framework  document in 2016, covering the period of March 14, 2016 to December  31, 2017. The organizations developed the framework to guide their  partnership, emphasizing measures such as oversight activities and risk  management. Among other things, the framework emphasizes improved  accountability at UNHCR through effective oversight measures, close  cooperation with State, and organization-wide risk management. In  addition, the framework notes that State will work to ensure that UNHCR  allocates sufficient resources to fully implement measures to provide  oversight and accountability. For instance, UNHCR has several offices  that are responsible for overseeing antifraud activities, in addition to  providing audit services, investigating instances of fraud, and conducting  broad reviews of country-level operations such as the United Nations  Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Board of Auditors. The  framework also describes regular coordination and communication  between State and UNHCR as an important principle in the relationship  between the two organizations. Specifically, at the headquarters level, the  U.S. Mission in Geneva, Switzerland, has a humanitarian affairs office  that, according to State officials, coordinates with UNHCR on a regular  basis.", "Additionally, UNHCR has developed standard operating procedures  (SOPs) and identity management systems to combat the risk of fraud and  worked with State to implement these activities in the resettlement  process. Despite the complexity and regional variations in its refugee  registration, refugee status determination, and resettlement referral  processes, UNHCR officials said that standardizing procedures ensures  that the organization has established basic antifraud practices worldwide.  These officials added that they believe that the SOPs are among the most  important tools with which they ensure the integrity of the resettlement  referral process. UNHCR officials also collect biometric information on  refugees, such as iris scans and fingerprints. State and UNHCR  developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the  sharing of some biometric information. According to a Letter of  Understanding that accompanies the MOU, it provides a framework  whereby data from UNHCR is shared with State, which allows for  increased efficiency and accuracy in processing resettlement referrals to  the United States.

State\u2019s USRAP Overseas  Processing Manual includes requirements for information RSCs should  collect when prescreening applicants and initiating national security  checks, among other things. RSCs communicate directly with USRAP  applicants and prepare their case files. For example, RSCs are to  conduct prescreening interviews to record key information, such as  applicants\u2019 persecution stories and information about their extended  family, and submit certain security checks based on the information  collected during the interview to U.S. agencies. In addition, State  developed SOPs for processing and prescreening refugee applications at RSCs, which State officials indicated provide baseline standards for RSC  operations. Further, all four of the RSCs we visited provided us with their  own local SOPs that incorporated the topics covered in State\u2019s SOPs.  Directors at the remaining five RSCs also told us that they had developed  local SOPs that covered the overarching USRAP requirements.

However, temporary officers receive a condensed  (or shortened) version of the trainings received by full time refugee  officers and do not receive infield training.

The 2015 quality assurance review found that most cases in the  sample were legally sufficient. However, the review indicated that there  were differences between RAD and IO adjudications.

State and RSCs reported instituting a number of activities to  combat the risk of fraud committed by RSC staff. Many of these activities  correspond with leading practices identified in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework which identifies leading antifraud practices to aid program  managers in managing fraud risks that affect their program. For  instance, State and RSCs reported that they have taken steps to commit  to an organizational culture and structure to help manage staff fraud risks  and established collaborative relationships with both internal and external  partners to share information. Officials from all nine RSCs stated that they  assign staff fraud risk management responsibilities to designated  individuals. In addition, State and RSCs reported that RSCs have  designed control activities to address staff fraud risk. State officials  identified two key guidance documents containing control activities: RSC  SOPs and the Program Integrity Guidelines. The Program Integrity  Guidelines are a list of 87 measures designed to prevent and mitigate  staff fraud at RSCs. The measures were developed by State and  provided to RSCs in response to a staff fraud incident in 2013 that  resulted in the termination of two RSC staff. These measures include  control activities addressing issues such as background checks,  interpreter assignment, antifraud training, office layout, case file reviews,  electronic data management, and reporting and responding to instances  of suspected fraud.", "State required RSCs to comply with the original Program Integrity  Guidelines by October 2014; however, our review of RSC documents  found that RSCs reported complying with most, but not all, of the required  measures applicable to their operations. Reported compliance with  required, applicable measures at individual RSCs ranged from 86 percent  to 100 percent. For 53 of the 72 measures, compliance was reported by  all RSCs for which the measure was applicable. Some RSCs have  reported that they face challenges in fully implementing certain controls.  State officials told us that they work to ensure that each RSC complies  with all required controls in the Program Integrity Guidelines. If an RSC  reports that it does not yet fully comply with a measure listed in the  Program Integrity Guidelines, State expects the RSC to report its  progress toward compliance to State. While this reporting assists State in  its implementation efforts, we found that gaps remain. Full compliance  with these measures could help RSCs ensure the integrity of their  operations and guard against staff fraud.", "In addition, State has taken some steps to assess the risks posed by staff  fraud to RSC operations; however, we found that not all RSCs have  conducted staff fraud risk assessments that follow leading practices  identified in the Fraud Risk Framework, including (1) conducting  assessments at regular intervals or when the program experiences  changes, (2) tailoring assessments to the program and its operations, and  (3) examining the suitability of existing fraud controls. State officials told  us that not all RSCs had conducted staff fraud risk assessments because  State\u2019s Program Integrity Guidelines recommend but do not require these  assessments. Without State requiring RSCs to conduct regular staff fraud  risk assessments tailored to their specific operations, staff fraud risk  assessments conducted by individual RSCs have varied. Further, we  found that State and most RSCs have not examined the suitability of  existing fraud controls. For example, while one RSC has regularly  assessed the suitability of its existing staff fraud controls by conducting  regular staff fraud risk assessments that examine the likelihood and  impact of potential fraudulent activity and related fraud controls, the  remaining eight RSCs have not done so. State officials told us that  because State does not require RSCs to conduct risk assessments,  information needed to assess the suitability of existing controls is not  available from all RSCs. As the number of refugees accepted varies each  year by RSC, internal control systems may need to be changed to  respond to the potential increased fraud risk. Without requiring RSCs to  conduct regular staff fraud risk assessments that are tailored to their  specific operating environments and reviewing these assessments to  examine the suitability of existing fraud controls, State may lack  necessary information about staff fraud risks and therefore not have  reasonable assurance that existing controls effectively reduce these risks.
