The Senate Appropriations Committee has expressed concern in its report accompanying a bill for DOD's fiscal year 2015 appropriations that it does not have a clear understanding of OCO funding used to support DOD's day-to-day programs and activities. The services track O&M obligations by base and OCO appropriations for OCO reporting purposes, but DOD's financial management regulations do not require it to congressionally report O&M base obligations separately for each account in its budget justification materials and execution reports.

In addition, Congress  appropriates O&M overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding to  support contingency and other operations. In committee reports  accompanying defense appropriation acts, the House and Senate  appropriations committees have on several occasions expressed concern  that DOD relies on a portion of its OCO appropriations to fund O&M  programs and activities that began in response to contingency operations  but have continued after these operations ended.

To understand the differences  between DOD\u2019s O&M base obligations and the amount Congress  designated for O&M base programs and activities, we estimated O&M  base obligations because DOD does not report this information  separately from O&M OCO obligations in its budget justification materials  or execution reports as discussed later in the report. To do this, we  compiled and summed O&M OCO obligations reported in the OCO  budget justification books for each O&M base account and subtracted this  amount from total O&M obligations reported in DOD\u2019s O&M base budget  exhibits at the account level. We took similar steps to estimate base  obligations by each subactivity group within the military services\u2019 O&M  base accounts. Next, we compared enacted amounts with our estimated  total O&M base obligations. We grouped the military service-level  subactivity groups into 11 categories of similar activities and compared  the congressional designations for the 11 categories to estimated base  obligations for the corresponding categories.

Enacted  funding, set by Congress, establishes how much the department can  obligate in a given fiscal year, unless the amounts are subsequently  adjusted through additional congressional action or DOD\u2019s use of its  authorities to transfer funds between appropriations accounts. Based on  DOD\u2019s data, enacted funding for O&M base in nominal dollars increased  by 7 percent from about $185.0 billion in fiscal year 2009 to about $198.5  billion in fiscal year 2016 (see figure 1).", "Our analysis of the budget year of DOD\u2019s 5-year funding plans for O&M  base from fiscal years 2009 through 2016 found that since fiscal year  2011, DOD consistently planned for more O&M base funding than  Congress enacted. The 5-year funding plans\u2014also known as the Future  Years Defense Plan\u2014consist of a budget year (first fiscal year) and out- years (4 subsequent fiscal years beyond the budget year), and are  intended to help inform Congress on current and future planned funding  needs.

For example, according to DOD  documents, the 5-year plan for fiscal year 2011 reflected the defense  objectives outlined in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review and the  corresponding increase in requirements to carry out those objectives. The  department then began to reduce its planned growth in fiscal year 2012,  as compared to fiscal year 2011, according to DOD budget documents  and DOD officials, based on a variety of initiatives intended to improve  the efficiency of DOD\u2019s business operations by reducing excess overhead  costs. In fiscal years 2013 through 2015, DOD further reduced its base  O&M funding plans as it realigned its entire discretionary budget closer to  expected appropriations. According to DOD documents and officials, this  was achieved through a combination of continued efficiency initiatives  and economic adjustments, among other reductions. However, in fiscal  year 2016, DOD\u2019s funding plans did not include further reductions.

These realigned funds represented 11 percent of the  $1,336.5 billion enacted for these accounts.  According to DOD and  military service officials, they used existing statutory authorities to transfer  (realign funds between appropriations accounts) or reprogram (realign  funds from the same appropriation within an account\u2019s budget activity)  O&M funding to adjust to differences in their budget year funding plans  and respond to emerging requirements, such as disaster response and  new contingency operations. The officials stated that this flexibility helps  the department to manage risk associated with priority missions by  ensuring that resources are aligned appropriately. DOD relied on legal  authority with congressional approval where necessary to realign  about $71.3 billion (48.5 percent) of these funds from transfers between  or reprogrammings within appropriations. DOD also reprogrammed about  $75.6 billion (51.5 percent) of these funds between budget activities  within accounts in amounts that did not require prior congressional  approval (see figure 4).", "We estimated that after the department used its authorities to transfer  funds, DOD\u2019s base obligations subsequent to fiscal year 2009 were  greater than amounts enacted by Congress for O&M base funding by an  annual average of 5.6 percent. During the period of our review, DOD did  not report O&M base obligation amounts separately from O&M OCO  amounts in its budget justification materials or execution reports;  therefore, we estimated base obligations for O&M. We found in 5 of the 7  fiscal years we estimated that O&M base obligations\u2014consisting of  enacted and realigned amounts\u2014were 5.6 percent to 8.7 percent greater  than congressionally enacted amounts ($10.9 billion and $16.7 billion,  respectively).

Officials told us  that they have since taken steps to better align the request with the  requirement by issuing guidance to the Army to incorporate information  on prior spending levels in this area within the budget request for fiscal  year 2017. In addition, they discussed that in fiscal years 2011 and 2012  the difference from the designated amount for the Air Force resulted from  the use of O&M base funding to support OCO requirements.", "In addition, our analysis found that there was no consistent pattern of  differences between spending and what was designated by Congress  among the two categories of subactivity groups that are most directly  related to readiness\u2014maintenance and weapon systems support and  operational tempo and training.

In its  written comments, which are summarized below and reprinted in  appendix II, DOD did not concur with the recommendation.", "In its written comments, DOD noted that many of its financial accounting  systems currently in use cannot distinguish between O&M base and OCO  obligations easily, and that due to limited resources as a result of  headquarters reductions, the requirement to manually identify these  obligations in O&M budget justification materials and quarterly O&M  execution reports will be extremely labor intensive. DOD further noted  that once all DOD components convert from these financial accounting  systems, the department should be able to report O&M base and OCO  obligations consistently and effectively.", "For over two decades, we have recognized and brought attention to  DOD\u2019s reliance on financial accounting systems with significant  weaknesses. In addition, we have consistently acknowledged that the  reliability of DOD\u2019s financial information will be increasingly important to  the federal government\u2019s ability to make sound resource allocation  decisions. While DOD is in the process of implementing various  enterprise resource planning systems to improve its financial accounting  departmentwide and implement an audit ready systems environment, as  required by Congress, we also recognize that DOD\u2019s continued efforts will  take time.", "However, in the interim, the revision we recommended to DOD\u2019s  guidance would help to establish the consistent reporting of O&M base  and OCO obligations once those enterprise resource planning systems  are in place. Specifically, revised guidance for preparing congressional  budget justification materials and execution reports to require the addition  of O&M base obligations for each O&M account would position DOD  components to report O&M base obligations uniformly using their new  systems. Given this, we continue to believe that implementing the  recommendation would make more complete information available to  Congress on the amount of funds DOD is obligating for its day-to-day  programs and activities, and reflect the department\u2019s full funding needs  for its O&M base budget.", "DOD provided additional information in its comments as to the specific  reasons its current financial accounting systems cannot easily distinguish  between O&M base and OCO obligations, and how it reports O&M total  and OCO obligations to Congress rather than O&M base obligations at  the level of information presented for each account. As discussed in this  report, implementing this recommendation would provide Congress with  more detailed information about DOD\u2019s O&M budget. DOD also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated into the report, as  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, and to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Army,  Secretary of the Air Force, and Secretary of the Navy.

This report: (1)  identifies the trends in enacted and planned funding for DOD\u2019s O&M base  appropriations since fiscal year 2009; (2) describes the amount of O&M  funding DOD has transferred or reprogrammed, and the effect of this  realignment on O&M base obligations; and (3) evaluates the extent to  which DOD reported to Congress its O&M obligations for its base and  OCO budgets.", "To identify the trends in enacted base funding for DOD\u2019s O&M accounts  since fiscal year 2009, we analyzed data on enacted funding from DOD\u2019s  budget justification materials from fiscal years 2009 through 2016. We  began with fiscal year 2009 because it was the first year after the surge in  both Iraq and Afghanistan and would provide us with a 7-year period of  data. All enacted funding amounts are in nominal dollars as presented in  the budget materials. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Comptroller and the military  services\u2019 financial management offices about O&M base funding. In some  years the budget justification materials were produced while DOD was  operating under a continuing resolution and contain an estimate of  funding under the continuing resolution. We verified the enacted data with  OUSD Comptroller officials to ensure that the data reflected enacted  amounts that were also reported to Congress after a defense  appropriation act in the annual Base for Reprogramming Actions report.  OUSD Comptroller provided revised amounts on enacted funding as  appropriate. We determined that the enacted funding amounts were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this audit with attribution to DOD.", "To identify how DOD\u2019s base funding plans for O&M compared with its  enacted funding levels since fiscal year 2009, we analyzed data specific  to O&M from DOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Program summary tables. We  compared information from each 5-year plan\u2014the budget year and total  for the 5 years\u2014with the enacted funding information previously  discussed. We also compared each 5-year plan with the previous plan to  describe the changes between plans since fiscal year 2009. We reviewed  documentary information and interviewed officials from Cost Assessment  and Program Evaluation and OUSD Comptroller on the Future Years  Defense Program about the changes in plans since fiscal year 2009. We  verified the data on planned funding amounts with OUSD Comptroller  officials. All enacted funding amounts are in nominal dollars. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  audit with attribution to DOD and the source document.", "To identify trends in other base funding available, we corroborated data  provided by the OUSD Comptroller officials with information in the  defense appropriations acts and defense appropriations joint explanatory  statements. All funding amounts are in nominal dollars. We determined  that the data on other funding available were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this audit with attribution to DOD.", "To describe how DOD has realigned O&M funds between O&M and other  appropriations through transfers, and within accounts through  reprogrammings, since fiscal year 2009, we analyzed data from DOD\u2019s  4th Quarter O&M execution reports from fiscal years 2009 through 2015  to determine the extent to which DOD transferred and reprogrammed  O&M base and OCO funding. Our analysis goes through fiscal year  2015, as this was the last full year of data during our review. We  calculated the value of funds realigned between and within the military  services\u2019 and defense-wide O&M accounts by two categories reported in  the execution reports\u2014prior approval transfers and reprogrammings, and  below threshold reprogrammings. Funds realigned out of accounts are  presented as negative numbers in DOD\u2019s execution reports. We used the  absolute value of the negative numbers to account for the total amount of  the realignment. We provided the amounts obtained from the execution  reports with OUSD Comptroller officials to verify the accuracy of the  information. Next, we calculated the total enacted O&M funding reported  in the execution reports for the military services\u2019 and defense-wide  accounts and determined the percentage of the enacted O&M funding  that DOD reported moving. We also interviewed OUSD Comptroller and  the military services\u2019 financial management officials to understand DOD\u2019s  process for transferring and reprogramming funds, including any  notifications to Congress about them. All fund realignment amounts are in  nominal dollars, and we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this audit with attribution to DOD and the source  document.", "To understand the differences between DOD\u2019s base obligations and the  amounts that Congress designated for base O&M programs and  activities, we estimated O&M base obligations because DOD is not  required to report this information in its budget justification materials or  execution reports separately from O&M OCO obligations, and had not  reported the amounts. To estimate O&M base obligations for the O&M  title, we compiled and summed O&M OCO obligations reported in the  budget justification materials for each O&M base account. We then  subtracted the O&M OCO obligations from the total O&M obligations  reported in the O&M O-1 budget exhibit, which provides aggregate details  on O&M obligations. We verified the OCO and total O&M obligation data  with OUSD Comptroller officials. We compared estimated O&M base  obligations with the enacted funding information previously discussed.", "Further, to understand the differences between O&M base obligations  and congressional designations for aggregate categories of similar  subactivity groups within the military services\u2019 O&M base accounts, we  compiled congressional designations, O&M total, and O&M OCO  obligations by each of the subactivity groups from the military services\u2019  O&M budget justification materials. To normalize obligations for the items  that were not enacted in the military services\u2019 O&M base accounts but  were appropriated to other accounts and authorized to be transferred to  the military services\u2019 O&M base accounts for execution, we obtained data  from the military services by subactivity group. Specifically, we obtained  data on transfers from the Environmental Restoration and Drug  Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities appropriation that were transferred  into the military services\u2019 accounts. Next, to estimate O&M base  obligations, we subtracted O&M OCO obligations and obligations  associated with Environmental Restoration and Drug Interdiction and  Counterdrug Activities transfer amounts from total O&M obligations. We  grouped the unclassified subactivity groups from the military services\u2019  O&M budget justification materials into 11 broad categories of similar  activities used in our prior sequestration work based on the activities and  functions of each subactivity group (see table 1). To ensure that the  budget categories and the placement of subactivity groups therein were  valid, we shared our updated approach with officials from OUSD  Comptroller, who did not make any suggested revisions.", "We then compared the congressional designations with estimated O&M  base obligations for the 11 aggregate categories of similar subactivity  groups within the military services\u2019 accounts to determine the amount and  percentage of difference in the same direction. We identified consistent  patterns of difference, defined as at least three consecutive years with a  difference. All amounts are in nominal dollars, and we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this audit with attribution  to DOD and the source.", "Lastly, to evaluate the extent to which DOD reported O&M base and OCO  obligations to Congress, we reviewed the data presented in DOD\u2019s  budget justification materials and execution reports to identify the type of  information available. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulations and congressional committee report language and  interviewed OUSD Comptroller officials to obtain information on the  organization of the budget justification materials. We reviewed this  information in light of federal internal control and accounting standards  that outline how information should be recorded and communicated to  management and others.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to August 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
