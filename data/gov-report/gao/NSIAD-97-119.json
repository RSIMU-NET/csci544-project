Canada and Mexico are by far the largest U.S. trade partners in the hemisphere, accounting for approximately two-thirds of total U.S. exports of goods to the region. Countries in the Western Hemisphere also constitute about 30 percent of total U.S. foreign direct investment.", "During the 1960s and 1970s, most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean experimented with various arrangements to promote subregional economic integration and free trade. These initiatives were generally frustrated by trade and investment restrictions characteristic of these countries\u2019 protective economic development strategies. By the late 1980s, faced with stagnant economies and mounting external debt, countries in the region began to move away from these restrictive policies and initiated market-oriented reforms to stimulate economic growth. Although these reforms were primarily intended to address domestic economic problems, they also facilitated trade liberalization efforts. Moreover, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1988 signaled a new commitment on the part of North American countries to regional trade liberalization. By the early 1990s, almost all countries in the hemisphere were engaged in multilateral or bilateral efforts to liberalize trade. After a decade of economic decline, Latin American economies have rebounded in the 1990s, and the region now represents the second fastest growing area in the world after Southeast Asia.", "The 1994 Miami Summit of the Americas gave new impetus to trade liberalization efforts in the region. At Miami, the 34 democratically elected leaders of countries in the Western Hemisphere agreed to conclude a free trade agreement no later than 2005, with concrete progress by the turn of the century. The summit declaration committed participating governments to negotiate, among other things, the elimination of barriers to trade in goods and services as well as investment and to provide rules in such areas as intellectual property rights and government procurement. The plan of action adopted at Miami called for two meetings of trade ministers (\u201cministerials\u201d) to reach agreement on the key principles upon which to base the FTAA. These two ministerials, held in Denver, Colorado (1995), and Cartagena, Colombia (1996), established a series of working groups to gather data and make recommendations to the ministers in preparation for FTAA negotiations.

NAFTA created the world\u2019s largest free trade area, with a combined population of nearly 400 million and a combined GDP of almost $8 trillion. NAFTA provides for the gradual elimination of tariff barriers on most goods over a 10-year period. It covers trade in services, provides protection for investment and intellectual property rights, applies rules to government procurement, and contains a dispute settlement system.

Mercosur currently functions as a customs union, providing not only for a free trade area but also for the establishment of a common external tariff. The external tariff instituted in 1995 is not to exceed 20 percent for most imports. Today, approximately 85 percent of imports from outside the bloc enter under the common external tariff, and about 90 percent of all intra-Mercosur trade is duty free. Mercosur includes a commitment by member countries to coordinate more disciplined macroeconomic policies. Also, Mercosur countries are committed to agree on a common foreign trade policy.

U.S. and OAS officials explained that the working groups have been the mechanism for accelerating progress on the priorities of participating countries. Progress in meeting the information mandates set forth at the ministerials differs for each of the 12 working groups. For example, the Working Group on Investment is particularly advanced, having prepared a comprehensive technical compendium on investment treaties in the region. This compendium was published at the Belo Horizonte ministerial in May 1997.

For example, the Working Group on Market Access reported in February 1997 that many countries had yet to submit the schedules and statistics required to prepare a hemispheric data base on tariff structures and nontariff measures.

For example, the IDB is collecting trade statistics to assist the Working Group on Market Access, while the OAS has provided support to other groups on trade policy issues, such as subsidies and competition policy. At this time, the Tripartite Committee\u2019s role in support of the FTAA is anticipated to be transitory. The countries are considering the possibility of establishing a temporary FTAA secretariat during the negotiations.

In the declaration, countries agreed that the FTAA would be consistent with member countries\u2019 commitments under the WTO and the FTAA. Moreover, countries agreed that the FTAA would coexist with, rather than supplant, existing subregional trade arrangements, such as NAFTA or Mercosur, to the extent that rights and obligations under these agreements are not covered or go beyond rights and obligations under the FTAA. The declaration also recognized the right of participating countries to negotiate independently or as members of subregional trade groupings, and the need to establish a temporary administrative secretariat to support future negotiations. Finally, the declaration reiterated the commitment of participating countries to conclude a trade agreement encompassing the entire hemisphere by 2005 at the latest.", "At the Belo Horizonte ministerial, participating countries also agreed to set up a Preparatory Committee at the vice ministerial level that will make recommendations for FTAA negotiations.

In 1996, Chile also concluded a free trade arrangement with Mercosur, becoming in effect an associate member of that trade bloc.

The Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, which became effective on July 1, 1997, is modeled on NAFTA and is intended as a provisional agreement to facilitate Chilean accession to NAFTA. Nevertheless, as noted earlier, there are some differences between this bilateral agreement and NAFTA, reflecting some of the areas where Chilean and Canadian interests differ significantly from those of the United States. For example, under their bilateral agreement, Chile and Canada are committed to forgo imposing antidumping and countervailing duties within 6 years after the agreement goes into effect. NAFTA, on the other hand, does not affect member countries\u2019 ability to unilaterally impose antidumping measures and countervailing duties. In addition to its trade negotiations with Canada, Chile has cultivated close commercial relations with Mexico, our other NAFTA partner. Currently, Chile and Mexico are renegotiating their 1992 free trade agreement to make it more compatible with NAFTA.", "Mexico, in turn, has been extending its own web of bilateral trade agreements throughout the hemisphere. As noted earlier, Mexico has concluded bilateral free trade agreements with Costa Rica and Bolivia and has a trilateral arrangement with Colombia and Venezuela.

Recently, Canada\u2019s Northern Telecom won a nearly $200-million telecommunications equipment contract in Chile.

The Information Technology Agreement, which was signed by 28 WTO members in Singapore in December 1996, provides important tariff concessions in an industry in which the United States enjoys a considerable competitive advantage. Brazil did not join in the Information Technology Agreement, seeking to protect its own emerging information technologies industry.

It is worth noting that Argentina\u2019s former Finance Minister favored joining NAFTA rather than integrating further within Mercosur.

Indeed, the Canadian Minister of International Trade recently indicated that his government is considering negotiating a trade agreement with Mercosur.

Since the FTAA would entail broadening Brazil\u2019s ongoing market-opening efforts, Brazil favors a slower managed approach to hemispheric trade liberalization.
