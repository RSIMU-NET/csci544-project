Beyond 2030, the population is expected to continue aging due to relatively low birth rates and increasing longevity. These demographic trends will require substantial changes in Social Security benefits and/or revenues. Without such changes, Social Security tax revenues are expected to be insufficient to cover benefit payments in about 2012, less than 15 years from now. To cover this annual cash shortfall, the trust fund will begin drawing on the Treasury, first relying on its interest income and, eventually, on its assets. As shown in figure 1.1, the trust fund\u2019s annual cash deficits will grow rapidly, reaching a projected 1.6 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2028.

While the Advisory Council could not agree on a single plan for dealing with Social Security\u2019s difficulties, the members did agree that investing in the stock market would yield higher returns for financing retirement benefits. One approach was to maintain Social Security\u2019s current benefit and taxation structure and allow the government to invest directly in the stock market. The other two approaches would significantly restructure Social Security and allow stock investing through accounts owned and controlled by individuals.", "The \u201cMaintain Benefits\u201d plan\u2014supported by 6 of the Advisory Council\u2019s 13 members\u2014recommended a traditional package of tax and benefit changes. These changes were projected to solve about two-thirds of Social Security\u2019s long-term financing problem. To close the remaining gap, the plan called for studying the possibility of allowing the Social Security trust fund to invest in the stock market. According to the plan\u2019s estimates, gradually investing up to 40 percent of the Social Security trust fund in stocks could obviate the need for further tax increases or benefit cuts. The plan also outlined that the government\u2019s portfolio would be passively managed and selected using a broad market index (\u201cindexing\u201d).", "The seven other Advisory Council members opposed government investment in the stock market. They believed that there would be tremendous political pressures to steer the Social Security trust fund\u2019s investments to achieve other economic, social, or political purposes rather than basing decisions solely on the trust fund\u2019s expected risk and return.

Pension funds invest in a wide mix of assets, often placing a majority of their funds in the stock market. Pension funds accumulate substantial assets from contributions by employers and employees to finance future retirement benefits. Investment earnings on these funds contribute considerable revenue and reduce the amount of money that would otherwise have to be contributed to pay pension benefits. In determining how to allocate their portfolios among different types of assets, pension funds must balance the trade-off between earning a good long-term return and minimizing the risk of loss. As of the third quarter of 1997, private sector pension funds had $3.5 trillion in assets, and state and local pension funds had $2 trillion. Overall, pension funds held about $3.4 trillion in stocks, or about 60 percent of their total assets. Pension funds own about a quarter of total U.S. stock holdings, valued at $12.8 trillion at the end of the third quarter of 1997. U.S. government securities accounted for about 15 percent of pension funds\u2019 holdings. Pension funds also invest in mortgages, real estate, and other assets, including venture capital.

A public pension fund operates under a legal framework established by its sponsoring government. A government may choose to restrict its public pension fund from investing heavily in risky assets. Also, a government may use public pension investments to further other policy objectives. Moreover, some state and local pension plans actively participate in the management decisions of the companies in which they invest by exercising their shareholder voting rights.", "The Advisory Council\u2019s Maintain Benefits plan pointed out that, in fact, a few federal pension plans invest in assets other than Treasury securities. Most notably, the federal employees\u2019 Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) has passively-managed indexed stock investments similar to those that have been proposed for Social Security. However, in one major aspect, the Thrift Savings Plan is not comparable to the Social Security trust fund\u2014federal employees, not the government, own and control the investment of their individual account balances. For this reason, the transactions of TSP are not included in the unified federal budget.", "There are other limits to comparing the Social Security trust fund to pension funds. Although Social Security resembles a traditional pension plan in that retirement benefits are based on earnings and work time, the Congress has the ability to change the legislation governing benefits at any time. Social Security is not just a retirement program\u2014it is also a social insurance program with additional goals for income redistribution and protection for survivors, dependents, and disabled workers. Moreover, Social Security is financed largely on a pay-as-you-go basis, whereas pension plans are generally funded in advance.

We researched economic and finance literature and interviewed market experts in both academia and the private sector to identify historical stock return data and major trends that could affect future stock performance. Also, we identified the general risks inherent in stock market investing and attempted to distinguish risks unique to the Social Security trust fund investing in the stock market in isolation from other program changes. As a point of comparison, we also examined pension literature and research documenting the general investment practices of public pension plans, but a detailed discussion of those practices was beyond the scope of this report.", "We simulated two stock investment scenarios to illustrate how changing the investment policy can affect the future outcome for the Social Security trust fund. We developed an aggressive scenario where the trust fund would maintain a reserve of Treasury securities equal to at least 100 percent of annual expected expenditures and invest its future annual cash surplus and interest earned on its Treasury securities in the stock market. We also tested a more conservative scenario investing only Social Security\u2019s annual cash surplus in the stock market. The simulations use the historical average real return on stocks that the Advisory Council assumed in estimating future stock performance as well as its assumption about administrative costs on the trust fund\u2019s investments. At our request, the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Office of the Chief Actuary simulated the potential effect on the trust fund of these two investment scenarios using the Social Security Trustees\u2019 1997 intermediate assumptions about future program revenues and expenditures as well as their demographic and economic assumptions. We did not audit or validate SSA\u2019s actuarial projections. For details of the simulation assumptions, see appendix I.", "Simulations are useful for comparing alternative investment policies within a common framework; however, they should not be interpreted as forecasts of future stock performance. In light of the uncertainty about future stock returns, we also tested a stock return that is 1 percentage point lower than the historical average.

However, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Social Security\u2019s expenditures regularly exceeded revenues, causing a rapid decline in the fund\u2019s balance and raising concerns about the program\u2019s solvency. In response, the Congress passed reforms in 1977 and 1983 that together were intended to assure Social Security\u2019s solvency for a 75-year period. These reforms included both tax increases and reductions in benefits, such as raising the normal retirement age for future workers. In enacting the 1983 reforms, policymakers erred on the side of caution by using fairly pessimistic assumptions for the short term. As a result, annual surpluses turned out to be larger than anticipated. One of the goals of the reforms was to restore Social Security\u2019s contingency reserve. According to analysts of Social Security, a prudent reserve ranges from 1 to 1-1/2 year\u2019s worth of anticipated spending.", "A combination of annual cash surpluses in recent years and the interest credited on its Treasury securities has brought the Social Security trust fund to the top of this range.

Although it cannot sell its holdings in the open market, the Social Security trust fund faces no liquidity risk because, by law, it can redeem special Treasury securities before maturity without penalty. This liquidity feature is particularly important for the trust fund if it needs to dip into its assets to cover a payroll tax shortfall during a general economic downturn. Moreover, redeeming special Treasury securities before maturity presents no risk of loss due to interest rate fluctuations because the trust fund can recover the par value plus accrued interest. In contrast, the trust fund would have to sell marketable Treasury securities at the market price\u2014which fluctuates inversely with market interest rates. The market price of a Treasury security falls when the current interest rate on Treasury securities of equal maturity rises. Selling marketable Treasury securities before maturity when market interest rates are rising could result in a sizable loss. In practice, the Treasury has allowed the Social Security trust fund to redeem its special Treasury securities at any time to pay benefits but not to do so solely for the purpose of maximizing the trust fund\u2019s return.", "Like any investor, the Social Security trust fund faces the risk that its investment returns will be eroded by inflation. This is a particular concern given that Social Security benefits are indexed for inflation. Social Security beneficiaries receive an annual cost of living adjustment that is normally based on the Consumer Price Index. Under the intermediate scenario for the next 75 years, which the Trustees regard as their \u201cbest estimate,\u201d the ultimate nominal interest rate assumed over the long term is 6.2 percent, while annual inflation is assumed to be 3.5 percent. Thus, the trust fund is expected to receive an ultimate real (after inflation) interest rate of 2.7 percent on its Treasury holdings.", "Although the current debate focuses on allowing the Social Security trust fund to invest in the stock market, there also are investment options within the federal government. Although the trust fund is not specifically authorized to do so by the Social Security Act, it may purchase securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and other Federal farm and home credit entities. The Advisory Council\u2019s Maintain Benefits approach suggested considering such investments to increase the trust fund\u2019s return. Agency securities typically pay more because they are not uniformly guaranteed as to principal and interest and there is some risk of default. And, like marketable Treasury securities, agency securities would expose the trust fund to potential losses due to fluctuating market prices.", "Another option could be to change the statutory rate of interest for special Treasury securities. For example, the Congress could raise the rate by a fixed percentage or link the rate to a stock market index, such as the Standard and Poor\u2019s index of 500 large stock companies (S&P 500). The interest premium in excess of the average rate Treasury pays on debt held by the public would represent a general revenue transfer to the Social Security trust fund. Increasing the rate credited to the Social Security trust fund account would appear to boost the program\u2019s finances inasmuch as the trust fund\u2019s balance would increase.

In its deliberations, the Advisory Council agreed to use this rate in estimating average future yields on stocks. Of course, an average return over a long period of time obscures the reality that stock returns fluctuate substantially from year to year, and there have been years in the past with negative returns. Figure 3.1 shows the annual returns\u2014not adjusted for inflation\u2014for large company stocks from 1950 to 1996.

An investor would face uncertain returns in the short term given that annual returns range widely and were negative in nearly 1 out of 4 years.

According to an analysis of historical stock performance, returns on stocks over 10-year periods have been well below average when the dividend yield was low and the price-earnings ratio was high. Indeed, the stock market has been at record high levels in recent years, and the dividend yield is below long-run historical values. Likewise, the price-earnings ratio is well above its long-run average.

As they retire, baby boomers are expected to sell stocks to finance consumption, and private pension plans likewise will sell stocks to finance retirement benefits. The Advisory Council\u2019s technical panel reported that selling pressure resulting from the sheer number of the baby boom retirees could possibly depress stock prices but that estimating any baby boom price effect would be highly speculative. Given that the financial markets and investors anticipate the aging of the population, asset prices may adjust downward gradually beforehand rather than dropping abruptly when the baby boomers begin retiring. Also, some analysts, including those we interviewed, suggest that global demand for stocks could offset any baby boom price effect. For example, investors from countries with relatively younger populations might invest in the U.S. stock market to save for their own retirement even as the baby boomers are selling their stocks.", "While future returns on stocks might reasonably be expected to be less than the historical average, analysts, including those we interviewed, expect stock returns to be higher than those on Treasury securities over the long term. How much higher is uncertain. The spread between the rates of return on stocks and Treasury securities has been shrinking. Historically, stocks have earned higher rates of return than those of Treasury securities to compensate for the additional risk associated with stocks. This \u201cequity risk premium\u201d has declined since the 1950s from about 7 percent to around 3 to 4 percent today. It is unclear whether this change will be long-lasting or whether the equity premium will decline even further. Some economists have suggested that the shrinking risk premium reflects a structural change in that the economy appears less susceptible to recessions. To the extent that corporate profits fluctuate with general economic conditions, fewer downturns translate into less volatility in corporate earnings. If investors perceive that the outlook for corporate earnings is more certain and that stocks may be less risky than they have been historically, stock investing might carry a lower premium and, therefore, relatively lower returns. The uncertainty about the risk and size of the risk premium have implications for analyzing the benefits of a stock investment proposal.", "Although investors believe that over the long run stock returns will always be higher than bond returns, one study has questioned this conventional wisdom.

In addition, the interest credited on the trust fund\u2019s special Treasury securities was roughly $40 billion in 1997.

Under an aggressive scenario, the trust fund would invest both its future annual cash surplus and interest in the stock market, while maintaining a contingency reserve of special Treasury securities equal to at least 100 percent of the next year\u2019s expected expenditures. We also tested an alternative scenario under which only Social Security\u2019s cash surplus would be invested in stocks, and Social Security\u2019s cash deficit, beginning in 2012, would be financed from stock earnings and sales. At our request, the Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of the Chief Actuary simulated the potential effect on the trust fund of these two investment scenarios using the Trustees\u2019 1997 intermediate assumptions. The simulations use the 7-percent real yield on stocks assumed by the Advisory Council in estimating future stock performance. This historical average stock return is 4.3 percentage points higher than the trust fund expects on its special Treasury securities. In the simulations, stock earnings are assumed to be reinvested in the market unless the trust fund needs cash to pay benefits or to invest in Treasury securities to maintain a 100-percent contingency reserve. The simulations also reflect the Advisory Council\u2019s assumption that annual administrative costs for the trust fund\u2019s stock holdings would be 0.5 basis points. See appendix I for further discussion of our assumptions.", "Figure 3.2 shows the estimated trust fund assets under the aggressive investment scenario compared to the cash surplus scenario as well as to the current statutory policy of investing solely in special Treasury securities.

This potential delay would extend the trust fund\u2019s life well into the baby boomers\u2019 retirement years. However, this delay results from a scenario representing an outer bound of how much the trust fund might invest in the stock market. Under the aggressive scenario, the trust fund would hold only enough Treasury securities to cover its contingency needs and would amass a sizable stock portfolio. Within 5 years, the trust fund would have about $500 billion invested in the stock market. Stocks as a share of the trust fund\u2019s portfolio would peak in 2017 at more than 70 percent.

At their peak, the trust fund\u2019s stock holdings would represent about twice Social Security\u2019s expected expenses in 2025. By 2034, the trust fund\u2019s assets would drop to about 150 percent of expected annual expenses. At that time, the trust fund would still have more than $1.5 trillion\u2014about one-third of its portfolio\u2014in stocks. In 2036, the trust fund would liquidate all of its stocks, and its special Treasury securities would drop below a 100 percent contingency reserve level.", "If only Social Security\u2019s cash surplus were invested, still assuming a 7 percent real rate of return, then the trust fund\u2019s projected exhaustion could be delayed by only 3 years, from 2029 to 2032. This scenario is somewhat more conservative; the trust fund would invest less than half as much as under the aggressive scenario. Within 5 years, the trust fund\u2019s stock investments would be about $200 billion. Stocks as a share of its portfolio would peak at about 35 percent, which is conservative in comparison to the 60 percent held by state and local government pension plans as a whole. The trust fund\u2019s stock holdings, in nominal dollars, would peak in 2017 at approximately $1.2 trillion, an amount roughly equivalent to that year\u2019s expected expenses.
