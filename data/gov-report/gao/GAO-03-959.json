GAO's research has shown that attempting to modernize an IT environment without a well-defined and enforceable enterprise architecture risks, among other things, building systems that do not effectively and efficiently support mission operations and performance. The FBI acknowledges the need for an enterprise architecture and has committed to developing one by the fall of 2003. However, it currently lacks the means for effectively reaching this end. For example, while the bureau did recently designate a chief architect and select an architecture framework to use, it does not yet have an agency architecture policy, an architecture program management plan, or an architecture development methodology, all of which are necessary components of effective architecture management. Given the state of the FBI's enterprise architecture management efforts, the bureau is at Stage 1 of GAO's enterprise architecture management maturity framework. Organizations at Stage 1 are characterized by architecture efforts that are ad hoc and unstructured, lack institutional leadership and direction, and do not provide the management foundation necessary for successful architecture development and use as a tool for informed IT investment decision making. A key for an organization to advance beyond this stage is to treat architecture development, maintenance, and implementation as an institutional management priority, which the FBI has yet to do.

Its mission includes upholding the law by  investigating serious federal crimes; protecting the nation from foreign  intelligence and terrorist threats; providing leadership and assistance to  federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies; and being  responsive to the public in the performance of these duties. Approximately  11,000 special agents and 16,000 professional support personnel are located  at the bureau\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 400 offices  throughout the United States and 44 offices in foreign countries.", "Mission responsibilities at the bureau are divided among five major  organizational components: Criminal Investigations, Law Enforcement  Services, Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence, Intelligence, and  Administration. Criminal Investigations, for example, investigates serious  federal crimes, including those associated with organized crime, violent  offenses, white-collar crime, government and business corruption, and civil  rights infractions. It also probes federal statutory violations involving  exploitation of the Internet and computer systems for criminal, foreign  intelligence, and terrorism purposes. (The major components and their  associated mission responsibilities are shown in table 1.) Each component  is headed by an Executive Assistant Director who reports to the Deputy  Director, who in turn reports to the Director.", "To execute its mission responsibilities, the FBI relies on the use of IT. For  example, it develops and maintains computerized IT systems such as the  Combined DNA Index System to support forensic examinations, the  Digital Collection System to electronically collect information on known  and suspected terrorists and criminals, and the National Crime Information  Center and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System to  help state and local law enforcement agencies identify criminals.  According to FBI estimates, the bureau manages hundreds of systems,  networks, databases, applications, and associated tools such as these at an  average annual cost of about $800 million."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FBI\u2019s Existing IT Environment Has Long Suffered from Known Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Several prior reviews of the FBI\u2019s existing IT environment have revealed  that it is antiquated and not integrated.

Moreover, it reported that some communications  networks were 12 years old and obsolete, and that many end-user  applications existed that were neither Web-enabled nor user-friendly. In  addition, a December 2001 review initiated by the Department of Justice  found that FBI\u2019s IT environment was disparate. In particular, it identified  234 nonintegrated (\u201cstove-piped\u201d) applications, residing on 187 different  servers, each of which had its own unique databases and did not share  information with other applications or with other government agencies.  Moreover, in June 2002, we reported that IT has been a long-standing  problem for the bureau, involving outdated hardware, outdated software,  and the lack of a fully functional E-mail system.

Collectively, the FBI\u2019s many modernization  efforts involve 51 initiatives that the FBI reported will cost about $1.5  billion between fiscal years 2002 and 2004. For example, the Trilogy  project, which is to introduce new systems infrastructure and applications,  includes establishing an enterprisewide network to enable  communications between hundreds of FBI locations domestically and  abroad, upgrading 20,000 desktop computers, and providing 2,400 printers  and 1,200 scanners. In addition, a new investigative data warehousing  initiative called Secure Counterterrorism Operational Prototype  Environment is to (1) aggregate voluminous counterterrorism files  obtained from both internal and external sources and (2) acquire analytical  capabilities to improve the FBI\u2019s ability to analyze these files.

In  April 2003, we published a maturity framework that arranges these key  practices and conditions (i.e., core elements) of the council\u2019s guide into five  hierarchical stages, with Stage 1 representing the least mature and Stage 5  being the most mature. The framework provides an explicit benchmark  for gauging the effectiveness of EA management and provides a roadmap  for making improvements. Each of the five stages is described below.  1. Creating EA awareness. The organization does not have plans to  develop and use an architecture, or it has plans that do not demonstrate  an awareness of the value of having and using an architecture. While  Stage 1 agencies may have initiated some EA activity, these agencies\u2019  efforts are ad hoc and unstructured, lack institutional leadership and  direction, and do not provide the management foundation necessary for  successful EA development. 2. Building the EA management foundation. The organization  recognizes that the EA is a corporate asset by vesting accountability for  it in an executive body that represents the entire enterprise. At this  stage, an organization assigns EA management roles and  responsibilities and establishes plans for developing EA products and  for measuring program progress and product quality; it also commits  the resources necessary for developing an architecture\u2014people,  processes, and tools. 3. Developing the EA. The organization focuses on developing  architecture products according to the selected framework,  methodology, tool, and established management plans. Roles and  responsibilities assigned in the previous stage are in place, and  resources are being applied to develop actual EA products. The scope  of the architecture has been defined to encompass the entire  enterprise, whether organization-based or function-based. 4. Completing the EA. The organization has completed its EA products,  meaning that the products have been approved by the EA steering  committee or an investment review board, and by the CIO. Further, an  independent agent has assessed the quality (i.e., completeness and  accuracy) of the EA products. Additionally, evolution of the approved  products is governed by a written EA maintenance policy approved by  the head of the organization. 5. Leveraging the EA to manage change. The organization has secured  senior leadership approval of the EA products and has a written  institutional policy stating that IT investments must comply with the  architecture, unless granted an explicit compliance waiver. Further,  decision makers are using the architecture to identify and address  ongoing and proposed IT investments that are conflicting, overlapping,  not strategically linked, or redundant. Also, the organization tracks and  measures EA benefits or return on investment, and adjustments are  continuously made to both the EA management process and the EA  products."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FBI Does Not Have an EA or the Management Foundation Needed to Effectively Develop, Maintain, and Implement One", "paragraphs": ["The FBI has yet to develop an EA, and it does not have the requisite means  in place to effectively develop, maintain, and implement one.

At the highest  level of component content description, the Federal Enterprise  Architecture Framework requires an \u201cas-is\u201d architectural description, a \u201cto- be\u201d architectural description, and a transition plan. For the \u201cas-is\u201d and \u201cto- be\u201d descriptions, this framework also requires the following major  architecture products: business, information/data, applications, and  technical components.", "The FBI has yet to develop any of these architectural components. In  response to our requests for all EA products, FBI officials, including the  chief architect and the deputy chief information officer, told us that they do  not yet exist. They added that they are currently in the process of  developing an inventory of the FBI\u2019s existing (legacy) systems, which is a  first step toward creating \u201cas-is\u201d architectural descriptions.

According to the FBI\u2019s chief  architect, although the FBI launched its architecture effort 32 months ago,  resources allocated to this effort have been limited to about $1 million  annually and four staff. In contrast, our research of successful architecture  efforts in other federal agencies shows that their resource needs are  considerably greater than those that the FBI has committed. Similarly, the  Justice Inspector General reported in December 2002 that limited funding  and resources contributed to the immature state of the bureau\u2019s EA efforts.  Additionally, assignment of responsibility and accountability for developing  the architecture has not been stable over the last 32 months. For example,  the chief architect has changed three times in the past 12 months.", "As our prior reviews of federal agencies and research of architecture best  practices show, attempts to modernize systems without an architecture,  which is what the FBI is doing, increases the risk that large sums of money  and much time and effort will be invested in technology solutions that are  duplicative, are not well integrated, are unnecessarily costly to maintain  and interface, and do not effectively optimize mission performance. In the  FBI\u2019s case, there are indications that this is occurring. For example, the  director of the modernization program management office told us that the  office recently assumed responsibility for managing three system  modernization initiatives and found that they will require rework in order  for them to be integrated. Such integration\u2014which an EA would have  provided for\u2014was not previously factored into their development.", "To allow for a more coordinated and integrated approach to pursuing its  other 48 modernization initiatives, the FBI has started holding informal  meetings among top managers to discuss related systems.

For example, Stage 2 specifies nine key practices or  core elements that are necessary to provide the management foundation  for successfully launching and sustaining an architecture effort. Five of the  nine Stage 2 core elements are described below.", "Establish an architecture steering committee representing the  enterprise and make the committee responsible for directing,  overseeing, or approving the EA. This committee should include  executive-level representatives from each line of business, and these  representatives should have the authority to commit resources and  enforce decisions within their respective organizational units. By  establishing this enterprisewide responsibility and accountability, the  agency demonstrates its commitment to building the management  foundation and obtaining buy-in from across the organization.", "Appoint a chief architect who is responsible and accountable for the  EA, and who is supported by the EA program office and overseen by  the architecture steering committee. The chief architect, in  collaboration with the Chief Information Officer, the architecture  steering committee, and the organizational head, is instrumental in  obtaining organizational buy-in for the EA, including support from the  business units, as well as in securing resources to support architecture  management functions, such as risk management, configuration  management, quality assurance, and security management.", "Use an architecture development framework, methodology, and  automated tool to develop and maintain the EA. These are important  because they provide the means for developing the architecture in a  consistent and efficient manner. The framework provides a formal  structure for representing the EA, while the methodology is the common  set of procedures that the enterprise is to follow in developing the EA  products. The automated tool serves as a repository where architectural  products are captured, stored, and maintained.", "Develop an architecture program management plan. This plan  specifies how and when the architecture is to be developed. It includes a  detailed work breakdown structure, resource estimates (e.g., funding,  staffing, and training), performance measures, and management  controls for developing and maintaining the architecture. The plan  demonstrates the organization\u2019s commitment to managing EA  development and maintenance as a formal program.", "Allocate adequate resources to the EA effort. An organization needs to  have the resources (funding, people, tools, and technology) to establish  and effectively manage its architecture.

Two of the six are discussed below.", "Issue a documented architecture policy, approved by the  organization\u2019s head, governing the development of the EA. The policy  defines the scope of the architecture, including the requirement for a  description of the baseline and target architecture, as well as an  investment roadmap or sequencing plan specifying the move between  the two. This policy is an important means for ensuring enterprisewide  commitment to developing an EA and for clearly assigning  responsibility for doing so.", "Ensure that EA products are under configuration management. This  involves ensuring that changes to products are identified, tracked,  monitored, documented, reported, and audited. Configuration  management maintains the integrity and consistency of products, which  is key to enabling effective integration among related products and for  ensuring alignment between architecture artifacts.", "At Stage 4, during which organizations focus on architecture completion  activities, organizations need to satisfy eight core elements. Two of the  eight are described below.", "Ensure that EA products and management processes undergo  independent verification and validation. This core element involves  having an independent third party\u2014such as an internal audit function or  contractor that is not involved with any of the architecture development  activities\u2014verify and validate that the products were developed in  accordance with EA processes and product standards. Doing so  provides organizations with needed assurance of the quality of the  architecture.", "Ensure that business, performance, information/data,  application/service, and technology descriptions address security. An  organization should explicitly and consistently address security in its  business, performance, information/data, application/service, and  technology EA products. Because security permeates every aspect of an  organization\u2019s operations, the nature and substance of institutionalized  security requirements, controls, and standards should be captured in EA  products.", "At Stage 5, during which the focus is on architecture maintenance and  implementation activities, organizations need to satisfy eight core  elements. Two of the eight are described below.", "Make EA an integral component of IT investment decision-making  processes. Because the roadmap defines the IT systems that an  organization plans to invest in as it transitions from the \u201cas-is\u201d to the \u201cto- be\u201d environment, the EA is a critical frame of reference for making IT  investment decisions. Using the EA when making such decisions is  important because organizations should approve only those investments  that move the organization toward the \u201cto-be\u201d environment, as specified  in the roadmap.", "Measure and report return on EA investment. Like any investment, the  EA should produce a return on investment (i.e., a set of benefits), and  this return should be measured and reported in relation to costs.  Measuring return on investment is important to ensure that expected  benefits from the EA are realized and to share this information with  executive decision makers, who can then take corrective action to  address deviations from expectations.", "Effective EA management is generally not achieved until an organization  has a completed and approved architecture that is being effectively  maintained and implemented, which is equivalent to having satisfied many  Stage 4 and 5 core elements.

We also interviewed FBI  officials, including the chief architect, to verify the status and plans for  developing bureau EA products, the causes for why none had been  completed to date, and the effects of proceeding with modernization  initiatives without an EA.", "To assess whether the FBI was effectively managing its architecture  activities, we compared bureau EA management practices to our EA  management maturity framework. This framework is based on A Practical  Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture, published by the federal Chief  Information Officers (CIO) Council. To do this, we first reviewed bureau  EA plans and products, and we interviewed FBI officials to verify and  clarify our understanding of bureau EA efforts. Next, we compared the  information that we had collected against our EA management maturity  framework practices to determine the extent to which the FBI was  employing such effective management practices. In addition, we  interviewed FBI\u2019s chief architect and other bureau officials to determine,  among other things, the cause of differences between what is specified in  the framework and the condition at the FBI. We also reviewed past FBI  information technology (IT) management studies and Department of  Justice Inspector General reports, to understand the state of FBI  management practices, including their strengths and weaknesses,  underlying causes for improvements, and open recommendations. Further,  we interviewed FBI division officials to understand the extent of their  participation in the bureau\u2019s architecture efforts. Finally, to verify our  findings and validate our assessment, we discussed with the chief architect  our analysis of the state of FBI\u2019s EA practices against our maturity  framework.", "We performed our work at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., from  September 2002 until August 2003, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of FBI\u2019s Enterprise Architecture (EA) Efforts against GAO\u2019s EA Management Maturity Framework", "paragraphs": ["Agency is aware of EA.", "The FBI has acknowledged the need for an EA.", "Adequate resources exist.", "The FBI has allocated four architects and  approximately $1 million annually for the  development, implementation, and maintenance of  its EA.", "Committee or group representing the  enterprise is responsible for  directing, overseeing, or approving  EA.", "The FBI has established the architecture  governance board to direct, oversee, and approve  the EA.
