One category\u2014razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others\u2014disposable razors and mass-market perfumes\u2014showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed.", "Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender\u2014mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results.", "In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences.

These differences related to gender can affect  manufacturing and marketing costs that may contribute to price  differences in products targeted to different genders.", "However, firms may also charge consumers different prices for the same  (or very similar) goods and services even when there are no differences  in costs to produce. To maximize profits, firms use a variety of  techniques to charge prices close to the highest price different consumers  are willing to pay. Firms may attempt to get segments of the consumer  market to pay a higher price than another segment by slightly altering or  differentiating the product. Based on the differentiated products,  consumers self-select into different groups according to their preferences  and what they are willing to pay. For example, some consumer goods  have different versions of what is essentially the same product\u2014except  for differences in packaging or features, such as scent\u2014with one version  intended for women and another version intended for men. The two  products may be priced differently because the firm expects that one  gender will be willing to pay more for the product than the other based on  preference for certain product attributes.", "Firms may also use some group characteristic, such as age or gender, to  charge different prices because some groups may have differences in  willingness or ability to pay. For example, a firm may offer discounted  movie tickets to students or seniors, as they may have less disposable  income. For the seller the cost of providing the movie is the same for any  customer, but the seller is able to maximize its profits by offering tickets to  different groups of customers at different prices. A firm\u2019s ability to  differentiate prices depends on multiple factors, such as the firm\u2019s market  power (so that competitors cannot put downward pressure on prices to  eliminate the price differences), the presence of consumer segments with  different demands and willingness to pay, and control over the sale of its  product so it cannot be easily resold to exploit price differences.", "In addition, the extent to which consumers pay different prices for the  same or similar goods can depend on other factors, such as consumers\u2019: willingness to purchase an item they believe may be priced higher for ability to compare prices and product characteristics and choose a  product based on its characteristics rather than its price,  choices about whether to purchase a more expensive version of the  product (e.g., a branded item versus a cheaper store brand),  choices about where to purchase the item (i.e., when different  retailers sell the same item at different prices), and use of coupons or promotions.", "No federal law expressly prohibits businesses from charging different  prices for the same or similar consumer goods and services targeted to  men and women. However, consumer protection laws do prohibit sex  discrimination in credit and real estate transactions.

Credit,  such as a credit card account or mortgage loan, is generally made  available and priced based on a number of risk factors, including credit  score, income, and employment history. A borrower with a lower credit  score is likely to pay a higher interest rate on a loan, reflecting the greater  risk to the lender that the borrower could default on the loan. In addition  to the interest rate, borrowing costs for consumers can also include fees  and other costs charged by lenders or brokers. However, there may be  differences in average outcomes for men and women\u2014such as for  availability of credit or interest rates\u2014if there are differences related to  gender in the factors that determine creditworthiness, such as income.", "BCFP, FTC, the federal prudential regulators, and DOJ have the authority  to investigate alleged violations of ECOA and are primarily responsible for  enforcing the act\u2019s requirements, while HUD and DOJ share responsibility  for enforcing the provisions of FHA.

First, our analysis suggests that due to industry  concentration, there is limited market competition for the 10 personal care  products we analyzed.

Second, firms have  the ability to segment the market for personal care products by tailoring  product characteristics related to gender, such as by labeling the product  as women\u2019s deodorant or men\u2019s deodorant, or by altering scent or colors.  Third, while men and women are able to freely purchase a product  targeted to the opposite gender, certain factors may limit the extent to  which this occurs.

In addition, two  of these laws included requirements related to promoting price  transparency. California enacted the Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995,  which prohibits businesses from charging different prices for the same or  similar services based on a consumer\u2019s gender. The law also requires  certain businesses to display price information and disclose prices upon  request, according to state officials with whom we spoke. Similarly, in  1997, Miami-Dade County passed the Gender Pricing Ordinance, which  prohibits businesses from charging different prices based solely on a  consumer\u2019s gender (though businesses are permitted to charge different  prices if the goods or services involve more time, difficulty, or cost). In the  same year, it also passed an ordinance that prohibits dry cleaning  businesses from charging different prices for similar services based on  gender.

The  factors that we controlled for were the product size, promotional and  packaging costs, and other product characteristics discussed in detail  later. We used scanner data from the Nielsen Company (Nielsen) for  calendar year 2016 and analyzed the following 10 product categories: (1)  underarm deodorants, (2) body deodorants, (3) shaving cream, (4)  shaving gel, (5) disposable razors, (6) nondisposable razors, (7) razor  blades, (8) designer perfumes, (9) mass-market perfumes, and (10)  mass-market body sprays. We estimated the following regression model  for each of our 10 product categories:  P=\u03b1+\u03b2*Male + \u03bb* Size + \u03b8*Owner +\u03b7*Promotion+ \u03bc*X + \u03b4*Y + \u03b5  The dependent variable P in the above equation represents price. For our  analysis, we constructed two measures of price. The first is the item price,  estimated as the total dollar sales of an item (each item is depicted by a  unique Universal Product Code (UPC) in the Nielsen data), divided by the  total units sold of that item. The second measure of price that we use is  price per ounce or price per count. This is estimated as the item price  divided by the total quantity of product, where quantity or size depicts the  number of ounces (as in the case of fragrances) or the count of blades in  razor blade packs. The total quantity of the product is the ounces or  counts of one item multiplied by the number of items included in a specific  product configuration. For example, a 2-pack of deodorant sticks where  each deodorant stick is 2.7 ounces would be a total quantity of 5.4  ounces.", "The variable Male in the above equation is an indicator variable depicting  whether the product is designated as a \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d product in the Nielsen  data. It is represented as a value of \u201c1\u201d for men\u2019s products and a value of  \u201c0\u201d for women\u2019s products. The co-efficient for this variable, parameter \u03b2,  would therefore show the price difference between a men\u2019s and women\u2019s  product. A negative value would imply a lower price for products  designated as men\u2019s products.", "The variable Size represents the most appropriate specification of the  size of the product.", "Owner is a set of indicator variables representing all the brand owners  selling a particular product. The brand of a product can be expected to  have a substantial effect on prices for the kind of products we analyze  because brands can be a proxy for quality for some consumers. However,  we also found that firms often create gender-specific brands, so holding  brands constant rendered most gender-based price comparisons  infeasible. To overcome this, we hold owners instead of brands constant  for our price comparison analysis.", "The variable Promotion represents the percentage of dollar sales that  were sold on any type of promotion. This variable proxies for promotional  costs to some extent based on the assumption that the greater the  proportion of sales due to promotional activity, the greater the promotional  costs.", "The variables X represent a set of indicator variables for packaging  characteristics such as package delivery method (for example, roll-on or  aerosol spray deodorants) or package shape (for example, bottle, tube, or  can). We expect these characteristics to proxy for different costs  associated with different packaging methods.", "The variables Y represent a set of indicator variables representing  different product characteristics (for example, forms such as gel stick or  smooth solid and claims such as \u201cactive cooling\u201d or \u201canti-wetness\u201d for  underarm deodorants, and blade types such as \u201ctriple edge\u201d and \u201cflexible  six\u201d for razors). These product characteristics may proxy for some  underlying manufacturing costs or even consumer preferences. Since  firms may create gender-specific product attributes\u2014scents like \u201csweet  petals\u201d and \u201cpure sport\u201d or razor head types and colors to differentiate  products between genders\u2014we did not always keep every product  attribute constant when comparing prices. The idiosyncratic error term is  represented by \u03b5.", "All of our regressions are weighted, with the proportion of units sold for a  particular item in that year as the weight. This is because, for personal  care products, there are large differences in units sold of various product  types and brands, and therefore it not useful to compare simple un- weighted average prices. For example, for one company the highest  selling men\u2019s deodorant stick sold almost 12 million units in 2016, and the  highest selling women\u2019s deodorant stick sold over 8 million units. The  average units sold for underarm deodorants as a whole was just over  300,000 units, and 1,000 products out of a total of almost 3,000 products  had less than 100 units sold in 2016.", "The linear model we used has the usual shortcomings of being subject to  specification bias to the extent the relationship between price and each of  the independent variables is not linear. The model also does not include  complete data on costs, such as advertising and packaging, or  consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, both of which have an effect on the price  differences. The model may thus also be subject to omitted variable bias.  In addition, the model may have some endogeneity issues to the extent  the product characteristics themselves are influenced by consumers\u2019  willingness to pay for some of those product features. To reduce the  impact of any model misspecifications or heteroscedasticity, we used the  robust (or Huber-White sandwich) estimator.", "We estimated the regression model above for each of the 10 products  separately and for each of the two measures of price. We used Nielsen\u2019s  in-store, retail price scanner data, which include information on total  volume sold and dollar sales for items purchased at 228 retailers  including grocery stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers (such as  Target), dollar stores, club stores (such as Sam\u2019s Club), and convenience  stores. The data capture 82 percent of all U.S. sales. Nielsen also  projects sales for the remaining noncooperating retailers, and that  information is included in this dataset. We excluded some very small  brands that did not have enough units sold from our regression analysis  in order to avoid outliers. These brands usually had less than 50,000 units  sold over the entire year, and for some products they represented less  than 1 percent of all units sold. We found that average retail prices paid  were significantly higher for women\u2019s products than for men\u2019s in 5 out of  10 personal care products. In 2 categories, men\u2019s versions sold at a  significantly higher price.
