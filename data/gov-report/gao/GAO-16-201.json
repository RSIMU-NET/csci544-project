The Navy is compensating for this by redefining how it plans to operate the ships.", "In 2014, the Navy conducted its first operational test of an early increment of the surface warfare mission package on a Freedom variant LCS, demonstrating that LCS could meet an interim lethality requirement. The Navy declared LCS operationally effective. However, the Navy's test report stated that the ship did not meet some key requirements. Further, the Department of Defense's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has stated that there is insufficient data to provide statistical confidence that LCS can meet its lethality requirements in future testing or operations, and further testing is needed to demonstrate both variants can meet requirements in varied threat environments.", "The Navy also has not yet demonstrated that LCS will achieve its survivability requirements, and does not plan to complete survivability assessments until 2018\u2014after more than 24 ships are either in the fleet or under construction.

He also directed the Navy to assess the cost and feasibility of backfitting lethality and survivability enhancements on current LCS. Nevertheless, the Navy has established a new frigate program office to manage this program, and the Navy has requested $1.4 billion for three LCS in the fiscal year 2016 President's budget, even though it is clear that the current ships fall short of identified survivability and lethality needs.

In addition, we reviewed relevant Navy policies stipulating  general survivability and shock requirements for ships. To assess the  extent to which LCS meets its current survivability and lethality  requirements, we analyzed Navy and Director, Operational Test and  Evaluation (DOT&E) test reports for developmental and operational test  events and reviewed the 2013 LCS test and evaluation master plan. We  also observed one day of the Total Ship Survivability Trial conducted on  LCS 3 in October 2014.

LCS was initially developed to  provide a lower-cost surface combatant with a smaller crew than other  ships and modest combat capabilities in focused areas, compared to  higher cost multi-mission surface combatants like destroyers. LCS is  envisioned to operate in both littoral waters and the deep ocean in all  theaters of operation. Early in the program, the Navy decided to forgo a  number of traditional ship requirements in order to help reduce the costs  and the weight and size of LCS, which in turn made the ship less robust  in terms of weaponry and survivability than other surface combatants.  Those decisions were validated by the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  Joint Requirements Oversight Council.", "Both LCS variants initially leveraged commercial ship designs, and were  modified in accordance with established sets of technical criteria, called  rules, that were developed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).

The Freedom variant design  has an aluminum deckhouse mated to a steel hull, while the  Independence variant is entirely made of aluminum with no steel  structure. Historically, many Navy ships have been made largely out of  steel, though several classes\u2014recent examples include the CG 47  Ticonderoga class cruisers and the FFG 7 Oliver Hazard Perry class  frigates\u2014have utilized an aluminum deckhouse. The lower density of  aluminum provides advantages in that it is lighter than steel, which helps  LCS achieve its high speed requirement. However, aluminum is also  known to lose stiffness more quickly than steel at elevated temperatures  in a fire, and the Navy has identified that this phenomenon needs further  study on LCS. The Independence variant uses an alloy of aluminum that  has not been used in prior Navy ship construction, so accumulated Navy  knowledge about how the aluminum on older ships reacts to damage  cannot be applied wholesale to the Independence variant. In addition,  both variants\u2014though more so the Independence variant\u2014use extruded  aluminum planks\u2014complex shapes that are formed by pushing heated  aluminum through a die using a hydraulic press.

Specifically, technical experts from the Naval Sea Systems Command  have stated that they do not fully understand how the hull would react to  whipping caused by an underwater explosion. Underwater explosions  create a shock wave and a highly compressed gas bubble that expands  and contracts. This can cause a type of vertical or horizontal flexing of the  ship called a whipping force. The severity of this whipping force and the  resulting damage is a function of the size of the explosion and the  distance from the hull, among other factors, and not all shocks lead to a  whipping response. If the whipping is significant enough, this vibration  could cause catastrophic damage and may cause a ship to break apart.  Naval Sea Systems Command technical experts have identified a lack of  experimental data on the whipping response of a trimaran hullform. These  technical experts stated that there is currently no algorithm in existence to  model how this hull type would perform, and stated that there is no plan to  invest in such an algorithm or a physical hull model for testing since the  LCS CDD has no explicit requirement for LCS to survive a whipping  response, though it does have an underwater shock requirement.

The Navy later stated in its technical  comments that there was not a disagreement, and that the Navy and the  technical team agree that the damage identified after the trial resulted  from quality control issues during construction, but cannot confirm that the  damage occurred during the trial itself because no pre-trial inspection was  conducted.

While current plans to protect LCS with more  capable ships in higher-threat environments may be a more cost effective  solution to addressing capability limitations, these changes also reflect an  ever-shrinking set of situations in which LCS can operate without placing  added demands on the larger combatants. Further, although the Navy  has a significant lack of knowledge of the Independence variant\u2019s lethality  and survivability capabilities with no plans to seek additional analysis from  an independent technical authority to resolve questions on its rough water  trial report, it continues with plans to buy equal numbers of both variants.", "The Navy is quickly embarking on an effort to redesign the LCS to  address lethality and survivability concerns.

Each  shipyard currently has 10 LCS in various stages of construction\u2014some  having not even started construction\u2014and most are experiencing  schedule delays.

We interviewed relevant Navy officials,  including from the Program Executive Office LCS for both the seaframes  and the mission packages; and Navy technical experts from the Naval  Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division and the Naval Research Lab  including technical warrant holders responsible for ship vulnerability and  shock tolerances. We obtained written responses from the Program  Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems. We also discussed  survivability and crew training issues with LCS Squadron One, Navy Fleet  Forces Command, and Navy Surface Forces Pacific officials.", "To assess the extent to which LCS meets its current lethality  requirements, we limited our assessment to the lethality of core seaframe  and the SUW mission package because the MCM and ASW mission  bring no or little offensive capability packages and both rely on the core  seaframe systems for self-defense. The ASW mission package will carry  a helicopter that can drop torpedoes, but this system is a well  characterized capability that is currently used in the fleet, so we did not  assess the effectiveness of this system. Further, the Navy has yet to field  a production representative ASW mission package to evaluate. To assess  LCS\u2019s performance, we analyzed Navy Commander, Operational Test  and Evaluation Force reports including the SUW initial operational test  and evaluation report, and Navy Surface Warfare Center Corona Division  test analysis reports from LCS developmental test events and DOT&E  reports. We reviewed the LCS Live Fire Test and Evaluation Management  Plan, and the Navy\u2019s 57mm and 30mm ammunition Live Fire Test and  Evaluation Management Plans. We also analyzed the USS Independence  Capabilities and Limitations document (2010) and the USS Freedom  Combat System Employment Guide. We reviewed the Navy\u2019s Damage  Control Book for LCS 3 and the LCS 1 Repair Party Manual. We also  interviewed relevant Navy officials, including from the Program Executive  Offices for LCS for both the seaframes and the mission packages; the  Naval Surface Warfare Center Corona Division; and Navy Commander of  Operational Test and Evaluation Force. We also interviewed relevant  DOT&E officials. We obtained written responses from the Office of the  Chief of Naval Operations LCS branch and from the Program Executive  Office Integrated Warfare Systems. We also reviewed the LCS 2 Special  Trial report.", "To assess the recent decisions pertaining to upcoming changes to the  program in response to the Secretary of Defense\u2019s concerns with LCS  lethality and survivability, we analyzed available Navy documentation on  the proposed modified LCS. We also met with the small surface  combatant study team. We were not provided with a copy of the study  team\u2019s report in time to include an analysis of that document in this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Diana Moldafsky (Assistant  Director), Greg Campbell, Laurier Fish, Laura Greifner, Kristine  Hassinger, C.
