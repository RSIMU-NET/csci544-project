Faith-based organizations (FBO), such as churches and religiously affiliated entities, are a part of this network and have a long history of providing social services to needy families and individuals. In the past, religious organizations were required to secularize their services and premises, so that their social service activities were distinctly separate from their religious activities, as a condition of receiving public funds. For example, the organizations often were required to incorporate separately from their sponsoring religious institution, refrain from religious activities in the publicly funded services, and remove religious symbols from the premises where the services were provided. Beginning with the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, the Congress enacted \u201ccharitable choice\u201d provisions, which authorized religious organizations to compete on the same basis as other organizations for federal funding under certain programs without having to alter their religious character or governance. These charitable choice provisions also require that the programs be implemented in a manner consistent with the First Amendment to the Constitution. These statutory provisions cover several programs, among them Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Welfare-to-Work (WTW). Similar provisions also apply to the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) and the substance abuse prevention and treatment (SAPT) programs. These charitable choice provisions contain certain safeguards that were intended to protect the interests of the various parties\u2013governments, FBOs, and beneficiaries\u2013 involved in federally funded financial agreements under these programs.For example, if a beneficiary objects to the religious nature of a service provider, the state or locality must make available an alternative provider that is without religious affiliation.", "Because the Congress has recently considered enacting charitable choice provisions in other programs, you asked us to report on how current provisions have been implemented. Specifically, you asked:   What is known about the extent and nature of financial agreements between FBOs and government entities nationally and in selected states?", "What factors have constrained or complicated financial agreements with FBOs?", "How have the federal charitable choice provisions intended to provide safeguards for various parties been implemented and what, if any, problems have arisen?", "How are FBOs being held accountable for performance and what information is available regarding their performance?", "To obtain a national perspective on charitable choice, we analyzed the results of our 50-state survey of TANF contracting, interviewed federal officials who oversee programs with charitable choice provisions, and reviewed federal agency reports on barriers to contracting with FBOs and the implementation of charitable choice provisions. To obtain more specific information about how charitable choice has been implemented, we visited 5 states\u2014Georgia, Indiana, Texas, Virginia, and Washington\u2014 and conducted telephone interviews with faith-based liaisons established in 15 states. We selected these 5 states to obtain a range in the levels of both state government activities with regard to faith-based initiatives and contracting with FBOs, as well as geographic dispersion. In each state, we interviewed state and local government officials who administered programs with charitable choice provisions, representatives of FBOs, and representatives of agencies involved in contracting for social services. We performed our work between September 2001 and July 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For more details on our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To increase the involvement of religious organizations in the delivery of social services, the Congress included charitable choice provisions in the legislation for several federal programs. These provisions were designed to remove legal or perceived barriers that religious organizations might face in contracting with the federal government. First enacted in 1996, charitable choice provisions apply to administrators, service providers, and recipients of TANF and WTW funds, as established through PRWORA. Subsequently, the Congress included charitable choice provisions in the 1998 reauthorization of the CSBG program and the amendments to the Public Health Services Act in 2000 affecting the SAPT block grant program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Funding", "paragraphs": ["Funding levels for programs with charitable choice provisions vary considerably, with TANF having the highest level of funding (see table 1). These programs allocate funds in a variety of ways. TANF, CSBG, and SAPT are block grants, which are distributed in lump sums to states. WTW has two funding streams, one of which is comprised of state formula grants that are mostly passed on to localities and the other representing a smaller portion of funds called national competitive grants, which the Department of Labor awarded directly to local applicants. Most federal funding for these programs is administered by state or local government entities, which have the ability to contract with social service providers, including religious organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charitable Choice Safeguards", "paragraphs": ["In addition to establishing that FBOs can compete for public funds while retaining their religious nature, charitable choice provisions are intended to safeguard the interests of the various parties involved in financial agreements to provide services (see table 2).

National data are not available on the proportion of contracted funds FBOs received for CSBG, SAPT, and Welfare-to-Work formula grants. However, state data indicate that FBOs received a small proportion of CSBG and SAPT funds in the five states we visited. All FBOs that we visited had tax-exempt status and most were incorporated separately from religious institutions. In addition, a majority had established contracts with the government before the passage of charitable choice provisions in legislation; most were affiliated with Christian denominations; and most contracted for TANF funds.

TANF contracting occurs only at the state level in 24 states, only at the local level in 5 states, at both levels in 20 other states, and in the District of Columbia.  TANF contracting does not occur in South Dakota. The majority of the approximately $1 billion in federal and state TANF funds spent by state governments on contracts with nongovernmental entities nationwide went to secular nonprofit organizations, as shown in figure 1. In contrast, contracts with FBOs accounted for 8 percent of the contracted funds.", "While FBOs received a small proportion of federal and state TANF funds contracted out in 2001 at the state level, this proportion varied considerably across states, as shown in table 3. New Jersey spent over 32 percent of these funds on contracts with FBOs.  Nine states and the District of Columbia spent more than 15 percent of these federal and state TANF funds on contracts with FBOs. In contrast, 23 states awarded to FBOs less than 5 percent of the federal and state TANF funds they contracted out to nongovernmental organizations. While table 3 depicts contracting by state governments, it does not include information on contracting by local entities. In states such as California, New York, and Texas, TANF contracting occurs predominately at the local level. Our national survey of TANF contracting identified more than $500 million in local government contracts with nongovernmental entities. About 8 percent of these funds were with FBOs.", "In addition, national data show that a small proportion of WTW competitive grant funds went to FBOs. According to Labor, 6 of 191 contracts for these funds went to FBOs in fiscal years 1998 and 1999; these contracts totaled $16.2 million, or approximately 2 percent of WTW competitive grant funds in those years.", "National data are not available to indicate the magnitude of contracting with FBOs in other charitable choice programs we examined. Labor did not have information about the proportion of WTW formula grants that went to FBOs. States administer these grant funds through local entities.

While 31 of the 35 FBO contractors we visited had been established to be independent of religious institutions, all of them had tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Several of these FBOs told us that they needed this status to compete for nongovernmental sources of funding, such as funding from private foundations. Some FBOs noted that this status established them as a legal entity separate from a church so that the church would be protected from liability for the services the FBO offered. Moreover, some FBO officials told us that 501(c)(3) status gave their program added credibility and an established presence in the community. Of the 35 FBO contractors we visited, 21 had contracted with the government before the passage of charitable choice legislation in the relevant programs. One FBO had provided services through government contracts since 1913.", "The FBOs we selected for interviews in the five states we visited varied in size and structure but shared some commonalities. While some FBOs were very small, operating on a budget of less than $200,000, others had large annual budgets, as high as $60 million. Some of the FBOs we visited operated independently; some were multidenominational coalitions of churches; and others were affiliated with a national religious organization, such as Catholic Charities, the Association of Jewish Family & Children\u2019s Services, or the Salvation Army. Twenty-nine of the 35 FBOs were affiliated with the Christian faith and included various Christian denominations, for example, Baptist, Methodist, and Lutheran. Finally, about two-thirds of these FBOs contracted for TANF-funded services.", "FBOs we visited contracted for services that matched the key uses of each program\u2019s funds and sometimes included additional features. While more FBOs provided services closer to the key uses of TANF program funds, such as job preparation, several of the FBOs contracting for TANF services included fatherhood programs or forms of mentoring in their programs. FBOs that contracted for WTW funds mostly provided job training and placement; one also helped clients find daycare services. FBOs contracting for SAPT funds provided prevention and treatment of substance abuse.

However, most of these limitations are not unique to FBOs but are common to small, inexperienced organizations seeking to enter into contracts with government. Although most officials in the states we visited reported no legal barriers to prevent religious organizations from partnering with government, some officials noted that their history of a strong separation of church and state might lead all parties to be cautious about collaboration. Government agencies in the states we visited differed in their approaches to identification and removal of constraints that can limit financial contracting between FBOs and government.

Notices about funding opportunities are sent to current provider mailing lists, to newspapers, and sometimes to agency Web sites. Because state and local governments are not required to promote a broader awareness of funding opportunities for new providers under current charitable choice provisions, government agencies in less active states have not taken steps to disseminate information about funding opportunities to FBOs. As a result, potential service providers that are not on current notification lists, including FBOs, may remain unaware of upcoming funding opportunities while experienced providers have advance notice.", "Moreover, small, inexperienced FBOs are disadvantaged by their limited administrative capacity, according to many government and FBO officials we interviewed. Small FBO providers often lack the administrative resources necessary to deal with the complex paperwork requirements of government contracting. Local program officials said that some new FBO providers may have never submitted a budget, or may overestimate their capacity to provide services, or may have difficulty with reporting requirements. Some small FBOs we interviewed rely on one person\u2014who may have other duties\u2014or a small number of staff and volunteers, to perform administrative tasks. Government officials told us that small faith- based contractors inexperienced in government contracting often required administrative and technical assistance.", "Similarly, FBO officials have expressed concerns about the financial constraints of government contracting. Some FBO officials we interviewed reported experiencing cash flow problems resulting from start-up costs and payment delays. In some cases, their churches helped with start-up funds, or other expenses, including overhead and indirect assistance. Furthermore, in a March 2001 survey conducted by the Georgia Faith- Based Liaison, religious leaders reported that while they were interested in government contracting, they had concerns regarding their limited financial capacity to manage publicly funded programs. These same leaders also expressed concerns about their financial capacity if they were to offer child-care or social services for welfare clients because of the risks associated with payment delays.", "Most state and local officials in the states we visited reported that no legal barriers exist to prevent FBOs from contracting with the government in programs with charitable choice provisions. However, some officials noted that perceptions about the separation of church and state might cause both FBO and government officials to be cautious about entering into contracts. One state lawmaker in Georgia identified the state\u2019s constitution as one source of this perception, noting that it contains language forbidding the funding of religious organizations with state funds. Because of confusion over whether the state constitution also applied to federal funds, Georgia adopted a law that specified that charitable choice allowed religious organizations to receive federal funding.", "Most government officials we interviewed told us that state licensure or certification requirements for substance abuse treatment providers do not restrict religious organizations from participating in publicly funded treatment programs. However, in all of the states we visited, substance abuse treatment providers are required to be licensed or certified in order to be eligible for publicly funded contracts. Government officials noted that because the health and safety requirements attached to licensing can be costly, they might pose a barrier to small FBOs that want to be licensed to offer this service. To address this, lawmakers in the state of Washington proposed easing licensing requirements for FBO substance abuse treatment providers. However, this proposal was not approved because of concerns that this would lower standards for FBO providers.", "Government and FBO officials we interviewed in several states reported that some FBOs prefer not to partner with government for various reasons. For example, some faith-based providers do not want to separate their religion from their delivery of services. In a recent survey conducted by Oklahoma\u2019s Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiative to identify barriers to collaboration, religious leaders reported that they were concerned about potential erosion of their religious mission, government intrusion into affairs of the congregation, and excessive bureaucracy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Vary in Their Approach to Addressing Constraints", "paragraphs": ["While states we visited differed in their approaches, some states have taken more active strategies toward addressing factors that constrain FBOs from government contracting. Some states, such as Texas and Virginia, established task forces to advise the governor or legislature about actions for improving government collaboration with FBOs. To promote awareness and facilitate collaborations with FBOs, 20 states have appointed faith-based liaisons since the enactment of charitable choice provisions in the current law. Four of the five states we visited directed outreach activities to engage religious leaders and government officials in discussions of the perceived barriers to collaboration and to promote awareness of funding opportunities.", "Some states took steps to strengthen the administrative capacity of FBOs by providing informational opportunities and developing educational material for FBOs unfamiliar with government contracting. Indiana, Virginia, and Texas conducted informational sessions and workshops for FBOs. In addition, Virginia and Indiana created educational handbooks dedicated to new faith-based social service providers with information on topics such as applying for government funding, writing grants, and forming a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization. Some state and local officials we interviewed told us that they offer assistance and administrative information to any small, new provider during the pre- contracting phase.", "Other states, which we did not visit, reported that they created separate funding for their faith-based initiatives. New Jersey set up its own Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiative and funded it using only state funds, according to the New Jersey faith-based liaison. This office began awarding grants for services such as day care, youth mentoring, and substance abuse treatment to FBOs in 1998 and plans to award $2.5 million in grants this year to faith-based providers. North Carolina developed a \u201cCommunities of Faith Initiatives,\u201d which set aside $2.45 million in TANF funds for its Faith-Demonstration awards in 1999 and 2000 to contract with various FBOs for job retention and follow- up demonstration pilots."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Also Taken Actions to Address Constraints", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have also acted to identify and address constraints to government collaborations with FBOs.

Even though HHS has recently created a charitable choice Web site outlining most of the safeguards and has sponsored workshops featuring charitable choice issues, it has not issued guidance to states on the meaning of the provisions designed to safeguard parties involved in government contracting. According to an HHS official, although they have drafted guidance for charitable choice provisions as they apply to substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, this document has not been released. HHS officials told us that the agency did not write regulatory language concerning charitable choice and TANF because PRWORA specifically limits HHS from regulating the conduct of states under TANF, except as expressly provided in the law. While PRWORA includes charitable choice provisions, the law does not indicate that HHS may prescribe how states must implement these provisions. With respect to CSBG funds, HHS\u2019s Office of Community Services has distributed an information memorandum to states communicating the safeguards as they are listed in the CSBG law, but this memorandum does not offer guidance on how states should interpret the safeguard provisions. Finally, Labor\u2019s solicitation of grant applications for WTW competitive grants specifically mentioned that FBOs were eligible to apply for the funds, but Labor did not issue guidance concerning charitable choice safeguards.

Several state and local officials reported that prayer was not allowed in the delivery of publicly funded social services, while many FBO officials said that voluntary prayer was permissible during such services.

In addition, in February 2002, The Pew Charitable Trusts awarded a $6.3 million grant to the Rockefeller Institute of Government, based at the State University of New York in Albany, to study the capacity and effectiveness of FBOs in providing social services and other issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While HHS and Labor have taken steps to increase awareness of funding opportunities for religious and community organizations, state and local government officials and FBO officials continue to differ in their understanding of charitable choice rules, particularly regarding specific safeguards designed to protect the various parties involved in financial arrangements, including FBOs and clients. In addition, clients are sometimes not being informed about the safeguards that are specifically designed to protect them. This is a problem because government entities generally rely on complaints from clients to enforce such safeguards. When all parties are not fully aware of their rights and responsibilities under charitable choice provisions, violations of these rights may go undetected and unreported.", "While HHS officials said that they interpret PRWORA to mean that the agency does not have the authority to issue regulations on charitable choice for TANF programs, HHS does have the authority to issue other forms of guidance to states for TANF programs. Additional guidance to clarify the safeguards and suggest ways in which they can be implemented would promote greater consistency in the way that government agencies meet their responsibilities in implementing charitable choice provisions. Without guidance from HHS, consistency in the interpretation of charitable choice provisions is unlikely. Because the WTW funds were not reauthorized and all funds have been distributed to grantees, the issuance of guidance by Labor to states is no longer needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to promote greater consistency of interpretation and implementation of charitable choice provisions, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS issue guidance to the appropriate state and local agencies administering TANF, CSBG, and SAPT programs on charitable choice safeguards, including the safeguard prohibiting the use of federal funds for religious worship, instruction, or proselytizing and the safeguard concerning a client\u2019s right to an alternative (nonreligious) provider. In particular, this guidance should offer clarification concerning allowable activities that a religious organization may engage in while retaining its religious nature."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and Labor for their review. HHS agreed with our recommendation and said that it is in the process of developing and issuing guidance to the appropriate state and local agencies administering these programs. HHS also provided detailed information on how it plans to use the $30 million Compassion Capital Fund, which is intended to assist FBOs and community-based organizations. HHS\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II. Labor had no formal comments. HHS and Labor also provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date.

We selected these states to obtain a range in the levels of both state government activities with regard to faith-based initiatives and contracting with faith-based organizations, as well as geographic dispersion. In addition, we did telephone interviews with faith-based liaisons established in 15 states (these were all of the liaisons that had been established as of September 2001).", "To identify what is known about the extent and nature of faith-based organization (FBO) contracting, we compiled information from several sources. We analyzed results from our national survey of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) contracting of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 10 counties with the largest federal TANF- funding allocations in each of the 13 states that locally administer their TANF programs. In addition, we interviewed state and local program officials that administer TANF, Welfare-to-Work (WTW), Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) funded programs in the states we visited. Finally, we analyzed documents and data provided to us by federal, state, and local officials.", "To identify the extent of FBO contracting in the WTW program, we obtained national information from the Department of Labor, which oversees this program. To identify the extent of FBO contracting in the SAPT block grant programs in the 5 states visited, we contacted state officials responsible for these programs to obtain data on certified substance abuse treatment providers eligible to receive federal funds and contracting under this program. To identify the extent of FBO contracting in the CSBG programs in these states, we contacted state officials responsible for CSBG funded programs to obtain data on FBO contracting and subcontracting. To identify the nature of services provided in the four programs, we contacted federal, state and local officials overseeing these programs. In addition, we visited FBOs that contracted with the government and some that did not have contracts. We also reviewed relevant documents related to the contracting process.", "To obtain information on the implementation of charitable choice, including factors that constrain FBOs in contracting with the government, implementing safeguard provisions, and the performance of FBOs, we met with officials at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor in Washington, D.C., that oversee the TANF, WTW, CSBG, and SAPT programs. We conducted telephone interviews with faith-based liaisons in 15 states and on-site interviews with state and local officials in various locations in Georgia, Indiana, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. To obtain the perspective of FBOs, we also interviewed FBO officials that have had contracts with the government under these programs, as well as some that do not have contracts with the government. In addition, we interviewed researchers that have conducted related studies on charitable choice implementation and the relative performance of FBOs. We also reviewed audit reports for the two federal agencies that oversee these programs.
