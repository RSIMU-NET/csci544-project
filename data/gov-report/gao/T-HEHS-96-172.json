Still, about 10 percent of the veteran population has neither public nor private insurance to help pay for basic health care services. Such veterans tend to rely on public hospitals and clinics, and on VA health care facilities, to meet their health care needs. These programs, however, are unable to meet the basic health care needs of all veterans who need them. A small group of veterans report that they have been unable to obtain needed hospital and outpatient services. Most of these veterans do not live near a VA hospital or outpatient clinic.", "While the acute care needs of most veterans are met through public and private health care programs, veterans needing specialized services, such as treatment for spinal cord injuries, blindness, and war-related stress, are more likely to find private-sector providers unable to meet their needs. In addition, neither public nor private-sector programs provide extensive coverage of nursing home and other long-term care services needed by an increasingly aging veteran population.", "There are a number of ways that VA could address the unmet needs of veterans using existing resources and legislative authority. For example, it could reduce the resources spent in providing care to higher-income veterans with no service-connected disabilities (discretionary care category veterans) in VA facilities and use those resources instead to purchase more care from private providers under the fee-basis program for veterans with service-connected disabilities who do not live near a VA facility. Such resources could also be retargeted into expanding the availability of specialized services. Similarly, VA could increase the equity of veterans\u2019 access to VA care by improving the way it allocates resources to facilities and the consistency of its coverage decisions. direct delivery system but has essentially converted its hospitals into long-term care facilities.", "Two approaches could be pursued to increase the workload of VA hospitals and prevent or delay their closure. First, actions could be taken to attract a larger market share of the veteran population to the VA system\u2014only about 20 percent of veterans have ever used VA care. Attracting enough new users to maintain the workload of VA hospitals could, however, add significantly to the government\u2019s cost of operating the VA system unless new sources of revenues are identified. A second approach for maintaining VA hospital workload would be to authorize VA hospitals to treat dependents or other nonveterans on a reimbursable basis. Such an approach might also strengthen VA\u2019s medical education and research missions by bringing a wider range of patients into the VA system. On the down side, it might raise questions about the extent to which the government should compete with private-sector hospitals.", "Converting VA hospitals to provide nursing home and other long-term care services might also help preserve the direct delivery system. With the expected eight-fold increase in the number of veterans 85 years of age and older, demand for VA-supported nursing home care is expected to increase dramatically over the next 15 years. While the cost of converting hospital beds to nursing home care is generally less expensive than building new nursing homes, the cost of operating VA nursing homes is higher than the cost of purchasing nursing home care from private-sector nursing homes. Establishing cost-sharing requirements patterned after those used by states in their veterans\u2019 homes could enable VA to serve more veterans within available resources.", "Several approaches could also be considered that would reduce or eliminate VA\u2019s direct delivery system. These approaches include (1) creating or expanding an existing VA-operated health financing program to purchase care from private providers; (2) issuing vouchers to allow veterans to purchase private health insurance; and (3) including veterans under an existing health benefits program, such as Medicare, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or TRICARE.

In the 1940s, a medical education mission was added to strengthen the quality of care in VA facilities and help train the nation\u2019s health care professionals. In the 1960s, VA\u2019s health care mission was expanded with the addition of a nursing home benefit. And, in the early 1980s, a military back-up mission was added.", "The types of veterans served have also evolved. VA has gradually shifted from primarily providing treatment for service-connected disabilities incurred in wartime to increasingly focusing on the treatment of low-income veterans with medical conditions unrelated to military service. Similarly, the growth of private and public health benefits programs has given veterans additional health care options, placing VA facilities in direct competition with private-sector providers.", "VA is in the midst of a major reorganization of its health care system. It has replaced its four large regions with 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), intended to shift the focus of the health care system from independent medical facilities to groups of facilities working together to provide efficient, accessible care to veterans in their service areas. The reorganization also includes plans to downsize the central office, strengthen accountability, and emphasize customer service. Under the reorganization, VA facilities are being encouraged to contract with private-sector providers when they can provide services of comparable or higher quality at a lower cost.

This increase is expected because almost all veterans become eligible for Medicare when they turn 65 years of age, including those unemployed or employed in jobs that do not provide health insurance at the time they turn 65. Health reforms, such as those that have been debated in the past year, that would increase the portability of insurance and place limits on coverage exclusions for preexisting conditions would also increase the number of veterans with health insurance.", "The nature of insurance coverage is changing. For example, increased enrollment in health maintenance organizations (HMO)\u2014from 9 million in 1982 to 50 million in 1994\u2014is likely to reduce the use of VA hospitals. Veterans with fee-for-service public or private health insurance often face significant out-of-pocket expenses for hospital care and have a financial incentive to use VA hospitals because VA requires little or no cost-sharing. Veterans\u2019 financial incentives to seek hospital care from VA are largely eliminated when they join HMOs or other managed care plans because such plans require little or no cost-sharing. Proposals to expand Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 enrollment in managed care plans could thus further decrease the use of VA hospitals. On the other hand, health reforms that would create medical savings accounts could increase demand for VA hospital care because veterans might seek free care from VA rather than spend money out of their medical savings account to pay for needed services. Finally, increased cost-sharing under fee-for-service programs could encourage veterans to use the VA system.", "The declining veteran population will likely lead to significant reductions in use of VA hospitals even as the acute care needs of the surviving veterans increase.

Currently, VA hospitals too often serve patients whose care could be more efficiently provided in alternative settings, such as outpatient clinics or nursing homes. Estimates of nonacute admissions to and days of care provided by VA hospitals often exceed 40 percent. Preadmission certification would likely reduce these admissions. VA is currently assessing the use of preadmission reviews systemwide as a method to encourage the most cost-effective, therapeutically appropriate care. The Veterans Health Administration is also implementing a performance measurement and monitoring system containing a number of measures that should reduce inappropriate hospital admissions.

With limited resources, one approach would be to shift resources from providing services to one group of veterans to paying for expanded services for a different group of veterans. For example, resources spent in providing care for higher-income veterans without service-connected disabilities could be shifted toward improving services for veterans with service-connected disabilities and lower-income veterans whose health care needs are not being met. About 15 percent of the veterans with no service-connected disabilities who use VA medical centers have incomes that place them in the discretionary care category for both inpatient and outpatient care. Another approach could be to narrow the types of services provided\u2014such as the provision of over-the-counter drugs\u2014and use the resources spent on those services to pay for other higher-priority services. necessary services because they are geographically inaccessible. While this approach would help some veterans, current law severely restricts the use of fee-basis care by veterans with no service-connected disabilities. Such veterans are eligible only for limited diagnostic services and follow-up care after hospitalization. VA\u2019s recent efforts to establish access points will improve accessibility for some veterans, but VA has not applied the outpatient priorities for care or the eligibility requirements for fee-basis care in enrolling patients and providing services. As a result, access points could divert funds that could be used to provide access to VA-supported care for high-priority veterans to pay for services for discretionary-care veterans. The concept of access points appears sound\u2014to increase competition and therefore reduce costs of contract care. To be equitable, however, care provided through access points could be made subject to the same limitations that apply to fee-basis care for other veterans. Increased use of fee-basis care, either through fee-for-service contracting or capitation payments, is not, however, without risks. The capacity of VA\u2019s direct delivery system serves as a control over growth in VA appropriations. Without changes in the methods used to set VA appropriations, removing the restrictions on use of fee-basis care could create significant pressure to increase VA appropriations. In other words, the result might be expanding priorities for care covered under the fee-basis program to match the priorities currently covered at VA facilities rather than reordering priorities within available resources. This expansion of priorities could occur because VA\u2019s budget request does not provide information on the priority categories of veterans receiving care from VA.", "Finally, VA could ensure that its facilities use consistent methods to ration care when demand exceeds capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Countries Integrated Their Veterans\u2019 Hospitals Into Their Health Care Systems or Shifted the Focus of Their Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Faced with aging and declining veteran populations, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom closed or converted their veterans\u2019 hospitals to other uses.

Alternatives to maintaining the current direct delivery system include (1) establishing a VA-operated health financing system to purchase care from other public and private providers (or expanding an existing program); (2) including veterans under an existing health benefits program, such as Medicare, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or TRICARE; and (3) issuing vouchers to enable veterans to purchase private health insurance. Under any of these approaches, many existing VA facilities might be closed, converted to other uses, or transferred to the community."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purchase Care From Public and Private Providers", "paragraphs": ["VA already purchases health care services from public and private-sector providers in many ways. For example, it purchases services from its medical school affiliates and other government facilities through sharing agreements; it purchases care for eligible veterans geographically remote from VA facilities directly from private physicians through the fee-basis program; it contracts with groups of public or private-sector providers on a capitation basis to provide primary care services to veterans; and it operates a health financing program, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), to purchase care for survivors and dependents of certain veterans.", "Expanding or combining these programs into a single health financing program could increase VA\u2019s purchasing power in the health care marketplace, allowing it to purchase health care services at lower prices. For example, expansion of capitation funding could shift risks for controlling veterans\u2019 health care costs from the government to private providers contracting with VA. And increasing the use of private-sector providers within the VA health care system could retain the focus on veterans\u2019 health care needs that might be lost by merging veterans\u2019 health care with another program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Include Veterans Under an Existing Program", "paragraphs": ["On the other hand, additional economies would be likely to be achieved by merging the veterans\u2019 health program with one or more of the existing federal health programs. For example, Medicare has many years of experience in negotiating and monitoring contracts with managed care plans and fee-for-service providers to ensure that the interests of both beneficiaries and the government are protected. Although the Health Care Financing Administration continues to face problems in identifying and eliminating fraud and abuse, it nonetheless has more experience than VA in wide-scale contracting. copayment features provide financial incentives for beneficiaries to select this option, the most highly managed of the three options.", "Under an agreement between VA and DOD, VA facilities can apply to become providers under TRICARE Prime. To date, no VA facilities are participating in TRICARE other than as fee-for-service providers. In many respects, VA\u2019s restructuring efforts parallel DOD\u2019s efforts in establishing TRICARE. Expanding TRICARE to include veterans\u2019 health benefits and VA facilities and physicians might further expand health care accessibility and options for beneficiaries of both programs.", "Finally, veterans could be allowed to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which provides federal employees and annuitants and their dependents a choice of private health insurance programs, including traditional fee-for-service plans, preferred provider plans, and HMOs. Enrollment costs and cost-sharing vary widely, depending on the plan selected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue Vouchers to Buy Private Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Of the various health care options, offering veterans vouchers to use in purchasing health care services would give veterans the maximum choice. Acting individually to purchase care or insurance, veterans would probably be unable to obtain the same prices on health care services and policies that they could obtain through the volume purchasing advantages of the federal health care programs. For example, individual health insurance policies are generally much more expensive than comparable coverage obtained through a group policy such as those available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.", "Any of the options for increasing the use of private-sector providers would address the primary reasons many veterans give for not using VA care: perceptions of poor quality and customer service and limited accessibility. As a result, these options would be likely to generate new demand. Such new demand could be expected to create upward pressure on VA appropriations unless actions were taken under current budget rules to offset new costs. The new options could, however, be structured to supplement, rather than duplicate, veterans\u2019 coverage under other health programs. For example, eligibility for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities might be limited to those without other public or private insurance.

We believe that attention is needed to position VA to ensure that veterans receive high-quality health care in the most cost-efficient manner, regardless of whether that care is provided through VA facilities or through arrangements with private-sector providers.", "The declining veteran population in the United States, in concert with the increased availability of community-based care, makes preserving the current acute care workload of existing VA health care facilities exceedingly difficult.
