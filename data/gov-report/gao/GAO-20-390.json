These aircraft  had maintenance completed in fiscal years 2014 through 2019 at the Air  Force\u2019s three Air Logistics Complexes and the Navy\u2019s three Fleet  Readiness Centers.

We used this  information to calculate the difference between the number of days  planned for maintenance (using the updated estimate if available) and the  number of days used for maintenance to determine whether the services  completed aircraft maintenance on time, early, or late. Additionally, we  used the total number of aircraft completed in each fiscal year to calculate  a measure of average maintenance timeliness by aircraft type. We  presented the data based on aircraft that had maintenance completed in  a given fiscal year; however, not all of the maintenance was necessarily  completed in that given fiscal year. For example, an aircraft may have  had maintenance started in one fiscal year and its maintenance was  completed in the next fiscal year.

At the  annual workload planning meeting, COMFRC and aircraft program leads  provide plans to meet aircraft workload requirements for the current year  and the next 2 fiscal years. The mid-year review provides an update on  the current year\u2019s performance and the final workload plan for the next 2  fiscal years, according to Navy documentation.

For example, depot  maintenance engineers may find extra corrosion on an aircraft, and use  those findings to update maintenance plans for other individual aircraft.", "While these meetings provide opportunities for collaboration and officials  utilize other means to informally communicate, NAVAIR and COMFRC do  not have formal processes and related guidance for communication and  coordination between depot stakeholders to ensure they receive input  from all key subject-matter experts regarding workload planning.

A COMFRC official said that different  stakeholders manage various parts of workload planning and without  guidance on specific documentation needs and process owners, it is  challenging for the Navy to identify accountable stakeholders and  discuss specific planning needs.", "NAVAIR officials said workload planners hold periodic meetings, but  attendance by subject-matter experts is not mandatory. For example,  subject-matter experts from the Fleet Support Teams\u2014officials who  provide engineering and logistics technical support to fleet and  aviation depot maintenance organizations\u2014are not required to attend  workload planning meetings. Experts may potentially attend via video  teleconference, but others, due to time zone differences, may not  participate. As a result, workload planning meetings may not  consistently include workload input from all relevant subject-matter  experts.", "Navy officials said that once the Naval Sustainment System initiative  began focusing on improving depot maintenance on the F/A-18E-F,  deficiencies in the workload planning process became more apparent.  They noted the challenges of coordinating key stakeholders along the  maintenance planning timeline and its impact on planning and  budgeting. In particular, Navy officials stated the current depot  maintenance planning-time horizon was disconnected from long- range planning, such as the Program Objective Memorandum  process. For example, due to a misalignment in the planning and  budgeting processes, COMFRC reacts to the outcome of the Program  Memorandum Objective process rather than influencing it, which  results in many adjustments to their productions plans, such as  improper staffing, material management, and facility-usage plans.", "NAVAIR Instruction 5221.1B, Workload Acceptance states that  commanders will establish internal competency guidelines for  communication and coordination of workload-related issues. In addition,  the Navy 2014-2019 Depot Maintenance Strategic Plan, states the Navy  will forge a strong liaison between maintenance activities and the  acquisition community to ensure that maintenance requirements and  planning are in sync. As a result of the Naval Sustainment System  initiative, Navy officials said that COMFRC is developing a new workload  planning process to become more proactive in depot maintenance  planning and increase information exchanges. This includes ensuring that  the new process involves all key depot maintenance stakeholders, such  as COMFRC officials, program managers, and fleet officials. For  example, NAVAIR officials said that most of the Fleet Support Team  scheduled maintenance leads will be the primary point of contact to assist  COMFRC with developing the future maintenance requirements planning  and will be invited and asked to attend workload planning meetings. If  they are unable to attend, they will then ask to have a program office  representative attend in their place.", "However, Navy officials acknowledged that their efforts are still in the  developmental stages and that the Navy needs formal processes and  related guidance for communication and coordination between depot  stakeholders to inform maintenance requirements planning.
