The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designed the Task Force for Emergency Readiness (TFER) pilot program to advance and integrate state and federal catastrophic planning efforts. TFER, first envisioned by the Department of Defense (DOD), ran from September 2008 to September 2010, and FEMA provided the five participating states--Hawaii, Massachusetts, South Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia--with $350,000 each to develop plans, build relationships with stakeholders, and document lessons learned (i.e., TFER's stated objectives). As requested, GAO evaluated the extent to which (1) FEMA followed sound management practices in designing, administering, and evaluating TFER and (2) the five participating states satisfied TFER's stated objectives. GAO analyzed FEMA guidance, such as the TFER Pilot Information Package, conducted site visits to all five participant states, and met with relevant FEMA and DOD officials, to evaluate FEMA's management of TFER and the states' implementation of it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FEMA developed program objectives and procedures for administering the TFER pilot, but did not develop other elements of sound management practices in designing, administering, and evaluating pilot programs that GAO identified from its prior work and social science literature. FEMA developed objectives for the pilot, but did not document standards for determining the pilot's success. FEMA also provided resources such as funding, training, and support, but FEMA did not always follow the procedures it established for TFER. For example, FEMA did not consistently conduct biweekly conference calls with the states, and four states reported that it would have been helpful if FEMA provided more guidance. FEMA did not develop a data analysis plan, which could have better ensured FEMA collected data on the extent to which the pilot states coordinated with key stakeholders and provided reasonable assurance that FEMA conducted a systematic assessment of TFER using comparable data across the five pilot states. In Spring 2010, FEMA announced TFER would not continue past the pilot stage before evaluating TFER on its merits in strengthening and advancing state catastrophic planning, but FEMA allowed the states to draw down the remaining TFER funds and continue to complete initiatives started under TFER through August 2011. GAO previously reported in April 2009 that FEMA faced challenges in assessing pilot program data, and FEMA officials reported the agency does not have pilot program policy guidance. In the absence of this, FEMA lacks a systematic approach to developing, administering, and evaluating pilot programs. FEMA could better ensure other pilot programs meet their intended goals by developing policies and guidance that include sound management practices. All five states have taken steps to follow FEMA's guidance to address TFER's objectives, but no state has fully addressed them all. First, two of the five states have completed draft catastrophic plans, and all five states reported following FEMA's planning process. Second, all five states built relationships with stakeholders such as state agencies and FEMA, but state officials said coordination with DOD--a key federal stakeholder who may be called upon to assist in disaster response--was limited. State officials reported not coordinating with DOD because they did not have draft plans for DOD officials to review. Third, all states have documented lessons learned to date, but four states have not exercised TFER plans to determine their effectiveness in the event of an emergency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA develop policies and guidance that follow sound management practices for future pilot programs, and share TFER results with stakeholders.

The  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 appropriated  approximately $7.1 billion to FEMA, and FEMA has allocated more than  $1.8 billion to preparedness grant programs.", "The Task Force for Emergency Readiness (TFER) pilot program was  launched by FEMA in September 2008 to strengthen state preparedness for  catastrophic disasters by facilitating greater capacity in and more  comprehensive integration of planning efforts across all levels of  government through $1.75 million in grant funds. In particular, TFER  emphasized integration of planning efforts across sectors, jurisdictions,  and functional disciplines, as well as integration among state, regional, and  federal agencies, primarily FEMA and DOD. The TFER grant funds  allowed states to hire three full-time planners with civilian and military  planning expertise to develop catastrophic plans. FEMA selected five  states to participate in this pilot program: Hawaii, Massachusetts, South  Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia.", "Planning is a key component of national preparedness. According to  FEMA planning guidance, planning provides a methodology to examine  the entire life cycle of a potential crisis, determine required capabilities,  and help stakeholders learn and practice their roles for building and  sustaining national preparedness capabilities against terrorist attacks and  other hazards. This is particularly important in a catastrophic incident,  defined as any natural disaster, act of terrorism, or man-made disaster that  results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage or disruption  severely affecting the population, infrastructure, environment, economy,  national morale, or government functions in an area. Catastrophic events  differ from a normal disaster in the severity of the damage, number of  persons affected, and the scale of preparation and response required. They  quickly overwhelm or incapacitate local and/or state response capabilities,  thus requiring coordinated assistance from outside the affected area.", "You asked us to review the TFER pilot program. Our objectives for this  report were to identify the extent to which (1) FEMA followed sound  management practices in developing, administering, and evaluating the  TFER pilot program and (2) the five participating states satisfied the TFER  pilot program\u2019s stated objectives.", "To conduct this work, we completed site visits to all five participant states  from June through September 2010 and interviewed relevant FEMA, DOD,  and DHS headquarters and regional officials. During our site visits, we met  with the planners hired through the TFER pilot program and other state,  local, and DOD and FEMA regional officials to discuss FEMA\u2019s  management of the TFER pilot program and the states\u2019 implementation of  it.", "To identify the extent to which FEMA followed sound management  practices in developing, administering, and evaluating TFER, we analyzed  program guidance and other key documents including the TFER Pilot  Information Package and the TFER Guidance and Application Kit. We also  analyzed our prior work on pilot programs and program management as  well as social science literature to determine elements of sound  management practices. We grouped these elements into three categories:  design, administration, and evaluation. We analyzed the program guidance,  other documents, and information obtained from our interviews and site  visits and compared the results of our work with the identified elements of  sound management practices.

The three program  objectives included developing plans, building relationships, and  documenting lessons learned, and FEMA provided criteria to measure  progress towards addressing each of these objectives. We used FEMA\u2019s  criteria to then assess states\u2019 progress toward addressing the three  program objectives. Additionally, FEMA identified key components of  each objective. To assess the states\u2019 progress towards addressing TFER\u2019s  program objectives, we assigned a numerical ranking to each objective\u2019s  components and then averaged the components\u2019 numerical rankings for  each of the objectives. We then assigned designations to these averages.  We determined that states could not receive a designation of \u201csubstantial  progress\u201d for their objectives without meeting the criteria related to these  key components. To assist in assessing states\u2019 progress, we reviewed and  analyzed the documents obtained during our site visits that included draft  plans, progress reports, and status briefings, and interviewed cognizant  officials. As part of this analysis, we reviewed the guidance in FEMA\u2019s  Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101, which provides  instructions regarding plan structure, and we used this information to  determine the extent to which the states\u2019 plans adhered to FEMA\u2019s  guidance.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to April 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For larger-scale incidents that  overwhelm the capabilities of local governments, assistance from the state  may be sought. Depending on the circumstances, states have capabilities,  such as the National Guard, that can help communities respond and  recover. If additional resources beyond what an individual state can  provide are required, the state may request assistance from other states  through Emergency Management Assistance Compacts or from the federal  government. Catastrophic incidents, by definition, result in extraordinary  levels of damage or disruption to government functions, and governors  have the option to seek federal assistance. The federal government has a  wide array of capabilities and resources to assist state and local agencies  respond to incidents. In accordance with the National Response  Framework and applicable laws including the Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), various federal  departments and agencies may play primary, coordinating, or supporting  roles, based on their authorities and resources and the nature of the  incident. In certain instances, national military capabilities may be  requested to respond to an incident. Defense resources are committed  following approval by the Secretary of Defense or at the direction of the  President.", "According to FEMA planning guidance, plans must be integrated  vertically among levels of government (e.g., local, state, and federal) to  ensure a common operational focus and horizontally (e.g., health  departments and law enforcement) to ensure that individual department  and agency operations plans complement the jurisdiction\u2019s plans. This  integration enables stakeholders to synchronize the sequence and scope of  a planned response in terms of roles and responsibilities, place, and time  to a catastrophic incident.

Additionally, NORTHCOM and PACOM coordinate with numerous federal  agencies that also have roles in planning for and responding to a variety of  incidents in the homeland. As part of the lessons learned from Hurricane  Katrina, both NORTHCOM and PACOM have established Defense  Coordinating Officers with staff to serve as DOD representatives to civilian  authorities in the 10 FEMA regions. Defense Coordinating Officers are  full-time senior-level military officers who provide liaison support and  requirements validation, and they serve as single points of contact for  state, tribal, local, and other federal authorities that need DOD support. In  that way they are able to develop relationships with civilian authorities  and gain an understanding of civilian capabilities so that DOD will know  what, if anything, it may be called upon to provide in the event of a  disaster or other incident. Additional defense resources include  Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers who are senior Reserve officers  that are expected to assist the Defense Coordinating Officers in  coordinating the provision of military personnel, equipment, and supplies  to support the emergency relief and cleanup efforts of civilian  authorities. When NORTHCOM and PACOM are called upon to support  civilian authorities, in most cases support will be localized, limited, and  specific.

Although FEMA administered  TFER, pilot program guidance stated that the TFER program was to place  a special emphasis on coordination and integration between the pilot  states, FEMA, and DOD. Further, a key measure of achievement in the  pilot program is the degree to which DOD stakeholders are integrated as  full partners in the development of states\u2019 plans.", "FEMA designed TFER to help assess, strengthen, and advance state  catastrophic preparedness planning across state and local agencies and  the private sector, as well as achieve a fuller integration of state planning  efforts with federal agency partners through a deliberate blending of civil- military planning expertise. The TFER pilot program centered on the  creation and employment of a dedicated planning team.

It selected applicants to achieve a representative cross-section of  geographic differences, FEMA regions, threat of catastrophic events, state  emergency management structures, and participation in a separate FEMA  catastrophic planning grant. As discussed in appendix II, FEMA provides  funds to states and localities for catastrophic planning through other grant  programs.

FEMA\u2019s 2006 Nationwide Plan Review  highlighted the need for fundamental planning modernization and  observed, among other things, that: catastrophic planning efforts were  unsystematic and uneven; planning expertise was insufficient for  catastrophic incidents; and collaboration requirements were not well- defined, fostering a tendency to plan internally. In addition, according to  FEMA, the 2006 Nationwide Plan Review revealed that 95 percent of state  and urban area participants cited the need for federally funded planning  support and technical assistance. FEMA also reported that in 2007, states  and urban areas ranked planning among their highest grant funding  priorities.

For example, FEMA provided $1.75  million in funds to the state administrative agencies identified in the TFER  Pilot Information Package and established a virtual communication tool  for the TFER pilot states to communicate and share lessons learned.  However, FEMA provided training for the initial cohort of TFER planners  in April 2009, which FEMA officials told us consisted of two-thirds of the  planners originally hired by the states. All five states found FEMA\u2019s  training useful. However, officials in two states told us additional training  would have been useful. For example, one TFER planner who was not  hired at the time of the training stated that additional training could have  provided planners more opportunities to network and gain knowledge  about state and federal resources. Further, FEMA conducted a meeting  with the pilot states to accomplish tasks such as establishing support  requirements and planning deliverables, but FEMA approved three state  project management plans that did not contain all the recommended  information, such as specific tasks, milestones, and deliverables. The  TFER program manager stated that part of the intent of TFER was to  design it in real time, working with the jurisdictions, and that the  omissions of the recommended information did not negatively impact the  states\u2019 implementation of TFER. However, the states whose project  management plans did not include specific deliverables have not  completed draft plans.", "Further, FEMA also established processes and procedures for reporting  and monitoring, but did not fully follow them. Specifically, FEMA stated in  the TFER Pilot Information Package that the project manager would  conduct biweekly conference calls with the states, but state officials in all  five pilot states noted that FEMA headquarters involvement was  inconsistent. According to the program manager, the purpose of these  meetings was to ensure the pilot was functioning smoothly, so FEMA  conducted biweekly meetings as TFER became operational but the  meetings were discontinued once the pilots were underway. However,  officials in four states reported that it would have been helpful if FEMA  had provided more guidance on plan development. Further, TFER  planners in one state reported that the lack of guidance made it more  difficult to write plans. Another planner stated that FEMA did not provide  the expected level of meetings and technical assistance.

As a result, the program manager could not monitor progress  in meeting milestones and completing deliverables. FEMA also conducted  a 6-month evaluation of the pilot program, but four pilot states reported  that FEMA did not provide feedback on the evaluation.

Sound management practices say that  the source of data should be specified in the data collection plan, and  according to program evaluation guidance, the reliability of evaluations  can vary depending on who responds. During interviews with officials  from participating states and FEMA regional offices, we found  inconsistencies in who completed the evaluation questions. For example,  two pilot states developed their own responses and three FEMA regions  developed the responses for their respective pilot states, even though one  of the questions explicitly asked for the opinion of state stakeholders.  Further, two of the three states were not cognizant of the fact that their  FEMA regional offices had completed the evaluation questions; therefore,  these states\u2019 views may not have been accurately captured in the  evaluation responses. Moreover, officials in one FEMA regional office  questioned whether they were the appropriate FEMA personnel to  administer the evaluation questions, since FEMA headquarters had  collected all prior information from the states.

Specifically, FEMA changed some  of the data collection questions it provided the states in the TFER Pilot  Information Package when it released updated questions in the TFER  Evaluation Criteria document. For example, FEMA used the same three  objectives in both its original and updated documents, and its objectives  on developing plans and documenting lessons learned objectives were  consistent across documents, but FEMA did not collect information to  assess all of the relationships it identified as important for its objective on  building relationships in the TFER Pilot Information Package. For  instance, FEMA did not evaluate coordination with FEMA, Defense  Coordinating Officers, or Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers\u2014all  relationships principal to implementing TFER, according to the TFER  Pilot Information Package document. FEMA included a question that  asked the pilot states which federal agencies they coordinated with, but  did not include any question that would allow it to evaluate the extent to  which coordination occurred with these stakeholders. As a result, the  evaluation responses we reviewed listed the stakeholders they  coordinated with but did not discuss the extent of coordination between  state officials and stakeholders. FEMA officials said that because the  Defense Coordinating Officer and Emergency Preparedness Liaison  Officer positions were not the only relationships explored between states  and federal agencies, the evaluation criteria was changed to make it more  general to determine with which agencies the TFER states engaged.  However, by changing the evaluation question to a general and descriptive  question on federal relationships, it will be difficult for FEMA to determine  if the states achieved a fuller integration of planning efforts with federal  agency partners\u2014one of the goals of TFER.", "FEMA did not develop a data analysis plan to describe how it would track  TFER\u2019s performance and evaluate its effectiveness based on criteria to  determine program performance.

FEMA did not finalize a data-analysis methodology  describing how FEMA would use information collected from the states to  evaluate TFER until after it collected responses to FEMA\u2019s evaluation  criteria questions. The TFER program manager stated that FEMA plans to  look for trends in the states\u2019 responses to the evaluation questions to  discern common threads and outliers. According to the program manager,  FEMA did not develop a plan that outlined the overall approach it would  use to analyze the TFER data during design of the pilot program because  the pilot was not intended to produce quantitative results. He further  stated that FEMA wanted to see what worked and what did not work as  the pilot evolved. However, a data analysis plan could have helped guide  the analysis of the qualitative data FEMA collected from the pilot states  and FEMA regional offices.

The  information on the TFER pilot program\u2019s evaluation stated that the results  of the evaluation would determine the prospect for the program\u2019s  continuation and level of future funding. However, prior to conducting its  evaluation of the pilot, FEMA announced in March 2010 that TFER would  not be continued as a stand-alone grant program. According to FEMA  officials, the decision to discontinue TFER as a stand-alone grant program  was made because DOD may begin a similar initiative and states could  allocate other FEMA grant funding for catastrophic planning purposes.  Specifically, the TFER program manager noted that the National Guard  Homeland Response Force, which is a DOD concept that would place  National Guard personnel in each FEMA region, could continue the  planning efforts associated with TFER. DOD officials stated that these  personnel would be located regionally and not in individual states;  therefore, the National Guard Homeland Response Force initiative could  supplement but not replace a TFER-like initiative. Also, according to DOD,  the National Guard Homeland Response Force would have as its mission  response to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-explosive  incidents and would not have a broad purview like TFER.

The status of the states\u2019 TFER plans varies; Washington  and South Carolina have completed some but not all of their plans, while  Hawaii and West Virginia have not completed any draft plans. Hawaii and  West Virginia officials identified reasons for not having completed draft  plans, including delays in hiring qualified planners. One of FEMA\u2019s  requirements for TFER was that planners have experience in conducting  civil-military support planning and operations with the National Guard  and/or military experience. In Massachusetts, South Carolina, and  Washington, all planners initially hired for TFER had military  backgrounds. These states hired planners as early as February 2009\u20145  months after the pilot program began. One of the planners initially hired  had prior military and civilian experience, and the other had a logistics  background. Hawaii hired its first TFER planner in April 2009 but did not  hire a second planner until August 2009\u201411 months after the pilot began.  Hawaii officials told us that they found it difficult to hire qualified  individuals with a military background because better paying options exist  in the state for qualified individuals. One of Hawaii\u2019s two current planners  does not have military experience, but state officials told us that the  individual is qualified because of his information technology background,  which was needed to support logistics planning. Additionally, he worked  for the state planning agency. West Virginia officials reported that they  hired their planners in the July/August 2009 time frame\u201410 to 11 months  after the pilot began. Two applicants originally applied for the position,  one of which West Virginia hired. This individual did not have a military  background, but officials stated he was qualified based on his decades of  experience as a first responder. West Virginia subsequently hired a  National Guardsman. The West Virginia TFER supervisor stated that  inadequate planning capacity at the local level also delayed TFER efforts  because West Virginia TFER focused on building capacity at the local  level. FEMA granted all five states a 6-month extension based on delays  the states experienced. As previously discussed, planning continues in  four states, as they are still spending TFER funds, as of March 2011 (see  fig. 5).", "Massachusetts TFER planners facilitated planning between different levels  of government, but other state planners are developing the plans.  Massachusetts initially focused on contributing to Boston\u2019s improvised  explosive device planning efforts, but differences in time lines, combined  with TFER\u2019s brief performance period, caused the team to change its focus  to facilitating collaborative emergency planning among federal, state,  local, and private stakeholders. For example, the Massachusetts TFER  planners facilitated collaborative planning among the Massachusetts  Department of Public Health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, and FEMA  to create a statewide medical support plan. TFER planners developed  interagency relationships and helped the planning team select goals and  objectives but did not draft the plan, which state officials said other state  planners are developing. State officials decided the TFER planners would  not actually write the plans because of the pilot program\u2019s short time  frame.", "Filling gaps in state planning. State officials reported that TFER  initiatives fill gaps in existing state plans. For example, South Carolina,  Washington, and West Virginia chose to work on a catastrophic incident  plan as part of their TFER efforts, and this plan is an annex to the states\u2019  basic emergency operations plan. Further, officials in four of five states  reported that TFER initiatives focused on gaps not addressed by other  planning initiatives. For example, the FEMA Region X TFER contact  stated that Washington successfully integrated TFER with the Regional  Catastrophic Grant Planning Program. Two of three West Virginia TFER  scenarios pertain in part to scenarios addressed by other planning efforts,  but officials stated that TFER planners work collaboratively with the  planners involved in these other efforts, as described in appendix IV.  Additionally, Hawaii officials anticipate the Regional Catastrophic  Planning Grant Program will address hurricanes in 2011\u2014before the state  exhausts its TFER funds. State officials expect these efforts to be  complementary.", "FEMA\u2019s planning process. All five states reported that they are following  FEMA\u2019s planning process, and states that developed draft plans utilized  the structure recommended in FEMA\u2019s CPG 101 (see fig. 6). All of the  states reported they are following FEMA\u2019s six-step planning process, but  they are in different stages of that process, as of March 2011.", "Washington has exercised three out of seven of its plans\u2014part of step six.  However, most of Washington\u2019s plans remain in draft form, which is  associated with step five.

Massachusetts state officials decided that their pilot program would  coordinate planning efforts, but that other state planners would develop  plans; officials stated they did not move beyond step four in the planning  process.", "Officials in the four states that committed to developing plans reported  that they are structuring plans as recommended by CPG 101, but some  sections are not included in the states\u2019 draft plans. CPG 101 provides a  recommended structure for annexes to a state\u2019s basic emergency  operations plan.  These annexes comprise half of the 32 TFER initiatives  spanning all five pilot states. Ten of 13 annexes we reviewed were missing  at least one recommended section. For example, none of the three  catastrophic incident plans we reviewed contain a section on direction,  control, and coordination. South Carolina and Washington officials noted  that their plans did not include all of the recommended sections because  other state plans like the basic emergency operations plan contained these  sections. Washington officials further stated that TFER-supported  planning is part of the state emergency operations plan and is not designed  to stand alone. Further, Hawaii officials told us that they are following the  FEMA guidance, but its plans are incomplete and work is ongoing. West  Virginia officials stated that it is following the structure recommended in  CPG 101, but since some of the sections rely on information gathered at  the county level, it will take about 5 years before the state has enough  information to include each recommended section in its catastrophic  incident plan.

As shown in figure 8 and further explained in appendix IV,  the TFER pilot states have provided a number of lessons learned and  recommendations on how to improve a similar program in the future.  One state, Washington, has made substantial progress documenting  lessons learned because it has exercised three of its plans to evaluate their  effectiveness, one of the components FEMA cited in the objective. FEMA  articulated the criteria for this objective in the TFER Pilot Information  Package and the TFER Evaluation Criteria document, which focused on  documenting lessons learned, including exercising plans to evaluate  TFER\u2019s effectiveness. All five pilot states documented lessons learned for  a report published by the National Guard Bureau in August 2010, and we  obtained additional lessons learned during our interviews with state  officials. Further, two of the states provided us with the lessons learned  they submitted to FEMA for its evaluation, which is not yet complete.", "Some of the lessons learned were similar across the pilot states. For  example, all five states considered the pilot a success; Hawaii,  Massachusetts, South Carolina, and West Virginia officials reported that  TFER allowed their states to conduct catastrophic planning that otherwise  would not have occurred, and Washington reported that TFER advanced  its catastrophic and emergency logistics planning by at least 2 years.  Washington officials further stated that the $350,000 the state received in  TFER funding generated more return on investment than any other  $350,000 in the state\u2019s emergency planning budget. Based on their view of  TFER\u2019s success, officials in each of the five pilot states recommended  FEMA expand TFER to other states.", "All states reported three principal reasons for considering TFER a success:  (1) autonomy to develop their own work plans, (2) provision of dedicated  funds to hire planners, and (3) the background of the TFER planners.  (1) State officials reported that they worked collaboratively with  FEMA to select catastrophic scenarios. For example, South  Carolina chose to work on plans related to terrorism attacks  because state officials believe they had adequately planned for  hurricanes and earthquakes\u2014the two National Planning Scenarios  ranked higher than terrorism attacks in the state\u2019s risk assessment.  Officials in all five states highlighted the benefit of this flexibility.  (2) Officials in all five states reported that the narrow focus of  TFER, dedicated solely to enhance catastrophic planning, was key  to the pilot program\u2019s success. State officials told us that state  planners are often required to assist emergency planning and  response efforts during more routine disasters, such as seasonal  floods and forest fires, but since the terms of TFER did not allow  states to use TFER funds for these efforts, catastrophic planning  continued unabated.  (3) Officials in all five states reported that the planners\u2019 military  background was beneficial. For example, state officials in  Massachusetts told us the planners\u2019 military experience provided  them with a level of experience and training not often found in  other sectors and gave them credibility. However, officials in three  states told us that civilian planning or emergency management  experience also provided TFER planners the needed skill set.", "States also reported challenges they faced, including (1) short time frames  that limited their ability to complete the planning process, and (2) not  enough guidance for the specialized plans they were developing.  (1) All five states reported that the short time frames limited their  ability to complete the planning process. FEMA structured TFER  as an 18-month program, and states noted that this was an  insufficient amount of time to complete the full cycle of planning.  Officials in one state thought that an adequate time frame would  have been 3 years, noting that this is the time frame FEMA  established for the Regional Catastrophic Planning Grant  Program. The TFER program manager stated that FEMA\u2019s 6- month program extension\u2014bringing the pilot program time frame  to 2 years\u2014provided a sufficient amount of time to complete the  TFER initiatives.  (2) CPG 101 provides general format and content guidance  applicable to all plans, but officials in four of the pilot states said  that it would have been helpful for FEMA to provide guidance for  specialized plans such as catastrophic incident annexes, terrorism  plans, and logistics plans. For example, one TFER planner stated  that clearer guidance could have accelerated the planning  process. Further, officials in a fourth state said that they are using  an unpublished FEMA guide to support their planning efforts.  FEMA officials told us that states can request technical assistance  and examples of well-developed plans to aid in their own plan  development. According to the TFER program manager, FEMA is  in the process of developing additional Comprehensive  Preparedness Guides that will inform plan content for future state  planning efforts.", "The process of documenting lessons learned is ongoing because Hawaii,  South Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia are still developing TFER  plans and spending TFER funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Hurricane Katrina highlighted gaps in the nation\u2019s preparedness to  respond effectively to catastrophic incidents. By their nature, catastrophic  events involve extraordinary levels of casualties, damage, or disruption  that will likely immediately overwhelm state and local responders\u2014 circumstances that make sound planning for catastrophic events all the  more crucial. Planning is a key component of national preparedness.  Planning provides a methodology to determine required capabilities and  helps stakeholders learn and practice their roles for building and  sustaining national preparedness capabilities against terrorist attacks and  other hazards. As state and local governments continue to develop and  improve plans for catastrophic events and identify potential resource  shortfalls, the federal government will be in a better position to  understand the nature of the gaps it may be called upon to fill if state and  local resources are overwhelmed. The TFER pilot program was one such  effort to enhance catastrophic preparedness and provide federal  stakeholders with valuable information regarding local, state, or regional  response capability. However, by not consistently following sound  management practices to design, administer, and evaluate the TFER pilot  program and by not following its processes and procedures for  administering the pilot, it is unclear whether TFER achieved its intended  purpose.

Other grants, such as the Port Security Grant Program (PSGP)  were considered, but discussions with officials in the Grant Programs  Directorate helped to clarify and narrow the scope of our review to the  most appropriate candidates for the types of catastrophic planning  described in the TFER grant. We collected fiscal year 2010 funding levels  for these grants, as well as information about how funds could be used for  planning, funding restrictions, and eligibility requirements.", "To identify the extent to which the five states participating in FEMA\u2019s  TFER pilot program addressed the pilot program\u2019s stated objectives, we  analyzed information that FEMA provided in the Pilot Information  Package and further defined in its TFER Evaluation Criteria document.  The pilot program\u2019s three stated objectives were building relationships,  developing plans, and documenting lessons learned, and FEMA provided  several criteria to measure progress towards addressing each of these  objectives. Additionally, FEMA identified key components to each  objective. We used FEMA\u2019s criteria to assess states\u2019 progress toward  addressing the three program objectives. Moreover, we identified  additional criteria for the building relationships objective in FEMA\u2019s TFER  Pilot Information Package, including whether pilot states coordinated with  other states and with FEMA. These components were identified as key  components in the TFER Pilot Information Package, but were not  identified in the TFER Evaluation Criteria. Therefore, we included the  additional criteria in assessing the states\u2019 progress toward addressing the  building relationships objective. We assigned a numerical ranking to  represent states\u2019 progress for each objective\u2019s components based on  interviews we conducted and our review and analysis of documents we  obtained during our site visits that included draft plans, progress reports,  and status briefings. We gathered information related to the lessoned  learned objective from state submissions to a report published by the  National Guard Bureau in August 2010, and we obtained additional lessons  learned during our interviews with state officials. Further, two of the  states provided us with the lessons learned they submitted to FEMA for its  evaluation, which is not yet complete. If the state met the criterion for a  particular component, we assigned it a ranking of \u20185\u2019, if the state partially  met the criterion, we assigned it a ranking of \u20183\u2019, and if the state did not  meet the criterion, we assigned it a ranking of \u20180\u2019. Next, we averaged the  components for each of the three objectives to obtain an overall objective  score. We then assigned designations to the overall percentages of scores  as follows: averages greater than 80 percent were designated as  \u2018substantial progress\u2019; averages from 20 percent to 80 percent were  designated as \u2018some progress\u2019; and averages less than 20 percent were  designated as \u2018little or no progress.\u2019 We did not assign designations to four  criteria pertaining to developing plans and six criteria pertaining to  lessons learned because we determined that these criteria do not inform  the extent to which states met the objective and/or there was not enough  information to quantify the results.", "States did not receive a designation of \u201csubstantial progress\u201d for each  objective unless they met the criteria related to the key component of that  objective, that is, (1) developing actual plans\u2014measured by the  completion of draft plans; and (2) building relationships with FEMA  officials, Defense Coordinating Officers, and Emergency Preparedness  Liaison Officers. FEMA did not identify key components of the third  objective, documenting lessons learned. In instances where states received  an average above 80 percent but did not meet the criteria related to these  key components, we assigned a designation of \u201csome progress\u201d for that  particular objective. For example, by adding the rankings assigned to  South Carolina for building relationships, the state received a score of 31  out of 35, or 89 percent. However, South Carolina did not fully meet the  criteria for coordinating with DOD and FEMA; so the state received the  designation of \u2018some progress.\u2019  Where possible, we used the Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG)  101 to determine the extent to which the states\u2019 plans adhered to FEMA\u2019s  suggested guidelines regarding plan structure and content. About one half  of the TFER states\u2019 32 planning initiatives involved developing plans.  Specifically, CPG 101 recommends that basic emergency operations plans  and their annexes include the following sections: purpose, situation  overview, and planning assumptions; concept of operations; organization  and assignment of responsibilities; direction, control, and coordination;  information collection and dissemination; administration, finance, and  logistics; and authorities and references. CPG 101 provides additional  guidance for the structure of the concept of operations section for hazard- specific annexes\u2014plans South Carolina developed\u2014and functional  annexes\u2014one of which Washington developed. We did not evaluate the  content of these plans because the plans remain in draft form. CPG 101  does not offer specific content guidance for the other plans types of plans  TFER states developed. We did not assign a progress designation for the  criterion that asked the extent to which states\u2019 plans adhered to CPG 101  because all but 3 of the plans TFER states are developing remain in draft  form.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed officials and obtained  information and related documents from federal agencies, the five pilot  states, and other relevant entities.

For example, in fiscal year 2010 two of the TFER pilot states  received more than $6 million from the Emergency Management  Performance Grant program compared to the $350,000 they each received  for TFER over a 24-month period. According to FEMA officials, the TFER  grant represents at most 3 percent of the grant money spent on planning  by the pilot states, as of March 2010, and all TFER activities are allowable  under other grant programs.", "TFER has unique attributes from other FEMA grants. The primary  difference between TFER and these other grant programs is that the TFER  pilot states are required to use the grant funds exclusively for planning  efforts. In contrast, states may use the other FEMA grant program funds  for a full range of activities such as planning, equipment, training, and  construction and renovation. Like TFER, the Emergency Management  Performance Grants Program provides funding to states with no  requirement to pass through funding to local governments. The Regional  Catastrophic Planning Grant Program provides funds directly to urban  areas, but beginning in fiscal year 2010, states were allowed to withhold up  to 20 percent of the funds to implement or integrate the urban areas\u2019  approved project plans throughout the state, or with neighboring states.  According to the TFER program manger, FEMA provided the TFER pilot  states with the option of continuing their efforts using Regional  Catastrophic Planning Grant Program funds; however the four states that  received funds under both programs chose not to pursue this option.  Similarly, the State Homeland Security Program requires states to pass  through at least 80 percent of the funding to local governments. Further,  the Urban Area Security Initiative provides the funding to urban areas, and  any funds retained by the state must be used to directly support the urban  area. Consequently, states cannot use most Regional Catastrophic  Planning Grant, Urban Areas Security Initiative, and State Homeland  Security Program funds to conduct statewide catastrophic planning.

Under the TFER pilot, FEMA was to grant $350,000 to each of  five participating states\u2014Hawaii, Massachusetts, South Carolina,  Washington, and West Virginia. FEMA designed TFER to run 18 months,  beginning on September 1, 2008, and ending on March 31, 2010, but  extended the pilot program by an additional 6 months to allow the states  more time to accomplish their goals. The TFER pilot was to emphasize  horizontal integration of planning efforts across sectors, jurisdictions, and  functional disciplines, as well as vertical integration among state, regional,  and federal agencies. For example, regarding vertical integration, states  were to integrate planning efforts with the Department of Defense (DOD)  through its Defense Coordinating Officers and Emergency Preparedness  Liaison Officers. To help develop plans to respond to catastrophic  disasters, states could hire up to three full-time planners ideally with  civilian and military planning expertise. FEMA\u2019s stated objectives for the  TFER pilot were to build relationships, develop plans, and document  lessons learned, and states were to focus their planning on the National  Planning Scenarios, which represent examples of the gravest dangers  facing the United States, including terrorist attacks and natural disasters,  and have been accorded the highest priority for federal planning efforts.  FEMA articulated these objectives in the TFER Pilot Information Package  and the TFER Evaluation Criteria document that was ultimately to be used  to evaluate the TFER pilot. Both of these documents refer to FEMA\u2019s  Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 as a source states were to  use to guide their planning process.", "In our assessment of the extent to which each state had addressed FEMA\u2019s  stated objectives for the TFER pilot, we reviewed those documents, used  the criteria in them that we determined were measurable and appropriate  to assess the states\u2019 progress towards meeting each objective, assigned a  numerical ranking to each objective\u2019s criteria, and then averaged the  rankings for each objective\u2019s criteria. Finally, we assigned designations to  these averages. When a state addressed more than 80 percent of the  criteria for an objective this was designated \u201csubstantial progress\u201d; from  20 percent to 80 percent, \u201csome progress\u201d; and below 20 percent, \u201clittle or  no progress.\u201d We gathered information related to the lessoned learned  objective from state submissions to a report published by the National  Guard Bureau in August 2010, and we obtained additional lessons learned  during our interviews with state officials. Further, two of the states  provided us with the lessons learned they submitted to FEMA for its  evaluation, which is not yet complete. We did not assign designations to  four criteria pertaining to developing plans and six criteria pertaining to  lessons learned because we determined that these criteria do not inform  the extent to which states met the objective and/or there was not enough  information to quantify the results. Four of the five pilot states are still  spending TFER funds, and the states\u2019 status in meeting TFER\u2019s stated  objectives may change as catastrophic planning continues.
