However, since 1993, substantial portions of North Dakota\u2019s barley crop have been damaged by a fungal disease\u2014known as scab\u2014that frequently produces a toxin called vomitoxin. The scab and vomitoxin epidemic has reduced the amount of barley produced and sold in North Dakota and the prices paid for barley. Specifically, scab causes barley kernels to become discolored and shriveled, reduces crop yield, depresses grain weight, and ultimately forces farmers to sell fewer bushels of barley at reduced prices. Furthermore, barley (in the form of barley malt) is a key ingredient in beer, and vomitoxin in barley can cause beer to produce too much foam, either during the fermentation process, thereby reducing the amount of beer produced, or when beer cans or bottles are opened, thus creating a less desirable product. In response, the malting and brewing industries will pay only a discounted price for barley that tests positive for vomitoxin; conversely, the industries offer top, or premium, prices for barley that is vomitoxin-free. Barley that is not of malting quality is sold primarily for animal feed and commands a much lower price. Discounted prices for vomitoxin-contaminated barley cover a narrow range of concentrations, beginning at 0.6 parts per million (ppm)\u2014the approximate level at which field tests can begin quantifying the amount of vomitoxin\u2014to about 3 ppm. Beyond 3 ppm, barley is usually sold as animal feed.", "Concerned about the effect of these losses on North Dakota barley farmers, you asked us to (1) determine the financial impact from scab and vomitoxin on these farmers, (2) assess the performance of vomitoxin test methods, and (3) identify short- and long-term actions that could help reduce the impact of scab and vomitoxin on North Dakota barley farmers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Vomitoxin, a toxin associated with a fungal disease called scab, only occurs when scab is present. Since 1993, scab and vomitoxin have affected wheat and barley crops in the Northern Great Plains, which includes North Dakota; Minnesota; South Dakota; and Manitoba, Canada. Crops in the Red River Valley region (the eastern part of North Dakota, the western part of Minnesota, and a corner of northeast South Dakota) have been the most severely affected. The mold that produces vomitoxin grows primarily on grains, particularly on wheat and barley, and can cause vomiting in farm animals that ingest vomitoxin-contaminated feed grains. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is responsible for ensuring food safety in certain foods\u2014including grains\u2014has not issued any guidance on vomitoxin in barley or barley products. However, it has issued advisory levels for vomitoxin in wheat and wheat products and feed grains for animals.", "The scab and vomitoxin epidemic has added to the financial stress of farmers in North Dakota and the rest of the Northern Great Plains. North Dakota suffered a drought in 1988 and floods in 1993 and 1997. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) estimates that in the barley-producing regions of North Dakota most affected by scab and vomitoxin, 768 (or about 14 percent) of the farmers stopped farming between 1996 and 1998. Although this figure includes farms that failed because of flood, drought, and other reasons, FSA officials stated that scab and vomitoxin were the primary reasons for leaving farming.", "Barley is economically important to North Dakota agriculture. Traditionally, it is second only to wheat in acreage planted and total crop income. For example, in 1992, the last year before the scab and vomitoxin epidemic, North Dakota\u2019s farm income from all crops totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.2 billion (about 54 percent) was from wheat and $237 million (about 11 percent) was from barley. Furthermore, for the last 50 years, North Dakota has been the leading barley producer in the United States; in 1997, it accounted for 27 percent of the nation\u2019s total barley production.", "Most farmers sell their barley to grain dealers, who then resell it to maltsters and brewers. To determine the price they will offer farmers for their barley, including the need for discounts, grain dealers have the barley tested for vomitoxin. Most testers of vomitoxin in North Dakota use a test kit called Veratox because it is relatively quick, inexpensive, and practical for commercial use. The high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) tests, which are used by researchers for purposes such as advancing research on vomitoxin, are also used by maltsters and USDA\u2019s Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) to check Veratox test results. These two reference methods are generally not used by commercial testing facilities and grain dealers because they are more costly, time-consuming, and complex to operate.", "GIPSA is the USDA agency that oversees federal grain inspections and has several key associated responsibilities. It authorizes certain commercial testing facilities to perform tests following its official procedures and standards. It also approves various testing methods, such as the Veratox kit, for use by these authorized facilities. Approved test methods, for which GIPSA provides training, must meet the agency\u2019s performance criteria. GIPSA also monitors the consistency of test results across its authorized facilities. For example, GIPSA conducts quarterly reviews of the test results from its authorized testing facilities. For these reviews, GIPSA uses the HPLC test method as a reference for, or check on, test results from these facilities. GIPSA considers the scab and vomitoxin epidemic to be a serious problem and has taken actions to address vomitoxin testing issues, such as conducting a study in 1998 to assess the extent to which sampling methods can affect vomitoxin test results.", "However, GIPSA oversees only a portion of commercial grain testing nationwide. Commercial testing facilities unaffiliated with GIPSA and large grain elevators where in-house testing with the Veratox kit is cost-effective also perform vomitoxin testing. The North Dakota Barley Council estimates that 40 percent of commercial vomitoxin testing in North Dakota occurs at GIPSA\u2019s authorized facilities; the remaining 60 percent occurs at either the unaffiliated testing facilities or large grain elevators. GIPSA has no oversight responsibility for vomitoxin tests performed by these other entities. Currently, GIPSA has four authorized agents in North Dakota that operate six commercial testing facilities. In addition, North Dakota has about nine commercial testing facilities that are not affiliated with GIPSA and between 12 and 20 grain elevators that test for vomitoxin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "North Dakota Barley Farmers Have Experienced Large Revenue, Yield, and Acreage Losses Because of Scab and Vomitoxin", "paragraphs": ["From 1993 through 1997, we estimate that North Dakota barley farmers suffered cumulative revenue losses from scab and vomitoxin of about $200 million (in 1997 dollars) \u2014equal to almost 17 percent of the $1.2 billion in total barley revenues farmers received during this period.The losses from these diseases varied significantly, both over the years and across the regions of the state, with the Red River Valley suffering the greatest losses. However, crop insurance payments for scab- and vomitoxin-damaged barley covered only a very small portion, less than 2 percent, of these cumulative losses. U.S. maltsters and brewers, the traditional buyers of North Dakota\u2019s malting barley, have reacted to scab and vomitoxin by expanding their imports of malting barley from Canada by about 380 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Large Revenue Losses Resulting From Scab and Vomitoxin Are Caused by Production Declines and Price Discounts", "paragraphs": ["From 1993 through 1997, we estimate that North Dakota farmers lost about $200 million (in 1997 dollars) in revenues as a result of declines in both production and price discounts. These losses were equal to almost 17 percent of the $1.2 billion in total revenues barley farmers received during these years. About 70 percent of these losses, or $139 million, were from reduced barley yields (in bushels per acre) and from farmers\u2019 leaving more barley unharvested. For example, between 1992 and 1997, average North Dakota barley yields dropped from a pre-disease level of 65 bushels an acre to 45 bushels an acre. Also, as shown in figure 1, from 1993 through 1997 (the years of the epidemic), the number of acres planted with barley fell from 2.9 million to 2.4 million and the number of harvested acres of barley fell from 2.4 million to 2.25 million. Differences between the amount of acres planted and actually harvested were the largest in 1993 and 1996. For instance, in 1993, North Dakota farmers harvested about 500,000 fewer barley acres than they had planted.", "Acres (000)", "Price discounts for barley contaminated with vomitoxin also played a key role in reducing farmers\u2019 revenues. From 1993 through 1997, price discounts because of vomitoxin accounted for about 30 percent, or $61 million, of total revenue losses. The relationship between vomitoxin and price discounts is complex. Discounting in the marketplace stems from the U.S. brewing industry\u2019s desire to use little or no vomitoxin-contaminated barley. In general, U.S. brewers send price signals that reflect their specific quality and quantity requirements to merchandisers and maltsters. These price signals are subsequently incorporated into price discount schedules that reflect buyers\u2019 reluctance to purchase barley with vomitoxin unless they receive a highly discounted price. Grain elevators use these schedules, in conjunction with other quality premium or discount factors, to determine an overall price quote to farmers. Price discount schedules for barley vomitoxin can change over time, sometimes on a daily basis, depending on market conditions. Price signals for malting barley come largely from the four large firms that dominate the U.S. brewing industry. One of these firms represents nearly half of the market. A limited number of buyers in a given industry, such as the brewing industry, can influence the market price for a given commodity.", "According to industry experts, although vomitoxin can cause excessive foaming during the malting process and in finished beer products, brewers require discounts for malting barley primarily because they are concerned about the potential for a negative public perception of beer containing vomitoxin. The industry is concerned that consumers will switch brands or purchase other alcoholic beverages if it is reported that beer contains vomitoxin. As a result, brewers are willing to pay top prices for vomitoxin-free barley, but only highly discounted prices for barley contaminated with vomitoxin.", "Table 1 shows an example of a price schedule for barley, incorporating discounts for different levels of vomitoxin. Although discounting strategies vary, grain dealers generally begin discounting the price of vomitoxin- contaminated barley at 0.6 ppm. This first discount, usually the largest of several, ranges from about 40 cents to 60 cents a bushel. As shown in table 1, this first discount would result in a price of about $2 per bushel. Grain dealers apply subsequent discounts of about 5 cents to 15 cents for concentrations of vomitoxin that range from 1.1 ppm to 3.0 ppm. At vomitoxin concentrations above 3.0 ppm, dealers generally purchase barley as feed grain, which receives the lowest price, about $1.75 per bushel. The American Malting Barley Council reported that for 1997 only 9 percent of all midwestern malting barley had a vomitoxin level that fell into the premium price category of 0.5 ppm or less.", "Along with steep price discounts, vomitoxin has had the effect of shifting the amount of malting versus feed grain barley produced in North Dakota. In the years before the scab and vomitoxin epidemic, the largest part of the state\u2019s barley production, and hence barley revenues, came from premium-priced malting barley\u201460 to 70 percent of all North Dakota barley sales. However, since the scab and vomitoxin epidemic, this trend has changed. Specifically, in several years during 1993 through 1997, many regions of North Dakota sold over 50 percent of the barley produced to the lower-valued feed grain market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue Losses Because of Scab and Vomitoxin Varied by Location and Year", "paragraphs": ["While scab and vomitoxin have reduced North Dakota barley farmers\u2019 revenues, the amount of loss has varied by region and year. As seen in table 2, the most severely affected area in North Dakota in terms of total revenue losses has been in the upper Red River Valley\u2014the East Central and Northeast regions of the state\u2014while the Southeast region has been least affected. Barley farmers suffered their greatest losses overall from vomitoxin in 1993 and in 1997, with losses of $62 million and $68 million, respectively. However, as the table shows, some regions\u2014because they were less affected by vomitoxin and thus had more premium quality malting barley to sell\u2014had a small increase in revenues in certain years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Imports of Malting Barley From Canada Increased as a Result of Scab and Vomitoxin", "paragraphs": ["Because the scab and vomitoxin outbreak has reduced the supply of high- quality malting barley in the Northern Great Plains, the traditional purchasers of North Dakota malting barley\u2014U.S. brewers and maltsters\u2014have increasingly turned to Canadian and other U.S. sources. Figure 2 illustrates the increase in Canadian barley production and the increase in exports of malting barley to the United States. During the years of the scab and vomitoxin epidemic, average annual Canadian exports of malting barley to the United States increased by about 380 percent. From 1993 through 1997, average annual barley exports from Canada reached 705,000 metric tons, compared to 147,125 metric tons from the pre-epidemic years of 1985 through 1992. In addition, to meet the increased U.S. demand for premium quality malting barley, Canadian production of malting barley grew from 1 million metric tons in 1993 to 2.2 million metric tons in 1997. Agriculture Canada reported in 1997 that the United States has been Canada\u2019s largest market for malting barley over the past 4 years because of the shortage of quality U.S. malting barley. And, in 1997, malting barley imports from Canada represented over 25 percent of all malting barley consumed by the U.S. brewing industry. In comparison, from 1988 through 1992, malting barley imports from Canada represented about 5 percent of all malting barley consumed by the industry.", "Although scab and vomitoxin have decreased North Dakota barley farmers\u2019 revenues, Canadian imports have somewhat moderated the blight\u2019s impact on U.S. brewers and maltsters. Shortages of malting barley in the United States as a result of these diseases would normally tend to increase U.S. malting premiums and prices, but these increases have been tempered by the large imports of Canadian malting barley. That is, even with a smaller domestic supply of malting quality barley, larger Canadian imports produce competitive pressures to keep prices below the levels they would be if imports were not part of the U.S. malting barley market."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Veratox Test Results Have Increased Variabilty at Levels Critical to Pricing Decisions", "paragraphs": ["According to testing experts, while the Veratox test kit serves the market\u2019s need for a relatively fast and cost-effective method for measuring vomitoxin in barley, it can produce test results that vary, particularly at concentrations critical to pricing decisions. Testing experts state that this variability can be reduced to some extent through quality assurance measures and training. Testing experts believe the HPLC and GC tests produce more accurate and consistent results, in part because they are conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. However, because of their complexity and cost, these tests are not practical for commercial use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Barley Prices Are Set at Levels Where Veratox Test Results Vary the Most", "paragraphs": ["Testing experts state that all tests for vomitoxin, including Veratox, experience variability in test results, particularly at the upper and lower limits of the test\u2019s ability to measure vomitoxin. This variability at the Veratox kit\u2019s lower limits of measuring vomitoxin can affect whether barley farmers receive a price discount. According to the manufacturer of the Veratox kit, the kit\u2019s lower limit of measurement is 0.5 ppm. At this concentration, Veratox test results can range from 0 ppm (where barley receives no discount) to 1.1 ppm (where barley would incur a substantial price discount). The market, therefore, is making crucial pricing decisions at concentration levels where the Veratox kit has substantial variability.", "Our analysis of selected test data results supports expert opinion regarding Veratox\u2019s variability. To conduct this analysis, we compared 1,068 Veratox test results between (1) Neogen (the manufacturer of Veratox) and a North Dakota commercial grain testing facility and (2) these two facilities and GIPSA\u2019s in-house HPLC reference method. We found that Veratox test results on the same samples of barley varied between Neogen and the commercial grain testing facility. Specifically, assuming that the HPLC test results represent the true concentration of vomitoxin, we found that at concentrations between 0.7 and 4 ppm, Neogen\u2019s estimate of vomitoxin levels was, on average, higher than the testing facility\u2019s. Consequently, farmers could have received different prices from each testing location, had the test results been the basis for a commercial sale. For example, we found instances in which, at a HPLC vomitoxin concentration of 1 ppm, the manufacturer\u2019s test results measured 1.1 ppm vomitoxin or greater, while the testing facility\u2019s measured 0.4 ppm. Had these results been the basis for a sale, a producer would have received $1.85 per bushel or less from the manufacturer but $2.55 per bushel from the testing facility. (See table 1 for an example of a price schedule for barley.)", "Testing experts said that test methods have two types of variability\u2014inherent and systemic. Inherent variability exists in all vomitoxin test methods and increases at the higher and lower limits of a given test method\u2019s ability to measure vomitoxin levels. Experts state that this variability cannot be controlled, which is why it is called inherent. The inherent variability of the Veratox test may affect barley buyers and farmers differently. According to GIPSA officials, grain elevators, which purchase barley from farmers and sell it to maltsters and brewers, may be less affected because they handle larger volumes of barley, with a correspondingly greater number of test results. Thus, the prices based on test results that were too high or too low\u2014because of the inherent variability associated with the test kit\u2014could counterbalance each other. As a result, grain elevators may be less affected by variable test results than barley farmers, who receive prices based on fewer test results. Because farmers may be more affected, some testing experts believe that if price discounts were started at 1 ppm, rather than at 0.5 ppm (the lower testing limit of the kit), farmers could receive more equitable test results. Some cereal scientists told us that no appreciable increases in beer production problems occur when brewing with barley having vomitoxin concentrations of 1 ppm versus 0.5 ppm. However, U.S. brewers and maltsters we talked to had varying opinions on whether beer production problems would increase at concentrations of 1 ppm.", "Systemic variability, which refers to differences in how testers obtain and process grain samples and conduct tests, can also affect test results\u2014for Veratox as well as for other testing methods. For example, a Veratox test involves many actions\u2014selecting and processing the grain sample, extracting the vomitoxin from the grain, and measuring the vomitoxin.", "Furthermore, the test equipment must be maintained and cleaned in order to achieve optimal results. Experts said that, because the potential exists for mistakes at each stage of the process, the accuracy of the kit\u2019s results is affected by the skill of the technician using it.", "For all testing methods, a number of actions\u2014including training and quality assurance efforts\u2014can be used to reduce systemic variability. First, test results from grain samples known to have vomitoxin can be compared across various testing facilities. This method, often referred to as a \u201ccheck-sample program,\u201d helps ensure that testing facilities will achieve consistent test results. GIPSA\u2019s offices and its authorized testing facilities use this approach. Specifically, GIPSA sends samples of barley or wheat with known concentrations of vomitoxin to its authorized facilities for testing. GIPSA then compares the test results to determine if all the facilities are measuring about the same amount of vomitoxin. GIPSA officials believe that their check-sample program helps keep vomitoxin test results consistent among its testing facilities.", "Second, testing experts stress the importance of using \u201cquality assurance (QA) pools\u201d to reduce systemic variability. QA pools consist of samples of naturally contaminated barley that a testing facility has tested many times in order to identify the true amount of vomitoxin in the sample. Testing facilities that practice quality assurance using QA pools will run tests on a pool in conjunction with daily vomitoxin tests. If a test on the QA pool detects an amount of vomitoxin that differs significantly from the known amount of vomitoxin in the pool, technicians are alerted that the tests on other samples also may be incorrect.", "Finally, testing experts said that the training of the technicians who conduct the tests is critical for obtaining optimal test results. GIPSA, for instance, provides Veratox training to all personnel who work at GIPSA-authorized testing facilities in North Dakota. However, GIPSA does not oversee the training given to other commercial grain testing facilities. Neogen, the Veratox kit\u2019s manufacturer, also provides training to new customers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reference Methods Produce Accurate Results, but Are Not Practical for Commercial Use", "paragraphs": ["According to testing experts, the HPLC and GC testing methods are widely accepted among analytical chemists for providing accurate and consistent results. For example, the Association of Official Analytical Chemists has approved a GC method and reviewed an HPLC method; and the American Society of Brewing Chemists has approved a GC method for industry use. In addition, the HPLC and GC methods are sometimes used to assess the performance of commercial test kits, including Veratox, because these chromatographic methods, according to testing experts, have less variability in their test results. For instance, GIPSA evaluates the performance of any new commercial test kit against its HPLC reference method before permitting its use by GIPSA employees and GIPSA-authorized testing facilities. Furthermore, GIPSA uses the HPLC method in its check-sample program.", "While these reference methods have less variability than Veratox, they are not practical for use at commercial testing facilities and grain elevators for several reasons, according to experts we spoke with. First, the procedures for preparing and testing the vomitoxin samples for these methods take several hours to complete. However, during the barley harvest, farmers typically deliver their barley to grain elevators by trucks that must unload and return to the fields for other loads. Because of the need for quick turnaround, the farmers, elevators, and truck drivers cannot wait several hours for a vomitoxin test to be conducted. In comparison, the Veratox test takes about 30 minutes to conduct. Second, the HPLC and GC methods require thousands of dollars in equipment investments. For example, HPLC and GC test equipment cost between $40,000 to $60,000 to purchase, while the Veratox test equipment costs about $3,200."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Under Conditions of Light Infestation, Short- and Longer-Term Actions May Reduce the Impact of Scab and Vomitoxin", "paragraphs": ["In barley, scab, and the vomitoxin resulting from scab, can be reduced somewhat through the use of fungicides and certain farming practices, such as crop rotation and deeper tillage of the soil. However, costs and other factors limit the usefulness of these actions, and their impact is minimal when the infestation is severe. In addition, varieties of barley that are more resistant to scab and vomitoxin will not be commercially available for at least 6 years. According to cereal scientists, improved barley varieties combined with short-term actions may eventually help some farmers to better manage scab and vomitoxin infestations, thereby reducing farmers\u2019 financial losses. However, it is unlikely that vomitoxin will be completely eliminated in the foreseeable future."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Short-Term Actions May Be Helpful, but Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["According to North Dakota extension agents and cereal scientists, a number of short-term actions can help farmers reduce scab, and thus vomitoxin concentrations, in barley. First, crop rotation\u2014changing the type of crop planted each growing season\u2014enriches the nutrients in the soil and decreases the incidence of crop disease. Although most farmers rotate crops routinely, the inclusion of more broadleaf crops in a rotation is likely to help decrease the levels of scab in the soil. Broadleaf crops, such as sunflowers, canola, and sugarbeets, are not as susceptible to scab as cereal grains, such as barley and wheat. However, even if rotation initially helps reduce scab levels, infestation could occur from airborne spores from other locations. Furthermore, other problems could discourage the use of crop rotations: (1) some broadleaf crops (such as sugarbeets) require costly equipment and costly contractual agreements and (2) many broadleaf crops cannot be grown in certain parts of North Dakota, thereby limiting the number of crops that can be included in rotations. For example, some farmers in north central North Dakota cannot easily grow beans because the climate is generally too cold and the growing season is too short. As a result, these farmers have shorter rotation cycles and are forced to more quickly return to crops (such as barley and wheat) that are highly susceptible to scab.", "Second, deep tilling to completely overturn the soil\u2014which does not occur with conventional tilling\u2014could reduce scab levels. Since scab stays through the winter in infected crop stubble, tilling deeper into the soil buries any infected residue and can help prevent scab from spreading to the next year\u2019s crop. However, deep-till practices result in less moisture in the soil, causing farmland to become more prone to wind and water erosion, and are therefore not practical for farmers in the drier portions of North Dakota (such as the western portion of the state). Deep tilling also requires farmers to purchase more expensive tilling equipment. Furthermore, as with crop rotation, infestation can occur from airborne spores if even one scab-infected farm in an area does not use deep tilling. Thus, for optimal effectiveness, deep tilling has to be conducted across many farms.", "Third, applying fungicides can help reduce vomitoxin. However, fungicides are not always reliable because of weather conditions and the difficulties associated with applying them. North Dakota farmers primarily use two types of fungicides, protectant and systemic. Protectant fungicides (which cover the plant externally) have been used for a number of years and are easily washed off by rain and degraded by sunlight. Systemic fungicides, which are newer, get absorbed into the barley plant within 4 to 8 hours of application and are not affected by sunlight or water. However, the timing of the application of both systemic and protectant fungicides is critical. They must be applied immediately after the barley flower blossoms because a new flower can become infected with airborne scab spores within 3 to 4 days. Once the barley flower is infected with the scab fungus, the fungus has the potential to produce vomitoxin. In addition, a farmer can expect to spend between about $90,000 and $138,000 to spray a 3,000-acre barley crop with a fungicide. Thus, in deciding whether to use fungicides, farmers must compare the costs they will incur in applying them with the higher price they could receive if their barley is less contaminated with vomitoxin.", "North Dakota extension agents told us that using the deep-till and rotation farming practices with fungicides increases the overall effectiveness of these short-term actions in reducing scab and lowering vomitoxin levels. However, they also noted that if airborne scab spores are widespread and weather conditions are favorable to fungal growth, barley crops would still become contaminated. Thus, they believe that these short-term actions will be effective only in years of light infestation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Resistant Barley Varieties Are Expected to Be Commercially Available in Several Years", "paragraphs": ["North Dakota State University, the University of Minnesota, South Dakota State University, and Busch Agricultural Resource, Inc., began a cooperative breeding effort to develop more scab-resistant barley in 1994. The four institutions exchange and test potential new varieties of barley. They also share information about new barley varieties that show resistance to scab and vomitoxin.", "In March 1997, a U.S. Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative was formed by scientists, members of the wheat and barley industries, commodity groups, and others to call national attention to the scab problem and to set national priorities for scab research. In fiscal year 1998, the Congress appropriated $500,000 to USDA to fund the scab research plan established by the leaders of the initiative; in fiscal year 1999, an additional $3 million was appropriated for the effort. Several of the research areas focus on developing more resistant varieties and assessing the effectiveness of fungicides in combating scab. Although USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is funding the initiative, scientists at state land grant universities, including North Dakota State University, will perform most of the research.", "According to barley breeders and farming experts, because of many scientific and commercial requirements, it takes about 8 to 10 years to breed, test, and release a new variety of barley. The breeding process includes several steps. First, a breeder must identify the genetic characteristics that could make the barley more resistant to vomitoxin. Second, these characteristics need to be combined and strengthened through successive new generations of barley varieties. Third, new varieties must be tested under multiple environmental conditions to ensure that they are truly resistant. During the breeding process, new varieties may sometimes appear to be resistant to scab when, in fact, they are not. For example, if a greenhouse containing a new variety being tested for resistance is kept cool and limited moisture is allowed to accumulate on the barley, little scab will grow. This may lead the breeder to believe that the variety is scab-resistant, while, in fact, the greenhouse environment suppressed scab growth.", "Fourth, after a breeder is confident that new varieties are truly resistant, they must be tested and screened for necessary malting and brewing qualities.

First, we explain malting premium price movements by total barley production or its relationship to the larger national barley market. Since the proportion of malting barley in the entire crop was fairly stable in the years prior to the vomitoxin epidemic, increases in total barley production translate into increases in the quantities of malting barley.
