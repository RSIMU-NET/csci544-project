This review calls for reductions in the F-22 low-rate initial production (LRIP) quantity, the total production quantity, and the production rates. Because the production quantities and rates were basic assumptions guiding the February 1997 F-22 restructuring plan, changes in the F-22 program that result from the review will require reevaluation of the cost of the program, the potential for cost reductions, and the contract strategy. Nevertheless, the information in this report provides an important historical and contextual framework for decisionmakers as they debate the issues surrounding the F-22."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The F-22 is an air superiority aircraft with a capability to deliver air-to-ground weapons. Advanced technology being developed for the F-22 makes it \u201c. . . a very ambitious, challenging program, probably the most challenging program in recent times,\u201d according to the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Defense Science Board. The most significant features include supercruise, the ability to fly efficiently at supersonic speeds without using fuel-consuming afterburners; low observability to adversary systems that have the objective of locating and shooting the F-22; and integrated avionics to significantly improve the pilot\u2019s battlefield awareness.", "The F-22 program began the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the acquisition process in 1991. According to the fiscal year 1997 President\u2019s budget, the Air Force planned to develop the F-22 and build nine development aircraft, two nonflying structural test articles, and four preproduction aircraft at a cost of about $17.4 billion. The Air Force planned to buy 76 aircraft during the LRIP phase of the program and 362 aircraft during the full-rate production phase. The total estimated production cost was about $48 billion.", "The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition engaged a Joint Estimate Team (JET) because management reviews of the F-22 program indicated potential cost growth. In February 1997, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology approved the Air Force\u2019s proposed plan to restructure the F-22 program based on the results of the JET\u2019s review. JET concluded that the F-22 engineering and manufacturing development program would require additional time and funding to reduce risk before the F-22 enters production. JET estimated that the development cost would increase by about $1.45 billion. Also, JET concluded that F-22 production cost could grow by about $13 billion (from $48 billion to $61 billion) unless offset by various cost avoidance actions, identified as tier I and tier II initiatives. These initiatives are being further defined by a study team chartered by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. That team is scheduled to report its conclusions in the fall of 1997. We have not reviewed the basis for the revised savings estimates that are now being devised by the team.", "We have issued a number of reports concerning the F-22 fighter program. (See Related GAO Products at the end of this report.) In an April 1995 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense reduce the degree of concurrency between development and production of the F-22 and minimize commitments to production until after successful completion of operational testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Costs Appear Optimistic", "paragraphs": ["Cost growth and schedule delays are among the most prevalent, oldest, and most visible problems associated with weapon systems.

Program cost increases on the order of 20 to 40 percent have been common on major weapon programs, as have schedule delays of over 2 years.", "Our review of the Air Force\u2019s restructuring plan for the F-22 program indicates that the projected costs are optimistic. The planned reductions in F-22 production unit costs are greater than achieved on prior fighter programs, and the initiatives to reduce the production costs are not fully developed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost Reduction Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["JET reported that projected costs for the F-22 grew because (1) making the first three of nine development aircraft was taking substantially more labor than planned, (2) the flight test program did not allow enough time for solving problems likely to be identified in avionics tests, (3) avionics integration was expected to take more time than first thought due to slips in the baseline schedule and loss of experienced software personnel, and (4) the number of engineering changes on the engine was expected to increase over earlier projections.", "JET also evaluated the cost impact on the production aircraft that could occur because the cost of the first three development aircraft was increasing above projections and the test program needed to be extended. As a result of these changes, production would have to begin later and at a slower pace, and the cost of production aircraft would reflect the increased costs of the development aircraft. JET concluded that cost growth of about $13 billion in the production program (from $48 billion to $61 billion) was possible unless offset by various cost reduction actions identified as tier I and tier II initiatives. JET\u2019s recommendations have been endorsed by the Air Force and essentially approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. JET\u2019s recommendations are listed in appendix I.", "JET concluded that savings of $6.6 billion in production costs could be achieved through the tier I initiatives. Although these techniques have the potential to reduce costs, the amount of savings that can be achieved from each will not be known until the initiatives are more specifically defined and production contracts are negotiated for F-22s. The tier I initiatives were those defined by JET in some detail, as shown in table 1.", "Tier II initiatives were less defined and were expected to provide an additional $6.6 billion in savings.

Our comparison of the planned reductions in F-22 production unit costs with the historical unit costs of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 programs indicates that the projected reduction in the unit cost of the F-22 exceeds the reductions that have been achieved on these other programs.", "The Air Force plans to acquire the first full-rate production lot of aircraft (the 71st through the 118th aircraft) at an average unit cost of about 18 percent of the cost of the first lot of LRIP aircraft. Prior programs, such as the F-16, have taken advantage of multiyear procurement and other techniques similar to those proposed for the F-22 program and have achieved significant reductions. However, these reductions were not of the magnitude projected for the F-22. For example, the average unit cost of the first full-rate lot of F-18s was about 31 percent of the cost of the first LRIP lot.", "Figure 1 compares the projected change in F-22 unit procurement cost to the actual changes in unit procurement cost of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 and plots the average procurement cost for each succeeding production lot of each aircraft. None of the other programs achieved the degree of unit cost reductions projected for the F-22. DOD officials said F-22 unit cost reductions are a result of production cost reduction business plans for the tier I and tier II initiatives. Air Force officials noted that an important factor is that no configuration changes, except for safety-of-flight changes, are to be made during LRIP of the first 70 aircraft. However, by not making configuration changes in the first 70 aircraft, the likelihood for cost growth in the first full-rate production lot may increase when the changes are made.

By applying the average cost of warranties we identified in past work, about 0.87 percent of the total contract value, we believe that about $400 million to $500 million in costs could be avoided if the warranty clause were eliminated. Air Force officials explained that they do not intend to eliminate the warranty and have provided about $200 million in the estimate of the cost for a warranty that is more limited, but complies with statutes.

Before restructuring, the Air Force estimated that 76 LRIP aircraft could be purchased for $10.8 billion. With the February 1997 restructured program, the Air Force estimated that 70 aircraft could be purchased at $14 billion.

The memorandum of agreement describes a contract strategy requiring negotiation of a target price curve that is to permit production of 438 F-22s at a cost of about $48 billion. In February 1997, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, in approving the Air Force\u2019s plan to restructure the F-22 program, required the Air Force to clarify the contractual implications of the memorandum of understanding.", "According to DOD officials, six factors are critical to maintaining the production cost at the planned level: maintaining stable funding throughout the production phase of the procuring a total of 438 aircraft in 13 lots; attaining a production rate of 48 aircraft per year in fiscal year 2004; achieving cost savings at the levels estimated by JET; maintaining a single configuration for aircraft produced through the LRIP program, except for changes for safety reasons; and negotiating a target price curve that is tied to a production lot profile as recommended by JET and endorsed by the Air Force.", "In view of the announced reduction of F-22 production quantities from  438 to 339, it appears that the contract strategy may require change.", "CAIG also evaluated the cost of the F-22 program and concluded in March 1997 that the production cost could approach $64.4 billion\u2014about $3 billion higher than the Air Force\u2019s estimate.

In 1991, when approving the F-22 program to begin the engineering and manufacturing development phase, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition required the Air Force to establish exit criteria that needed to be met before awarding production contracts. The Air Force established exit criteria for each lot of LRIP aircraft and the first lot of full-rate production aircraft. As part of the program restructuring, the Air Force revised these criteria, increasing the emphasis on avionics but removing criteria concerning aircraft performance.", "In the previous criteria, aircraft performance parameters for combat radius, maneuverability, and supercruise were required to be validated by analysis, test, or demonstration before contracts for lot 1 and subsequent production lots could be awarded. Air Force and DOD officials noted that key aircraft performance parameters are routinely reported in periodic Air Force and DOD reports, such as the Selected Acquisition Report, to acquisition and other executives. Accordingly, the officials said that reporting the performance parameters as part of the exit criteria is duplicative and not encouraged by DOD directives.", "The revised exit criteria include no specific requirements regarding aircraft performance as the program advances from one LRIP lot to the next. Although we recognize that reporting the key performance parameters occurs through other reports, we believe aircraft performance should be included as exit criteria because analysis and demonstration of aircraft performance are important factors in determining whether to proceed to the next production lot.

Because of the potential for cost growth in the F-22 program, we also recommend that the Secretary reconsider the potential savings that can be achieved by reducing the performance requirements of the F-22, as previously suggested by the Defense Science Board.

DOD also stated that it would make every effort to complete the detailed F-22 costing data in time to influence the fiscal year 1999 President\u2019s budget. In addition, DOD said that it does not believe that a substantial reduction in F-22 required performance is currently justified, but it indicated that cost-effectiveness analyses will be done to determine whether it is appropriate to lower requirements that are not met during testing. DOD acknowledged that certain aircraft performance measures had been deleted from exit criteria. However, DOD stated that the exit criteria had been simplified and reordered to conform to the restructured schedule but not at the expense of either the quality or difficulty of the events and performance levels that determine whether the program should be allowed to proceed to the next acquisition phase. Moreover, DOD indicated that the new criteria related to the demonstration of avionics maturity had been added.", "After considering DOD\u2019s comments, we believe our recommendation is still valid because the original exit criteria required intermediate validation of the aircraft performance parameters before award of each LRIP lot, whereas the revised exit criteria deleted the intermediate validation requirement and only considered the comparable requirement to enter full-rate production.
