Of the 179 systems at these locations, we discussed with system and technical managers the status of 48 systems, about 27 percent of the total. We selected these systems because they cover the three categories of active systems\u2014those to be replaced, those to be renovated, and those already compliant\u2014that DFAS is tracking under its Year 2000 program. Additional factors included consideration of the system size, number of system interfaces, and whether systems were intended to replace existing legacy systems.

It was established in January 1991 to strengthen DOD\u2019s financial management operations by standardizing, consolidating, and streamlining finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems. DFAS accounts for DOD\u2019s worldwide operations with assets totalling well in excess of $1 trillion. Each year, DFAS pays nearly 4 million active military and civilian personnel, 2 million retirees and annuitants, and approximately 23 million invoices to contractors and vendors. Due to DFAS\u2019 reliance on computer systems to carry out its operations, the Year 2000 issue has the potential to impact virtually every aspect of the DFAS accounting and finance mission. The majority of DFAS finance and accounting systems are 20 or more years old and are primarily written in the Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) programming language. DFAS recognizes that millions of lines of code must be analyzed and rewritten in systems that will still be operational in the year 2000.", "The Year 2000 problem is rooted in the way dates are recorded and computed in automated information systems. For the past several decades, systems have typically used two digits to represent the year, such as \u201c97\u201d representing 1997, in order to conserve on electronic data storage and reduce operating costs. With this two-digit format, however, the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, or 2001 from 1901. As a result of this ambiguity, system or application programs that use dates to perform calculations, comparisons, or sorting could generate incorrect results when working with years after 1999.", "Although DFAS is responsible for the majority of DOD\u2019s finance and accounting systems, DFAS is not responsible for all the systems that produce financial data. Systems that support other functional areas such as acquisition, medical, logistics, and personnel originate and process a significant amount of financial data that is ultimately reported on financial statements. These military service and Defense component systems provide financial data to DFAS through systems interfaces that DFAS needs to consider in addressing the Year 2000 problem. The systems that interface with DFAS systems are just as vulnerable to the Year 2000 problem as its own systems. Accordingly, DFAS\u2019 ability to sustain operations in the Year 2000 time frame is dependent not only on its own systems, but also on a host of Defense component systems upon which it is largely reliant for accounting transaction data.", "In February 1997, we published the Year 2000 Computing Crisis: An Assessment Guide that addresses common issues affecting most federal agencies and presents a structured approach and a checklist to aid them in planning, managing, and evaluating their year 2000 programs.

DFAS has estimated that it will cost $33.7 million to renovate its systems, which contain about 63 million lines of code, to meet Year 2000 requirements.", "DFAS has taken a number of positive steps to ensure that its personnel are fully aware of the impact should DFAS finance and accounting systems not be compliant at the turn of the century. During the awareness phase, DFAS developed a Year 2000 strategy that adopts the five-phased approach of awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation. The strategy, which is embedded in DFAS\u2019 written executive plan, establishes accountability for Year 2000 systems compliance from DFAS headquarters management to individual system/program managers at the center level. The Deputy Director for Information Management, who serves as the DFAS Chief Information Officer (CIO), is responsible for managing the Year 2000 program, and overseeing efforts to ensure that all DFAS systems are Year 2000 compliant by December 31, 1998, and within existing funding. As of April 1997, DFAS had taken the following actions as part of its efforts to address the Year 2000 problem: established a Year 2000 systems inventory, prepared cost estimates for systems to be renovated, instituted a quarterly Year 2000 status reporting process, appointed a project manager to provide Year 2000 guidance and track Year established a Year 2000 certification program that defines the conditions that must be met for automated systems to be considered as Year 2000 compliant.", "DFAS has also performed and documented an analysis of personal computers and workstations, which covered the Year 2000 hardware problems, test procedures and results, and corrective actions.

However, the plan does not address all phases of the Year 2000 problem, specifically the actions that will be needed during the validation (testing) and implementation phases. The plan also does not establish schedules for completing each phase of the Year 2000 program or milestones for meeting critical tasks under each phase, such as identifying system interfaces and securing interface agreements, preparing contingency plans, defining requirements for and establishing operational Year 2000 compliant test facilities, completing tests of personal computers and servers, or identifying performance measures for evaluating DFAS and center-level progress. DFAS officials have informed us that, while this step is not included in its Year 2000 plan, its system/program managers are now required to have all systems interfaces identified and written interface agreements completed by September 30, 1997, and all personal computers tested by December 31, 1997.", "Without comprehensive planning of the Year 2000 project, DFAS runs the risk that it will not have the information to make proper decisions or that necessary tasks will not be addressed in a timely manner. For example, it is important that DFAS establish time frames for completing specific tasks under the Year 2000 program that can be used by DFAS Year 2000 managers as indicators to gauge the progress of individual systems. Equally important is the need to formalize what DFAS managers expect to accomplish during each phase of the Year 2000 effort and within what time frames. For instance, if DFAS system managers have performed system renovations to become Year 2000 compliant, but planning was not conducted early in the process to ensure that adequate test resources or facilities would be available, DFAS runs the risk of systems failure if systems are left untested, or the loss of flexibility to pursue other alternatives before the year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Emphasis Needed on Assessing Risks and Planning for Contingencies", "paragraphs": ["DFAS has initiated actions to require contingency planning for noncompliant systems that are at risk of not being replaced prior to impact of the year 2000.

Contingency plans are important because they identify the alternative activities, which may include manual and contract procedures, to be employed should critical systems fail to meet their Year 2000 deadlines. DOD\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan and our Year 2000 Assessment Guide call on agencies to initiate realistic contingency plans during the assessment phase for critical systems and activities to ensure the continuity of their core business processes. From an overall agency perspective, DFAS has a Corporate Contingency Plan, which was recently updated in May 1997, that establishes policies, programs, and procedures and assigns responsibilities for the contingency planning process. The plan discusses various possible threats to DFAS activities, but does not specifically address potential year 2000 system failures, nor does it require DFAS managers to include year 2000 failures as part of the updated plan.", "DFAS has adopted a strategy for making all systems impacted by the Year 2000 compliant that includes (1) replacing legacy systems with compliant migration or interim migration systems and (2) renovating systems expected to be operational on and after the year 2000. However, DFAS\u2019 strategy has two inherent risks. First, because of delays in implementing some migration or interim migration systems, all legacy systems that are expected to be replaced may not be replaced prior to the year 2000. Second, systems being renovated to be compliant may not be completed as scheduled, and renovated systems and those systems DFAS believes to already be compliant, may not correctly operate at the turn of the century. Although DFAS has begun taking steps to address alternative actions if migration systems are delayed, DFAS\u2019 overall Year 2000 strategy has not required managers to address alternative actions should systems not operate correctly at the turn of the century. If this latter risk is not addressed and various critical applications fail to operate properly near to or at the turn of the century because of Year 2000 problems, DFAS will encounter interruptions to its accounting and financial activities with no clear alternative actions to help ensure continuity of operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DFAS Has Begun Planning for Contingencies Should Legacy Systems Not Be Replaced", "paragraphs": ["DFAS is relying on the success of the DOD migration program to solve a significant portion of its Year 2000 problem. DFAS\u2019 April 1997 quarterly status report indicates that about 80 existing legacy systems are to be replaced with 27 interim migration and migration systems, and several COTS systems. The DOD migration program, however, has a long history of problems, including missed milestones. Our current work has shown that many of DFAS\u2019 legacy systems had not been replaced according to projected plans. Also, in some instances, replacement decisions had not been finalized because of concerns over incorporating the legacy system requirements into the migration or interim migration systems.", "To assess the likelihood that systems already scheduled to be replaced would be replaced as planned, we identified 18 systems from DFAS\u2019 October 1996 Year 2000 quarterly report that were scheduled for replacement or termination by January 1997 (see appendix II for the number of systems not replaced or terminated by location). Of those 18 systems, we found that 11 had not been replaced or terminated as planned. While these systems could incur additional slippage and still be replaced before being impacted by the Year 2000 problem, DFAS\u2019 ability to meet tight deadlines for replacing systems may well become more difficult as the need for technical staff and resources increase for Year 2000 activities.", "One example of this problem is the deployment of the Standard Accounting and Reporting System (STARS). STARS is a DFAS interim migration system intended to replace eight noncompliant legacy accounting systems before the year 2000. In September 1996, we reported that the STARS migration project had experienced a number of problems over the years, including incomplete planning, missed milestones, and budget overruns. One specific system that was to have been replaced by STARS in January 1997 is the Naval Civilian Engineering Laboratory Financial Management Data System (NCEL-FMDS). However, as of April 1997, DFAS reported that NCEL-FMDS would be replaced by a COTS system by August 1997. Another system\u2014the U.S. Naval Academy Trust Fund Accounting System (NTFAS)\u2014was to have been replaced by STARS as of December 1996. While the April 1997 DFAS Year 2000 quarterly status report shows that a date for replacing NTFAS with STARS had yet to be determined, recent discussions with DFAS personnel indicate that NTFAS had been terminated. At the time of our report, DFAS had not provided documentation to support this assertion.", "DFAS recognizes the concern that some migration and interim migration systems may be delayed, and has begun actions to renovate some legacy systems that were originally designated for replacement. DFAS has also required its systems managers, for all systems to be replaced, to assess and report the risk\u2014using a high-; medium-; or low-risk designation\u2014of their systems not being replaced prior to being impacted by Year 2000 problems. Systems managers for all systems to be replaced that were designated as having a high or medium risk are to have prepared plans identifying how they intend to fix the Year 2000 problem. Beginning in July 1997, DFAS reports that it intends to start monitoring the existence of these systems plans through its quarterly reporting process. Further, DFAS also intends to begin tracking other information that should help it make decisions as to whether to renovate, or take other alternative actions, for additional legacy systems that are now expected to be replaced. For example, systems managers will be required to report the latest possible start date to initiate a system renovation that would still allow them to meet the compliance deadline. This requirement calls for having contingency plans in place for over 80 percent of the systems to be replaced.

These alternatives could include performing automated functions manually or using the processing services of contractors. While DFAS managers have begun preparing contingency plans for legacy systems that may not be replaced by compliant systems prior to the year 2000, the DFAS Year 2000 strategy does not require managers to assess risk, or plan for contingencies, if systems being renovated fail to operate at the year 2000. Also, the recently updated DFAS Corporate Contingency Plan does not require managers to address contingencies for a potential Year 2000 failure. DFAS needs this protection to ensure that, in the event of an operational failure, major functional activities are not disrupted at the year 2000.", "DFAS currently has identified 71 systems that it plans to make compliant through renovation, and an additional 66 systems that are reported as being compliant, but have not yet been fully tested in a Year 2000 operating environment. Although the DFAS Year 2000 program calls for these systems to eventually be validated prior to implementation, even with a structured process for assessing systems\u2019 compliance, DFAS systems are still at risk that unanticipated operational failure could occur. In addition, DFAS systems interact with many DOD component and military service systems, and as a result, an operational failure in one system or process would not only impact functions these systems currently perform but could also impact other related activities. Because many of the continuity of operation alternatives that traditionally apply to threats, such as back-up processing sites, cannot be relied upon to address Year 2000 issues, it is important that DFAS\u2019 functional and technical managers have policies and procedures in place to ensure that critical activities can be performed in the event of system failure.

DFAS systems interface internally with hundreds of other DFAS systems and externally with military services, Defense components, and various federal government systems. DFAS receives an estimated 80 percent of the data it uses in its finance and accounting processes from non-DFAS systems. It is critically important during the Year 2000 effort that agencies protect against the potential for introducing and propagating errors from one organization to another and ensure that interfacing systems have the ability to exchange data through the transition period. This potential problem may be mitigated through formal agreements between interface partners that describe the method of interface and assign responsibility for accommodating the exchange of data. DOD\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan places responsibility on component heads or their designated Year 2000 points of contact to document and obtain system interface agreements in the form of memorandums of agreement (MOA) or the equivalent.", "DFAS\u2019 Year 2000 strategy calls for its system managers to identify interfaces for all systems that are to be renovated for Year 2000 compliance and to obtain written MOAs between interface partners. System managers also are required to identify the number of internal and external systems interfaces and the number of interfaces that are covered by MOAs and include this as part of the DFAS Year 2000 quarterly reporting process. The number of interfaces not impacted by the Year 2000 problem are also reported separately for each system.", "As of April 1997, DFAS reported that system/program managers had identified 904 internal and external interfaces that are affected by the year 2000 problem, although managers still had not identified all interfaces. Of the 904 system interfaces that had been identified, 451 were reported as internal interfaces and 453 were identified as external interfaces. According to DFAS, written MOAs, covering how and when the interfaces are to be accomplished, had been completed for only 230 of the system interfaces. DFAS\u2019 quarterly report shows that significantly less progress has been made in securing written MOAs for external system interfaces than for those internal to DFAS. Of the 230 completed MOAs, only 82 were with external interface partners. DFAS officials have set September 30, 1997, as the deadline for securing all MOAs, both internal and external, with interface partners.", "While the number of interfaces is a major Year 2000 concern to DFAS, the importance and complexity of the interface issue is compounded due to DFAS\u2019 use of different strategies for making systems Year 2000 compliant. DFAS reports that about one-third of the systems it plans to renovate are using procedural code or sliding windows as the predominate strategies for becoming Year 2000 compliant. As such, the use of different strategies in systems that exchange data through interfaces may require the use of bridging. With these strategies, each interface partner will have to clearly understand the logical date interpretations that each is using to ensure that the appropriate century is applied when exchanging two-digit year data. Additional monitoring and oversight may be necessary to ensure that compliant date strategies that depend on date logic are implemented correctly.", "Timely and complete information on all system interfaces that may be affected by Year 2000 changes is critical to the success of DFAS\u2019 Year 2000 compliance program. The amount of work required to coordinate the data being exchanged between systems must be known as early as possible, and documented in written MOAs, in order that DFAS may complete maintenance schedules, allocate resources, plan testing, and schedule implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Focus Needed on Systems Testing", "paragraphs": ["We expect that agencies may need over a year to adequately validate and test converted or replaced systems for Year 2000 compliance, and that the testing and validation process may consume over half of the Year 2000 program resources and budget. While DFAS technical managers have performed certain Year 2000 tests of individual systems as part of their normal software maintenance processes, DFAS has not yet performed sufficient planning to ensure that all necessary testing will be conducted prior to Year 2000 impact. Also, some systems that DFAS has designated as already compliant had not been fully tested to support that assertion. Our assessment guide calls on agencies to develop validation strategies and test plans, and to ensure that resources, such as facilities and tools, are available to perform adequate testing. During the assessment phase, DFAS had not yet developed test plans for all systems it plans to have operational at the year 2000, including those systems to be renovated and those already classified as compliant. DFAS also had not yet defined what Year 2000 test facilities it expected to use and ensured their availability.", "Much of DFAS\u2019 testing is dependent upon others to provide the needed assurances that systems are Year 2000 compliant. For example, about 40 percent of DFAS\u2019 systems are technically maintained by central design activities (CDAs) that are managed by another Defense component or a military service. These activities are likely to have differing processes for conducting system testing. Also, before DFAS managers can be assured that systems under their responsibility are compliant, the systems will need to be tested in an operating environment using a Year 2000 compliant operating system. DISA is responsible for providing a Year 2000 compliant operating environment and resources for testing systems, including many DFAS systems, at DISA megacenters. DFAS will also need assurances from vendors that its COTS applications are Year 2000 compliant. While DFAS\u2019 recent establishment of a certification program should provide additional assurance that systems have been tested, the program will need to be properly implemented at all locations. Without planning for the proper and timely testing of all systems, DFAS runs the risk of potential contamination to systems data or interference with the operation of production systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Systems Asserted as Compliant Have Not Been Fully Tested", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our analysis, we found that DFAS had not performed adequate testing to assert that its compliant systems are capable of transitioning into the year 2000. According to the DFAS April 1997 quarterly status report, 66 of its 216 systems tracked for Year 2000 purposes are classified as compliant. DFAS\u2019 compliant systems can be grouped into four categories: already converted, not date sensitive, under development, and compliant COTS products. To determine if DFAS had a sufficient basis for asserting Year 2000 compliance, we selected six systems that DFAS had designated as compliant and reviewed supporting documentation provided by technical managers for three of the six that were identified as already converted. The remaining three systems were either in the process of being developed Year 2000 compliant or deemed to not be date sensitive. Managers of the already converted, compliant systems we spoke with indicated that they had performed some tests on the transfer and storage of dates, but had not completed all Year 2000 compliance tests. For example:", "A technical manager for the Defense Transportation Pay System (DTRS) stated that system integration tests to input four-digit year data from a keyboard entry and from an electronic entry had been performed.

The intent of the certification program is to define conditions, through completion of a certification checklist, that must be met in order that systems can be considered as Year 2000 compliant. Under the certification program, systems identified in DFAS\u2019 Year 2000 quarterly status report as to be renovated, being developed compliant, and compliant, are to be certified. System/program managers are to complete the certification no later than 1 month after a system acceptance test is performed and the system is deemed compliant. The certification checklist requires signatures of the technical manager responsible for performing system changes, the system/program manager responsible for ensuring that the system is compliant, and the center director or headquarters deputy director responsible for Year 2000 compliance of all systems at their respective locations.", "Because the certification program had only recently been established, we were unable to assess to what extent it had been implemented, and therefore, how well the process was working.

At the time of our review, DFAS had not required the testing of COTS applications that are being reported as compliant. Although systems managers had been given responsibility for obtaining written assurances from their vendors that COTS products are compliant, no documentation had been obtained to provide these assurances.

At the same time, its operations hinge on the ability of systems belonging to the military services and other components to be Year 2000 compliant. Additionally, DFAS is dependent on numerous central design activities that are not under its control to perform Year 2000 renovations to many of its systems. Although DFAS managers have recognized the importance of solving Year 2000 problems in their systems, to reduce the risk of failure with its own Year 2000 effort, it is critically important that DFAS take every measure possible to ensure that it is well-positioned to deal with unexpected problems and delays.
