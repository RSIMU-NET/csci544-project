For example, at HHS's National Institutes of Health (NIH), initial closure of the clinical trials registry prevented new trial registrations for patients, before NIH recalled a small number of employees to reopen the registry. Similarly, DOT's Merchant Marine Academy closed and required a change to the academic calendar to allow eligible students to graduate on time. However, officials at these departments said that longer-term effects are difficult to assess in isolation from other budgetary events, such as sequestration.", "Because of employee furloughs and payment or work disruptions, the three departments, their components, grant recipients, and contractors faced delays and disruptions in grant and contract activities during the shutdown, including the following examples:", "Within HHS, grants management activities at NIH effectively ceased with employee furloughs, although most current grant recipients were able to draw down funds. NIH had to reschedule the review process for over 13,700 grant applications because of the shutdown. After the shutdown, NIH completed the process to meet the next milestone in January 2014.", "Grants activities at DOT's Federal Transit Administration (FTA) effectively ceased with grants management officials furloughed and no payments made on existing grants. FTA officials said that no new grant awards were processed because of the shutdown, but the effect was minimal because the grant processing system is typically unavailable in early October for fiscal year closeout activities.", "At DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM), contract activities generally continued because of the availability of multi-year funding, but more than 1,700 contractor employees who operate and maintain EM facilities were laid off or required to use leave because EM issued stop work orders. EM officials reported some programs required 4 months to return to pre-shutdown levels of contract activity.", "Researchers' analyses of the economic effects of the shutdown have been limited to predicting its effect on real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2013.

There are two types of  furloughs:  A shutdown furlough occurs when there is a lapse in appropriations, and can occur at the  beginning of a fiscal year, if no funds have been appropriated for that year, or upon  expiration of a continuing resolution, if a new continuing resolution or appropriations law is  not passed.  In a shutdown furlough, an affected agency would have to shut down  activities funded by annual appropriations that are not excepted by law.

According  to officials at the three selected departments, all decisions were made in  collaboration with their general counsel, budget officers, and human  resources officials, and in line with guidance from OMB.", "At DOT, prior to and during the shutdown, the management team met to  determine what actions were needed to maintain operations and services  in the event of a government shutdown. The management team was  convened in August 2013 to start planning and met frequently in the days  before and during the shutdown. According to DOT officials, some days  there were multiple meetings held to make the necessary determinations  and after the team reached consensus on a particular issue the requisite  action was taken. Specifically, DOT officials said they continually  monitored how employees were affected by the shutdown through their  daily management meetings. According to DOT officials, DOT developed  an emergency furlough recall form to document when an employee  needed to be recalled temporarily back to duty because of an emergency  situation, such as services needed to protect life and property. The form  allowed management to document its request for employee recall in  addition to outlining the internal steps that needed to be followed to obtain  approval and document the process. According to DOT officials,  management used a tracking log to ensure these emergency recalls were  internally monitored throughout the shutdown. DOT did not update its  contingency plan after the shutdown.", "According to HHS officials, throughout the shutdown key management  officials were in constant communication to monitor the effects of the  shutdown on department operations and services including employee  furloughs. For example, the number of employees furloughed at HHS  changed according to the circumstances for each day of the shutdown,  according to HHS officials. Employees that completed the end of the  fiscal year financial close out for HHS initially were not furloughed, but  after they finished the financial close out they were furloughed. While  HHS did not document the number of employees furloughed each day  during the shutdown, HHS officials said, the key officials made decisions  orally as they were in constant communication throughout the shutdown.  HHS updated its contingency plan during the shutdown on October 10,  2013, to reflect the number of employees actually involved in the orderly  phase-down and suspension of operations. Specifically, on October 1,  HHS estimated that 1,103 employees were engaged in this activity, while  on October 10, HHS estimated that actually 429 employees were  engaged in this activity. HHS did not update its contingency plan after the  shutdown.", "DOE officials said ongoing communication with management at the  department and component level allowed them to closely monitor the  shutdown and make decisions as needed to keep programs operational  based upon the availability of funding, as discussed earlier. For example,  although DOE planned to furlough some of the EM staff at headquarters  and at each site that it oversees, EM officials said that their federal  employees were not furloughed as projected in the contingency plan.  DOE officials said the Energy Information Administration was the only  component that furloughed a number of employees during the shutdown.  According to departmental officials, DOE managed its contingency plan  throughout the shutdown in an effort to assess the needs of the  department and components regarding furloughs for employees at EM  and its other components. However, DOE did not formally update its  written plan after the shutdown.", "Officials at the three departments we reviewed said the daily  communication with OPM and OMB to address questions about the  shutdown was beneficial and helped lessen the uncertainty of the  situation. According to OMB staff and OPM officials, OMB and OPM had  daily telephone communication with agencies\u2019 management to address  questions such as clarifying guidance and answering questions from  agencies relating to recalling furloughed employees. Issues discussed  included unemployment compensation for furloughed employees and the  treatment of the Columbus Day holiday for excepted employees. In  addition, OMB staff indicated that they addressed questions from  agencies regarding how to communicate shutdown information to their  employees through these phone calls. Prior to the shutdown, OMB  provided guidance to agencies instructing them to update their  contingency plans and to determine the number of furloughed and  excepted employees. During the shutdown, OPM posted frequently  asked questions on its website to provide details on how employees\u2019 pay,  leave, and other personnel functions would be affected by the shutdown.", "Consistent with Circular No. A-11, OMB staff told us that after the  shutdown, they did not direct agencies to update their contingency plans  or document in another way how the shutdown was planned for,  managed, or implemented in terms of lessons learned for future  reference. For a longer shutdown, such as one lasting more than five  days, documenting what actually happened once a shutdown is over  including how operations were fully resumed could help agencies better  prepare and plan in the event of a future shutdown. Federal standards  indicate that agencies should identify, record, and distribute pertinent  information to the right people in sufficient detail, in the right form, and at  the appropriate time to enable them to carry out their duties and  responsibilities.

The impacts of sequestration on the  workforce, which included reduced employee travel, training, and  monetary awards, affected employee morale. According to department  officials, this effect on employee morale was further exacerbated by the  lapse in appropriations.", "According to HHS officials, once the shutdown ended, the department\u2019s  functions were fully reestablished and operations were back to normal  within 6 months of reopening. Department officials do not anticipate any  longer-term effects from the shutdown on departmental operations and  services. However, according to HHS officials, the morale of HHS  employees was low as a result of being furloughed. Also, the longer the  shutdown lasted, the more challenges arose that they had to  unexpectedly manage. For example, furloughed federal employees were  eligible to apply for unemployment insurance benefits, which the  Department of Labor is responsible for administering. HHS needed  guidance on how to instruct its employees to apply for unemployment  insurance since each state has different rules and procedures. HHS  officials said they could not provide general guidance to all employees.  After the shutdown, the department had to work with OPM to instruct its  employees on how to repay the insurance benefits since they received  back pay.

The first level of review is carried out by a Scientific Review Group composed primarily of  nonfederal scientists who have expertise in relevant scientific disciplines and current  research areas. Selection of scientists for peer review panels for the various study  sections is a multi-step process and it takes months to vet and balance scientific  expertise.

The second level of review is performed by National Advisory Councils or Boards within  NIH\u2019s Institutes and Centers. Councils are composed of both scientific and public  representatives for their expertise, interest, or activity in matters related to health and  disease. Appointed members usually serve a 4-year term (or usually 6-year terms in the  National Cancer Institute) and require approval by the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services or in some cases by the President of the United States.

The  exception was if the drawdown request triggered a Payment Management  System internal control flag. For example, some of the controls compare  requests to previous quarter draws, check if reporting requirements are all  met, and verify that the funds requested are within the grant\u2019s budget  period. NIH officials said that there were two holds triggered during the  shutdown for NIH grants that were resolved by the excepted employees.

These reductions included layoffs or forced use of annual  leave for 61 contracted employees at EM\u2019s Portsmouth Paducah Project  Office and 1,715 contracted employees at its Savannah River  Remediation Site. Agency officials also told us that the looming possibility  of employee furloughs and the potential termination of contracts  decreased morale among contractor employees in the weeks leading up  to the shutdown.", "Although the availability of multi-year funding gave EM some flexibility to  fund contracts, EM officials were still limited in their ability to manage  contracts and meet programmatic requirements. EM officials told us that if  EM had more advance notice of a potential lapse in funding, federal and  contractor personnel would have been better able to strategize as to how  to prepare for the funding lapse and would have slowed work at the end  of fiscal year 2013 to carryover more funds into fiscal year 2014 so that  work on contracts could continue. EM officials also reported challenges  with keeping equipment\u2014particularly equipment for nuclear processes\u2014 running and staffed at necessary levels during the shutdown.

The officials also said that if the shutdown had continued much  longer, existing funding for even the minimum level of staffing and  operation would have been in jeopardy. Officials told us that melters can  never be shut down because if the temperature of the melters fell below a  certain threshold, the melters would not restart and would therefore  become permanently unusable.

For example, some of the agency\u2019s computer systems that are  used to locate and assemble contract data were unavailable during the  shutdown and many of the officials who run reports and analyze data  were furloughed. As a result, the excepted officials had to manually  search through other means to obtain the information they needed to  inform decisions, such as identifying contract options that were set to  expire.

Specifically, at least one state publically reported it was uncertain about  how a mandatory grant with administrative costs funded with a  discretionary grant would be affected by the shutdown. For example,  unemployment compensation is a federal-state partnership and the state  is entitled to a grant from the Department of Labor to cover the necessary  costs of administering the program. While states were responsible for  making unemployment compensation payments during the shutdown,  states were unclear when they would be reimbursed for the administrative  costs incurred during the shutdown.", "The degree of disruption caused by the shutdown varied among  contractors at NIH and EM as well. Whether or not a federal contract was  allowed to continue during the shutdown depended on a number of  variables including the availability of funds and the extent to which  contract employees required supervision by federal employees or access  to federal facilities to conduct their work. For example, NIH contractor  employees that are located with and receive technical input from federal  employees or access to federal facilities were generally furloughed while  contracted EM employees generally continued their work at most sites.  However, the DOE contingency plan noted that while multi-year and no- year funds would be used initially DOE might need to review the activities  of its contractors depending upon the length of the shutdown, the need for  government oversight, and the availability of prior-year funding.

Some contractor employees were reportedly laid off  during the shutdown and furloughed contractor employees were not  necessarily paid by their employer during or after the shutdown. For  furloughed contractors, several circumstances influenced whether they  could be paid during the shutdown, including whether work was allowable  based on the terms of the contract that they worked on, the availability of  other assignments, and whether their company chose to or was able to  compensate them out of its own pocket if contract funds were  unavailable. Specifically, one association we interviewed told us that  small businesses with federal contracts were reportedly less prepared to  weather the shutdown than larger contractors with revenue sources other  than the federal government. In addition to furloughs, some companies  with affected contracts required employees to use leave or take paid or  unpaid time off if they were unable to reassign employees to training or  other nongovernment projects.

In some cases, suspending program operations may include  furloughing state employees. Some states have large numbers of  federally funded state employees and at least eight states furloughed  state employees during the shutdown.

As one  university wrote in a press statement, it could temporarily use cash  reserves in unrestricted fund balances to cover any federal shortfall.  However, doing so would affect its cash flow and if the shutdown lasted a  few weeks, the university expected the shutdown to have a direct effect  on the student academic experience and the university\u2019s ability to  continue to do research. Affected funding would include graduate student  funding, post\u2010doctorate funding, and other academic professionals and  faculty funding.", "During the shutdown, it was an issue for states to maintain sufficient cash  flow to bridge funds for federally-funded grant programs. Even if a state  wanted to use its funds to continue services for a federally funded  program, it might not have had sufficient liquid assets to do so quickly. At  least 12 states publicly reported that funding for certain grant programs  was only confirmed through October, meaning the funding may not have  been available if the shutdown had continued into November. Some of  these states had expected to discontinue certain federally-funded  programs or services if the shutdown had extended into November, while  others expressed uncertainty over how they would have proceeded if the  shutdown had been longer.

The economic  forecasters we interviewed do not anticipate the shutdown having any  longer-term effects on national economic activity.", "In January 2014, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the agency  whose national economic statistics provide a comprehensive view of the  U.S. economy in the form of summary measures such as GDP, estimated  the direct effect of the shutdown on the real GDP growth in the fourth  quarter of 2013 to be a reduction of 0.3 percentage points, which is within  the range of estimates provided by the economic forecasters that we  identified. According to BEA, the shutdown did not have an impact on  current-dollar federal compensation since Congress authorized  retroactive compensation for furloughed workers. BEA derived this  estimated effect on real GDP from real federal government  compensation, one of the components of GDP. BEA adjusted real federal  government compensation estimates based on the number of furloughed  employees and the number of furlough days, for the reduction in hours  worked by federal workers to account for a reduction in services. Thus,  BEA estimates show a decline in real GDP based on the lost productivity  of the furloughed workers. BEA could not quantify the effects of the  shutdown on other components of GDP and the national income and  product accounts, such as personal consumption expenditures or private  wages and salaries, since they were embedded in the source data that  underlie BEA estimates and could not be separately identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Economic Effects of the Shutdown", "paragraphs": ["The economic forecasters we interviewed believed the other economic  effects of the shutdown to be minimal and they generally limited their  analyses to the effect of the shutdown on direct effects of government  spending, specifically real federal compensation, as discussed earlier. For  example, one economic forecaster who did factor in some of the indirect  effects of the shutdown told us that he estimated the loss in real GDP  growth to be 0.36 percentage points, out of which only 0.03 percentage  points could be attributable to loss of support services or procurement of  other services by the federal government such as food and janitorial  services.", "Given the challenge with identifying and analyzing the detailed micro-level  data that would let them capture all the ripple effects through the  economy, these economic forecasters did not take all the indirect or  multiplier effects into account. These economic forecasters told us that  effects such as impact on consumer and investor confidence were harder  to quantify since it is not possible to isolate the effect of the shutdown  from the general political uncertainty at the time of the shutdown.", "One of the economic forecasters we interviewed believed that at the  economy-wide level, when one aggregates the effects over time and  across economic participants, these effects cancel each other out  because of substitution between activities and goods. For example, the  money that was not spent by furloughed federal workers at restaurants  near their work places may have been spent at restaurants around their  residences or at grocery stores. In addition, two of the four economic  forecasters told us that furloughed federal workers may have delayed  some purchases rather than canceling them altogether because they  were paid retroactively.", "Though the economic forecasters we interviewed generally did not  analyze all the indirect or multiplier effects of the shutdown on the  national economy, the economic forecasters told us that they expect the  indirect effects to have been minimal due to several factors:", "Duration and timing of the shutdown. Given that the shutdown  lasted for 11 working days, two of the forecasters we interviewed  believed it had a modest effect on the national economy. For  example, according to the analysis of one economic forecaster,  defense gross investment funding is usually set contractually about a  year before expected delivery so a shutdown was unlikely to delay  private production or construction of defense-related capital from one  quarter to the next. Also, if the contractors know that the funding is  secure and will be forthcoming eventually, this economic forecaster  said a brief shutdown would be unlikely to have an impact on defense  gross investment. Similarly, research projects are more likely to have  been delayed, rather than canceled, given the temporary nature of the  shutdown. We were also told that the timing of the shutdown  somewhat constrained its visible impact on the economy because it  occurred in the earlier part of the fourth quarter. Specifically, delays in  federal spending which occur within a quarter have no impact on the  growth rate of federal spending across different quarters, according to  the economic forecasters we interviewed.", "Expectations of federal workers regarding retroactive pay. Two of  the economic forecasters we interviewed said the furloughed federal  workers expected to be compensated for the time of the shutdown,  which prevented major changes in the economic behavior of these  employees. Federal employees have historically received retroactive  compensation from previous government shutdowns and the day  before the shutdown, Congress authorized that members of the  armed forces and civilian employees who support these members  would receive retroactive compensation. Both of these factors  increased federal employees\u2019 expectations that they would receive  retroactive compensation once the shutdown ended. This expectation  caused them to delay rather than reduce consumer expenditures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The October 2013 government shutdown was disruptive for the selected  departments\u2019 and components\u2019 operations and services. According to  selected department officials, the time spent preparing to furlough federal  employees and determining which programs could continue took  resources away from the departments\u2019 daily operations. The shutdown  also disrupted federal grants and contracts delivery at our selected  departments and components as a result of employee furloughs and  payment or work disruptions. Among other factors, the selected  departments were aided in managing the uncertainties of the shutdown  by their experience with preparing for prior potential shutdowns.", "The three selected departments reported that their contingency plans  were important in directing their shutdown activities and that these plans  generally represented how the shutdown was implemented. According to  the departmental officials, the departments did not update their  contingency plans after the shutdown ended to reflect how they managed  the shutdown. OMB requires agencies to submit plans and update them  when changes in funding occur and every 2 years starting August 1,  2015. However, OMB does not direct agencies to formally document  lessons learned from planning for and implementing a shutdown, as well  as resuming activities following a longer shutdown, such as the October  2013 shutdown which lasted more than five days. Federal standards  indicate that agencies should identify and record pertinent information to  enable officials to carry out their duties.

These departments and  components were selected based on the following criteria: (1) having  grants or contracts valued over $1 billion in fiscal year 2013, as reported  on USASpending.gov; (2) the percentage of federal employees expected  to be furloughed as reflected in the department contingency plans; and  (3) the potential for longer-term effects from the shutdown on operations,  grants, or contracts based on our determination using department  contingency plans, the dollar value of grants and contracts programs in  fiscal year 2013, and background research (including the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) report on the shutdown).

We checked OMB\u2019s data  by comparing the data to the planned furlough data agencies reported in  their shutdown contingency plans, and we checked the data for  reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in  accuracy and completeness. We also interviewed selected OMB staff  knowledgeable about the data and clarified the process whereby the data  were collected and verified. Additionally we assessed the reliability of the  federal grants and contracts data as reported on USASpending.gov for  the limited purpose of case study agency selection and background  information. We assessed the USASpending.gov data for accuracy and  completeness based on our recent report on the reliability of  USASpending.gov data. While the report noted inconsistencies with  USASpending.gov reporting, we determined that selected individual data  elements that we used for this report had sufficiently low percentages of  unverified information and therefore could be used for the limited  purposes of case study selection and background information. We believe  these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To describe the effects of the shutdown on the three departments\u2019 and  components\u2019 operations and services, we reviewed the documentation  from the department (including the contingency plan and guidance to  employees) and components (including details on programs affected by  the shutdown) and interviewed relevant departmental and component  level officials regarding steps they took for planning for and implementing  the shutdown and the effects of the shutdown on operations and services.  We reviewed OMB documentation (including its November 2013 report on  the effects of the shutdown, guidance to agencies on preparing  contingency plans and operating during a shutdown (OMB Circular No. A- 11 and OMB Memorandum M-13-22); reviewed Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) guidance to agencies; and interviewed OMB staff  and OPM officials. The information obtained from the selected agencies is  not generalizable to the rest of the government, but is descriptive of the  preparation and implementation of the shutdown and the effect of the  shutdown for the selected agencies. We did not assess whether  departments correctly implemented the shutdown or whether decisions to  except certain programs or employees were in accordance with the law.", "To describe what is known about how the shutdown affected contracts  and grants at the selected departments and components and contractors  and grant recipients as reported by associations with expertise in grants  and contracts, we reviewed documentation from the selected  departments and components (including guidance to the recipients of  grants from the components and contractors employed by the  components) and interviewed officials managing grants and contracts  within the selected departments and components. We targeted our review  of grants to HHS and NIH and to DOT and FTA. We targeted our review  of contracts to HHS and NIH and to DOE and EM. We also reviewed  documentation on how federal grant recipients in general were affected  by the shutdown as identified through background research from national  associations as well as the Congressional Research Service. We  interviewed relevant officials from national associations which either  represent contractors and grant recipients or otherwise have relevant  expertise, including associations representing recipients of grants from  our selected departments and components. In selecting associations with  expertise in grants, we applied the following criteria: geographic dispersal  of membership; longevity of operations; recommendations from the case  study departments and components; and our judgment. For grants, these  included the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials; Association of American Medical Colleges; Association of  American Universities; Community Transportation Association of  America; Federal Funds Information for States; Federation of American  Societies for Experimental Biology; National Association of State  Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers; and National Association of State  Budget Officers. For contracts, these included the Professional Services  Council and the American Small Business Chamber of Commerce.
