This progress has been the result of hard work and commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces financial management challenges. At the beginning of GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2006 financial statements, 72 financial management-related recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the issues that gave rise to them. During the fiscal year 2006 financial audit, IRS took actions that enabled GAO to close 25 of those recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional internal control issues resulting in 28 new recommendations. In total, 75 recommendations currently remain open. To assist IRS in evaluating and improving internal controls, GAO categorized the 75 open recommendations by various internal control activities which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control activity groupings. The continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle that IRS needs to overcome. Effective implementation of GAO's recommendations can greatly assist IRS in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management and can help enable it to more effectively carry out its tax administration responsibilities.

Internal  control in this important area should be designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or prompt detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets. We have grouped  together the four control activities in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government that relate to safeguarding of assets  (including tax receipts) and security activities (such as limiting access to  only authorized personnel): (1) physical control over vulnerable assets,   (2) segregation of duties, (3) controls over information processing, and   (4) access restrictions to and accountability for resources and records.", "An agency must establish physical control to secure and safeguard vulnerable assets.

Such assets should be periodically counted and compared to control records.", "IRS is charged with collecting over $2 trillion in taxes each year, a  significant amount of which is collected in the form of checks and cash  accompanied by tax returns and related information. IRS collects taxes  both at its own facilities as well as at lockbox banks that operate under  contract with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management  Service (FMS) to provide processing services for certain taxpayer receipts  for IRS.

Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain  appropriate separation of duties to allow for adequate oversight of staff  and protection of these vulnerable resources so that no single individual  would be in a position of both causing an error or irregularity, potentially  converting the asset to their personal use, and then concealing it. For  example, when an IRS field office or lockbox bank receives taxpayer  receipts and returns, it is responsible for depositing the cash and checks in  a depository institution and forwarding the related information received to  an SCC for further processing. In order to adequately safeguard receipts  from theft, the person responsible for recording the information from the  taxpayer receipts on a voucher should be different from the individual  who prepares those receipts for transmittal to the SCC for further  processing.", "The following four open recommendations would help IRS improve its  separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen its controls over both  tax receipts and refunds.

The review is required in TACs  where staffing permits. In exploring  procedures in January 2006 for TACs  with limited staffing where there is no  manager, secretary, or IAR, FA  determined proposed procedures to  be burdensome, difficult to  administer, and not administratively  feasible (e.g., copying and faxing  Form 795 to the manager). Also,  based on a September 2005 report by  the Treasury Inspector General for  Tax Administration (TIGTA) on  payments received at TACs (report  No. 2005-40-148), 99 percent of  payments posted appropriately to  taxpayer accounts. This accuracy rate  combined with compensating controls  at the Submission Processing  Centers (SPC) effectively reduces  risks associated with not having  reconciliation processes in small  TACs. Still, FA continued its efforts to  mitigate circumstances that prevent  proper segregation of duties in TACs  with limited staffing and, in July 2006,  approved a SERP update for IRM  1.4.11.19.5 to require TAC managers  to conduct quarterly reviews for  payment processing and  reconciliation procedures. Each  employee is to be reviewed a  minimum of two times each quarter  and reviews are to be discussed with  the employee as an evaluative record  of performance.
