While the 2006 Quadrennial Review emphasized the need for the ISR community to improve the integration and management of ISR assets, DOD plans to make significant investments in ISR capabilities for the future. Congress has been interested in DOD's approach for managing and integrating existing assets while acquiring new systems. This testimony addresses preliminary observations based on GAO's ongoing work regarding (1) the status of DOD initiatives intended to improve the management and integration of ISR requirements and challenges DOD faces in implementing its initiatives, (2) DOD's approach to managing current ISR assets to support military operations, and (3) the status of selected ISR programs in development and the potential for synergies between them.

DOD developed an ISR Roadmap that assessed current and planned ISR capabilities. Our preliminary work, however, has shown that the Roadmap does not (1) identify future requirements, (2) identify funding priorities, or (3) measure progress. DOD's second initiative to improve the integration of the services' ISR programs is assigning management of ISR issues as a test case of its joint capability portfolio management concept. The intent of the test case is to explore whether managing groups of ISR capabilities across DOD will enable interoperability of future capabilities and reduce redundancies and gaps. Although in its early stages, GAO identified challenges, such as the extent to which the services will adopt suggestions from portfolio managers. DOD's approach to managing its current ISR assets limits its ability to optimize its use of these assets. U. S. Strategic Command is charged with making recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on how best to allocate to combatant commanders theater-level assets used to support operational requirements. While it has visibility into the major ISR programs supporting theater-level requirements, it does not currently have visibility into all ISR assets. Also, the commander responsible for ongoing joint air operations does not currently have visibility over how tactical assets are being tasked. Nor do tactical units have visibility into how theater-level and ISR assets embedded in other units are being tasked. Further, DOD lacks metrics and feedback to evaluate its ISR missions. Without better visibility and performance evaluation, DOD does not have all the information it needs to validate the demand for ISR assets, to ensure it is maximizing the use of existing assets, and to acquire new systems that best support warfighting needs. Opportunities exist for different services to collaborate on the development of similar weapon systems as a means for creating a more efficient and affordable way of providing new capabilities to the warfighter. We have identified development programs where program managers and services are working together to gain these efficiencies and where less collaborative efforts could lead to more costly stovepiped solutions. Additionally, most of the 12 airborne ISR development programs that we reviewed had either cost growth or schedule delays. These problems resulted from not following a knowledge-based approach to weapon system development as provided for in Defense policy. In some cases, delay in delivering new systems to the warfighter led to unplanned investments to keep legacy systems relevant."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to discuss GAO\u2019s work for this  Subcommittee on the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) management and  acquisition of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets,  including unmanned aircraft systems. As you know, intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities are central to ongoing  military operations. Effective ISR can provide early warning of enemy  threats and precision targeting, as well as enable U.S. military forces to  increase effectiveness, coordination, and lethality. Battlefield commanders  rank the need for ISR systems and the information they produce as high on  their priority lists, a fact that is reflected in DOD\u2019s planned investment in  ISR. The demand for ISR assets at every level of command is growing, and  DOD is making investments in a number of ISR systems, including  unmanned aircraft systems, manned platforms, and space-borne, maritime,  and terrestrial systems. Although the United States has significant ISR  capabilities, their effectiveness has been hampered by gaps in capabilities,  growing competition for assets, unavailability when needed, and systems  that do not fully complement one another. The 2001 and 2006 Quadrennial  Defense Reviews emphasized the increasingly important role intelligence  capabilities\u2014including manned and unmanned airborne and space  capabilities\u2014play in supporting military operations and acknowledged  that the ISR community as a whole must move toward a collaborative  enterprise to achieve more responsive support for civilian decision makers  and commanders engaged in planning and executing operations. The 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review also called for a shift from military service- focused acquisition systems and concepts of operation to a more joint  approach to acquiring and employing defense assets.

To execute  this responsibility, USSTRATCOM established the Joint Functional  Component Command-ISR in March 2005 and designated the Director of  the Defense Intelligence Agency as the commander. The Joint Functional  Component Command-ISR is charged with developing strategies for  distributing, or allocating, existing ISR assets among combatant  commanders and ensuring the integration and synchronization of DOD,  national, and allied ISR capabilities and collection efforts.

DOD\u2019s recent update took the  ISR Integration Roadmap a step farther than its 2005 version because it  incorporated information from the QDR and the National Intelligence  Strategy. For example, the updated version includes a list of the ISR- related QDR decisions aimed at achieving future joint force characteristics  and building on progress to date, such as increasing investment in  unmanned aircraft systems and balancing air- and space-borne ISR  capabilities.

Moreover, the Roadmap does not clarify what requirements for future ISR  systems are already filled, or possibly saturated, identify the critical  capability gaps that need to be filled by future systems, or identify focus  areas for future requirements. For example, although the Roadmap sets  the objective of attaining global persistent surveillance, it has not yet  defined the requirements for persistent surveillance or how to use current  assets to attain it. We have previously testified on the need for better  planning for other ISR-related development programs. For example, DOD  has continued to request funding to support the services\u2019 plans to develop  new unmanned aircraft system capabilities in the absence of overall plans  to guide development and investment decisions.

The capability portfolio containing these  ISR systems is known as the battlespace awareness capability portfolio,  and it is one of the four test cases for exploring this management concept.  The intent of the ISR portfolio management test case is to enable DOD to  develop and manage ISR capabilities across the entire department\u2014rather  than by military service or individual program\u2014and by doing so, to  improve the interoperability of future capabilities, minimize capability  redundancies and gaps, and maximize capability effectiveness.

Therefore, it is too early to assess its effectiveness in integrating ISR  programs to meet future requirements. However, our preliminary work has  shown that the concept faces implementation challenges, among them  clarifying the responsibilities and authorities of the capability portfolio  managers in relation to the services in order to make trade-offs among  competing service priorities. For example, the ISR Integration Council  held discussions on service resource allocation decisions in an effort to  achieve consensus among the services, combatant commanders, and other  stakeholders. The Council proposed recommendations for rebalancing the  services\u2019 investments in their respective ISR portfolios during the fiscal  year 2008 budget. However, the ISR Integration Council did not have the  authority to compel services to change their budget plans. According to  defense officials, there were some disagreements between the ISR  Integration Council\u2019s recommendations and the services on funding levels  for ISR systems. These issues were elevated to the Deputy Secretary of  Defense for final decision. DOD leaders are monitoring the  implementation of the capability portfolio test cases to determine whether  portfolio managers should have the authority to direct changes to service  plans.

In 2004, the National Security Space Office completed a  limited architecture analysis of ISR assets using cost and performance  data. Specifically, the National Security Space Office analyzed how much  additional ISR capability would be provided by various ISR system mixes  for given levels of additional investment. The intent of the study was to  provide insight into the most efficient mix of current and planned ISR  systems. While the analysis was a useful demonstration of an approach to  inform decision makers, it had several limitations. For example, the  analysis did not include all national and tactical ISR systems, mainly  focusing on space and air. The analysis also assumed that the additional  infrastructure needed to support integration of information from  additional ISR systems would be available, while the costs associated with  such additional infrastructure, which are difficult to estimate, were not  included in the analysis. Further, the analysis was limited in that it only  considered ISR capabilities for levels of increased investment, not for  levels of decreased investment; thus, it did not consider what the most  efficient mix of ISR systems would be if limited resources forced decision  makers to decrease funding for ISR programs. Moreover, the analysis  represented a one-time effort and has not been repeated. Still, we believe  that, if expanded to be more comprehensive and integrated, this type of  data-driven analytical approach could inform decision makers on the  implications of various options for providing the most effective mix of ISR  capabilities that DOD can afford.

Greater visibility is also needed at the  tactical level to allow units a greater awareness of where other ISR assets,  including both theater-level and those assets embedded in other units, are  operating and what they are being used to do. Our preliminary work shows  that as a result of this lack of visibility, the potential exists for unnecessary  duplication, or multiple ISR aircraft to be tasked to operate in the same  area and against the same requirement.  However, some level of  duplication may be necessary when driven by system capabilities and  mission requirements.  Our work has also shown that by leveraging the  capabilities of different ISR assets using techniques such as cross-cueing,  the Air Component Commander has been able to use the different types of  capabilities brought by different theater-level manned and unmanned  assets to maximize the intelligence collected. For example, a manned Joint  Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance system could be  used to sense movement in an area and then an unmanned system such as  a Predator could be called in to collect imagery to confirm suspected  activity. With greater visibility at all levels into the tasking of all ISR assets,  including those tactical assets controlled by the military services, there is  an opportunity for DOD to gain greater synergies and optimize the use of  its ISR assets, reduce the potential for unnecessary duplicative taskings,  and determine whether additional perceived demand for these assets is  well-founded. This visibility would also allow tactical units, when  appropriate, to leverage other assets operating in their area to maximize  the information captured and avoid unnecessary duplicative taskings.

The Army\u2019s unmanned aircraft system had four  blades and a larger engine, while Navy\u2019s system had three rotor blades and  a smaller engine. After discussions, the Navy decided to switch to the  Army\u2019s configuration. The Army is buying common components, such as  the air vehicle and flight components, under the Navy contract.", "An Army program management official estimated that the savings to the  Army in research and development alone would be about $200 million. As  both programs mature, the official believes additional synergies and  savings could be realized through contract price breaks on quantities and  shared test assets, such as air vehicles, support equipment, and test  components. Jointly acquiring common hardware under one contract will  also reduce procurement administrative lead time and permit common  design, tooling, and testing. Finally, future payload development such as  communications, sensors, and data links could be procured jointly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunity to Collaborate on Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)", "paragraphs": ["The Navy identified a mission need for a broad area maritime and littoral  ISR capability in 2000. Based on a 2002 analysis of alternatives, the Navy  decided to pursue a manned platform Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft  (MMA) with an unmanned adjunct, the BAMS. The Navy subsequently  performed an analysis of alternatives for the BAMS program, which  identified several potential alternatives; foremost among them was the  Global Hawk system. As a risk reduction effort, the Navy funded the  Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration program in 2003. Working through  the existing Air Force contract, the Navy procured two Global Hawk  unmanned aircraft and associated ground controls and equipment. The  demonstration program was expected to leverage the existing Global  Hawk system to develop tactics, training, and techniques for maritime  mission applications.", "The BAMS program is at a critical juncture. It released a request for  proposals in February 2007 and plans to proceed with system development  and demonstration in October 2007. If the Global Hawk (or another  existing system like the Air Force Reaper) is selected, there are  opportunities for the Navy to work with the Air Force and take advantage  of its knowledge on the existing platform. By adopting the collaborative  techniques used by the Fire Scout officials, the Navy could leverage  knowledge early in the acquisition process and avoid or reduce costs for  design, new tooling, and manufacturing, and streamline contracting and  acquisition processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration Slow to Happen on Warrior and Predator", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the Fire Scout experience, the Air Force and Army  repeatedly resisted collaborating on their Predator and Warrior unmanned  aircraft programs. The Air Force\u2019s Predator is a legacy program that has  been operational since 1995. Its persistent surveillance/full motion video  capability continues to be a valued asset to the warfighter. When the Army  began in 2001 to define requirements for the Warrior, a system similar to  the Predator, it did not explore potential synergies and efficiencies with  the Air Force program. Both the Air Force and the Joint Staff responsible  for reviewing Warrior\u2019s requirements and acquisition documentation  raised concerns about duplication of an existing capability. Despite these  concerns, the Army did not perform an analysis of alternatives, citing the  urgent need of battlefield commanders for this capability. The Army  awarded a separate development contract to the same contractor  producing the Predator.", "Responding to direction from the Quadrennial Defense Review and the  Secretary of Defense, the Army and Air Force agreed to consider  cooperating on the acquisition of the two systems in January 2006.  However, the effort has stalled because the services have different  concepts of operation and requirements. For example, the Army does not  agree with the Air Force\u2019s requirement for rated pilots. The Air Force and  the Army are currently working to identify program synergies in a phased  approach. Initially, the Air Force will acquire two of the more modern  Warrior airframes and test them. Later, the services will compare their  requirements for ground control stations and automated takeoff and  landing. Finally, the Army and Air Force plan to compare concepts of  operation and training requirements for additional synergies. However, so  far the Army has coordinated the proposed approach through the Vice  Chief of Staff level, but the agreement has not yet been approved by the  Department of Army. The Air Force is still working to resolve comments  and concerns at lower organizational levels. If this stalls, these programs  could be more costly and redundant."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some ISR Development Programs Have Experienced Problems That Have Led to Cost Growth, Delays, and Additional Investments in Legacy Systems", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all of the 13 airborne ISR programs we reviewed have experienced  changes in cost or schedule. This can be attributed to a variety of causes.  Many programs began development without a solid business case or a  realistic acquisition strategy. As a result of the schedule delays in some  programs, the services will have to make investments in legacy systems to  keep them in the inventory longer than planned. These investments  represent opportunity costs that could have been used for other needs  within DOD."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost, Schedule, and Performance Status of Airborne ISR Programs", "paragraphs": ["Programs must build a business case that provides demonstrated evidence  that (1) the warfighter need exists and that it can best be met with the  chosen concept, and (2) the concept can be developed and produced  within existing resources\u2014technologies, design, funding, and time.  Establishing a business case calls for a realistic assessment of risks and  costs; doing otherwise undermines the intent of the business case and  invites failure. Once the business case is done, programs must develop a  realistic acquisition strategy, which requires having critical program  knowledge at key points in the acquisition. This includes knowledge about  technology maturity, system design, and manufacturing and production  processes. DOD\u2019s acquisition policy endorses this knowledge-based  approach to acquisition. This policy includes strategies to reduce  technology, integration, design, manufacturing, and production risks.", "Table 1 summarizes ISR programs that have encountered problems either  in development or as they prepared to begin the system development and  demonstration phase of an acquisition program.  Results of these  problems included cost and schedule growth, program restructuring,  cancellation, and unplanned investments in the legacy systems that were  being replaced.", "Following are detailed examples of programs that failed to either develop  a good business case or an executable acquisition strategy and that had  problems. The outcome was that the services either had to or may have to  make additional investments in the legacy systems to keep them relevant  and in the operational inventory until the new system has completed  development and is fielded.", "Aerial Common Sensor (ACS)", "The Army\u2019s termination of the ACS system development and  demonstration contract could have significant schedule, cost, and  performance impacts on three legacy systems in the ISR portfolio\u2014the  Army\u2019s Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) and Airborne Reconnaissance  Low (ARL), and the Navy\u2019s EP-3. The Army and the Navy had planned a  phased approach to field the ACS and retire the legacy systems from the  inventory with a minimal investment in maintaining legacy systems. Delays  in ACS development will now require the Army and Navy to make  investments in the legacy systems at the same time that they develop new  replacement systems. In addition, any delay in either the development of  new systems or modification of legacy systems could result in an ISR  capability gap on the battlefield.", "The GRCS and ARL were to be replaced by ACS beginning in fiscal  year 2009. Since the termination of the ACS development contract, the  ACS program has reverted to a predevelopment stage as the Army  restructures the program. ACS is scheduled to restart system  development and demonstration in 2009, 5 years later than the initial  development decision. Although the Army has not established a new  date for initial operating capacity, that date is also likely to slip by 5  years to fiscal year 2014. The cost to keep GRCS and ARL mission  equipment viable and the platforms airworthy is estimated to be $562  million between fiscal years 2008 and 2013. Without these  improvements, the systems will not remain capable against modern  threats which could result in a gap in ISR capabilities on the battlefield.  In addition, the airframes could not continue to fly during this time  frame without some structural modifications.", "The Navy had planned to replace its EP-3 with ACS and begin fielding  the new system in fiscal year 2012. After the Army terminated the ACS  development contract, the Navy considered staying with the Army in its  development effort. However, according to Navy officials, the Chief of  Naval Operations directed the Navy to proceed with a separate  development effort, designated the EPX. The Navy now plans to  proceed with system development and demonstration in the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Navy has not established a date to begin  fielding the new system, but that is not likely to take place before 2017.  This translates into a 5-year slip in retiring the oldest EP-3 systems and  will make modifications to those systems necessary so that they can  remain in the field until the Navy achieves full operating capacity for its  EPX. The Navy plans to invest $823 million between fiscal years 2008  and 2013 to modify the EP-3.", "The Air Force plans to replace the U-2 with the Global Hawk but delays in  the Global Hawk program have contributed to the need to keep the U-2 in  the inventory longer than anticipated. In December 2005, the Air Force had  planned to begin retiring the U-2 in fiscal year 2007 and complete the  retirement by fiscal year 2012. Although the next configuration of the  Global Hawk (with limited signals intelligence capability) is scheduled for  delivery in fiscal year 2009, it will not have the same capability as the U-2.  The version of the Global Hawk that is planned to include a more robust  signals intelligence capability is scheduled to begin deliveries in 2012. The  Air Force is now developing a plan to fully retire the U-2s a year later in  2013 and at a slower rate than the 2005 plan. There are no funds in the  budget beyond fiscal year 2006 but the Air Force intends to fund projects  necessary to keep the U-2 capable.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our prepared statement.
