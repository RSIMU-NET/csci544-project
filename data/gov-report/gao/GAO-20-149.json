Among other things, this report examines (1) states' estimates of costs of administering work requirements in selected states, and (2) CMS's oversight of these costs. GAO examined the costs of administering work requirements in the first five states with approved demonstrations.

Since January 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved nine states' demonstrations that require beneficiaries to work or participate in other activities, such as training, in order to maintain Medicaid eligibility. The first five states that received CMS approval for work requirements reported a range of administrative activities to implement these requirements.", "These five states provided GAO with estimates of their demonstrations' administrative costs, which varied, ranging from under $10 million to over $250 million. Factors such as differences in changes to information technology systems and numbers of beneficiaries subject to the requirements may have contributed to the variation. The estimates do not include all costs, such as ongoing costs states expect to incur throughout the demonstration.", "GAO found weaknesses in CMS's oversight of the administrative costs of demonstrations with work requirements.", "No consideration of administrative costs during approval. GAO found that CMS does not require states to provide projections of administrative costs when requesting demonstration approval. Thus, the cost of administering demonstrations, including those with work requirements, is not transparent to the public or included in CMS's assessments of whether a demonstration is budget neutral\u2014that is, that federal spending will be no higher under the demonstration than it would have been without it.", "Current procedures may be insufficient to ensure that costs are allowable and matched at the correct rate. GAO found that three of the five states received CMS approval for federal funds\u2014in one case, tens of millions of dollars\u2014for administrative costs that did not appear allowable or at higher matching rates than appeared appropriate per CMS guidance.

As of November 2018, over three-quarters  of states operated at least part of their Medicaid program under a section  1115 demonstration; in fiscal year 2017, federal spending for  demonstrations was about $145 billion, or over one-third of federal  Medicaid program expenditures.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees Medicaid  section 1115 demonstrations (referred to hereafter as demonstrations)  and has approved states\u2019 use of demonstrations for a variety of purposes.  For example, under demonstrations, states have extended coverage to  populations, offered services not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, and  increased beneficiary premiums and cost-sharing above statutory limits.", "In January 2018, CMS issued guidance announcing a new opportunity for  states to use demonstrations to require certain beneficiaries to work or  participate in community engagement activities, such as vocational  training or volunteer activities, as a condition of Medicaid eligibility.

CMS officials explained that the agency needs more experience  with policies that require administrative changes under a demonstration  before making any revisions to its processes.

State officials said that CMS officials told them on multiple  occasions that the state could receive a 50 percent federal match for  these costs. Based on this, the state requested budget authority from its  legislature for $51.2 million for employment and training services, of  which it anticipated $23.1 million would come from federal Medicaid  funds. CMS officials told us that such costs are not eligible for federal  matching funds and maintained that the agency\u2019s guidance\u2014which  indicates that beneficiary support costs are not eligible for federal  matching funds\u2014was clear. In response to our inquiries, the agency  contacted the state in April 2019 and clarified this with officials.", "Federal funds for costs to administer work requirements provided  through managed care contracts, which may not be allowable. As  noted earlier, three of the five selected states (Indiana, Kentucky, and  New Hampshire) required or planned to require MCOs to perform a  number of activities to implement work requirements. These activities  included, for example, providing information on options to satisfy work  requirements, assisting beneficiaries with reporting compliance with work  requirements, and providing referrals to state work requirement  resources. To fund these activities, officials in these states said that they  plan to increase their capitation payments. States will receive at least a  90 percent federal matching rate for most of these payments, because  the payments are largely for beneficiaries who are newly eligible under  PPACA. It is unclear, however, whether including these activities in  capitation payments is allowable. CMS regulations provide that states  may only include administrative costs that are related to the provision of  covered health care services in their MCO capitation payments. In  addition, CMS guidance notes that implementing work requirements will  not change the types of expenditures that are allowable. We provided  CMS with specific examples of activities states delegated or planned to  delegate to MCOs and asked if these types of activities met CMS\u2019s  criteria to be included under capitation payments.

This assessment should consider risks related to costs for  information systems, beneficiary supports, and managed care.

HHS also provided us with technical  comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate. HHS did  not concur with our recommendations. In general, HHS commented that it  expects administrative costs to represent a relatively small proportion of  total Medicaid spending and that its current approach to overseeing  administrative costs\u2014including those incurred under Medicaid  demonstrations\u2014is appropriate given the level of financial risk. HHS  commented that administrative costs were approximately 5 percent of  Medicaid expenditures. While these cost may represent a relatively small  share of total spending, CMS projected them to be $18 billion in federal  funds in fiscal year 2019\u2014and this does not include all administrative  spending. In particular, it does not include amounts paid to MCOs for  administrative costs, which are likely considerable given that managed  care payments now represent about half of all Medicaid spending.  Further, demonstrations may represent a heightened financial risk given  our finding that they can result in additional administrative costs that  would not otherwise occur.", "Regarding our first recommendation to require states to submit and make  public projections of administrative costs, HHS commented that its  experience suggests that demonstration administrative costs will be a  relatively small portion of total costs and therefore HHS believes making  information about these costs available would provide stakeholders little  to no value. As noted, Medicaid is a significant component of federal and  state budgets. In each of the five states we reviewed, public commenters  expressed concerns about the potential administrative costs of Medicaid  demonstrations with work requirements, suggesting stakeholders would  value information about these costs. We maintain that requiring states to  make public information about administrative costs would help to ensure  that demonstration proposals provide sufficient information to ensure  meaningful public input.", "Regarding our second recommendation to account for administrative  costs when assessing whether demonstrations are budget neutral, HHS  again commented that its experience suggests that demonstration  administrative costs will be a relatively small portion of total costs and that  it believed that its current approach is appropriate for the level of financial  risk. However, we found that demonstration administrative costs could be  significant and HHS\u2019s current policy of not considering these costs in its  assessments of budget neutrality could increase federal fiscal liability. For  example, in Kentucky, we found estimated administrative costs for  implementing the demonstration exceeded $270 million over about 2  years. We maintain that including administrative costs in its assessments  will help HHS ensure that demonstrations are budget neutral.", "Regarding our third recommendation to assess and respond to risks of  providing federal funds for costs to administer work requirements that are  not allowable, HHS commented that (1) all states\u2019 requests for federal  Medicaid funding are subject to the same federal regulations and  requirements; (2) the expenditures reported by states to GAO had not  been reviewed against federal requirements or certified by states to be  accurate and permissible; and (3) HHS believes its existing approach is  appropriate for the low level of risk that administrative expenditures  represent. Our findings indicate that CMS\u2019s oversight procedures\u2014which  are designed to prevent state spending on costs that do not meet federal  requirements\u2014have vulnerabilities, particularly given the types of  administrative activities associated with work requirements. Four of the  five states we reviewed were planning to seek federal funds for costs (1)  that did not appear allowable, or (2) at higher matching rates than appear  appropriate, and three states succeeded in gaining CMS approval to do  so. We agree with HHS that CMS may also identify inappropriate  expenditures during its reviews of state-reported expenditures. However,  our past work has identified weaknesses in that review process. In  2018, we reported that CMS officials indicated that resource constraints  have limited the agency\u2019s ability to target risk during such reviews,  potentially allowing errors to go undetected. Finally, the basis for HHS\u2019s  conclusion that its current approach is appropriate for the risks posed by  these administrative expenditures is unclear. As we note in our report,  CMS officials told us that they had not assessed whether current  procedures sufficiently address risks posed by administrative costs for  work requirements and had no plans to do so.
