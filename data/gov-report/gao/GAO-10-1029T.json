This statement is based primarily upon an April 2010 GAO report on VA's training for experienced disability claims processors (GAO-10-445) and includes information on actions VBA says it has taken in response to our recommendations. This statement focuses on (1) experienced disability claims processors' views regarding training, and (2) VBA's efforts to monitor and assess training for experienced disability claims processors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Experienced claims processors had concerns about the amount of training they were required to complete and their ability to meet that requirement. In addition, they had mixed views on the amount of training received on specific topics, the way in which training was delivered and the timing of training. GAO's survey results indicated that 60 percent of experienced claims processors found it difficult to meet the 80 hour annual training requirement given their workload. In addition, based on its survey, GAO estimates that 45 percent of supervisors of experienced Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSR) and 53 percent of supervisors of experienced Veterans Service Representatives (VSR) thought that only some or few, if any, of the experienced staff they supervise need 80 hours of training annually to perform their job duties effectively. Many experienced staff also thought they received too little training on some topics and too much on others. For example, 47 percent thought they received less training than needed in how to develop appeals and remands and 34 percent thought they received more than enough training on records management. Finally, opinions varied on how helpful the various modes of training were. Nearly all claims processors, in general, considered on-the-job experience to be the method of training best suited to their needs. An estimated 39 percent of all experienced claims processors, in general, felt that the training they received was delivered too late, suggesting that regional offices may not always deliver the training needed by experienced claims processors in a timely manner. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, federal agencies must have control mechanisms in place to help ensure that all employees receive appropriate and consistent training. Under its current annual training requirements, VBA delegates considerable responsibility for training experienced claims processors to each of its 57 regional offices. In particular, regional offices are responsible for ensuring that claims processors complete annual training requirements. Each office also determines what topics are covered for half of the required training hours, what material to provide on each of these topics, and how and when the training should occur. Regional offices also have considerable discretion in determining what activities qualify as training. However, at the time of GAO's review, VBA lacked controls to ensure that regional offices deliver required training and record completed training in a consistent manner, and did little to assess the appropriateness or consistency of all training for experienced claims processors. During the course of our review and in response to our recommendations, VBA has taken steps to improve its monitoring and assessment of training. VBA reports that they are developing guidance on what activities qualify as training, have begun to require staff to complete course evaluations for some training and are exploring the feasibility of requiring evaluations for all training. In its April report, GAO recommended that VBA (1) adopt procedures for routinely monitoring and ensuring compliance with annual training requirements, including more fully using its Web-based learning management system to ensure training requirements are met, (2) develop clear written guidance on the types of activities all regional offices should and should not count toward completion of annual training requirements, and (3) develop and implement a written strategy for systematically assessing the appropriateness of the training regional offices provide to experienced claims processors. VA concurred with these recommendations and has taken some actions in response."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on training for Veterans  Benefits Administration (VBA) disability claims processors. In fiscal year  2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) paid about $44 billion to  about 4 million veterans and their survivors through its disability  compensation and pension programs. For years, the claims process has  been the subject of concern and attention by VA, the Congress, and  veterans service organizations due, in large part, to long waits for  decisions, large numbers of pending claims, and problems with the  consistency of decisions. To help VBA manage its increasing workload and  replace the growing number of experienced claims processors who are  retiring, the Congress provided funding which enabled VBA to hire several  thousand new staff from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2010.  However, more staff alone will not guarantee effective disability claims  processing. To ensure that decisions in disability compensation and  pension cases are accurate, consistent, and timely, training must enable  claims processors to become fully proficient and maintain their knowledge  and skills.", "In 2008 we reported that VBA\u2019s centralized training for new claims  processors appeared well designed but that some claims processors had  raised concerns about implementation. VBA has since evaluated its  training for new claims processors and made changes based upon that  evaluation. In April 2010, we again reported on VBA\u2019s training as mandated  in the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. We recommended  improved monitoring of annual training requirements, standardized  recording of training taken, and a review of course content and timing for  experienced claims processors. My remarks today will focus on 1)  experienced disability claims processors\u2019 views regarding training, and 2)  VBA\u2019s efforts to monitor and assess their training. This statement is drawn  primarily from our April 2010 report, where we obtained information on  the training, experience, and views of a nationally representative sample  of claims processing staff. We also interviewed VBA headquarters officials  and managers and training coordinators in four regional offices\u2014Little  Rock, Arkansas; Denver, Colorado; St. Petersburg, Florida; and White  River Junction, Vermont. Our work was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe the evidence obtained provides  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To process claims accurately, consistently, and in a timely manner,  Veterans Service Representatives (VSR) and Rating Veterans Service  Representatives (RVSR) must perform a complex set of tasks. When a  claim is received, a VSR reviews it and assists the veteran in gathering the  evidence, or documentation, needed to support it. The RVSR then  evaluates the evidence to determine whether the claimant\u2019s medical  condition(s) constitutes a disability, and assigns a disability percentage  rating which determines the amount of benefits the veteran is eligible to  receive. Finally a VSR calculates the amount of monthly benefit payments.  VSRs and RVSRs also perform follow-up reviews if, for example, there is  evidence a claimant\u2019s medical condition has changed, or a court  determines that a claim was incorrectly denied.", "To ensure that VSRs and RVSRs develop and maintain the knowledge and  skills needed to process disability claims accurately, consistently, and in a  timely manner, VBA has established annual training requirements and  developed a structured training program, called \u201cChallenge,\u201d for newly- hired or promoted claims processors. Beginning in fiscal year 2010,  claims processors must receive 80 hours of training annually in topics  directly related to processing disability claims. VBA requires that 40 o f  those hours be in topics designated by VBA, 20 cover topics selected by  each regional office from a list of core technical training requirements  (CTTR), and 20 cover topics determined by each regional office.", "In addition to its \u201cChallenge\u201d program and annual training requirements,  VBA issues \u201cFast Letters,\u201d or memoranda on policy changes, conducts  telephone conferences, and develops ad hoc required training on emerging  issues to help ensure that disability claims processors have the  information they need to do their job. VBA issued 100 Fast Letters in  calendar years 2008 and 2009, on topics ranging from cost-of-living  adjustments in disability benefits to rating the effects of traumatic brain  injury (TBI). Monthly or quarterly telephone conferences with regional  offices concentrate on claims processing issues identified through VBA\u2019s  quality reviews or on new management priorities or initiatives that may  affect how claims processors do their jobs. VBA officials also told us the  agency periodically requires training on emerging topics such as rating  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and spinal, neck, and joint injuries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experienced Claims Processors Had Concerns with Various Aspects of the Training They Received", "paragraphs": ["Experienced staff responding to our survey expressed concerns with the  amount of training they were required to take and their ability to meet  those requirements. Based on the results of our survey of claims  processors, many believed that 80 training hours each year were too many,  particularly for experienced staff. An estimated 45 percent of supervisors  of experienced RVSRs and 53 percent of supervisors of experienced VSRs  thought that only some or few, if any, of the experienced staff they  supervise need 80 hours of training. Most of the regional office officials we  interviewed also said 80 hours are too many for at least some experienced  staff and one regional official told us it would make sense to vary the  required number of hours based on the training needs of individual claims  processors. In 2008 we recommended that VBA collect and review  feedback from staff to determine if the 80-hour training requirement was  appropriate for all VSRs and RVSRs. VBA has not yet implemented this  recommendation.", "Our survey results also indicated that it was challenging for many  experienced claims processors, in general, to meet the 80-hour annual  training requirement, given their workload. Sixty percent found it  somewhat or very difficult to meet the requirement. Moreover, 61 percent  of experienced RVSRs\u2019 supervisors and 76 percent of experienced VSRs\u2019  supervisors thought it was somewhat or very difficult for experienced staff  to complete 80 hours of training each year.", "While many experienced claims processors thought that 80 hours of  training per year was too much and difficult to complete, they had mixed  views on the amount of training they received on specific topics. For  example, an estimated 47 percent thought they received less than  sufficient training in developing appeals and remands, and 42 percent  thought they received less than needed in how to rate claims involving  special monthly compensation. On the other hand, in each case, about  one-third thought they received more than enough training in records  management, rating disability compensation claims, and calculating  payment amounts based on disability ratings.", "Experienced claims processors\u2019 views on the helpfulness of various  training modes and the timing of training also varied. Training for  disability claims processors can be delivered in a number of ways: formal  classroom training, online instruction, and video or satellite conferences.  Claims processors can access online training courses through VBA\u2019s  Training Performance Support System (TPSS), and learning resources  such as VBA training materials, published guidance, and technical  information are available to them on VBA\u2019s internal Web site. Regional  offices also provide claims processors with individual coaching and  mentoring, and may hold weekly meetings for claims processing teams.", "Based on our survey results, experienced claims processors, in general,  found certain training modes and learning resources more helpful than  others. Nearly all thought that on-the-job experience, to a great or very  great extent, helped them learn what they needed to know to perform their  jobs. However, only about 20 percent indicated TPSS and other online  training, and video or satellite training had, to a great or very great extent,  helped them become familiar with even the basic information needed to  handle claims.", "Survey results also indicated that regional offices do not always deliver  necessary training in a timely manner. An estimated 39 percent of all  experienced claims processors felt that the formal training, in general,  they received in the last 12 months was delivered too late to help them  effectively perform their job duties. For example, although the regulation  governing ratings decisions on the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI)  was changed in October 2008, one RVSR wrote in a comment to the  survey that, \u201cTBI training is not projected to come out until \u201d  Another wrote that introductory leadership training was not received until  two years after a promotion to a supervisory position."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VBA Did Little to Systematically Monitor or Assess Training for Experienced Claims Processors but Has Begun to Take Steps to Do So", "paragraphs": ["VBA headquarters does not ensure that experienced claims processors  receive all required training. It is important for federal agencies to have  mechanisms in place to ensure their employees actually receive required  training and we have reported in the past that tracking the actual receipt  of required training calls for reliable data from a comprehensive learning  management system. While each regional office is responsible for  recording completed training hours for each claims processor in VA\u2019s  Web-based Learning Management System (LMS), VBA officials told us that  VBA headquarters did not use it to centrally monitor the specific types of  training individual claims processors have completed. Based on our survey  results, we found some claims processors did not receive training they  should have. An estimated 24 percent of all RVSRs with more than one  year of experience, who should have received mandatory training on  rating spinal, neck, and joint injuries, never did. To improve VBA  headquarters\u2019 ability to systematically monitor regional office compliance  with its annual training requirements, we recommended that it adopt  procedures to routinely do so, including more fully utilizing its LMS to  ensure that claims processors received required CTTR and ad hoc training  on emerging issues. In their comments to our report, VBA noted that it had  begun to use LMS to determine what percentage of claims processors at  each office were meeting annual training requirements. However, it is not  clear if they are tracking whether staff receive required CTTR training or  ad hoc training on emerging issues such as the training on rating spinal,  neck, and joint injuries.", "In addition, we found that VBA lacked controls to ensure that regional  offices record completed training in a consistent manner. Each regional  office has considerable discretion in determining what activities qualify as  training and we noted that they were not all defining training consistently.  For example, some regions counted the time claims processors spent  reading \u201cFast Letters\u201d as training while others did not. This raises  questions about the reliability of the data that regional offices enter into  the LMS. We recommended that VBA develop clear written guidance on  the types of activities all regional offices should and should not count  toward completion of annual training requirements. According to VBA, the  agency is developing such criteria and expects to complete this process by  September 30, 2010.", "VBA also has not systematically assessed the appropriateness or  consistency of training regional offices provide to experienced claims  processors. In prior work, we have noted that federal agencies should  have mechanisms in place to ensure that training for employees is  appropriate and consistent. However, we found that VBA did little to  determine if all regional offices provide training to experienced claims  processors that 1) covers topics relevant to what they do; 2) helps them do  their job; 3) is delivered in the most useful and efficient way; and 4) is  provided when needed.", "In the past, VBA has evaluated some mandatory training to improve the  consistency of ratings, assessed training for newly-hired claims  processors, and solicited feedback from staff on TPSS. VBA officials told  us that teams from VBA headquarters also periodically visit regional  offices to monitor their compliance with VBA policies and procedures.  Since July 2009, such visits have included a training specialist responsible  for reviewing some aspects of training in the regional office, such as  training records and materials, and whether new claims processors have  completed the last phase of Challenge Training at their regional office.  Although examining some aspects of training for claims processors during  these visits may provide VBA with some information on the  appropriateness and consistency of training, each office is only visited  about once every three years.", "Finally, VBA has not yet systematically collected feedback from  experienced claims processors on training received at the regional offices  even though feedback from training participants, supervisors, instructors  and other stakeholders can provide agencies with valuable information to  assess the appropriateness and consistency of their training. VBA recently  developed a training evaluation tool that all VSRs and RVSRs are required  to complete, but only for CTTR courses. As a result, we recommended that  VBA develop and implement a written strategy to systematically assess the  appropriateness (content, mode and timing) of all training for experienced  claims processors. Such a strategy should include a standardized approach  for obtaining feedback from experienced claims processors and regional  office managers and training coordinators.

However, VBA could do more to monitor the training  received by experienced claims processors. VBA cannot be sure all staff  are receiving the type of training the agency believes is essential for  success on the job. Furthermore, there are questions about the reliability  of the training data regional offices record in VA\u2019s LMS.
