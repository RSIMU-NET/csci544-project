These efforts have resulted in a wide range of recommended actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the VA system. Some involve ways to restructure existing delivery processes to lower costs, while others identify ways to increase the recovery of the costs of health care provided to veterans and others. Our comments are based primarily on the results of these efforts as well as studies done by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG), and others.", "In summary, VA\u2019s health care system should be able to make a significant contribution toward deficit reduction over the next 7 years. First, the system may not need to expend the level of resources it previously estimated to meet the health care needs of veterans in the mandatory care category. These resources are overstated because (1) VA does not adequately reflect the declining demand for VA hospital care in estimating its resource needs and (2) much of the care VA provides is discretionary (that is, VA is required to provide the services only to the extent that space and resources permit). Second, VA could reduce operating costs by billions of dollars over the next 7 years by completing actions on a wide range of efficiency improvements. Actions are already under way or planned on many of the improvements.", "The success of these efforts, however, depends on the extent to which VA and its health care facilities are held accountable for how they spend appropriated funds. Unlike private health care providers, VA\u2019s system bears few of the risks associated with inefficient operating practices and, as such, has little economic incentive to reduce costs. VA managers frequently blame inefficiencies on the law, but this appears to us to be unfair. Historically, VA\u2019s central office provided few incentives for facilities to become more efficient. The central office put little pressure on facilities to treat patients in the most cost-effective manner and shifted few resources among facilities to promote efficiency. At the facility level, however, VA managers are often able to find ways to operate more efficiently when they need resources to implement new services or expand existing ones.", "Recent changes at VA are starting to create the types of efficiency incentives that have long existed in the private sector. For example, VA\u2019s reorganization of its health care facilities into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) includes several encouraging elements that show promise for providing the management framework needed to realize the system\u2019s full savings potential. First, VA plans to hold network directors accountable for VISN\u2019s performance by using, among other things, cost-effectiveness goals and measures that establish accountability for operating efficiently to contain or reduce costs. Second, the Under Secretary for Health (1) distributed criteria that could guide VISN directors in developing the types of efficiency initiatives capable of yielding large savings and (2) gave VISN and facility directors authority to realign medical centers to achieve efficiencies. Finally, VHA\u2019s plans to develop a capitation funding process could provide greater incentives to improve efficiency, provided data problems are resolved."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The VA health care system was established in 1930, primarily to provide for the rehabilitation and continuing care of veterans injured during wartime service.

Certain veterans, however, have a higher priority for receiving care and are eligible for a wider range of services. Such veterans are generally referred to as Category A, or mandatory care category, veterans.", "More specifically, VA must provide hospital care, and, if space and resources are available, may provide nursing home care to certain veterans with injuries related to their service or whose incomes are below specified levels. These mandatory care veterans include those who have service-connected disabilities, were discharged from the military for disabilities that were incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, are former prisoners of war, were exposed to certain toxic substances or ionizing radiation, served during the Mexican Border Period or World War I, receive disability compensation, receive nonservice-connected disability pension benefits, and have incomes below the means test threshold (as of January 1995, $20,469 for a single veteran or $24,565 for a veteran with one dependent, plus $1,368 for each additional dependent).", "For veterans with higher incomes who do not qualify under these conditions, VA may provide hospital care if space and resources are available.

Only veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or higher (about 465,000 veterans) are in the mandatory care category for comprehensive outpatient care. All veterans with service-connected disabilities are in the mandatory care category for treatments related to their disabilities; they are also eligible for hospital-related care of nonservice-connected conditions, but, with the exception of veterans with disabilities rated at 30 or 40 percent, they are in the discretionary care category. Most veterans with no service-connected disabilities are eligible only for hospital-related outpatient care and, with few exceptions, are in the discretionary care category.", "From its roots as a system to treat war injuries, VA health care has increasingly shifted toward a system focused on the treatment of low-income veterans with medical conditions unrelated to military service. In fiscal year 1995, only about 12 percent of the patients treated in VA hospitals received treatment for service-connected disabilities. By contrast, about 59 percent of the patients treated had no service-connected disabilities.

To date, only a few medical centers have established such access points, but many others are developing plans to shift care to lower-cost community settings.

For example, although the Albuquerque VA medical center treated a total of only 24 veterans for kidney stone removal in fiscal years 1990 through 1992, the hospital purchased a lithotripter, a machine that breaks up kidney stones so that they can be eliminated without surgery, at a cost of almost $1.2 million. During its first year of operation, 34 veterans received treatment. A private provider in the same city provided lithotripsy services for $2,920 a procedure. Thus, the hospital could have met the 34 veterans\u2019 needs at a cost of about $100,000 compared with its expenditure of $1.2 million plus operating costs.

In 1994, VA began routinely using such data to determine veterans\u2019 copayment status."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Incentives Can Hinder Further System Efficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Although cost savings can and are being realized, the VA health care system lacks overall incentives to further increase efficiency. Unlike private sector hospitals and providers, VA facilities and providers bear little financial risk if they provide (1) expensive medically inappropriate care or (2) services not covered under a veteran\u2019s VA benefits. Unlike private health insurance, where the insurance company bears most of the risk, the veteran, rather than VA, bears most of the financial risk for veterans\u2019 health benefits. However, when VA facilities are given an incentive, such as the desire to fund new programs, they appear to be able to identify opportunities to achieve savings through efficiency improvements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Facilities Bear Little Risk From Providing Inappropriate Care", "paragraphs": ["Private insurers increasingly require their policyholders to obtain prior authorization from an independent utilization review firm before the insurers will accept liability for the hospital care. Frequently, this authorization also sets a limit on the number of days of care the insurer will cover without further authorization regarding the medical necessity of continued hospitalization. Because compliance with these requirements directly affects their revenues, private sector hospitals pay close attention to them.", "Similarly, the Medicare program has, since 1982, paid hospitals a fixed fee based on the patient\u2019s diagnosis. The fixed fee is based on the national average cost of treating the patient\u2019s condition. If the hospital provides the care for less than the Medicare payment, it makes a profit. But if the hospital keeps the patient too long, is inefficient, or provides unnecessary treatments, then it will suffer a loss. This creates a strong incentive in the private sector to discharge Medicare patients as soon as possible.", "Those same financial incentives to increase efficiency and provide care in the most cost-effective setting are largely absent in the VA system. Even in those cases in which a private health insurer\u2019s preadmission certification requirement applies, the hospital\u2019s revenues are not affected by failure to obtain such certification. A VA hospital that admits a patient who does not need a hospital level of care incurs no penalty. In fact, facility directors often indicated that VA\u2019s methods of allocating resources to its medical centers favored inpatient care.", "VA\u2019s current RPM system is attempting to remove the prior incentive to provide care in the hospital rather than an outpatient clinic and create incentives to provide care in the most cost-effective setting. As used during the last two budget cycles, however, the system has done little to create such incentives. Because VA chose to shift few funds between the highest- and lowest-cost facilities, facility incentives to become more efficient were minimal. For fiscal year 1995, VA reallocated $20 million from 32 high-cost to 27 low-cost facilities. VA officials told us that they plan to use RPM to reallocate more money in fiscal year 1996 and to provide VISN directors a \u201crisk pool\u201d of contingency funds to help facilities unable to work within their budgets. It is yet unclear how VISN directors plan on using these funds.", "And unlike private sector health care providers, VA has no external preadmission screening program or other utilization review program to provide incentives to ensure that only patients who need a hospital level of care are admitted and that patients are discharged as soon as medically possible. VA gives private sector hospitals providing care to veterans under its contract hospitalization program incentives to limit patients\u2019 lengths of stay by basing reimbursement on Medicare prospective payment rates.

The insurer or managed care plan thus has a strong financial incentive to make certain that only medically necessary care is provided and that care is provided in the most cost-effective setting. Otherwise, the insurer may suffer a financial loss.", "Unlike private health insurance, however, the VA system does not guarantee the availability of covered services. As a result, the ability of veterans to obtain covered services depends on resource availability. If a VA facility is inefficient and the resources allocated to the facility are not sufficient to meet anticipated workload, the VA facility is allowed to deny (that is, ration) services to eligible veterans.

But he told the hospitals that they would have to use their own resources to do this. Over half of VA\u2019s hospitals quickly developed plans to establish so-called access points. For example, the Amarillo VA medical center identified ways to save over $850,000 to pay for the establishment of access points:", "The medical center saved an estimated $250,000 a year by consolidating inpatient medical wards and reducing the number of surgical beds it staffed. As a result of these consolidations, the center eliminated nine nursing positions, achieving a savings in salaries and related benefits. Officials said that the consolidations coincided with declining workloads, attributable to lower admissions and lengths of stay, and as such would not affect the availability or quality of care the center provides.", "The medical center expects to save up to $150,000 by reviewing patients\u2019 use of prescription medications. These reviews have led to a reduction in the number of medications provided, resulting in a savings in the cost of procuring, storing, and dispensing the drugs. It expects to reduce future pharmacy costs by $250,000 by trying to change patients\u2019 lifestyles as a means of reducing cholesterol. Center officials estimate that this approach has reduced the use of lipid-lowering drugs by half. The medical center established health education classes, which teach correct eating and exercise techniques. Before this, physicians had routinely prescribed lipid-reducing drugs to lower cholesterol levels. Officials are planning to establish similar health clinics for patients with high blood pressure and other common conditions that may be effectively treated without prescription drugs.", "The medical center expects to save $200,000 or more by using a managed care contract to purchase radiation therapy services. Radiation therapy involves a series of treatments, which the center has historically paid for on a fee-for-service basis.

However, VA has much to do before it can set appropriate capitation rates. For example, while VA\u2019s RPM data show a wide variation in operating costs among facilities VA considers comparable, VA has done little to determine the reasons for these variations. Without such an understanding, there is no assurance that capitation rates can be set at the level that promotes the most efficient operation.", "Part of gaining a better understanding of facility or VISN cost variations must involve improving the information VA has on the operating costs of its hospitals. While the automated Decision Support System (DSS) that VA is implementing has potential to be an effective management tool for improving the quality and cost effectiveness of VHA operations, VA has not developed a way to verify the accuracy of the cost and utilization data going into DSS. Some of the data provided to DSS from other VA information systems are incomplete and inaccurate, limiting VA\u2019s ability to relay on DSS-generated information to make sound business decisions.", "It will take time for the new VISN directors to achieve significant savings. They have been in place for only a few months, so it is too early to tell how successful they will be in achieving increased efficiency. It will be important that VA implement clear mechanisms and useful management data by which to hold VISN directors accountable for workload, efficiency, and other performance targets.
