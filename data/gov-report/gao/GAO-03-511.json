In this report, the term \"investment bank\" includes not only securities firms but also those bank holding companies with securities affiliated or business divisions that assist clients in obtaining funds to finance investment projects. Since the activities identified in this report are the subject of ongoing and extensive investigations and litigation by competent authorities, it is not our role to determine the propriety of any of the parties' activities. To help the Congress better understand the activities of investment banks with respect to these companies we agreed to provide publicly available information on the roles investment banks played in designing, executing, and participating in certain structured finance transactions, investment banks' and federal regulators' oversight of these transactions, and the role that the banks' research analysts played with Enron and Global Crossing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Certain investment banks facilitated and participated in complex financial transactios with Enron despite allegedly knowing that the intent of the transactions was to manipulate and obscure Enron's true financial condition. The investment banks involved in the transactions we reviewed contended that their actions were appropriate and that Enron had not revealed its true purpose in obtaining their assistance. While investment banks are not responsible for the financial reporting of their clients, if it is proven that the investment banks knowingly assisted Enron in engaging in securities law violations, SEC has the authority to take legal action against them. Oversight responsibility for the investment banks' part in these transactions lay with both the banks themselves and the federal regulators. Investment banks told us that they had vetted transactions involving Enron through their risk management and internal control systems. Since Enron's collapse, these firms reportedly have been taking some steps to strengthen their internal controls, in part because they are now more sensitive to reputation risk. Federal financial regulators noted that before Enron's collapse they had not viewed structured transactions with investment-grade counterparties as particularly high risk in their exams. They subsequently are refining their approach to supervising structured transactions, and bank regulators now plan to include more transactions in their exams. Regulators are currently conducting targeted reviews of structured finance transactions at large firms and plan to develop guidance or best practices that clarify their expectations for sound control and oversight mechanisms. In the wake of the scandals, research analysts at investment banks who made favorable recommendations for failed firms have also come under public scrutiny. Investment banks allegedly pressured analysts covering Enron and Global Crossing to give investors favorable or misleading investment recommendations in order to keep or win lucrative work from the companies, creating serious conflicts of interest. Although the investment banks denied the allegations, several have been investigated by regulators and involved in litigation about conflicts of interest between their research and investment banking departments. Certain federal regulators and self-regulatory organizations have all adopted additional regulations addressing such conflicts. Although investment banks are not typically responsible for their client's accounting, it is a violation of law to facilitate transactions that an investment bank knows will materially misstate the client's financial statements. Since investment banks may be tempted to participate in profitable but questionable transactions, it is especially important that regulators be alert to this and be ready to use their enforcement tools to deter such actions. We are encouraged that investment banks and regulators are strengthening their oversight of the appropriateness of transactions, but it is too soon to evaluate the effectiveness of reforms."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The publicity surrounding Enron Corporation\u2019s (Enron) bankruptcy and  the effect on the company\u2019s stockholders and employees has generated a  debate on the activities of investment banks and their role in Enron\u2019s  collapse.

Therefore, in this report we discuss other client  relationships that investment banks had with Global Crossing, primarily  through their research analysts. Through the transactions we describe in  this report, investment banks facilitated complex structured finance  transactions, despite allegedly knowing that Enron would use deceptive  accounting and tax strategies. Complaints filed by the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) and individual investors also allege that,  through various transactions, Enron and its officers and directors engaged  in a scheme to defraud investors by inappropriately reporting the  transactions in Enron\u2019s financial statements and consequently  misrepresenting Enron\u2019s true financial condition.", "Investigations and litigation are under way in connection with both Enron  and Global Crossing, and it was not our objective to assess, nor should this  report be construed as assessing, the potential culpability of the parties  involved in the transactions discussed in the report.

The five transactions  we analyzed exemplify a variety of relationships that Enron had with  several different investment banks and were among those in which  investment bankers allegedly assisted Enron in manipulating its earnings,  but they were not those included in Enron\u2019s restatement of its financials  for the period 1997 through the second quarter of 2001. Although the  investment banks described themselves as passive investors in the  restated transactions, we did not confirm or refute their assertions to that  effect.

An SEC  official has stated that structured finance plays an important role in the  modern business environment and, when used properly, can provide  needed liquidity, funding sources, and investment opportunities and  facilitate risk dispersion. The official also noted that structured finance  transactions have at times been used inappropriately to achieve a specific  accounting or tax result. Sometimes this inappropriate use has been  achieved by violating existing regulations or accounting standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Special Purpose Entities", "paragraphs": ["In the ordinary course of business, many companies use a variety of  structured financings that involve SPEs to access capital or hedge risk.  An SPE is a legal entity created by another entity (a sponsor) to carry out a  specified purpose or activity, such as to consummate a specific  transaction or series of transactions with a narrowly defined purpose.  SPEs are often used as a financing vehicle that allows a sponsor entity to  transfer assets to the SPE in exchange for cash or other assets the SPE  obtains by issuing debt, equity, or both, to third-party lenders or investors.  Originators of financial assets such as mortgages and consumer credit  have used SPEs extensively; at the end of 2001, such SPEs held over $2  trillion in assets. For example, a sponsor entity could transfer accounts  receivable from credit-card holders into an SPE in exchange for cash. In  this example, the SPE would obtain the cash by issuing securities backed  by the accounts receivable. SPEs may also be established to acquire,  construct, or manufacture assets the sponsor entity uses through leases,  management contracts, or other arrangements. For example, a sponsor  entity could establish an SPE to construct a power plant that was financed  through debt issued by the SPE.", "An SPE may take many different forms, including a corporation,  partnership, limited liability company, or trust. When the entity is  properly structured, an SPE\u2019s assets may be legally separate from those of  its sponsor, protecting the SPE\u2019s assets from the risk of the sponsor\u2019s  bankruptcy. This arrangement often reduces credit or other risks for  lenders and investors and thus lowers financing costs for the sponsor.  SPEs may also create certain tax advantages for the participating parties.", "Under generally accepted accounting principles and Financial Accounting  Standards Board guidance, SPEs meeting certain criteria do not appear on  the balance sheet of the sponsoring entity. Thus, transactions that provide  financing involving SPEs can be structured so that the assets and liabilities  transferred to an unconsolidated SPE can be removed from the sponsor\u2019s  financial statements. Whether an SPE is consolidated with another entity  is a matter of judgment that involves an assessment of the risks and  rewards of ownership, as well as control over the SPE\u2019s activities. This is  important, because an entity could materially misstate its own financial  statements by, for example, understating its debt or overstating its sales if  it does not properly account for ownership in an SPE. Even though a  sponsor of an SPE might not be required to consolidate the assets and  liabilities of an SPE in its financial statements, the sponsor is required to  either recognize in its financial statements or disclose in the footnotes to  its financial statements the nature of its involvement with the SPE; the  purpose, size, and activities of the SPE; and the maximum exposure to loss  as a result of its involvement with the SPE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Sales of Financial Assets", "paragraphs": ["Ownership interests in an entity, including an SPE, are considered  financial assets. When assets of this type are sold or transferred to another  entity, Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 140, Accounting for  Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of  Liabilities, provides the accounting guidance related to the transaction.  In general, when an entity surrenders control of a transferred financial  asset, a sale can be recognized. For a sale to occur, the transferred asset  should be isolated from the transferring entity and its creditors, and the  entity receiving the asset has the right to pledge the asset as collateral or  to sell it. Further, the entity transferring the asset is not allowed to  maintain control of the asset through any agreement that entitles and  obligates it to repurchase the asset. If a transfer of financial assets in  exchange for cash or other consideration does not meet the criteria for a  sale, then the entity transferring the asset must account for the transaction  as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral, and the resulting  liability and the asset are reflected on the entity\u2019s balance sheet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prepay Transactions", "paragraphs": ["A prepay transaction involves a contractual agreement between two  parties that combines the economics of a debt obligation with those of a  forward contract, which is a contract for a service or product to be  delivered at a later date. Forward contracts, whether prepaid or not, can  be used to hedge against adverse price moves. For example, if two parties  enter into a forward contract to exchange 100 gallons of gas for $180  ($1.80 per gallon) in a month, the buyer of the gas is protected against a  price higher than $1.80 while the seller is protected against a price lower  than $1.80. In a prepaid forward contract, the payment for the gas is made  at the time of the contract but the gas is delivered in a month; this provides  immediate cash flow to the seller. If this prepay transaction is a loan in  substance and intent, its accounting treatment should be that of a loan.", "In the energy business, entities commonly enter into forward contracts for  the purchase or sale of a commodity.

The contracts are often entered  into based on an entity\u2019s assessment of market movements either to hedge  its position or to speculate on price. Some entities enter into energy  contracts for trading purposes and often settle them with cash rather than  a commodity. In accounting guidance, \u201cenergy trading activities\u201d refers to  energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits from  changes in market prices. The guidance states that determining whether  an entity is involved in energy trading activities is a matter of judgment  that depends not solely on the terms on the contracts, but also on an  assessment of relevant facts and circumstances related to the entity\u2019s  activities.

In other words:    The first legal element of aiding and abetting is the requirement that an  independent, illegal act exists to which the aider and abettor can be  attached. This independent illegal act or primary violation may be a  misrepresentation, omission, scheme to defraud, or fraudulent course of  business.", "The second element of aider and abettor liability is either actual  knowledge of the primary violation on the part of the aider and abettor or  recklessness. However, the law is ambiguous with regard to the level of  knowledge needed to prove aiding and abetting liability.

In SEC administrative proceedings, liability  may be based on less than actual knowledge of the violation.", "The third element of aiding and abetting, \u201csubstantial assistance by the  aider and abettor in the achievement of the primary violation\u201d has been  interpreted as meaning significant assistance to the representations of  others or to the fraud of others.

The form of Merrill Lynch\u2019s involvement was an equity investment that  would validate a sale by Enron, but it was reported that oral commitments  by Enron minimized Merrill Lynch\u2019s risks and ensured a specified return,  meaning that Merrill Lynch\u2019s investment was in substance a loan and that  therefore there was no valid sale. Publicly available reports describe a  transaction in which Enron reported a gain from selling an interest in  three power barges located in Nigeria to Ebarge, LLC (Ebarge), an SPE  Merrill Lynch created for this transaction. This transaction occurred 2  days before the year-end closing date for Enron\u2019s 1999 financial  statements. It was asserted that Merrill Lynch was not at risk for the equity  investment in Enron\u2019s barges because Enron officials made oral  guarantees to arrange for the resale of Merrill Lynch\u2019s interest in the  barges within 6 months, with a specified return to Merrill Lynch for its  involvement in the transaction. A publicly available Merrill Lynch  document related to this transaction indicates that prior to entering into  the transaction, Merrill Lynch received assurance from Enron that Merrill  Lynch\u2019s investment would be liquidated within 6 months. After attempts  by Enron to sell Merrill Lynch\u2019s interest in the barges to an independent  third party failed, an Enron-related party purchased Ebarge from Merrill  Lynch. Based on the sale price and fees received for the transaction,  Merrill Lynch received the allegedly promised return on its equity  investment. If, as asserted, Merrill Lynch did not have an equity risk in the  barges through Ebarge but instead had a credit exposure to Enron, then  Enron should have reported this transaction as a secured borrowing  instead of a gain on the sale of an asset, reducing the company\u2019s net  income and increasing its debt.

The Sundance transactions involved the  creation of an Enron-Citigroup joint venture that was allegedly designed to  ensure that Citigroup had no equity at risk. If Citigroup never had equity at  risk in these transactions, then the substance of the transactions was  secured borrowing that Enron should have reported as debt rather than as  a sale.

In these transactions, Enron received cash in  advance and promised to deliver a specific volume of oil or gas in the  future (or the cash value of the commodity). Enron accounted for these  transactions as energy trading activities and reported the prepay  transactions as liabilities from price risk management on its balance  sheet and as cash flows from operations on the statement of cash flows.  However, PSI and the bankruptcy examiner concluded that Enron\u2019s  accounting for the transactions was inappropriate because the prepay  transactions were in substance and intent loans, not trading activities, and  should have been recorded by Enron as debt. Reporting them as debt,  however, would have weakened some of Enron\u2019s key financial ratios, such  as its debt-to-equity ratio. Further, the cash Enron received would have  properly been reported as cash flows from financing activities on the  statement of cash flows and not as cash flows from operations. If it is  proven that the prepays were effectively loans, Enron\u2019s accounting for the  prepay transactions as trading activities could have misled investors and  analysts about the scope of Enron\u2019s trading activities and the nature of its  incoming cash flows. Publicly available Chase and Citigroup documents  indicate that the firms participated with other companies in prepay  transactions that, like Enron\u2019s prepay transactions, often involved an SPE  and no price risk. However, we were not able to determine if these  transactions involved circular cash flows like Enron\u2019s prepay transactions.  If the allegations that (1) the firms knowingly assisted Enron in engaging  in materially fraudulent transactions and (2) the firms\u2019 conduct provided  substantial assistance to the fraud are proven true, SEC would have the  authority to bring an action against them for aiding and abetting securities  laws violations.", "Publicly available reports describe prepay transactions among Enron,  Chase, and an SPE (Mahonia, Ltd.) that was created to undertake  transactions for Chase. In these transactions, Enron\u2019s accounting  treatment of the prepay transactions as trading activities was allegedly  improper because in substance and intent the transactions were actually  loans. One publicly available Chase document indicated that \u201cEnron loves  these deals as they are able to hide funded debt from their equity analysts  because they (at the very least) book it as deferred revenue or (better yet)  bury it in their trading activities.\u201d Between 1992 and 2001, Enron and  Chase entered into 12 prepay transactions with a combined value of over  $3.7 billion.", "In testimony given at a congressional hearing, in an interview with us, and  in documents supplied to us, Chase officials said that they understood that  Enron, with Enron\u2019s auditor\u2019s approval, had treated the prepay  transactions as trading activities. The officials contended that Chase  mitigated risk, as required by banking law, and that the risks of the  different transactions and hedges involved in prepays were different from  those of a loan. Chase provided us with excerpts from other companies\u2019  financial statements that described their prepays as a means of financing,  recorded as liabilities for price risk management. However, we have not  reviewed these transactions and cannot determine if they were similar to  Enron\u2019s prepay transactions.", "Another example of an Enron prepay transaction involved Enron,  Citigroup, and a Citigroup-created SPE, Delta Energy, that served as a  third party. The first of these Citigroup prepay transactions in 1993 was  similar in structure to the Chase prepay transactions. However, some of  the later Citigroup prepay transactions involving Delta Energy were  funded by bond offerings to qualified institutional buyers instead of by  Citigroup. By raising funds for the prepay transactions in this fashion, the  institutional investors rather than Citigroup were at risk if Enron should  go bankrupt or default. PSI and the bankruptcy examiner concluded that  Enron\u2019s accounting for these prepay transactions as trading activities was  improper, because in substance and intent the transactions were actually  loans. One publicly available Citigroup document discussing the approval  of an Enron prepay transaction indicated that Citigroup\u2019s \u201cinternal  approval for the transaction will acknowledge that  was  basically making a loan.\u201d PSI reported that between 1993 and 2001, Enron  and Citigroup entered into 14 prepay transactions with a combined value  of over $4.8 billion.", "Citigroup officials contended the transactions were done in good faith,  complied with existing law and prevailing standards of the time, and had  been reviewed and approved by their internal review committee.

Federal financial regulators saw these steps as positive but  noted that it was too soon to evaluate how well the new policies and  procedures would work. Federal financial regulators also responded to the  issues raised by the Enron collapse.

These policies and procedures are also used to  establish any conditions, procedures, or parameters applicable to the  transactions, new product or business line. The three investment banks  involved in the transactions discussed in this report all had internal review  and approval processes with independent control processes that were to  review transactions for their appropriateness. Control groups and  business unit representatives involved in the review process generally  operated by consensus. However, in circumstances where the business  unit wished to pursue a transaction despite concerns expressed by a  control group, senior management (management that is, at a minimum,  senior to the business unit directly interested in the transaction) could  exercise the discretion to approve the transaction.", "In speaking for several large investment firms, a representative of the  securities industry told us that all investment firms recognized that the  various processes and policies they have adopted for transaction review  and approval are fallible. However, these processes and policies were  designed not to police compliance by clients with accounting or disclosure  obligations, but to ensure that the relevant risks and issues presented by a  transaction or new product or business line are identified and evaluated by  the appropriate control functions. In their view, an investment-banking  firm generally is not in a position to perform an effective policing function  vis-\u00e0-vis its client for a number of reasons. First, investment banks  generally (underwritings present a partial exception to this general  principle) will not have access to financial or transactional information  that, although unrelated to the specific transaction under consideration, is  relevant to determining whether the client\u2019s disclosure for a transaction is  appropriate. Moreover, investment-banking firms are frequently not in a  position to make the relevant materiality determinations or to exercise  control over disclosure determinations. Indeed, these determinations are  made in many cases subsequent to the execution of the transactions. The  investment banks expressed the view that it is a client\u2019s senior  management, audit committee, and independent auditors who are in  possession of the information and decisionmaking authority necessary to  exercise an effective gatekeeping role. Therefore, according to these  investment banks, as a policy matter, these are the groups who should be  viewed, and who should view themselves, as responsible for performing  that role.", "The transactions that are the focus of this report were reportedly vetted  through the risk management processes of the investment banks involved.  For example, one investment bank told us that it had been engaging in  prepay transactions with Enron for about a decade and that it had closely  reviewed the initial transactions but not subsequent prepays, which were  not seen as a new type of transaction. The investment bank maintained  that because it had not reviewed the later transactions, it had not realized  the extent to which Enron had changed from an energy company to a  financial company over the years. Another investment bank told us that its  risk management reviews of the Enron transactions relied heavily on  Enron\u2019s assurances that the outside auditor for Enron had reviewed the  transactions and considered them appropriate. Representatives of the  investment bank also said that, in their view, the decision to approve the  transactions was appropriate given the information they had at the time.  But they added that if they had known then what they know now about  Enron, they would not have done business with the company. A securities  industry official told us that risk management decisions regarding the  Enron transactions failed not because investment banks did not have  internal control processes but because Enron did not provide these firms  with the whole picture.", "Representatives of some investment banks told us that after Enron\u2019s  collapse, their firms became more sensitive to risk management issues,  such as the possibility that some transactions could involve fraudulent or  questionable financial reporting on a client\u2019s part. Based on this  experience, some investment banks told us they had taken steps to  strengthen their risk management, although the processes themselves  remained essentially the same. For example, one investment bank created  a new policy review office to formalize and strengthen the firm\u2019s process  for examining transactions and products. According to the investment  bank\u2019s chief executive officer, the office is intended to help ensure that the  firm does not participate in transactions that its clients do not properly  disclose. The investment bank\u2019s management told us that their risk  management process would not presume that transactions with highly  rated large U.S. corporations were appropriate without asking more  detailed questions. Instead, regardless of the corporation\u2019s size and  reputation, the investment bank would require a closer look at all complex  transactions that could involve fraudulent or questionable financial  reporting. Investment bank representatives also said that accounting and  tax-driven transactions would now get a more thorough review.", "Representatives from another investment bank told us that legal and  accounting representations on some transactions would now be obtained  from outside sources. Representatives from yet another investment bank  said that, based on their negative experiences with Enron, they were now  willing to ask more questions about specific transactions. In August 2002,  this investment bank announced a new initiative as one of a series of  enhancements to the controls it imposes on the execution of transactions  that raise legal, accounting, or other reputation issues. This new policy  states that if the transaction would be materially significant for the client,  the investment bank will proceed only if the client commits to disclosing  the transaction\u2019s \u201cnet effect\u201d on its financial position.

First, the financial institutions have centralized the process  for establishing, using, and managing SPEs and conducting separate audits  of SPEs\u2019 activities. Second, they have strengthened their review and  approval processes for complex structured transactions in several ways.  For example, management reviews during the approval process now  include a broader range of senior managers from various areas of the  financial institution and focus more closely on assessing customer  motivation and appropriateness. In order to obtain a structured product,  customers are required not only to provide information on disclosures and  accounting treatment but also to comply with strict reporting standards.

The  purpose of the examinations was to ascertain facts, conditions, practices,  and other matters relating to conflicts of interest associated with the work  of research analysts. In October 2002, SEC, NYSE, and NASD announced  that they would work jointly with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office  and the North American Securities Administrators Association to bring to  a speedy and coordinated conclusion the investigations concerning  research analysts. NYSE and NASD conducted joint examinations of the  same firms separate from those examinations that they were conducting  for compliance with the new NYSE and NASD analyst rules on conflicts of  interest. SEC examination staff also participated in these examinations.", "A settlement in principle to resolve issues of conflict of interest at  multiservice brokerage firms was announced in December 2002, with 10  large investment banks agreeing to pay over $1.4 billion in sanctions and  agreeing to certain reforms. Among the reforms were an agreement to  sever links between research and investment banking, a ban on allocating  initial public offering shares to corporate executives and directors, an  obligation to contract with at least three independent research firms to  provide research to the brokerage firm\u2019s customers for 5 years, and the  hiring of an independent consultant (chosen by regulators) for each firm  with final authority to procure independent research from independent  providers. Additionally, the settlement would require each firm to make its  ratings and price target forecasts publicly available. The settlement in  principle is subject to approval by the SEC Commissioners.", "On February 6, 2003, SEC adopted Regulation AC (Analyst Certification),  which requires that any research report disseminated by a broker, dealer,  or certain associated persons of a broker-dealer include certifications by  the research analyst that the views expressed in the research report  accurately reflect the analyst\u2019s personal views and disclose whether the  analyst received compensation or other payments in connection with his  or her specific recommendations or views. The regulation also requires  analysts to provide certifications in connection with public appearances.  By requiring these certifications and disclosures, according to SEC, the  regulation should promote the integrity of research reports and investor  confidence in the recommendations they contain.", "According to SEC officials, SEC examination staff will continue to  examine for issues related to conflicts of interest involving research  analysts in future examinations.

With such creative  financing, two financial transactions can, for example, have identical  financial or economic outcomes but substantially different tax and  accounting implications. The appropriateness and presentation of such  transactions can hinge, among other things, on the actual purpose and  intent of the transactions involved. Designing, advising on, or participating  in such transactions can be lucrative for investment banks, which compete  vigorously for the business. In the case of Enron, the incentives to  participate in transactions to accommodate the client were strong: the  prospect of handsome revenues and the perceived risk-mitigating factor  that Enron was a large, prominent, investment-grade company whose  outside auditor had reportedly vetted the appropriateness of the  transactions. Given these incentives, the investment banks may have  reduced the weight attached to or overridden their risk-management  systems. These events illustrate that lapses in market discipline can create  significant reputation and legal risks and that adequate due diligence is  always necessary, regardless of the sophistication or prominence of the  counterparties.", "Although investment banks have primary responsibility to practice  prudent risk management procedures, prudent procedures do not  guarantee prudent practices. The events surrounding Enron\u2019s collapse  demonstrate the importance of regulatory oversight in identifying and  promptly correcting weaknesses in risk management practices. Prior to  Enron\u2019s collapse, federal financial regulators had not identified the lapses  in investment banks\u2019 risk management practices and the threats reputation  and legal risks posed to firms involved in complex structured transactions  with Enron. Federal financial regulators placed significantly more  emphasis on the regulated firms\u2019 risk of material loss from traditional  risks, such as counterparty default, than they did on less quantifiable  factors such as reputation or legal risk. We are encouraged that investment  banks are beginning to strengthen their risk management practices by,  among other things, gaining additional assurances of the underlying intent  behind and the anticipated accounting treatment and presentation of  complex structured finance transactions they facilitate for their clients.  The purpose and intent behind these complex structured transactions  must be properly understood and transparent. Now, federal financial  regulators need to determine whether these safeguards will be sufficient  and develop a means not only to ensure that the safeguards are  implemented properly and swiftly but also to take steps to more regularly  consider the reputation and legal risks associated with complex structured  transactions in future examinations.", "Accounting and auditing standards and securities laws recognize that an  entity\u2019s management is responsible for the fair and accurate presentation  of the entity\u2019s financial statements. Investment banks are not typically  responsible for their client\u2019s accounting. However, it is a violation of the  federal securities laws for investment banks to aid and abet complex  structured financial transactions that will materially misstate a public  company\u2019s financial statements, thereby deceiving investors and creditors.  SEC would have the authority to bring a legal action for aiding and  abetting a securities violation against an investment bank if the investment  bank knowingly gave substantial assistance to its client in carrying out a  violation of the securities laws.", "However, we have observed that a conflict exists among the courts about  the level of knowledge that SEC must prove to successfully bring an aiding  and abetting case. As previously discussed, in some courts the level of  knowledge must be actual knowledge, a difficult element to prove. In  other jurisdictions, the proof of reckless disregard for the truth is  sufficient. Depending on where the fraudulent conduct occurred or the  location of potential parties to the suit, SEC may not be able to  successfully pursue all cases that may involve potential aiding and abetting  violations. Since investment banks might be tempted to participate in  profitable but questionable transactions when successful SEC prosecution  is in doubt, it is especially important that regulators be alert to this  possibility and be ready to use the rest of their enforcement tools to deter  such actions.", "Another ongoing issue is the potential conflict of interest between  investment bankers and research analysts. The value and credibility of  research analysts\u2019 recommendations depend on the analysts\u2019 unquestioned  independence and objectivity in their research and resulting  recommendations. However, many factors can put pressure on an  analyst\u2019s independence and objectivity, including investment banking  relationships and compensation arrangements tied to investment banking  revenues. SEC, NYSE, NASD, the New York Attorney General, and other  states have taken actions to promote the integrity of research reports and  investor confidence in the recommendations contained in those reports,  but it is too soon to assess the overall effectiveness of these steps. In  addition, SEC, NYSE, and NASD are required to take further actions to  promote the integrity of research reports in compliance with the directives  of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We did not have sufficient public information to determine  the extent of investment bank involvement in the latter transactions.

This transaction occurred on December 29, 1999, 2 days before the  year-end closing date of Enron\u2019s 1999 financial statements, reportedly to  allow Enron\u2019s African Division to make its earnings target for the year.

Merrill Lynch provided  $7 million in cash to Ebarge for equity ownership. The remaining $21  million was obtained as a loan from another Enron entity that received no  interest payments from Ebarge. It has been asserted that Merrill Lynch,  through its SPE, Ebarge, did not have equity from the purchase at risk  because Enron officials made oral guarantees to arrange for the resale of  Merrill Lynch\u2019s interest in the barges by June 30, 2000, with a specified  return for Merrill Lynch for its involvement in the transaction. A publicly  available Merrill Lynch document related to this transaction indicates that  prior to entering into the transaction, Merrill Lynch received assurance  from Enron that its investment would be liquidated within 6 months. On  June 29, 2000, after Enron\u2019s efforts failed to sell Merrill Lynch\u2019s interest to  an independent third party, LJM2 Co-Investments, L.P., an Enron-related  party, purchased Ebarge from Merrill Lynch, which ended Merrill Lynch\u2019s  ownership interest in the barges. Merrill Lynch received fees and a return  on its investment that totaled $775,000, equaling the allegedly promised  return to Merrill Lynch for its involvement in the transaction. If, as  asserted, Merrill Lynch through its SPE, Ebarge, did not have an equity  risk in the barges but instead had a credit exposure to Enron, then Enron  should have reported this transaction as a secured borrowing instead of a  $12 million gain on the $28 million sale of an asset. This accounting would  have reduced Enron\u2019s net income and increased Enron\u2019s debt.", "Merrill Lynch officials contended that Enron proposed and structured the  transaction and also assured Merrill Lynch that its outside auditors had  vetted and approved its accounting for the transaction. Merrill Lynch  officials also contended that Merrill Lynch provided no accounting advice  to Enron and that Merrill Lynch in fact was at risk in the transaction  because, while Enron orally agreed to make a \u201cbest effort\u201d to find another  buyer for the asset, this promise was not a legally binding guarantee and  there was no guarantee that Merrill Lynch would receive a certain rate of  return.

The Caymus Trust purchase was funded by a $6  million cash equity investment by FleetBoston and a loan from Citigroup  for $194 million. Enron recorded a $112 million gain from the $200 million  sale of its ownership interest. It was reported that Citigroup assumed the  risks of FleetBoston\u2019s ownership through a total return swap and that  Enron assumed Citigroup\u2019s risk associated with the $194 million loan, also  through a total return swap. The effect of these agreements would indicate  that Citigroup held equity risk of $6 million, or 3 percent, of the $200  million purchase and that Enron retained the remaining risk associated  with the asset. However, it has been alleged that Citigroup, despite its  swap contract with FleetBoston, did not have equity risk for the $6 million  cash investment because Enron officials provided verbal guarantees to  Citigroup to ensure the repayment related to the $6 million investment.", "If Enron was in fact the only entity with equity risk, the prescribed  accounting treatment would have been to consolidate the SPE into  Enron\u2019s financial statements and to report the $200 million received as  debt, not a sale.

Subsequently, multiple loans and other contracts in the  amounts of $375 million, $1.039 billion, and $1.4 billion reportedly were  exchanged by various Enron-related entities.

The difference between these two amounts equaled approximately  the $375 million loan. Thus, it was reported that Enron would treat the  principal and interest payments on the 5-year and 1 day $375 million net  economic obligation as interest payments on the $1.4 billion loan, reducing  Canadian taxes by about $60 million and providing Enron with additional  financial statement benefits totaling about $65 million over 5 years.

However, some of the later Citigroup prepay  transactions involving Delta were funded by bond offerings to qualified  institutional buyers instead of by Citigroup (fig. 6).
