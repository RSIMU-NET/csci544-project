In April 2012, DOD reported progress increasing the number and capability of ANSF, with 7 percent of army units and 9 percent of police units rated at the highest level of capability. GAO has previously found the tools used by DOD and NATO to assess ANSF reliable enough to support broad statements regarding capability. However, issues related to these tools exist. When GAO reported on ANA capability in January 2011, the highest capability rating level was \u0093independent\u0094\u0097meaning that a unit was capable of executing the full spectrum of its missions without assistance from coalition forces. As of August 2011, the highest level had changed to \u0093independent with advisors\u0094\u0097meaning that a unit was capable of executing its mission and can call for coalition forces when necessary.

First, while the Afghan government and coalition partners agreed in May 2012 to a sustainment model for ANSF, with an annual budget of $4.1 billion, GAO has previously reported the Afghan government has limited ability to financially support its security forces and is dependent on donor contributions. Second, shortfalls in leadership and logistics capabilities in ANSF persist. Addressing such gaps is necessary to reduce ANSF reliance on coalition support. Finally, the Ministries of Defense and Interior\u0097which oversee the Afghan army and police\u0097continue to require coalition support to accomplish their missions. DOD has also reported these ministries face challenges, such as lack of expertise in human capital and problems with corruption. GAO has made recommendations to address these challenges, including addressing shortages of trainers. Since GAO made its recommendations, additional trainers have deployed to Afghanistan.", "As part of the overall transition of lead security responsibility to ANSF, starting in early 2012, the Army and Marine Corps began training and deploying small teams of advisors with specialized capabilities, referred to as Security Force Assistance Advisory Teams (SFAATs).

GAO\u0092s past work examining the use of training and advisor teams in Iraq and Afghanistan highlighted certain areas relevant to DOD\u0092s plans to provide SFAATs in support of the current mission in Afghanistan. For example, GAO found it is important that DOD assign officers and non-commissioned officers to advisor teams in a timely manner so they can train and exercise as a team prior to deployment. In addition, commanders need to set clear priorities between the advising mission and other operational requirements such as counterinsurgency operations.

Since 2002,  the United States and other nations have worked to develop the  capabilities of ANSF. In 2010, the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO), the Afghan government, and members of the  international community agreed to transition responsibility for the security  of Afghanistan from the international community to the Afghan  government by the end of 2014. In the past few months, NATO has  begun to shift the focus of its mission from combat to a support role more  focused on advising and assisting ANSF. According to NATO, a  successful transition requires that ANSF be fully capable of addressing  security challenges in Afghanistan on a sustainable basis. To support this  effort, the United States allocated $43 billion to build, train, equip, and  sustain ANSF from fiscal year 2002 to 2011, with an additional $11.2  billion appropriated in fiscal year 2012 and approximately $5.8 billion  requested by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for fiscal year 2013.", "To assist Congress in its oversight, since 2005 we have issued over 20  reports and testimonies focusing on ANSF.

Detailed information on the scope and methodology for our prior  work can be found in the reports we have cited throughout this statement.  For the purposes of this testimony, we updated data on ANSF size and  capability using DOD and NATO progress reports. We obtained the views  of DOD on this information and incorporated the Department\u2019s comments  where appropriate. We conducted the underlying performance audits in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

We previously reported that  DOD reported similar progress in 2010, achieving its interim growth goals  for the ANA several months ahead of schedule. Further, DOD noted that  increased numbers of ANSF were accompanied by increased capability  of these forces, reporting that 7 percent (15 out of 219) of ANA and 9  percent (39 out of 435) of ANP units rated as operating independently  with the assistance of advisors.on DOD assessments of the ANA and ANP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-standing Challenges May Affect Progress and Sustainment of Capable ANSF", "paragraphs": ["In April 2012, GAO issued a restricted report on the cost to build and sustain ANSF.", "ANP required approximately 8,300.

To that end, earlier this year, the  United States and coalition nations have begun providing specialized  teams, referred to as security force assistance advisory teams (SFAATs),  to provide leadership and expertise to ANSF personnel and units. At the  same time, overall U.S. troop levels are planned to draw down from about  87,000 as of the end of March 2012, to approximately 68,000 by the end  of September 2012.", "Mentoring, advising, and partnering with ANSF units has been a key part  of NATO\u2019s mission in Afghanistan. For the U.S. contribution, DOD has  used a variety of approaches to provide U.S. forces to carry out the  advise and assist mission, including forming individual training teams as  well as augmenting existing brigade combat teams with additional  personnel to serve as advisors. Starting in early 2012, the Army and  Marine Corps began training and deploying small teams of advisors with  specialized capabilities, or SFAATs. These teams will be located  throughout Afghanistan and are comprised of officers and senior-grade  non-commissioned officers. They will work with ANSF personnel from the  headquarters to the battalion level and advise and assist in areas such as  command and control, intelligence, and logistics. In addition, the SFAATs  will work with the ground commander to arrange for these units to provide  any necessary support to ANSF units such as fire support or medical  assistance. To initially provide these teams, the Army and Marine Corps  in some cases created these teams by drawing personnel from units that  had already deployed to Afghanistan. In other cases, they created teams  by drawing personnel from U.S. based units. As the Army and Marine  Corps plan to provide additional teams of advisors for future deployments,  they are exploring whether to use the same approaches or other options  for organizing and deploying these personnel. In addition, coalition  nations are expected to provide a number of similar advisor teams.", "Our past work examining the use of training teams and advisor teams in  Iraq and Afghanistan highlighted certain areas that we believe are  relevant to DOD\u2019s plans to provide the SFAATs in support of the current  mission in Afghanistan. For example, our recent work focused on the  Army, which in 2009 shifted its approach and began replacing individual  training teams with brigade combat teams augmented with advisor  personnel. Specifically, we identified challenges related to the sourcing  and training of personnel, balancing missions, defining command and  control relationships, and providing support to advisor personnel once  deployed.", "Sourcing and training of advisor personnel. Neither the training teams  nor the augments provided to the Army\u2019s brigade combat teams  existed in any of the services\u2019 doctrinal structures. Instead, they were  typically sourced with personnel who were identified individually, and  generally consisted of company and field-grade officers and senior  non-commissioned officers who were taken from other units. We  found that DOD faced some difficulty in providing the required field  grade officers or specialized capabilities to these teams, because of  widespread demand for these personnel, whose numbers were  already in short supply. In addition, DOD faced challenges getting  personnel assigned to advisor teams in a timely manner, limiting their  ability to train and exercise as a team prior to deployment.", "Balancing advising activities with other missions. We found that units  in Afghanistan faced some challenges because commanders did not  always set clear priorities between the advising mission and other  operational requirements, such as counterinsurgency operations or  performing missions such as conducting checkpoints. As a result, in  kinetic combat environments, commanders prioritized the combat  mission and directed their resources accordingly.", "Defining command-and-control relationships. Theater commanders  did not always provide clear guidance on command and control  structures for the advisors. In some cases, the lack of clarity on  command relationships between brigades and advisor teams led to  the reassignment of advisors to the control of a division or a brigade  that they had not trained and deployed with.", "Provision of support to advisor teams. We found that brigades in  Afghanistan sometimes faced challenges providing the necessary  support to advisor teams such as transportation assets, force  protection resources, and equipment because support requirements  had not always been clearly identified, these items and capabilities  were in limited supply and were, at times, also needed to support  combat operations.", "We made several recommendations to DOD to enhance the  Department\u2019s ability to support the advising mission, including clearly  defining the requirements for the number, ranks, and capabilities of  advisors, the relative priority of the advising mission, and the support that  advisor teams require. DOD concurred with our recommendations and  has taken some actions to implement them.
