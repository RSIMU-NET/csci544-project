Contracts using Recovery Act funds are required to be awarded competitively to the maximum extent practicable. GAO was asked to examine the use and oversight of noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts at the federal and state levels. GAO determined (1) the extent that federal contracts were awarded noncompetitively; (2) the reasons five selected federal agencies (the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Health and Human Services; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Small Business Administration (SBA)) awarded noncompetitive contracts; (3) the oversight these agencies and their inspectors general (IG) provide for Recovery Act contracts; and (4) the level of insight five selected states (California, Colorado, Florida, New York, and Texas) have into the use of noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["More than two-thirds of the $26 billion obligated for Recovery Act federal contract actions through May 2010 were on contracts that were in place before the enactment of the Recovery Act. Most of these contracts had been awarded competitively. For new federal Recovery Act contract actions, 89 percent of the dollars were obligated on competed actions. Most of the Recovery Act dollars obligated noncompetitively on new contract actions went to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses under SBA's 8(a) program. The goal of using Recovery Act funds quickly on high-priority projects drove the contracting approaches of the five federal agencies, particularly their use of existing contracts. Officials explained that whether an existing contract had been competed originally did not influence the decision to use a pre-existing contract because the level of competition had been established before Recovery Act funds were available. The selected federal agencies implemented additional review processes, internal reporting, and coordination efforts for the Recovery Act. Some IGs for these agencies focused initial Recovery Act oversight on areas the IGs considered to be higher risk than contracts, such as grant programs. The IG reviews to date have not focused specifically on contracting, including the use of noncompetitive awards to 8(a) program businesses. GAO's recent reviews of the 8(a) program, however, have found that safeguards for ensuring that only eligible firms receive 8(a) contracts may not be working as intended. The five states varied on the type and amount of data routinely collected on noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts. GAO could not determine the full extent to which such contracts are being used. The states generally rely on their pre-Recovery Act contracting policies and procedures, which generally require competition. The states do not routinely provide state-level oversight of contracts awarded at the local level, where a portion of Recovery Act contracting occurs. Officials from the selected states' audit organizations said that if they were to address Recovery Act contracting issues, it could be done through the annual Single Audit or other reviews of programs that involve Recovery Act funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the five IGs assess the need to allocate audit resources to noncompetitive 8(a) Recovery Act contracts.

A  portion of those funds is being provided directly to federal agencies, which  may award contracts and grants for their respective programs. Another  portion of Recovery Act funds is being provided directly to the states,  which in turn may award contracts or grants to businesses or local  governments. As of May 2010, $26 billion of Recovery Act funds had been  obligated on contracts awarded by federal agencies. The Recovery Act  provides that to the maximum extent practicable, federal agencies\u2019  contracts should be awarded competitively with fixed prices. Federal  agencies and their inspectors general (IG) were provided funding under  the Recovery Act to audit the act\u2019s programs and projects, including grant  and contract awards. States generally are expected to use competition to  the extent practicable when awarding contracts using federal funds. The  benefits of competition are well-established. It saves taxpayer money,  helps improve contractor performance, and promotes accountability for  results.", "You asked us to examine the use and oversight of noncompetitive  contracts awarded under the Recovery Act at the federal and state levels.  In response, we determined (1) the extent of Recovery Act funding  obligated by federal agencies on contracts, and the extent to which these  contracts were awarded noncompetitively, (2) the reasons selected federal  agencies awarded noncompetitive Recovery Act contract actions, (3) the  extent of oversight of Recovery Act contracting at selected federal  agencies, and (4) state officials\u2019 level of insight into and oversight of the  use of noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts within selected states. This  report first addresses each of these objectives, and then provides  additional data on federal Recovery Act contracting governmentwide in  appendix I and more detailed information about the approaches taken by  selected federal agencies in appendix II.", "To determine the extent to which contracts using Recovery Act funds are  being awarded noncompetitively by federal agencies, we analyzed  governmentwide data from the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next  Generation (FPDS-NG). We determined that the FPDS-NG data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review by comparing the  information for selected agencies with information from other sources,  including agency contract data and information in contract files at  selected locations. To determine the reasons that Recovery Act contracts  are at times not competed, we selected five agencies at which we  discussed the use of noncompetitive contracts and reviewed about 150  noncompetitive Recovery Act contract actions\u2014new contracts as well as  orders on and modifications to previously awarded contracts. We selected  these agencies based on the number, value, and percentage of  noncompetitive Recovery Act actions and obligations. Four agencies\u2014the  Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), and Health and Human  Services (HHS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA)\u2014are the four agencies that obligated the most Recovery Act funds  using noncompetitive contracts. The fifth agency\u2014the Small Business  Administration (SBA)\u2014had a relatively low amount of noncompetitive  Recovery Act actions and obligations but provided an example of how a  smaller agency carried out Recovery Act contract awards. At each agency,  we reviewed all Recovery Act contract actions awarded noncompetitively  at a particular contracting office, generally the one with the largest volume  of noncompetitive actions, to identify the reason each action was not  competed and the extent to which the reason was explained in the  contract file. To determine the extent of Recovery Act contracting  oversight provided by the selected federal agencies and their respective  IGs, we interviewed agency officials, including IG staff, and reviewed their  oversight plans and resulting reports.", "To determine the level of insight that state officials have into the use of  noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts, we selected five states\u2014 California, Colorado, Florida, New York, and Texas\u2014based on the amount  of Recovery Act funds reported as being awarded via contracts on  www.Recovery.gov and our goal of providing information on a variety of  geographic locations. For each state, we discussed with the appropriate  state officials\u2014including representatives from the governors\u2019 offices, state  procurement offices, and audit organizations\u2014the extent to which the  state has awarded noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts, the reasons  why the state did not use competition, and the level of oversight the state  provides for these contracts. Additionally, we discussed these issues with  representatives of the state agencies that manage the education and  weatherization programs, to obtain further understanding of how state  agencies award and oversee contracts. Because a large portion of the  Recovery Act funds received by the states is in the form of grants, which  are further distributed by the states to local governmental entities, we  discussed the extent of oversight the state provided over contracts  awarded by local governmental entities. We also attempted to identify a  statewide data source or database for sampling and evaluating state- awarded contracts with respect to competition, but were unable to  identify such a data source or database for any of the states in our review.  As a result, we relied primarily on testimonial evidence provided by state  officials. Details on our scope and methodology are contained in appendix  III.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2010 to July 2010, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act was enacted on February 17, 2009, to help stimulate the  United States economy by creating new jobs, as well as saving existing  ones, and investing in projects that will provide long-term economic  benefits. The Recovery Act requires that the President and heads of the  federal agencies manage and expend Recovery Act funds to achieve the  act\u2019s purposes as quickly as possible and consistent with prudent  management. In addition, the Recovery Act requires contracts funded  under the act to be awarded as fixed-price contracts through the use of  competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance for implementing the  Recovery Act and meeting \u201ccrucial accountability objectives\u201d of the act,  including, for example: timely awarding of Recovery Act funds; reporting  on the use and public benefit of those funds; and ensuring that those funds  are used for authorized purposes while mitigating the potential for fraud,  waste, error, and abuse.", "In addition to these objectives, OMB supplemental guidance also provides  other goals that agencies are to consider when using Recovery Act funds.  Among those goals are investing in efforts that will provide jobs and have  long-term public benefits, promoting local hiring, providing maximum  practicable opportunities for small businesses, and supporting  disadvantaged businesses. The guidance also identifies activities agencies  should consider to mitigate risks, including determining what contract  award methods will allow recipients to commence expenditures and  activities as quickly as possible; providing oversight for non-fixed-price  contracts that may be riskier to the government; and reviewing internal  procurement rules to promote competition to the maximum extent  practicable.", "Federal agencies using Recovery Act funds on contracts must take a  number of new steps related to the solicitation of offers and award of  contracts. For instance, to enhance the transparency to the public, the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended to require federal  agencies to publicize on www.fedbizopps.gov contract actions that will be  funded by the Recovery Act. The description on the Web site of the  supplies and services should be clear and unambiguous to support public  understanding of the procurement. After awarding a contract using other  than fixed-price or competitive approaches, federal agencies are also  required to publicize the rationale for doing so on the Web site. In  addition, federal agencies should use specific codes when entering  Recovery Act contract actions into FPDS-NG to indicate that Recovery Act  funds are being used, in whole or in part. The FAR was also amended to  implement the Recovery Act requirements that: only American-produced  iron, steel, and manufactured goods be used in Recovery Act construction  projects; access be provided for Comptroller General and IG audits and  reviews of Recovery Act contracts and subcontracts; and whistleblower  protections be provided. The act also requires the payment of at least  locally prevailing wages to contractor employees working on Recovery Act  projects, in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act.", "Federal agencies are generally required to obtain full and open  competition through competitive procedures when awarding government  contracts, unless an exception to competition applies. Some authorized  exceptions include when  the supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one  responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the  agency\u2019s needs;   the agency\u2019s need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and  compelling urgency that there would be serious injury if the agency were  not permitted to limit the number of sources; or    a statute expressly authorizes that the acquisition be made through  another agency or from a specified source, such as SBA\u2019s 8(a) program.", "In most cases, the use of noncompetitive contracting procedures must be  properly justified in writing and certified by the appropriate agency  official. The competition requirements that apply to federal agencies do  not apply to the states, each of which has its own contract competition  requirements.", "Additionally, purchases of supplies or services that are under certain  dollar thresholds (usually from $3,000 to $100,000) may be acquired  through the use of simplified acquisition procedures. These procedures  provide a streamlined approach to procurements as a way to promote  efficiency and economy in contracting. While full and open competition  procedures do not apply to simplified acquisitions, federal agencies are  still required to promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.  When using simplified acquisition procedures, federal agencies can solicit  from one source if they determine that only one source is reasonably  available.", "Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes SBA to create a business  development program to help small, socially and economically  disadvantaged businesses compete in the American economy, including  gaining access to the federal procurement market. This program, known as  the 8(a) program, authorizes contracting by using procedures other than  full and open competition, such as awarding sole-source contracts. Under  the 8(a) program, when the anticipated value of a contract is below the  \u201ccompetitive threshold\u201d\u2014$5.5 million for acquisitions involving  manufacturing and $3.5 million for all other acquisitions\u2014the contract  should be awarded on a sole-source basis to an eligible 8(a) business.   Contracts above the competitive thresholds can be awarded based on  competition limited only to 8(a) businesses when there is a reasonable  expectation that at least two 8(a) businesses will submit offers. Sole- source contracts of any value may be awarded to businesses owned by an  eligible Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation. Federal agencies are  not required to provide written justification for sole-source contracts  awarded under the 8(a) program, but regulations specify percentages of  the work that must be performed by the 8(a) business with its own  resources. The OMB Recovery Act implementing guidance encourages  federal agencies to take advantage of authorized small business  contracting programs, which may include the use of noncompetitive  contracts, to create opportunities for small businesses.", "The Recovery Act provided an unprecedented level of funding for  programs to be administered within the states at various levels. Recovery  Act funds are being distributed to states, local entities, and individuals  through a combination of formula and competitive grants and direct  assistance. Nearly half of the approximately $580 billion associated with  Recovery Act spending programs will flow to states and localities through  about 50 state formula and discretionary grant programs as well as about  15 entitlement and other programs. Some of the funds are passed from the  federal agencies through state governments to local governments, while  other funds are provided directly to local governments or individuals by  the federal agencies.", "As we previously reported, states are taking various approaches to ensure  that internal controls are in place to manage risk up front, rather than after  problems develop and deficiencies are identified. States have different  capacities to manage and oversee the use of Recovery Act funds. Many of  these differences result from the underlying differences in approaches to  governance, organizational structures, and related systems and processes  that are unique to each jurisdiction. To provide state-level oversight of the  use of Recovery Act funds, many states appointed an individual or team,  often in the governor\u2019s office, to provide overarching guidance and  monitoring for the state\u2019s Recovery Act efforts. Since many of the  programs and the processes and procedures used to implement them  existed before the Recovery Act funds were provided, much of the focus  of the state-level oversight efforts has been on the new aspects of the  Recovery Act, such as the new recipient reporting requirements and state  fiscal stabilization funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Largely Used Existing Contracts and Awarded Most New Recovery Act Contracts Competitively", "paragraphs": ["More than two-thirds of the $26 billion that had been obligated on federal  contracts through May 2010 was obligated on contracts that were already  in place before the Recovery Act.

For these orders  and modifications on existing contracts, the decisions to compete or not  compete the underlying contracts predated the Recovery Act.

For these contracts,  the decisions on whether to compete the contracts were made after the  Recovery Act was enacted. As shown in figure 1, most Recovery Act  dollars obligated on new federal contracts were on contracts that were  competed. The new contracts that were not competed consisted of  contracts awarded under the SBA\u2019s 8(a) program, contracts awarded using  simplified acquisition procedures, and other contracts that were awarded  under authorized exceptions to competition, such as only one source was  available or the requirement was urgently needed.

The act and guidance from  OMB and agency officials directed agencies to obligate Recovery Act funds  quickly, creating a sense of urgency on the part of contracting staff. As a  result, program and contracting staff identified programs, projects, and  contract vehicles that would allow them to obligate funds within short  time frames. Contracting officials at some of the agencies we visited told  us that they considered both the relative risks of using noncompetitive  contracting approaches and the benefits of obligating funds faster than  had they awarded new contracts using full and open competition. For  example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) chose construction  projects that could be executed quickly by issuing task orders under  previously awarded contracts with businesses under SBA\u2019s 8(a) program.  Further, contracting officials at USACE also noted that new sole-source  contracts to 8(a) businesses typically take about 4 months to award,  while a new competitive contract could take 12 to 14 months using full and  open competition procedures. As shown in figure 2, most of the Recovery  Act funds were obligated within the first two full fiscal quarters in which  rs in which  the funds were available for obligation.  the funds were available for obligation.", "Officials at several of the selected federal agencies explained that the use  of existing contracts allowed them to obligate funds quickly. Whether an  existing contract had been competed originally did not influence decisions  about which of these contracts to use since the level of competition had  already been established prior to the availability of Recovery Act funds.  According to agency officials, programmatic priorities and the availability  of contracts with the capacity to absorb and effectively use additional  funding were the predominant factors in choosing which existing  contracts received Recovery Act funds. Use of the 8(a) program to award  new contracts allowed agencies to quickly obligate funds without  competition as sole-source awards. For certain 8(a) contracts, such as  those below $3.5 million, sole-source is the default contracting approach  under federal regulations. Contracting officials at each of the federal  agencies told us that the 8(a) program allowed them to quickly obligate  funds on both new and existing contracts under $3.5 million and that the  noncompetitive nature of the contracts was viewed as a trade-off for  expediency and the ability to provide opportunities to small businesses.", "While speed was the primary driver agencies cited for using  noncompetitive contracting approaches, noncompetitive awards were also  used in a small number of new contracts that we reviewed when there was  only one source available for specialized equipment or a specific service.  For example, several National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract actions  we reviewed were sole-source contracts for specialized medical  equipment. In these cases, there was only one manufacturer that could  meet the requirements of the contract according to the documentation in  the contract files.", "At the five selected agencies, we found that all of the new noncompetitive  Recovery Act contracts that required documented justification and  approval for using other than full and open competition had such  documentation. For most new noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts,  specific documentation to justify the noncompetitive award was not  required. However, we found that 21 of the new contracts awarded as of  February 2010 at the five agencies we visited required documented  justifications. For these 21 contracts, the contract files included the  required justification and approval documentation for not using full and  open competition. Almost all of the justifications we reviewed authorized  a sole-source contract because there was only one responsible source and  no other type of supplies of services would satisfy the agency\u2019s  requirements. Among these, about half were for purchases of proprietary  parts or technology, and most of the others were contracts for utility  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Provided Varying Degrees of Additional Contract Oversight, While IGs Focused On Higher-Risk Areas", "paragraphs": ["The selected agencies added additional review processes, internal  reporting, and coordination steps in response to the Recovery Act. While  the measures implemented vary at each of the selected agencies, all have  created additional processes to increase management oversight beyond  their normal practices. IGs used a risk-based approach to target their  initial oversight efforts, and did not specifically target noncompetitive  contract actions because IGs did not view them as high risk. At most of the  selected agencies, IGs chose to focus on areas and programs they judged  to be higher risk, such as grant programs, which accounted for the  majority of Recovery Act funding. Alongside IG\u2019s individual efforts, the  Recovery Act also established the Recovery Accountability and  Transparency Board to coordinate among the IGs and provide additional  oversight."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Federal Agencies Implemented Varying Degrees of Additional Oversight for Contracts Awarded under the Recovery Act", "paragraphs": ["The selected agencies used existing processes to award and administer  Recovery Act contracts, but they also implemented a number of additional  measures intended to provide enhanced oversight. This added oversight  was in response to the specific requirements of the Recovery Act and  implementing guidance from OMB for greater transparency, speedy  execution of projects, maximizing competition in contracting, and other  priorities. According to agency officials, additional oversight measures  were put in place at the agencywide level, as well as within the agency  components that we reviewed.", "All five of the selected agencies created working groups, committees, or  other internal entities with the mission of coordinating each of the  agency\u2019s Recovery Act work. Most of these groups deal with a wide range  of Recovery Act-related implementation issues and included oversight of  contracting as one element of their work. Generally, officials said that they  meet on a regular basis\u2014such as monthly or weekly\u2014and provide a venue  for officials from across the agencies to provide management visibility into  Recovery Act programs, discuss problems that may have arisen, and  coordinate approaches by issuing formal or informal guidance. For  example, DOD created the Recovery Act Working Group to coordinate  implementation across the department. At weekly meetings,  representatives from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the  military services provide updates on the status of Recovery Act  obligations, projects in progress, relevant IG findings, and other issues.  Further, similar Recovery Act coordinating groups are in place within each  of the military services.", "In addition to their primary Recovery Act coordination groups, some  agencies also created additional subgroups to coordinate specific aspects  of implementation and oversight, such as contracting. For example, HHS  established an Office of Recovery Act Coordination to work across the  entire agency. As part of that function, HHS established a Recovery Act  Coordinators group to hold weekly meetings of key personnel from the  various agency operating divisions, allowing centralized collection and  distribution of management information.", "Most agencies reported that they also identified a single individual to take  managerial responsibility for implementation and oversight of Recovery  Act programs. For example, NASA created the Recovery Act  Implementation Executive position responsible for coordinating activities  throughout the agency related to the administration of Recovery Act  programs. Likewise, at DOD, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense in the Comptroller\u2019s office leads the Recovery Act Working Group  and is responsible for ensuring that the military services are properly  administering their Recovery Act-funded programs.", "Although the selected agencies reported that they awarded Recovery Act  contracts through their standard contracting processes, one agency  implemented additional pre-award reviews of contract actions. According  to NIH officials, NIH implemented an increased review of contracts  awarded noncompetitively, which allowed greater visibility into Recovery  Act contracts. Typically, NIH management reviews any noncompetitive  contract award over $550,000, but NIH procedures for the Recovery Act  require management review of all proposed noncompetitive contracts  prior to award. Across the five federal agencies, some provided additional  review in other ways, such as reviews of selected projects prior to the  contract award process. See appendix II for additional details on each  agency.", "Agencies increased the amount of internal reporting of Recovery Act  activities, including contracting. In combination with the coordination  groups discussed above, this internal reporting was intended to create  greater visibility for Recovery Act programs. Agencies increased the  amount of data provided directly to agency leadership on contract awards,  as well as the frequency at which these data are updated. For example,  DOE expanded an existing data system to provide more frequent reporting  and performance information to a larger number of users as part of its  approach to Recovery Act oversight. The system includes regularly  updated financial, earned value management, performance, risk, and job  creation data on DOE projects, which are available to agency officials  directly and through daily summary reports. Within DOD, USACE  established a weekly report to agency leadership on Recovery Act  contracting activity, showing obligations, project status, and other  information.", "The additional oversight processes and increased volume of funding under  the Recovery Act have put added demands on agency contracting staff,  which agency officials said was having some impact on their ability to  carry out their missions. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency  Board coordinated a survey administered by IGs of contracting and grant  officials at 29 agencies regarding the adequacy of contracting and grant  staffing levels. Some survey respondents said that staffing was  inadequate, while about half of respondents said that staffing was  adequate to meet Recovery Act needs but affected non-Recovery Act  work. Contracting officials at several agencies whom we met with in our  site reviews also reported that there had been an impact on their staff.  Officials said that staff had put in extra hours to meet Recovery Act  demands, and in one case said that attention to Recovery Act contracts  had led to delays on non-Recovery Act contract awards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most IGs for the Selected Agencies Did Not Focus on Contracts Because Other Areas Were Deemed Higher Risk", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act provided supplemental funding to IGs to support their  oversight of their agencies\u2019 spending under the act. Table 1 shows the  funding provided to the IGs for the five selected agencies.", "IGs for the selected agencies reported that they used assessments of the  relative risks, specific to their agencies and programs, of different  Recovery Act activities to target their oversight efforts. At three of the five  IG offices, these assessments did not result in a focus on contracting. The  IGs for all five agencies reported that they used a risk-based approach to  structuring their Recovery Act oversight work, but each considered  different factors in assessing risk. They all said that the amount of  Recovery Act funding received by their agency was a main factor in their  focusing on program areas or projects receiving the greatest funding. Most  Recovery Act spending was through grants not contracts. Other risk  factors used by some of the IGs included problems identified in previous  audit work, the level of experience of grant recipients, and contract  characteristics such as the level of competition and whether the contract  was new or existing. At three of the IG offices, the assessment results  showed that Recovery Act contracting was an area of lower risk relative to  Recovery Act spending through grants and loans. These offices devoted  only a small portion of their Recovery Act audit work toward it. For  example, HHS IG officials said that they focused on the agency\u2019s grant  programs, in large part because the amount of Recovery Act funding to be  spent by HHS through grants was much greater than the amount to be  spent through contracts. In addition, the HHS IG\u2019s prior findings showed  grants to be a higher-risk area. The officials said that they also took into  account the risks posed by increased funding under the Recovery Act. For  example, an HHS IG official said that they anticipated that some grant  recipients would have little prior experience with federal funds. As a result  of this risk assessment, the HHS IG conducted only limited work on  contracts. This work involved two reviews that looked at administrative  approvals and funding for a selection of contracts at NIH, and concluded  that no further reviews were needed. The IGs review their Recovery Act  audit plans periodically, generally on a semiannual basis, and revise them  as warranted.", "Contracting under the 8(a) program was not a focus for four of the five  IGs, who did not use the 8(a) status of a business as a factor in their  selection of contracts for review, and did not review 8(a) compliance  issues, such as 8(a) eligibility or limits on the amount of work that can be  subcontracted. The DOE IG and HHS IG did not review issues related to  8(a) contracts as a result of their risk assessments, because they did not  identify contracting as a high-risk area. DOD IG and NASA IG officials said  that they did not focus on issues related to 8(a) contracts beyond the 8(a)  contracts they encountered in performing their programmatic reviews, and  did not review 8(a) business compliance and eligibility. The eligibility  determination is an issue that is within the sole purview of SBA. The SBA  IG did review some 8(a) contracts and looked into the reasons specific  businesses were chosen. In one of the SBA IG reviews, the resulting report  did address the eligibility of two 8(a) businesses and determined that one  of the two businesses was not eligible for the contract award under the  8(a) program rules.", "We recently reviewed the process SBA uses to ensure that 8(a) businesses  remain eligible to continue participating in the program, and found  inconsistencies and weaknesses in the required annual review  procedures. For example, we estimated that SBA staff at five district  offices failed to complete the required review for 55 percent of 8(a)  businesses. In a separate review, we recently found that $325 million in  set-aside and sole-source contracts were awarded to businesses that were  not eligible to participate in the program. We also have identified issues  with respect to the use of 8(a) businesses that qualify as Alaska Native  Corporations. Specifically, we have found that agencies have not always  complied with requirements to notify SBA when 8(a) contracts with  Alaska Native Corporations are modified, or to ensure that the businesses  comply with limits on subcontracting.", "In contrast to the other three IGs, the DOD IG and NASA IG included  reviews of individual contracts as a central part of their oversight.  According to DOD IG officials, they chose their approach as a result of  their risk analysis. The majority of the department\u2019s Recovery Act  spending is through contracts for building construction and renovation.  DOD IG officials analyzed data on the services\u2019 planned projects and  decided which ones to review based primarily on the size, location, and  type of project. The DOD IG with the assistance of the military services\u2019  audit agencies\u2014the Army Audit Agency, the Air Force Audit Agency, and  the Naval Audit Service\u2014conducted coordinated reviews of the projects  identified through the initial risk analysis. As part of those reviews,  auditors gathered additional information on contract actions for the  selected projects, including whether they were issued as orders or  modifications under existing contracts, whether the contracts were  competitively awarded, and whether a surveillance plan was in place. In  addition, the DOD IG and military services\u2019 audit agencies collected  information on whether contracts for the projects they reviewed were  awarded to 8(a) businesses, but the officials said that they did not assess  business eligibility because this falls under the jurisdiction of the office  within SBA that administers the 8(a) program. However, DOD IG officials  told us that if they suspect that a business is not eligible for the 8(a)  program, they refer the matter to SBA for review. The only audit work that  directly focused on 8(a) businesses, other than the work of the SBA IG  noted above, is a review currently being conducted by the Air Force Audit  Agency, which is reviewing the eligibility of 8(a) contractors at 10 Air  Force installations. As of June 2010, the Air Force Audit Agency had not  yet issued its report.", "As of June 2010, 141 reports had been posted on www.Recovery.gov by the  IGs for the five agencies we reviewed. In 43 of the reports, the IGs touched  on contracting issues. Of these, 27 were reviews of projects at individual  DOD facilities issued by the DOD IG or by the military services\u2019 audit  agencies. Most of the IG reports that dealt with contracting did not identify  systematic shortcomings in agency processes or Recovery Act contracts.  Rather, contracting-related findings ranged from clauses omitted from  individual contracts to observations on the completeness of contracting  data reported by the agencies. For instance, the Air Force Audit Agency  reported in its audit of Elmendorf Air Force Base that while the base\u2019s  Recovery Act contracts met several requirements, such as expediting the  award process and fostering competition, they had not fully met  transparency requirements because the contracting office did not provide  sufficient information on the work to be completed for one project on  www.fedbizopps.gov.  According to Office of the Secretary of Defense  and Air Force officials, Elmendorf Air Force Base subsequently reposted  the project on www.fedbizopps.gov to more accurately reflect the work  accomplished.", "One IG report, however, noted significant shortcomings in agency  contracting workforce capacity. The SBA IG determined that staffing  levels in the agency\u2019s contracting office were insufficient. The SBA IG  found that because of vacant positions, contracting office staff declined  from 13 to 7 personnel from June 2009 to February 2010, at a time when  the office\u2019s workload increased as a result of Recovery Act  implementation. The report concluded that the current staffing of the  contracting office was insufficient to award, administer, and oversee  Recovery Act and other contracts, and that as a result, the risk of fraud,  waste, and abuse had increased. In our discussions with SBA on the  report\u2019s findings, a senior procurement official stated that the agency has  experienced further attrition in its acquisition workforce since this report  was released. To address this, the agency awarded a contract to provide  acquisition services for four contracting positions and plans to contract  for services for six more.", "For further information on how the IGs at each of the selected agencies  are conducting Recovery Act oversight, see appendix II."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States Vary In Their Level of Insight into Noncompetitive Recovery Act Contracts", "paragraphs": ["At the state level, we were not able to determine the full extent of the use  of noncompetitive contracting.

In the selected states in which state- level officials were aware of the award of noncompetitive Recovery Act  contracts, officials said those awards were made between government  agencies or to sole-source providers. For example, an agency in one state  contracted with a university to provide training, and an agency in another  state contracted with businesses that were the sole providers of  proprietary scientific equipment.", "Each of the five states provides oversight of the award of Recovery Act  contracts to varying degrees. According to officials, each state uses a  combination of policies and procedures that existed prior to the Recovery  Act and some additional measures to oversee these awards. Each state  supplemented its existing contracting procedures with new guidance and  had state agencies that realigned or hired staff to implement Recovery Act  requirements. State officials explained that under existing state  procedures, agencies are required to prepare justification documentation  and obtain approval before they award noncompetitive contracts. In  addition, state officials told us that generally state agencies are  responsible for oversight of contracts their agencies award, while local  entities have oversight responsibilities for contracts awarded at the local  level. For example, Colorado officials approve local agencies\u2019  procurement processes, but the local agencies acquire weatherization  materials on their own using a competitive bid process.", "Most Recovery Act funds to local governments flow through existing  federal grant programs, while some of the funds are provided directly to  local governments by federal agencies and others are passed from the  federal agencies through state governments to local governments.  Therefore, state officials have limited insight into contracts awarded at the  local level. In California, for example, state education officials said the size  of the state and its more than 1,600 local education entities made it  impractical to track local contracts. Nonetheless, officials in the selected  states can perform postaward reviews related to contract competition on  an as-needed basis.", "Officials in some of the states we visited said that they did not receive  additional resources to provide oversight of Recovery Act funds.

For  example, funding for weatherization programs, which increased from the  pre-Recovery Act level in the selected states, falls under the Single Audit  requirements. According to Florida state officials, their weatherization  program funding increased from about $1.3 million before the Recovery  Act to an average of $58.7 million per year over a period of 3 years. With  respect to noncompetitive contracts, the audit organizations for some of  the states we visited had not identified noncompetitive contracts as a risk  area and did not plan any audits specifically targeted at this contracting  method. Audit organization representatives in each of the five states we  visited said that they were in the process of conducting reviews of some  Recovery Act programs but the focus of these audits is not on  noncompetitive contracts; however, they also noted that these audits  could address procurement and contracting issues should they surface  during the course of the audits.", "At the state level\u2014unlike the federal level\u2014Recovery Act funds were not  specifically set aside for state audit organizations to provide oversight of  the use of Recovery Act funds.

In general, congressional and  administration direction to obligate Recovery Act funds quickly led  agencies across the government to rely heavily on existing contract  vehicles to get work under contract. Most of these existing contracts, as  well as most new contract actions, were competitive. Federal agencies  have added additional oversight procedures, internal reporting, and  coordination in response to Recovery Act requirements.", "Federal agency IGs focused their initial oversight efforts on areas they  determined to be higher risk and did not target spending under contracts,  including noncompetitive contracts. While this approach may have been  justified initially given competing priorities and the relatively small  percentage of obligations spent on noncompetitive contract actions, the  result is relatively little audit coverage of Recovery Act contract actions  under SBA\u2019s 8(a) program. This is significant for two reasons. First, the  8(a) program accounts for the overwhelming majority of noncompetitive  contract obligations under the Recovery Act. Second, our prior work,  some of which is quite recent and was not available to the IGs when they  prepared their audit plans, has shown that safeguards designed to ensure  that the program operates as intended\u2014requiring checks on participant  eligibility and limits on subcontracting\u2014are not always implemented  effectively. While we recognize that the Recovery Act guidance encourages  contracting with small businesses, there is an opportunity for the IGs to  reassess whether they need to focus additional audit resources on  contracting under the 8(a) program, which accounts for nearly 80 percent  of the new noncompetitive contract actions under the Recovery Act.", "At the state level, we were not able to determine the full extent of the use  of noncompetitive contracting. The five states we visited collected some  aggregate data on contracts awarded by state agencies, but did not  maintain data on contracting at the local level where a portion of the  contracting activity occurs. As a result, we could not analyze the extent of  noncompetitive Recovery Act contracting within these states. With respect  to oversight, each state has supplemented its state-level guidance with  some additional Recovery Act-specific policies and procedures but does  not routinely provide state-level oversight of contracts awarded at the  local level.

However, as your report states, we did not identify  contracting as a Recovery Act high risk area.  One of the primary reasons was that the  Department used a significant portion of its Recovery Act funds to award grants, with virtually  all of the remainder dedicated to accelerating approved scopes of work on existing contracts.  As  GAO notes in the Appendix to its draft, less than one percent of funding was devoted to newly  awarded contracts, including those awarded to 8(a) firms.

However, the draft report fails to recognize that this was  directly tied to delays in the Department\u2019s program start/scale-up.  As we have identified in  recently issued and several in-progress reviews, significant spending by the Department on a  number of major Recovery Act projects/activities had only recently begun.
