In April 2011, GAO reported that, as of January 2011, DHS's Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) contained a backlog of 1.6 million potential overstay records. DHS uses ADIS to match departure records to arrival records and subsequently close records for individuals with matching arrival and departure records. Unmatched arrival records--those that do not have corresponding departure records--remain open and indicate that the individual is a potential overstay. In the summer of 2011, DHS reviewed the 1.6 million potential overstay records. As a result, DHS closed about 863,000 records and removed them from the backlog. Since that time, DHS has continued to review all potential overstay records for national security and public safety concerns. However, as of April 2013, DHS continues to maintain more than 1 million unmatched arrival records in ADIS. GAO's preliminary analysis identified nonimmigrants traveling to the United States on a tourist visa constitute 44 percent of unmatched arrival records, while tourists admitted under a visa waiver constitute 43 percent. The remaining records include various types of other nonimmigrants, such as those traveling on temporary worker visas.", "DHS has actions completed and under way to improve data on potential overstays and report overstay rates, but the impact of these changes is not yet known. DHS has streamlined connections among databases used to identify potential overstays, among other things. Although these actions have resulted in efficiencies in processing data, they do not address underlying data quality issues, such as missing land departure data. Further, because many of these changes were implemented in April 2013, it is too early to assess their effect on the quality of DHS's overstay data. DHS continues to face challenges in reporting reliable overstay rates. Federal law requires DHS to report overstay estimates, but DHS or its predecessors have not regularly done so since 1994. In September 2008, GAO reported on limitations in overstay data that affect the reliability of overstay rates. In April 2011, GAO reported that DHS officials said that they have not reported overstay rates because DHS has not had sufficient confidence in the quality of its overstay data and that, as a result, DHS could not reliably report overstay rates. In February 2013, the Secretary of Homeland Security testified that DHS plans to report overstay rates by December 2013.", "DHS faces challenges planning for a biometric exit system at air and sea ports of entry.

In April 2011, we reported that DHS\u2019s efforts to  identify and report on overstays were hindered by unreliable data, and we  identified various challenges to DHS\u2019s efforts to identify potential  overstays, including the incomplete collection of departure data from  nonimmigrants at ports of entry, particularly land ports of entry, and the  lack of mechanisms for assessing the quality of leads sent to ICE field  offices for investigations. Since that time, DHS has taken action to  strengthen its processes for reviewing records to identify potential  overstays, including (1) streamlining connections among DHS databases  used to identify potential overstays and (2) collecting information from the  Canadian government about those exiting the United States and entering  Canada through northern land ports of entry.", "First, DHS has taken steps to enhance connections among its component  agencies\u2019 databases used to identify potential overstays and reduce the  need for manual exchanges of data. For example:  In August 2012, DHS enhanced data sharing between ADIS and  IDENT. This improved connection provides additional data to ADIS to  improve the matching process based on fingerprint identification. For  example, when an individual provides fingerprints as part of an  application for immigration benefits from U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services or a visa from the State Department, or when  apprehended by law enforcement, IDENT now sends identity  information, including a fingerprint identification number, for that  individual to ADIS. This additional source of data is intended to help  allow ADIS to more effectively match the individual\u2019s entry record with  a change of status, thereby closing out more unmatched arrival  records.", "Beginning in April 2013, ICE\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor  Information System (SEVIS) began automatically sending data to  ADIS on a daily basis, allowing ADIS to review SEVIS records against  departure records and determine whether student visa holders who  have ended their course of study departed in accordance with the  terms of their stay.

In  October 2012, DHS and the Canada Border Services Agency began  exchanging entry data on travelers crossing the border at selected land  ports of entry. Because an entry into Canada constitutes a departure from  the United States, DHS will be able to use Canadian entry data as proxies  for U.S. departure records. We have previously reported that DHS faces  challenges in its ability to identify overstays because of unreliable  collection of departure data at land ports of entry. This effort would help  address that challenge by providing a new source of data on travelers  departing the United States at land ports on the northern border. In the  pilot phase, DHS exchanged data with the Canada Border Services  Agency on third-country nationals at four of the five largest ports of entry  on the northern border. These data covered entries from September 30,  2012, through January 15, 2013. DHS plans to expand this effort to  collect data from additional ports of entry and to share data on additional  types of travelers. According to DHS officials, after June 30, 2013, DHS  plans to exchange data for third-country nationals at all automated ports  of entry along the northern border. At that time, DHS also plans to begin  using these data for operational purposes (e.g., taking enforcement action  against overstays, such as revoking visas or imposing bars on  readmission to the country based on the length of time they remained in  the country unlawfully).

According to federal law, DHS is to  submit an annual report to Congress providing numerical estimates of the  number of aliens from each country in each nonimmigrant classification  who overstayed an authorized period of admission that expired during the  fiscal year prior to the year for which the report is made. Since 1994,  DHS or its predecessors have not reported annual overstay rates  regularly because of its concerns about the reliability of the department\u2019s  overstay data. In September 2008, we reported on limitations in overstay  data, such as missing data for land departures, that affect the reliability of  overstay rates.

Beginning in 1996, federal law has required the implementation  of an integrated entry and exit data system for foreign nationals. The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required the  Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a plan to accelerate full  implementation of an automated biometric entry and exit data system that  matches available information provided by foreign nationals upon their  arrival in and departure from the United States. Since 2004, we have  issued a number of reports on DHS\u2019s efforts to implement a biometric  entry and exit system. For example, in November 2009, we reported that  DHS had not adopted an integrated approach to scheduling, executing,  and tracking the work that needed to be accomplished to deliver a  comprehensive exit solution. We concluded that without a master  schedule that was integrated and derived in accordance with relevant  guidance, DHS could not reliably commit to when and how it would  deliver a comprehensive exit solution or adequately monitor and manage  its progress toward this end. We have made recommendations to  address these issues, including that DHS ensure that an integrated  master schedule be developed and maintained. DHS has generally  concurred with our recommendations and has reported taking action to  address them. For example, in March 2012, DHS reported that the   US-VISIT office was adopting procedures to comply with the nine  scheduling practices we recommended in our November 2009 report and  has conducted training on our scheduling methodology.", "DHS has not yet implemented a biometric exit capability, but has planning  efforts under way to assess options for such a capability at airports and  seaports. In 2009, DHS conducted pilots for biometric exit capabilities in  airport scenarios, as called for in the Consolidated Security, Disaster  Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. In August 2010,  we reported on the results of our review of DHS\u2019s evaluation of these pilot  programs. Specifically, we reported that there were limitations with the  pilot programs\u2014for example, the pilot programs did not operationally test  about 30 percent of the air exit requirements identified in the evaluation  plan for the pilot programs\u2014which hindered DHS\u2019s ability to inform  decision making for a long-term air exit solution and pointed to the need  for additional sources of information on air exit\u2019s operational impacts.  According to DHS officials, the department\u2019s approach to planning for  biometric air exit has been partly in response to our recommendation that  DHS identify additional sources for the operational impacts of air exit not  addressed in the pilot programs\u2019 evaluation and to incorporate these  sources into its air exit decision making and planning. As of April 2013,  the department\u2019s planning efforts are focused on developing a biometric  exit system for airports, with the potential for a similar solution to be rolled  out at seaports, according to DHS officials. However, in October 2010,  DHS identified three primary reasons why it has been unable to  determine how and when to implement a biometric air exit solution:   (1) the methods of collecting biometric data could disrupt the flow of  travelers through air terminals; (2) air carriers and airport authorities had  not allowed DHS to examine mechanisms through which DHS could  incorporate biometric data collection into passenger processing at the  departure gate; and (3) challenges existed in capturing biometric data at  the point of departure, including determining what personnel should be  responsible for the capture of biometric information at airports.", "According to DHS officials, these challenges have affected the  department\u2019s planning efforts. In 2011, DHS directed its Science and  Technology Directorate (S&T), in coordination with other DHS component  agencies, to research \u201clong-term options\u201d for biometric exit. In May 2012, DHS reported internally on the results of S&T\u2019s analysis of previous  air exit pilot programs and assessment of available technologies, and the  report made recommendations to support the planning and development  of a biometric air exit capability. In that report, DHS concluded that the  building blocks to implement an effective biometric air exit system were  available. However, DHS reported that significant questions remained  regarding (1) the effectiveness of current biographic air exit processes  and the error rates in collecting or matching data, (2) methods of cost- effectively integrating biometrics into the air departure processes (e.g.,  matching arrival and departure records based on biometric information  like fingerprints rather than based on biographic information, such as  names and dates of birth), (3) the additional value biometric air exit would  provide compared with the current biographic air exit process, and (4) the  overall value and cost of a biometric air exit capability. The report  included nine recommendations to help inform DHS\u2019s planning for  biometric air exit, such as directing DHS to develop explicit goals and  objectives for biometric air exit and an evaluation framework that would,  among other things, assess the value of collecting biometric data in  addition to biographic data and determine whether biometric air exit is  economically justified.", "DHS reported that, by May 2014, it planned to take steps to address the  recommendations in its report; however, according to DHS Office of  Policy and S&T officials, the department has not yet completed actions in  response to these recommendations, although DHS officials reported that  DHS has plans to do so to help support development of a biometric air  exit concept of operations. For example, DHS\u2019s report recommended that  DHS develop explicit goals and objectives for biometric air exit and use  scenario-based testing rather than operational pilot programs to inform  the concept of operations for biometric air exit. As of April 2013, DHS  officials stated that they expect to finalize goals and objectives in the near  future and are making plans for future scenario-based testing. In addition,  DHS\u2019s report stated that new traveler facilitation tools and technologies\u2014 for example, online check-in, self-service, and paperless technology\u2014 could support more cost-effective ways to screen travelers, and that these  improvements should be leveraged when developing plans for biometric  air exit. However, DHS officials stated that there may be challenges to  leveraging new technologies to the extent that U.S. airports and airlines  rely on older, proprietary systems that may be difficult to update to  incorporate new technologies. Furthermore, DHS officials stated they face  challenges in coordinating with airlines and airports, which have  expressed significant reluctance about biometric exit because of concerns  over its effect on operations and potential costs. To address these  concerns, DHS is conducting outreach and soliciting information from  airlines and airports regarding their operations.", "DHS officials stated that the goal of its current efforts is to develop  information about options for biometric exit and to report to Congress in  time for the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle regarding (1) the additional  benefits that biometric exit provides beyond enhanced biographic exit and  (2) costs associated with biometric exit.
