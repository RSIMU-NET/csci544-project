For example, VBA established a new governance structure for the initiative that included senior management and involved all stakeholders, and it incorporated all critical areas of system development in an integrated master schedule. However, not all of SEI's management concerns have been addressed. For example, SEI advised VBA to ensure that stakeholders take ownership responsibility for the project, including the total system and process operating costs; however, although VBA is tracking costs incurred by contractors, it is not yet tracking and reporting in-house costs incurred by the project. Further, although the project has improved its management processes, such as establishing a process to manage and stabilize system requirements, it has not yet developed processes for capacity planning and management. This will be important for ensuring that further VETSNET development does not lead to delays and slowdowns in processing of benefits. In addition, although the project has established certain performance measures, it has not yet established results-oriented measures for productivity and user satisfaction, both of which will be important for measuring progress. Finally, the process improvements that VBA has incorporated in the replacement initiative remain in draft and have not been established through documented policies and procedures. If VBA does not institutionalize these improvements, it increases the risk that they may not be maintained through the life of the project or be available for application to other development initiatives. After more than 10 years of effort, including the recent management, organizational, and process improvements, VBA has developed critical functionalities needed to process and pay certain original compensation claims using the replacement system, but it remains far from completing the project. According to VBA officials, all five of the major software applications that make up the new system are now being used to establish and process new compensation claims for veterans. In total, the replacement system is currently providing monthly compensation payments to almost 50,000 veterans (out of about 3 million veterans who receive such payments); the system was used to process about 83 percent of all new compensation claims completed in March 2007. Nonetheless, the system requires further development before it can be used to process claims for the full range of compensation and pension benefits available to veterans and their dependents."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1996, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), a major  component of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), has been  undertaking a project to replace its compensation and pension benefits  payment system.

However, this system, which has been in  operation for more than 40 years, is based on antiquated software  programs, which have become increasingly difficult and costly to  maintain. VBA is in the process of replacing the aging BDN with a faster,  more flexible, and higher capacity system. When it began this project in  1996, which it generally refers to as the Veterans Service Network  (VETSNET), VBA had planned to complete the replacement system in  May 1998 at an estimated cost of $8 million.", "Over the years, we have reported on numerous problems that VBA has  encountered in completing the replacement system. Our prior work  found, for example, that the project was begun before VBA had fully  developed its business requirements, resulting in confusion over the  requirements to be addressed; in addition, VBA\u2019s software development  capability was too immature to ensure that the agency could reliably  develop and maintain high-quality software on any major project within  cost and schedule constraints. In 2002, we offered a number of  recommendations to improve managerial and program weaknesses,  including that VBA appoint a project manager; thoroughly analyze its  initiative; and develop a number of plans, including a revised  compensation and pension replacement strategy and an integrated project  plan. VA concurred with our recommendations, and as we last reported in  June 2006, it took several actions to address them. For example, it  appointed a full-time project manager, and the project team reported that  it had completed certifications of users\u2019 requirements for the system\u2019s  applications. Nonetheless, these actions did not implement all our  recommendations and were not sufficient to establish the program on a  solid footing: certain basic requirements of sound project management,  such as an integrated project plan for the replacement system, continued  to be lacking.", "In 2005, the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Under Secretary for  Benefits became concerned about continuing problems with the  replacement project and contracted for an independent assessment of the  department\u2019s options for the project, including whether the project should  be terminated. This assessment, conducted by the Carnegie Mellon  Software Engineering Institute (SEI), concluded that the replacement  project faced many risks arising from management and organizational  issues, but no technical barriers that could not be overcome. According to  SEI, a new system was still needed, and VBA would not be able to  successfully deliver a full, workable solution unless it addressed its  management and organizational weaknesses.

Compensation programs, which are based on  service-connected disability or death, provide direct payments to veterans  and/or veterans\u2019 dependents and survivors. These programs are not based  on income. Pension benefits programs, on the other hand, are income  based; these are designed to provide income support to eligible veterans  and their families who experience financial hardship. Eligible veterans are  those who served in wartime and are permanently and totally disabled for  reasons that are not service-connected (or who are age 65 or older).  Veterans are also eligible for burial benefits.", "Survivor benefits may be paid to eligible survivors of veterans, depending  on the circumstances. Some of these benefits are based on financial need,  such as death pensions for some surviving spouses and children of  deceased wartime veterans, and Dependency and Indemnity  Compensation to some surviving parents.", "Finally, certain benefits may be paid to third parties, such as individuals to  whom a veteran has given power of attorney or medical service providers  designated to receive payments on the veteran\u2019s behalf.", "Generally, VBA administers benefit programs through 57 veterans benefits  regional offices in a process that requires a number of steps, depending  on the type of claim. When a veteran submits, for example, a  compensation claim to any of the regional offices, a veterans service  representative must obtain the relevant evidence to evaluate the claim  (such as the veteran\u2019s military service records, medical examinations, and  treatment records from VA medical facilities or private medical service  providers). In the case of pension claims, income information would also  be collected.", "Once all the necessary evidence has been compiled, a rating specialist  evaluates the claim and determines whether the claimant is eligible for  benefits.

According to administration officials, the replacement  initiative is an in-house, contractor-assisted development effort, in which  three different contractors provide support for program management,  system development, and testing and validation of requirements.

In particular, the lack of an integrated master schedule for the VETSNET  project was a major concern articulated by SEI, as well as in our prior  work. An integrated project plan and schedule should incorporate all the  critical areas of system development and be used as a means of  determining what needs to be done and when, as well as measuring  progress. Such an integrated schedule should consider all dependencies  and include subtasks so that deadlines are realistic, and it should  incorporate review activities to allow oversight and approval by high-level  managers. Among other things, the program plan should also include  capacity requirements for resources and technical facilities to support  development, testing, user validation, and production.", "SEI was specifically concerned that releases with overlapping  functionality were being developed at the same time, with insufficient time  to document or test requirements; this approach constrained resources  and added complexity because of the need to integrate completed  applications and newly developed functionality. In addition, SEI observed  that the VETSNET program suffered from lack of sufficient test facilities  because it did not have enough information to plan for adequate capacity.", "In response to these project planning concerns, VETSNET management,  with contractor support, developed an integrated master schedule to guide  development and implementation of the remaining functionalities for the  replacement system. The VETSNET Integrated Master Schedule, finalized  in September 2006, includes an end-to-end plan and a master schedule.  According to VBA, the end-to-end plan documents the end state of the  project from a business perspective, which had not previously been done.  The master schedule identifies the necessary activities to manage and  control the replacement project through completion. The schedule also  describes a new software release process that provides more time to work  on requirements definition and testing, and allows for more cross- organizational communications to lessen the possibility of not meeting  requirements.", "In addition, the new release process includes a series of management  reviews to help control the software development process and ensure that  top management has continuous visibility of project related activities.  These reviews occur at major steps in the system development life cycle  (as described in fig. 1: initiation, preliminary design, and so on). Such  reviews are intended to ensure that the VETSNET Executive Team and the  VETSNET Executive Board agree and accept that the major tasks of each  step have been properly performed.", "Nonetheless, while the Integrated Master Schedule is an important  accomplishment, it may not ensure that the project sufficiently addresses  capacity planning, one of SEI\u2019s areas of concern. According to its  assessment, capacity requirements for the fully functional production  system were unclear. Capacity planning is important because program  progress depends on the availability of necessary system capacity to  perform development and testing; adjustments to such capacity take time  and must be planned. If systems do not have adequate capacity to  accommodate workload, interruptions or slowdowns could occur.  According to SEI, capacity adjustments cannot be made instantly, and  program progress will suffer without sufficient attention to resource  requirements.", "However, the VETSNET Integrated Master Schedule does not identify  activities or resources devoted to capacity planning. According to officials,  the capacity of the corporate environment (that is, corporate information  systems, applications, and networks) is being monitored by operational  teams with responsibility for maintaining this environment. According to  project officials, VETSNET representatives participate in daily conference  calls in which the performance of corporate applications is discussed, and  changes in application performance are reported to the VETSNET  developers for investigation and corrective action. Project officials  reported that when a performance degradation occurred in some  transactions during performance testing, it was determined that additional  computing capacity was needed and would be acquired. One reason why  the occurrence of degradation had not been anticipated by the VETSNET  project was that capacity planning had not taken place. Unless it ensures  that capacity planning and activities are included in the Integrated Master  Schedule, the replacement project may face other unanticipated  degradations that it must react to after the fact, thus jeopardizing the  project\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conversion Efforts Were Suspended as Advised, but Issues Remain", "paragraphs": ["In its assessment, SEI questioned VBA\u2019s approach to developing  functionality while concurrently converting records from the BDN to the  replacement system. It noted that VBA had chosen to complete software  development according to location rather than according to the type of  functionality. Specifically, in 2004, VBA began an effort to remove all  claims activity (both new and existing claims) at one regional office  (Lincoln, Nebraska) from the BDN to the replacement system, developing  the software as necessary to accommodate processing the types of claims  encountered at that site. The intention was to address each regional office  in turn until all sites were converted. According to SEI, this approach had  resulted in the development being stalled by obstacles arising from the  variety of existing claims. The contractor advised VBA to focus first on  developing functionality to process original claims and discontinue efforts  to convert existing claims until all the necessary functionality had been  developed, and the replacement system\u2019s ability to handle new cases of  any complexity had been proven by actual experience.", "In accordance with this advice, VBA stopped converting existing records  from the BDN and changed its focus to developing the necessary  functionality to process all new compensation claims. According to the  integrated master schedule, conversion activities are now timed to follow  the release of the needed functionality. That is, according to the schedule,  VBA plans to begin converting each type of record from the BDN only  after the necessary functionality for the replacement system has been  developed and deployed to process that type of record.", "In addition, the project is mitigating risk by resuming conversions  beginning with a test phase. Its strategy is first to convert records for  terminated claims\u2014claims that are no longer being paid. Conversion of  the terminated records will be followed by additional conversions of  records for claims receiving payment at Lincoln and Nashville (these two  sites are being used to test system functionality during development). The  VETSNET leadership will consider testing complete with the successful  conversion at these two sites.", "However, SEI raised three additional issues with regard to the conversion  of records that VBA has not fully addressed:    First, SEI expressed concerns that conversion failures could lead to  substantial numbers of records being returned to the BDN. Because of  differences in the database technologies used for the old system and the  replacement system, certain types of errors in BDN records cause  conversion to fail (according to SEI, approximately 15 percent of all these  records are estimated to have such errors). If records fail to convert  correctly, they may need to be returned to the BDN so that benefits can  continue to be paid. However, this process is not simple and may involve  manually reentering the records.", "Second, SEI observed that VBA was also depending on manual processes  for determining that records were converted successfully, including the  use of statistically random samples, and that it was aiming to ensure  correctness to a confidence level of 95 percent. However, in the absence of  a straightforward method for automatically returning records to the BDN,  SEI considered the 5 percent risk of error unacceptable for conversions of  large numbers of records.", "Finally, SEI observed that the lack of automated methods and the  complexity of the processes meant that conversions required careful  planning and assurance that adequate staff would be available to validate  records when the conversions took place.", "However, the VETSNET leadership has not developed any strategy to  address the possibility that a large number of cases might need to be  returned to the BDN during the testing phase. For example, it has not  included this possibility as a risk in its risk management plan. The absence  of a strategy to address this possibility could lead to delays in program  execution.", "Further, VBA has not yet decided whether a possible 5 percent error rate  is acceptable or developed a plan for addressing the resulting erroneous  records. If VBA does not address these issues in its planning, it increases  the risk that veterans may not receive accurate or timely payments.", "Finally, the VETSNET leadership has not yet developed detailed plans that  include the scheduled conversions for each regional office and identified  staff to perform the necessary validation.

According  to SEI guidance, defect management prevents known defects from  hampering the progress of the program. The management process should  include clearly identifying and tracking defects, analyzing defects to  establish their cause, tracking their disposition, clearly identifying the  rationale for not addressing any defects (as well as proposing  workarounds), and making information on defects and their resolution  broadly available. SEI\u2019s report stated that VBA needed to distinguish  defects from changes to requirements and develop a process for defect  management.", "To respond to these concerns and focus program management attention  on major defects, the VETSNET Executive Team, with contractor support,  conducted an audit of existing defects and revised the defect management  process. The audit of the defect database determined that the VETSNET  database used to capture software defects also included change requests;  as a result, work required to address processes that did not work properly  was not distinguished from requests for added or changed functionality,  which would require review and approval before being addressed. To  address this issue, the team separated defects from change requests, and a  new severity rating scale was developed. All open defects were  recategorized to ensure the major defects would receive appropriate  program management attention. Also, all defect categorizations must meet  the approval of the VETSNET Business Architect and are scheduled for  action as dictated by the severity level.", "Although these steps address many of SEI\u2019s concerns regarding VBA\u2019s  defect management process, more remains to be done before the process  is institutionalized. The Program Management Office has reported that  actions to revise the defect management process are complete, but the  process description is still in draft, and policies and procedures have not  been fully established.

In its report, SEI stated that although VBA was reporting certain types of  performance measures, it was not relating these to progress in system  development. For example, VBA reported the total number of veterans  paid, but did not provide estimates of how many additional veterans would  be paid when the system incorporated specific functionalities that were  under development. SEI suggested several measures that would provide  more evidence of progress, such as increases in the percentage of original  claims being paid by the replacement system, as well as user satisfaction  and productivity gains resulting from use of the replacement system  applications at regional offices.", "In response to these concerns, the replacement project has begun tracking  a number of the measures suggested by SEI, including  increases in the percentage of original claims being paid by the  replacement system, increases in the percentage of veterans\u2019 service representatives using the  new system,   decreases in the percentage of original claims being entered in the BDN  rather than the replacement system.", "Although these measures provide indications of VA\u2019s progress, other  measures that could demonstrate the effectiveness of the replacement  system have not been developed.
