Although private pensions are an important source of retirement income for many workers, millions of other workers have no individual pension coverage, which places them at risk of inadequate income during their retirement years.Since the 1970s, only about half of the nation\u2019s workers have been covered by private employer-sponsored pensions. Although it is difficult to predict whether any particular worker currently in the labor force will ultimately earn a pension benefit, at present only about 52 percent of retirees receive pension income. Over the past 25 years, considerable attention has been focused on modifying pension law, in part to improve coverage and ultimately retirement income adequacy, yet a significant portion of the workforce remains without pension coverage and the opportunity to earn pension income.", "A wide variety of further reforms have been suggested to improve pension coverage and benefits. You asked us to examine the issues surrounding pension coverage and benefit adequacy and what measures might improve the income prospects of future retirees. Accordingly, this report discusses the potential for reform of the private pension system to improve workers\u2019 pension coverage and benefits, and it reviews approaches other than the voluntary, single-employer-based pension system that might expand pension coverage and improve the retirement income of those workers likely to lack pensions.", "In conducting this study, we surveyed an array of literature relevant to the topic.

In addition, benefits from public assistance programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and health insurance programs, such as Medicare, may also be relevant in assessing the standard of living of the elderly. Pensions generally supplement Social Security, which has a progressive benefit structure that provides higher relative benefits to lower earners. As a result, although private pensions account for only about one-tenth of the aggregate income of the elderly, they are an important source of retirement income for many households, particularly those in the middle to higher ranges of the income distribution. Recent research suggests that about two-thirds of households nearing retirement have rights to some pension income, but these amounts can vary widely.", "The ability to earn and receive retirement income under a voluntary, private pension system is the result of decisions made by both the employer and the worker within a legal and regulatory framework that has developed over time. The Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, as amended, are the basis of pension law today. Employers make the decision to sponsor a plan and choose the features that it will include, taking into account that workers may have different preferences for pensions in comparison with other forms of compensation such as cash wages and health insurance. Workers also make numerous employment-related decisions over the course of their career, such as where to work, how much to work, and whether to change jobs, that can affect their ability to earn pension income. They also make decisions about how much to save for retirement and whether to preserve funds distributed from their plans. The result of employer and worker interactions in the marketplace is that not all workers will earn pension income and receive it in retirement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Employers Sponsor Pensions to Provide Tax- Deferred Income to Workers", "paragraphs": ["Among the most important reasons that employers sponsor pensions are the need to attract and retain a productive workforce and the tax advantages associated with pensions. Pensions can be a means of providing deferred compensation that may encourage workers to make a long-term commitment to the employer, thus reducing turnover and making for a more stable, productive workforce. But in deciding whether to offer a pension, companies must assess the nature of their particular workforce to determine if offering pensions is a necessary employment inducement. For example, some workers may view pensions as less important than cash wages or other benefits, particularly health insurance. For such workers, the employer may have little incentive to offer a pension. Employers also choose to sponsor pension plans because of the favorable federal tax treatment of pension contributions and investment returns. This tax treatment, particularly the deferral of taxation on invested income, is especially attractive to those facing higher marginal tax rates, such as some business owners and higher-paid employees, and can be an important incentive to sponsor a plan.", "Employers also consider the benefits of offering a pension plan in comparison with its overall cost. The major cost of the pension to the employer will depend on the contributions necessary to finance or fund the pension. Other costs involve the administration of the plan, such as record keeping, calculation of benefits, outside administrative help and advisers, communication with employees, investment management fees, and compliance with government rules and regulations. The result of weighing the benefits and costs of offering a plan is that not all employers will find it desirable to sponsor a pension plan. For example, compared with medium and large employers, small employers are less likely to sponsor a pension plan. Small businesses may face greater uncertainty, especially with regard to profitability, and may face cost pressures that can affect their ability to offer compensation packages that compare favorably with those offered by larger, more stable firms.

An employer may have one plan to cover a wide range of categories of workers, or it may have separate plans for different groups depending on business objectives. The employer is also bound by a federal rule on eligibility that covers all pension plans. Under this rule, a pension plan may exclude employees younger than age 21 or those who have less than one year of service from participating in the plan.", "Plans that seek tax-qualified status must also satisfy a set of \u201cnondiscrimination\u201d rules that seek to ensure that the plan design does not exceed certain limits in the extent to which it favors highly compensated employees in participation and benefits.

Under the typical formula used for defined benefit plans, the annual (or periodic) increment in benefits earned (benefit accrual) tends to increase over the worker\u2019s career with the employer, which makes this type of plan advantageous for workers who stay with one employer over their working careers. Under a defined contribution plan, the benefit accumulation each period may fluctuate over the course of the worker\u2019s career; frequently, however, such accounts are depicted in terms of an average or steady return over the worker\u2019s tenure with the employer, making the accumulation pattern more even in comparison with a defined benefit plan.

Defined benefit plans typically provide benefits in the form of an annuity, which provides benefits throughout the period of retirement, and generally have age and service provisions that determine when an employee becomes eligible for receipt of benefits. Employers may also allow their workers to elect to receive pension payments as a lump sum. Because defined contribution plans are not required to offer annuities, lump sum distributions are typical and raise concerns about whether pension benefits will be preserved throughout retirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pension Benefits Depend on Workers\u2019 Decisions about Work and Saving for Retirement", "paragraphs": ["The decisions that workers make also play an important role in determining how much pension income they will earn and receive in retirement. When a worker accepts employment, he or she accepts a compensation package that may or may not include a pension. Many workers may prefer cash wages or other benefits, such as health insurance, to pension benefits. The extent to which the worker values the pension component of compensation depends on many individual factors, including how aware he or she is about the need for future retirement income.", "Some workers also decide how long to remain employed by the plan\u2019s sponsor, and this decision determines whether they will earn pension income. Workers who stay with a plan sponsor for a number of years are more likely to meet the vesting requirements and to accrue benefits. For some plans, such as 401(k) plans, workers must also decide to participate, how much to contribute, and how to invest the assets in the plan.Workers who exhibit less attachment to the workforce may be less likely to become covered and participate in the plan.", "Even if a worker earns pension benefits, he or she must make decisions that determine whether these savings will contribute to their standard of living in retirement. When workers become eligible to receive distributions from a plan\u2014either preretirement or upon retirement\u2014they are faced with a choice of whether to preserve the distribution in a form that could provide income over their remaining lifetime, such as by transferring the funds to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or choosing an annuity. The option of cashing out a lump sum distribution from a pension plan without rollover to an IRA raises concerns about future retirement income. Lump sum distributions can have advantages, because they allow flexibility for workers who have high-priority needs such as medical treatment, purchasing a home, or investing in a business. Lump sums distributions may also make sense when the amount is small and can be invested more profitably elsewhere. The potential disadvantage of lump sums distributions is that the assets may not be preserved for retirement income, as would be the case with a rollover to an IRA or purchase of an annuity. However, the importance of the lump sum issue to retirement income adequacy is the subject of debate and continuing research. Some see a problem given the number of workers taking preretirement lump sums without rollover to an IRA. However, some research has concluded that the impact of this practice on retirement income is very small, since these workers tend to have small account balances. Other research shows that larger sums generally are preserved through rollover into an investment account and that the proportion of workers cashing out lump sums is declining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Workers Unlikely to Benefit under a Voluntary System", "paragraphs": ["Under a voluntary private pension system, the linkage between work, pension coverage, and the receipt and level of pension income in retirement is complex and depends on an array of factors, such as employer plan sponsorship and plan design, the framework of government rules, and worker decisions and choices over a lifetime. The result of employer and worker interactions in the marketplace is that not all workers will earn and receive pension income in retirement. Research suggests that some of the demographic characteristics of those who lack pension income in retirement are similar to the characteristics of workers who lack pension coverage during their working years. For example, those without pension income in retirement are more likely to be single, to be women, and to have low levels of education. But data on pension coverage are only a partial indicator of future pension receipt. The receipt of pension income involves factors that span a worker\u2019s career, and it is difficult to predict whether any particular worker currently in the labor force will ultimately receive a pension benefit. However, available research suggests that those who accumulate no pension income, or relatively low pension income, are more likely to include the following:   Workers employed by small firms. Compared with medium and large employers, small employers are less likely to sponsor a pension plan. As table 1 shows, the pension sponsorship rate drops dramatically as firm size gets smaller\u201486 percent of firms employing more than 1000 workers offer pensions, while only 13 percent of firms with fewer than 10 employees offer pensions. Figure 2 illustrates that worker participation in pension plans is lower for those employed by small firms.", "Workers employed part time or part year. Employers are less likely to provide pension coverage to part-time, seasonal, and contingent workers. For example, recent data show that about 60 percent of workers employed full time and year round have some form of pension coverage, but only 21 percent of part-time workers have pension coverage.", "Workers with low earnings. Low earners are less likely than middle and high earners to be offered a pension plan and participate when a plan is offered. As figure 3 shows, pension participation varies by earnings levels ranging from over 70 percent participation for the top earning group to about 30 percent for the lowest earners. For those who are participants, some plans that are integrated with Social Security permit a reduction in pension benefits for the lowest earners to offset their proportionally higher Social Security benefits.", "Workers who frequently change jobs over the course of a career.", "Even \u201ccovered\u201d workers who frequently change jobs can fail to accrue pension wealth for a significant fraction of their working lives owing to eligibility rules or to vesting rules and the resulting forfeiture of nonvested contributions or accruals. In addition, under defined benefit plans, the annual benefit accrual may be small relative to that for longer-service workers because of the age- and service-weighted features used in these plans. Finally, many plans provide for lump sum cash-outs of accounts or accruals, which often are not rolled into other retirement savings vehicles.", "Workers who place little value on saving. Some workers, either by preference or from lack of knowledge, may not be predisposed to saving or to committing to saving over the long term for retirement. The determinants of saving behavior are not completely understood, but it appears that inadequate retirement saving occurs at all income levels (see app. 2).", "Concerns remain about the ability of workers with these characteristics to earn pension income and receive it in retirement. The federal government has several policy tools to provide incentives for expanding pension coverage, and various reforms to pension rules have been enacted with the aim of protecting and improving pension benefits for workers.

Also, numerous proposals attempt to directly affect pension coverage and benefits by revising the framework of rules governing pensions. Past reforms to these rules, such as improved vesting, and trends in plan design, such as the enhanced portability and accrual patterns associated with defined contribution plans, suggest that more workers and their spouses could receive pension income in the future.

The success of tax incentives to encourage pension sponsorship has been questioned, however, in part because data show that only about half of the workforce is covered by a pension. At least two important factors may limit the effect that tax incentives provide for pension sponsorship. First, tax regulations limit employers\u2019 ability to direct tax preferences to the higher-paid employees who likely most value pensions. As a result, recent pension reform efforts typically have been aimed at relaxing these limits on pension tax preferences. Second, marginal tax rates have been lower in recent decades, which may have reduced the value of pensions to workers and thus the incentive for employers to sponsor or expand pensions.", "The progressive structure of income tax rates, that is, levying higher marginal tax rates as income increases, makes the benefits of the tax preference for pensions relatively greater for higher-income workers who pay higher marginal tax rates than for lower-income workers. Thus, this tax preference provides an incentive for owners and officers of firms to sponsor a pension plan for themselves and their higher-income employees. In turn, because sponsors may also want to provide pension benefits for other workers in the firm, and because pension law encourages plan sponsors to extend pensions broadly to their work force, these tax incentives may result in increased worker coverage. Some pension regulations, such as contribution limits and nondiscrimination rules, are designed to limit the use of tax preferences and to ensure that they do not benefit specific groups of workers, typically the higher paid, disproportionately; however, these regulations may reduce the incentive for employers to offer pensions. As these pension rules are made more stringent, the incentive may be further reduced. Relaxing limits and nondiscrimination rules is viewed by many employers as improving incentives to sponsor and expand plans. While such changes may lead to increased retirement savings by some workers, it is not clear whether they can significantly improve pension coverage and benefits for workers who traditionally lack pensions. Workers advocates may also view such changes as reducing the equity with which pension benefits are provided among workers.", "In addition, during the last two decades, marginal income tax rates have been lowered, which may have reduced the tax incentive to sponsor pensions. Reagan and Turner studied the pattern of marginal rates during the 1980s to determine whether decreases in marginal tax rates have reduced pension coverage. They found that, on average, a decrease of one percentage point in the marginal tax rate is consistent with a decline of 0.4 percentage points in the worker coverage rate.

Employers often argue that the burden of complying with pension regulations is excessive to the point of discouraging plan sponsorship, thus limiting the opportunity to increase coverage.", "The cost of sponsoring a pension plan can be an important deterrent to sponsorship in the small business sector. As a result, there have been calls for \u201cpension simplification\u201d to reduce the administrative complexity and cost of pensions while retaining the flexibility to design pensions that meet employers\u2019 needs. Proposed solutions generally involve reducing or eliminating various requirements with which sponsors must comply.Worker and public policy advocates, however, seek plan designs that improve worker coverage and benefits. Policymakers have sought to balance these competing demands by adopting reforms that reduce the legal and regulatory requirements on plan sponsors if they adopt specific plan designs that expand coverage to more workers and specify employer contributions.", "Two examples of pension simplification reforms are the creation of the Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) and the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE). Created in 1978, a SEP is essentially an IRA that an employer provides to each eligible employee. The employer is subject to minimal reporting requirements and is not subject to nondiscrimination rules. Although employers are not required to contribute to an employee\u2019s SEP, when employer contributions are made they must be distributed as a uniform percentage of pay to all employees.", "In 1996, Congress also instituted a new plan design, SIMPLE, that allows workers to defer a portion of their salary.

Surveys indicate that some small employers remain unfamiliar with the availability of simplified plan designs.

These multiemployer plans, in which participants can negotiate the plan characteristics, must be jointly governed by management and labor representatives. Since their inception in 1929, these plans have been advanced by labor unions and have developed a variety of benefit structures. Usually, multiemployer plans provide pension coverage to labor union workers from the same industry or trade. Although most are defined benefit plans, multiemployer defined-contribution plans do exist, and hybrid models have developed where the employer\u2019s contribution and the worker\u2019s benefit are both specified.", "Non-collectively-bargained pooled employer plans, or multiple-employer plans, also exist and are normally administered by a professional or trade association. For example, the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF) offers a multiple- employer plan organized around education and research professions. Employers, such as member colleges and universities, make contributions for their employees. TIAA-CREF offers a defined contribution plan, in which contributions are accumulated over a career and paid out at retirement, often as an annuity.", "Proposals advancing pooled employer plans would include both proposals that would facilitate collectively bargained plans and proposals that would advance development of professional and trade association plans. One proposal would create a model small-employer group pension plan with minimal administrative responsibilities. Other proposals would provide tax incentives to employers to encourage participation in pooled employer arrangements. Another proposal would make changes in income tax law to allow professional and trade associations to be treated as employers for purposes of sponsoring pooled employer pensions or health plans for their members.", "Advocates of pooled employer plans reason that both employers and employees benefit from the portability and trade focus of this arrangement. The portability of the plans improves worker pension receipt by allowing short-service workers to accumulate pension benefits with different employers. This portability diminishes the effects on pension accruals of company ownership changes and failures, because workers can continue to participate with new or reorganized employers. The trade focus enhances the advantages of portability, because even though workers may change employers, many stay in the same industry or trade. Similarly, employers benefit by having a pool of workers with previous work and training in their industry or trade, and pooled employer plans are likely to have pension features, such as early retirement provisions, to meet the needs of a common industry or trade. Advocates also note that workers in small business, in particular, could benefit from the pooled employer model because small employers generally have high rates of employee turnover and high business termination rates.", "By lowering the cost of administering a pension plan, pooled employer plans also offer employers a more cost-effective way of providing pensions to their employees. Because they provide economies of scale and reduce employer costs, such plans are easier for some employers to offer. Advocates note that pension administrative costs per employee are normally higher for small employers who have smaller numbers of workers over which to spread implementation and administrative costs. Pooled employer pension plans spread these costs over a larger number of workers.", "Despite these possible benefits, some pension experts have expressed doubt that pooled employer models can be widely expanded beyond current levels, because pooled employer plans are still dependent on voluntary employer action. They note that pooled employer plans have been available for many years, yet small businesses have shown little interest in them. Employers may be less likely to adopt pooled employer plans, because they have little control over plan design and are less able to assure that the plan meets their needs. Further, little evidence exists that proposals such as employer tax credits will lead to adoption of pooled employer plans by businesses without pension plans. Moreover, employers may have little incentive to choose a pooled-employer defined-benefit plan instead of a single-employer 401(k) plan, which also is portable and offers low administrative costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reforms to Create Universal Access to Retirement Saving Rely on Voluntary Worker Election", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that many employers do not provide pension plans to workers and that some employees with coverage need additional retirement savings, some analysts and policymakers embrace reforms to assure universal access to tax-favored retirement savings accounts such as IRAs.Although legislation has created different IRA types and provisions, workers generally establish IRAs outside the workplace.

Although an estimated 42 percent of households owned some type of IRA as of May 2001, evidence suggests that IRAs serve more as a parking place for distributions from other tax-qualified retirement savings plans than as accounts for active retirement saving.

Observers note that the low rate of IRA saving by low-income workers is not surprising in that low-income workers have the smallest amount of disposable income for saving.

Experts disagree about whether 401(k) plan accounts or IRA accounts have increased personal saving. They note that lower-income workers face lower tax rates and therefore benefit less from the tax-deferred nature of the accounts. In addition, these critics note that such plans shift investment risk to the individual and that lower-income workers have little investment management experience. Some are concerned that individual accounts could supplant existing private pensions, resulting in employers\u2019 feeling less need to offer traditional pension benefits and leading to a possible drop in national saving.

For example, the 1981 report from the President\u2019s Commission on Pension Policy recommended an advance-funded minimum universal pension system (MUPS). The commission recommended that employers establish pension accounts for all employees and contribute a minimum of 3 percent of pay annually. The MUPS proposal required immediate vesting and prohibited integration with Social Security. Under MUPS and other mandatory pension proposals, employers would be required to establish pension accounts and make contributions for workers. Another, more recent proposal required employers to provide uniform pension coverage for all employees in a given line of business but allowed for workers with income below a certain threshold to be excluded from employer-sponsored coverage and to instead receive their retirement income from the government.

Low- and moderate-income workers represent a disproportionate share of those without pensions, so mandating pension coverage would increase the retirement incomes of these workers, who generally lack retirement income other than Social Security. Because of the low rate of retirement and other savings, particularly for lower-income workers, some proponents of a mandatory pension system believe that mandating pensions would increase personal retirement savings.

Employees with current pension coverage could be adversely affected if employers chose to reduce benefits to the mandatory minimum. In addition, mandatory pensions could have negative consequences for employers, increasing employers\u2019 costs for pension implementation, administration, and contributions.

The intended effects of changing pension rules may be counteracted by the responses of employers and workers. As a result, additional reforms to the voluntary, single-employer-based system have only a limited ability to significantly expand pension sponsorship and extend coverage and benefits to workers who traditionally lack pensions.", "In considering proposals that move outside the voluntary, single-employer system, employers may find long-standing proposals, such as those that would expand pooled employer arrangements and mandate private pensions, unattractive in part because they may increase compensation costs. While raising the base level of Social Security benefits might be an effective means of addressing some of the concerns about lower-earning workers, such a reform would need to be considered as part of the broader Social Security financing reform discussion. Several pension- related proposals aimed at improving the availability and level of retirement income for lower-earning workers are similar in many respects to current proposals to introduce an individual account-based option into Social Security. The infrastructures of private pensions or Social Security could be modified to provide a universal, payroll-based opportunity to save for retirement. While many lower-earning workers may have difficulty saving out of current income, supplementing a worker\u2019s account through tax credits and contribution matches might increase saving incentives among those with low levels of income and retirement wealth.

Both receive a higher after-tax return from saving through a pension than they would have received in a regular taxable account. In both cases, the value of their pension accounts at retirement is greater than the value of their regular savings account at the time funds are withdrawn. This reflects the effect of taxes not paid at the time of the initial deposit in the pension account and taxes not paid on the earnings in the pension account over time. Despite the fact that both individuals have to pay tax on the value of the pension account when the funds are distributed, while no additional tax is owed on the funds in the regular saving account, both individuals gain by saving through the pension instead of the regular account.", "Table 3 also shows that the person with the higher, 28-percent tax rate benefits more from saving through a pension, compared with a regular savings account, than the person with the lower, 15-percent rate.", "The example in table 3 assumed that the lifetime tax rate\u2014when contributions are made, as earnings accrue, and when funds are withdrawn or distributed\u2014remains constant.

In other words, if the tax rate during a person\u2019s working life is higher than the tax rate during retirement, the tax benefits from pension saving will be greater. Conversely, if tax rates are higher during retirement than during a person\u2019s working life, the relative tax benefits are smaller.

In addition, about half of those retired (17.6 of 36.6 million) reported that they did not receive income from a pension of their own or from that of a spouse.

For example, those without pension income in retirement are more likely to be single, to be women, and to have low levels of education. However, it is not possible to predict whether any particular worker currently in the labor force will ultimately receive a pension benefit.

Typically, pension professionals suggest that a worker or family needs approximately 65 to 85 percent of preretirement income to maintain the preretirement living standard. The achievement of this level of income replacement depends significantly on Social Security and pension income and may require income from other sources, such as earnings from employment, home equity, and nonpension saving. Studies show that many workers need to save for retirement beyond the income they can expect from Social Security and pensions. Owing to the tilt of Social Security benefits toward lower earners, it follows that those in lower earnings categories generally need to save proportionately less than those in higher earnings groups to reach an adequate replacement rate.

This means that low retirement saving is not strictly a low earnings phenomenon: there are high earners with low retirement wealth and low earners with relatively high retirement wealth. Mitchell and Moore\u2019s results also suggest that although the need to save increases with higher earnings, when households are arrayed according to retirement wealth, those with the lowest wealth face significant risk of inadequate retirement income.Recent research by Engen, Gale, and Uccello provides a different interpretation of Mitchell and Moore\u2019s results, but their findings are consistent with the conclusion that there appear to be different preferences or propensities in the population for accumulating retirement wealth and that inadequate retirement income appears to be associated with low retirement saving by a segment of the workforce.."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Private Pensions: Key Issues to Consider Following the Enron Collapse, GAO-02-480T.
