The Army has not managed the program in accordance with those DOD policies and related guidance, including related federal and other best practice guidance, that are intended to reasonably ensure that a proposed system is the right solution to meet mission needs. Specifically, the Army has not economically justified its investment in TC-AIMS II on the basis of reliable estimates of costs and benefits. For example, the most recent economic justification included cost and benefit estimates predicated on all four military services using the system. However, two services (U.S. Department of the Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps) have stated that they do not intend to use it. The Army has not invested in TC-AIMS II within the context of a well-defined enterprise architecture, which is an institutional blueprint to control program investment decisions in a way that promotes interoperability and reduces redundancy among systems. The Army has instead focused on aligning TC-AIMS II with its logistics architecture; this means that even though TC-AIMS II is intended to be a DOD-wide program, it has been based on a service-specific architecture rather than a DOD-wide architecture. As a result, it may not properly fit within departmentwide plans. To its credit, the Army has largely managed the program in accordance with key policies and related guidance that are intended to reasonably ensure that the acquisition and deployment of a given system are handled in a manner that maximizes the chances of delivering defined capabilities on time and within budget. However, some aspects of this policy and guidance have not been followed. For example, the Army has not fully implemented risk management and has not adhered to a key feature of performance-based contracting. Reasons the Army cited for not following policies and guidance ranged from management inattention to lack of training. As a result, the Army, among other things, does not know whether the system is the right solution.

First, the contract for Block 3 (dated  Apr. 30, 2004) includes a statement of objectives that define the work to be  performed. For example, the contract identifies specific project tasks (e.g.,  establishing a Block 3 development help desk for system users) and  associated project management products (e.g., program management plan,  program schedule, and program status reports) that the contractor is to  perform and deliver, respectively, in accordance with the contract.", "Second, the contract includes performance standards (measures) that are  contractually required.

More precisely, the contract  does not provide for forfeiting all or part of the fee if the contractor fails to  perform as expected. Instead, program officials stated that their practice of  withholding the additional award fee when expectations are not met,  constitutes a disincentive. For example, they said that they withheld the  award fee for the contractor\u2019s first performance period (which totaled  about $900,000) because the contractor failed to develop two deliverables  on time (the program management plan and the performance metrics).", "We do not agree that this practice constitutes an effective negative  incentive because it does not penalize performance that fails to meet  expectations. Moreover, program officials told us that in the above  example, withholding the award fee was not a forfeiture, because it was  actually deferred to the second performance period when the contractor  had another opportunity to earn it. According to program officials, during  the second performance period, the contractor earned almost $780,000 of  the withheld fee from the first period by completing, among other things,  first period tasks.", "In the absence of specific negative incentives that are tied to intended  performance, the program is at increased risk of contractor  nonperformance.

Compounding  this uncertainty is the inherent risk of defining and developing this  multiservice system outside the context of a well-defined DOD-wide  enterprise architecture. Without this information, the Army cannot  currently determine whether TC-AIMS II, as defined and as being  developed, is the right solution to meet its strategic business and  technological needs.", "If these uncertainties are addressed and the Army demonstrates that  TC-AIMS II plans are the right course of action, the department largely has  the capabilities that are essential to successful system acquisition and  deployment, although there is room for strengthening its practices related  to risk management and performance-based contracting.", "It is vital that Army and DOD authorities responsible and accountable for  ensuring prudent use of limited resources first reassess whether allowing  TC-AIMS II to continue as planned is warranted, and that the decision on  how to proceed be based on reliable data about program costs, benefits,  risk, and status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to determine if continued investment in TC-AIMS II as planned  represents a prudent use of the department\u2019s limited resources. To  accomplish this, the Secretary of the Army should take the following three  actions:  collaborate with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Networks and Information Integration/Chief Information Officer, the  Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, and the Army Cost Analysis  Division to prepare a reliable economic analysis;  ensure that development of this economic analysis (1) complies with  cost-estimating best practices and relevant Office of Management and  Budget cost benefit guidance, (2) incorporates available data on  whether deployed TC-AIMS II capabilities are actually producing  benefits, and (3) addresses that the Air Force and Marines are not  planning to use the system; and  collaborate with the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics and the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) to ensure that TC-AIMS II is adequately aligned with the  evolving DOD business enterprise architecture.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretary of the Army to present the results of these analyses to the Deputy  Secretary of Defense, or his designee, and seek a departmental decision on  how best to proceed with the program.

For example, while DOD agreed that TC-AIMS II was originally defined and  implemented without a complete and formal enterprise architecture and  that the program had not identified the lack of a mature architecture as a  program risk, it stated that the program is taking steps to ensure alignment  to relevant enterprise architectures and is thereby mitigating this risk. In  addition, although the department agreed that the latest economic analysis  shows a negative return on investment, it said that other intangible benefits  not included in the analysis, such as improved planning and equipment  tracking, bolster the value of TC-AIMS II. Further, it agreed that the system  was originally envisioned as a single DOD-wide solution and that the Air  Force and Marine Corps are no longer intending to use the system, but  added that it was now evaluating whether these two services\u2019 existing  (legacy) systems should be enabled to share data with TC-AIMS II, rather  than be replaced in their entirety by a joint system as was originally  envisioned. According to DOD, the results of this evaluation are to be  considered at the next milestone review, which is planned for early to mid- 2006.", "These comments are largely consistent with our report. Specifically, the  report makes clear that DOD is managing TC-AIMS II in accordance with  some key practices and has efforts under way, such as those previously  cited, intended to bring the program into compliance with other key  practices. However, the report also points out noncompliance in areas  intended to provide sufficient information to determine how the TC-AIMS  II program should proceed. Accordingly, it contains recommendations to  ensure that the economic analysis is updated to (among other things)  reflect current operating assumptions, and that the program is adequately  aligned with the department\u2019s evolving enterprise architectures. It is  precisely because the program does not have this information that, despite  having invested $751 million over 11 years, the department does not know  whether the program as defined is the right solution to meet DOD-wide  asset deployment needs.", "DOD offered five detailed comments on our four recommendations. The  department\u2019s comments and our responses are as follow: 1. DOD stated that the TC-AIMS II program has used best practices and  followed all economic analysis requirements specified in relevant DOD  and OMB guidance, and has successfully passed milestone reviews at  which it was required to show costs and benefits for both the entire  system and its increments. In addition, the department stated that even  though its economic analysis showed a slight negative return on  investment, the system\u2019s intangible benefits bolster the program\u2019s  overall value. According to DOD, the program identified these  intangible benefits to obtain department milestone approval, and this  documentation was provided to us on October 31, 2005. This  notwithstanding, the department stated the program will (1) conduct,  in coordination with the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Program  Analysis and Evaluation, an analysis to determine the relationship of  TC-AIMS II and other programs, such as the Global Combat Support  System, that may provide similar functionality to ensure optimal return  on investment and (2) brief the Networks and Information Integration  Overarching Integrated Product Team in preparation for the next major  milestone decision review. It also stated that these results will be used  to justify further investment.", "We do not agree that the program has used all best practices and  followed all requirements specified in relevant guidance. In particular,  the Army did not economically justify its TC-AIMS II investment on the  basis of reliable estimates of costs and benefits and did not invest in  TC-AIMS II within the context of a well-defined architecture, both of  which are recognized best practices as well as DOD and OMB  requirements. In addition, while it is appropriate to consider intangible  benefits in economically justifying an investment, these benefits are not  in the economic analysis, and the separate document provided on  October 31, 2005, did not contain sufficient rationale and justification  for claimed qualitative benefits. Rather, the information provided was a  restatement of the quantitative benefits in the economic analysis.  Further, by stating that it is to conduct an analysis of the relationships  of TC-AIMS II to other programs that provide similar functionality and  use the results of this analysis to justify further system development,  DOD is recognizing that it does not have the information it needs to  make informed investment decisions. If done thoroughly, the analysis,  which the department committed to conduct, should help to inform  future program decisions.  2. Consistent with our report, DOD stated that TC-AIMS II was  established as a joint military service program. However, in explaining  why the Air Force and Marine Corps are not intending to use TC-AIMS  II, it added that changes to operations throughout the world since then  have necessitated changes to the services\u2019 deployment processes. In  light of this, the department stated it will evaluate other options for  data exchange among Air Force and Marine Corps existing asset  deployment systems and TC-AIMS II, instead of having all the services  use a single, joint system. Further, the department said it will have the  program, in coordination with Program Analysis and Evaluation,  develop an economic analysis for TC-AIMS II that is based on the  system being used solely by the Army and the Navy. DOD also  commented that our report assumed a positive cost-benefit impact  from including the Air Force and Marine Corps in the program.", "We support the department\u2019s decision to develop an economic analysis  that reflects this material change in the program\u2019s scope, which is what  we recommended. However, we would note that DOD\u2019s comments do  not explain how unspecified changes to operations throughout the  world caused unspecified changes to each of the services\u2019 deployment  processes, which in turn required DOD to have to interface multiple  service-unique systems, rather than adopting a joint system. We would  expect such an explanation to be an integral part of updating the  economic analysis, as will the costs of pursuing service-unique courses  of action.", "With regard to the comment that we assumed the inclusion of the Air  Force and Marine Corps would have a positive cost-benefit impact, we  do not agree. We made no assumption about the impact of the  program\u2019s scope on the cost-to-benefit or return on investment ratios.", "Rather, our point is that DOD policy and related guidance state that  programs should be economically justified by, among other things, cost  and benefit estimates that are based on realistic plans for the program\u2019s  scope. Such realistic plans did not exist because DOD\u2019s justification  was based on the four services using the system, when in reality the Air  Force and Marine Corps do not intend to do so. Relevant guidance calls  for updating economic analyses when significant program changes  such as these occur. Accordingly, we recommended that the  department follow this guidance to ensure it had adequate information  for informed decision making. 3. DOD commented that it has worked over the past several years to  develop an enterprise architecture and is on a path to fully defining and  effectively managing its enterprise architecture. It also said that it is  working to align TC-AIMS II with relevant evolving architectures. In  particular, DOD stated that Blocks 1 through 4 are aligned with the  Joint Deployment Operational Architecture and the program office  continues to work to align the program with the Joint Deployment and  Distribution Architecture, which it said is currently aligning to the  evolving Business Enterprise Architecture.", "We do not take issue with the comments that work has been and is  under way in this area. Our point is that the Business Enterprise  Architecture is still a work in progress and what has been available to  guide and constrain business system investments, such as TC-AIMS II,  has not been sufficient. Moreover, program officials told us that  TC-AIMS II has not been assessed against the Business Enterprise  Architecture because this architecture has not yet been completed.  Without a well-defined DOD-wide architecture that sets the context  within which such a joint military service system is to fit, and a firm  understanding of the extent to which TC-AIMS II, as defined, fits within  that context, the program office risks, among other things, acquiring a  system that does not meet DOD\u2019s strategic business needs.  4. DOD stated that while comprehensive mitigation and contingency  strategies were not developed for all of the 22 risks cited in our report,  the program office has subsequently developed strategies for them.  DOD also commented that subsequent risk management data, along  with evidence that risks are continuously reviewed and updated, was  provided to us on October 28 and November 3, 2005.", "We acknowledge that program officials orally stated that this had  occurred. However, we have yet to receive any documentation to  substantiate these statements.  5. DOD stated that while the current TC-AIMS II contract does not include  direct disincentives for contractor failure to meet performance criteria,  its semiannual award fee mechanism serves a similar purpose.  Nonetheless, DOD commented that it will address its award fee  implementation on future TC-AIMS II contract reviews.", "We do not agree that this semiannual award fee approach is an effective  disincentive because award fees are only being withheld when  contractor performance does not exceed certain targets; conversely,  direct disincentives penalize poor performance that falls short of  meeting contractually required levels of performance. Without direct  disincentives, the program is at increased risk of contractor  nonperformance, and thus taking more time and spending more money  than necessary to acquire contract deliverables and services. We  support the department\u2019s stated commitment to address this issue.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees.
