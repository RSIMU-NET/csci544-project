OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was reinforced by the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) in 2014. GAO reported in May 2017 that agencies had closed 4,388 of the 9,995 total data centers, and had plans to close a total of 5,597 through fiscal year 2019. As a result, agencies reportedly saved or avoided about $2.3 billion through August 2016. However, out of the 23 agencies that submitted required strategic plans, only 7 had addressed all required elements. GAO recommended that agencies complete their plans to optimize their data centers and achieve cost savings and ensure reported cost savings are consistent across reporting mechanisms. Most agencies agreed with the recommendations.", "Enhancing transparency . OMB's IT Dashboard provides information on major investments at federal agencies, including ratings from Chief Information Officers that should reflect the level of risk facing an investment. GAO reported in June 2016 that agencies had not fully considered risks when rating their investments on the Dashboard. In particular, of the 95 investments reviewed, GAO's assessments of risks matched the ratings 22 times, showed more risk 60 times, and showed less risk 13 times. GAO recommended that agencies improve the quality and frequency of their ratings. Most agencies generally agreed with or did not comment on the recommendations.", "Implementing incremental development . OMB has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver investments in smaller parts, or increments, in order to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. Since 2012, OMB has required investments to deliver functionality every 6 months. In August 2016, GAO reported that while 22 agencies had reported that about 64 percent of 469 active software development projects planned to deliver usable functionality every 6 months for fiscal year 2016, the other 36 percent of the projects did not. Further, for 7 selected agencies, GAO identified differences in the percentages of software projects reported to GAO as delivering functionality every 6 months, compared to what was reported on the Dashboard. GAO made recommendations to agencies and OMB to improve the reporting of incremental data on the Dashboard. Most agencies agreed or did not comment on the recommendations.", "Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings. Specifically, only two agencies had comprehensive license inventories. GAO recommended that agencies regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory and analyze that data to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform decision making.

This policy requires agencies to conduct an  annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software  licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve  significant savings government-wide. In particular, 22 of the 24 major  agencies did not have comprehensive license policies and only 2 had  comprehensive license inventories. In addition, we identified five leading  software license management practices, and the agencies\u2019  implementation of these practices varied.", "As a result of agencies\u2019 mixed management of software licensing,  agencies\u2019 oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking,  thus, potentially leading to missed savings. However, the potential  savings could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major  federal agency reported saving approximately $181 million by  consolidating its enterprise license agreements, even when its oversight  process was ad hoc. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue  needed guidance to agencies; we also made 135 recommendations to  the 24 agencies to improve their policies and practices for managing  licenses. Among other things, we recommended that the agencies  regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software  licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to reduce  costs and better inform investment decision making.", "Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments. As of May 2017, 123 of the recommendations had not been  implemented, but 4 agencies had made progress. For example, three  agencies\u2014the Department of Education, General Services  Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development\u2014regularly  track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses. In  addition, two of these agencies also analyze agency-wide software  licensing data to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform  investment decision making. The National Aeronautics and Space  Administration uses its inventory to make decisions and reduce costs, but  does not regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory. While  the other agencies had not completed the actions associated with these  recommendations, they had plans in place to do so. Table 2 reflects the  extent to which agencies implemented recommendations in these areas.", "In conclusion, with the enactment of FITARA,  the federal government has  an opportunity to improve the transparency and management of IT  acquisitions and operations, and to strengthen the authority of CIOs to  provide needed direction and oversight. The forum we held also  recommended that CIOs be given more authority, and noted the  important role played by the Federal CIO.", "Most agencies have taken steps to improve the management of IT  acquisitions and operations by implementing key FITARA initiatives,  including data center consolidation, efforts to increase transparency via  OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard, incremental development, and management of  software licenses; and they have continued to address recommendations  we have made over the past several years. However, additional  improvements are needed, and further efforts by OMB and federal  agencies to implement our previous recommendations would better  position them to fully implement FITARA.", "To help ensure that these efforts succeed, OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019  continued implementation of FITARA is essential. In addition, we will  continue to monitor agencies\u2019 implementation of our previous  recommendations.", "Chairmen Meadows and Hurd, Ranking Members Connolly and Kelly,  and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
