The SED utilized a standard prototypical design for new embassies and consulates along with a streamlined delivery method combining responsibility for design and construction under a single contract. Under the Excellence approach, OBO now directly contracts with design firms to develop customized embassy designs before contracting for construction. OBO officials believe that greater design control under Excellence will improve embassies' appearance in representing the United States, functionality, quality, and operating costs.", "Excellence consists of several key elements and involves trade-offs. For example, OBO now allots time and funding to develop customized designs and hires leading design firms to produce them. These design firms have faced initial adjustment challenges designing U.S. embassies, and OBO only recently began evaluating their performance as required by federal regulation. OBO's new approach poses cost and schedule trade-offs since, for example, OBO now has greater design control but may also be responsible if design problems are identified during construction. GAO's survey found that OBO staff who responded held split or conflicting opinions on Excellence compared with SED.", "While OBO has established guidance to implement Excellence, it lacks tools to fully evaluate the performance of this new approach. Performance measures are essential tools for managers to evaluate progress toward a program's goals, as noted in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government . However, OBO has not established performance measures to specifically evaluate and communicate the effectiveness of Excellence in delivering embassies. Moreover, OBO's bureau-wide strategic measures do not address Excellence priorities, such as greater adaptability to individual locations, functionality, or sustainability. OBO also lacks a reliable system to monitor operating performance, such as building energy usage, and a centralized database to broadly manage the Excellence program, to include effectively reporting on projects' design and construction costs and schedules. Without performance measures and reliable systems to collect and analyze relevant data, OBO cannot fully assess the value of shifting to the Excellence approach and away from the SED."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations that State take several steps to strengthen performance measures and reporting, monitoring mechanisms, and data systems for the Excellence approach.

More than 86,000  U.S. government employees are housed in these facilities. On August 7,  1998, terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar  es Salaam, Tanzania, killing over 220 people and injuring 4,000 others.  The ensuing Accountability Review Board found that unless State  addressed security vulnerabilities at U.S. embassies, U.S. government  employees would remain at risk from terrorist activity. In 1999, State  began its multiple-year Capital Security Construction Program,  administered by the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO),  which to date has received $21 billion, according to State. In  administering the program, OBO\u2019s primary goal was providing overseas  U.S. diplomatic personnel with secure, safe, and functional workplaces.  OBO sought to achieve that goal by using a Standard Embassy Design  (SED) approach that relied heavily on the use and site-adaptation of a  standard design for new embassies and consulates (both referred to  hereafter as embassies) and a streamlined delivery method combining  responsibility for final design and construction under a single contract.  OBO also intended that new embassies would be efficient, state-of-the-art  facilities. In 2006, we reported that by using the SED and a streamlined  delivery method, OBO had made significant progress in completing new  embassies and, on average, reduced the time required to complete  projects.", "In 2011, OBO replaced the SED approach with Design Excellence, now  referred to simply as Excellence, which makes use of customized,  individual designs for each embassy and emphasizes innovation.

That new  mission is \u201cto provide safe, secure, and functional facilities that represent  the U.S. government to the host nation and support our staff in the  achievement of U.S. foreign policy objectives. These facilities should  represent American values and the best in American architecture, design,  engineering, technology, sustainability, art, culture, and construction  execution.\u201d Some Members of Congress and others have raised concerns  that this new approach may result in embassies that take longer and cost  more to build.

Following the demise of the Inman program in the early 1990s,  State initiated very few new construction projects until after the two 1998  embassy bombings in Africa. Following those attacks, the Secure  Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 required State  to maintain a list of diplomatic facilities to be scheduled for replacement  based on their vulnerability  to attack. In response, State initiated the  Capital Security Construction Program to construct new, secure facilities  overseas. At that time, State determined that diplomatic facilities at more  than 180 posts\u2014more than half of U.S. overseas missions\u2014needed to be  replaced to meet security standards. In 2016, State reported that from  2000 through 2014, it moved over 30,000 staff into more secure facilities.", "The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999  calls for new diplomatic facilities to be sufficiently sized to ensure that all  U.S. government personnel at a post are located on a single secure site  and that those facilities are set back not less than 100 feet from the site\u2019s  perimeter boundary. Before constructing a new embassy, State must  certify to Congress that, among other things, the facility incorporates  adequate measures for protecting classified information and activities as  well as personnel working in the facilities. OBO contracts with  architectural and engineering firms (design firms) to develop designs  meeting security and other project requirements. These design firms  submit their designs for reviews by OBO and DS to ensure conformance  with building code and security standards, respectively. DS, in  consultation with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, must  certify that the design meets security standards prior to the start of  construction. While this certification occurs in the design phase of a  project, DS also has other roles in the process, such as participating in  site selection, ensuring OBO contractors have necessary security  clearances, and ensuring facilities are securely constructed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The SED Approach", "paragraphs": ["To address some of the performance problems experienced during the  Inman program, OBO implemented reforms to its business processes in  structuring the new Capital Security Construction Program. Among the  most prominent reforms were the development of the SED to expedite the  planning, contract award, design, and construction of new diplomatic  compounds and use of the design-build (DB) project delivery method,  which combines responsibility for design and construction under a single  contract and allows contractors to begin basic construction before the  design is fully completed.", "Initially  there were three common SED classes\u2014small, medium, and  large\u2014based on the size of a post. For planning purposes, each size had  predefined schedules and costs associated with them. The SED itself  was a set of documents providing prototypical plans (for a medium SED),  specifications, and design criteria, and explaining how to adapt those to a  particular site and project. The SED was not a complete design but  rather a standardized template for the structural, spatial, and security  requirements of a new embassy compound to guide a contractor\u2019s final  design. Compound elements described by the SED generally included the  main office building; U.S. Marine Security Guards\u2019 living quarters; a  warehouse; a utility building; compound access control buildings and  perimeter walls; and parking facilities. The SED also allowed for the  standardization of building components such as security windows and  doors. Figure 1 shows the prototypical facilities defined by the SED.", "The main office building within the SED was organized around two  parallel wings connected by a central lobby. Occasionally site conditions  such as size, shape, or topography required deviating from that typical  configuration; OBO refers to such projects as SED \u201cderivatives.\u201d From  2001 through 2015, OBO constructed more than 50 embassies using the  SED approach. Figure 2 shows examples of both the typical SED and  derivative SED office building configurations.", "In 2006, we reported that OBO had made significant progress  constructing new diplomatic compounds using the SED approach. We  found that the average time to design and construct the 18 new embassies completed from 1999 to 2005 was about 3 years (36.7  months). This was nearly 3 years faster than embassies built during the  Inman era, even though the newer facilities were significantly larger and  more complex. We also found that reforms implemented by OBO,  including the switch to the SED and the DB contract delivery method, had  reduced project completion times, although it was difficult to quantify the  effects of any single reform. In 2007, OBO reported that the SED,  combined with DB project delivery, was expected to reduce overall  delivery time\u2014from site selection to occupancy\u2014by 34 percent. In  2008, State\u2019s Inspector General found that OBO\u2019s continued use of the  SED, in conjunction with the DB delivery method, was generally  effective. Additionally,  State\u2019s Inspector General found that the SED  permitted faster certification of project designs and accreditation by DS  because the standardized design specifications were fully vetted for  conformity to security standards.", "OBO took some actions to incorporate sustainability principles in the SED  to meet federal energy mandates to reduce energy and water  consumption. In 2006 OBO committed, in concert with 20 other federal  agencies, to seek common strategies for planning, acquiring, siting,  designing, building, operating, and maintaining federal facilities in an  energy efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. In 2008, OBO  established Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)  certification as a design standard for its SED projects.

DB integrates design and construction responsibilities into a  single contract. Under this model, the DB contractor is responsible for  design and construction and thus bears the risks, such as added cost, for  any design problems because it (not OBO) hires the design firm to bring  the design to completion. According to industry experts, DB is generally  recognized as the best project delivery method for supporting accelerated  delivery, in part because the DB contractor may undertake some  construction while design is still in progress. Under OBO policy, in the  SED approach OBO provided the DB contractor with the SED prototypical  design\u2014to include standard site and building plans, technical  specifications, design criteria, and instructions for its adaptation for a  particular project and contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s design firm  would then use the SED documentation to develop a 100-percent design  adapted for a site at a particular post, becoming the architect-of-record.  According to the AIA,  in general, the architect-of-record for a project  prepares the bulk of the design and construction drawings and assumes  professional responsibility for the design. Although the DB contractor\u2019s  design firm completed the project design, OBO\u2019s policy was to hire its  own design firm beforehand to conduct project development activities  such as due-diligence planning surveys, site studies, and other analyses  needed to inform the project\u2019s design. Figure 3 provides an overview of  the embassy construction process under OBO\u2019s implementation of DB.", "According to former senior OBO officials, the OBO Director who had  implemented the SED viewed OBO\u2019s mission as needing to build secure  embassies as fast as possible and within a fixed budget, given the large  number of facilities that State needed to replace. They stated that the  then Director\u2019s commitment was that OBO would combine a standardized  design with the DB delivery method to speed design and construction and  limit the costs to build each embassy to no more than $100 million (based  on a large SED). OBO also maintained at that time that the SED generally  would take no more than 36 months to build\u2014inclusive of the time for  contract acquisition, design, and construction\u2014depending on the post  size. According to these former senior OBO officials, those estimates  did not always reflect the budget and time needed to build some SED  embassies. They also stated that adapting the SED to the unique  requirements of some posts\u2014such as a very large consular services  operation\u2014was challenging and that the SED did not always account for  quality and long-term maintenance and operations cost considerations. In  addition, one former OBO official stated that although the emphasis in the  SED approach on speed and cost control enabled OBO to promote that it  had moved a certain number of people into secure facilities each year,  this was an indicator of performance related to a single goal: project  delivery. He noted that OBO did not use any performance indicators  related to design and construction quality to evaluate the new SED  facilities being built.", "Although the SED approach enabled OBO to accelerate the construction  of new embassies intended to meet rigorous new security requirements,  some stakeholders raised concerns about the aesthetics, quality, location,  and functionality of those facilities.", "Aesthetics. One design firm we spoke with said there were criticisms that  SED embassies were \u201ccookie cutter\u201d facilities that looked like fortresses.  In 2010, then U.S. Senator John Kerry and former Secretary of Defense  William Cohen\u2014key advocates of Excellence\u2014reported newly  constructed embassies were not sending the right message. They  described new embassies as cold concrete facilities at a forbidding  distance hidden away from city life, with little regard for the local  surroundings, undermining U.S. diplomats\u2019 message and mission. They  asserted that State was constructing a standardized \u201cembassy in a box,\u201d  uniform in appearance, quickly assembled, and fortress-like.", "Quality. According to some former senior OBO officials, OBO\u2019s emphasis  on speed and cost under the SED approach resulted in some poor-quality  buildings. According to these officials and one design firm we interviewed,  the time and budget pressures sometimes resulted in OBO and its  contractors making trade-off decisions such as using less costly and  lower-quality building systems or materials. For example, one former  official reported that the SED approach resulted in some projects where  contractors used lesser-quality exterior stone or metal cladding on  building exteriors. In some projects, he indicated that contractors installed  heating, ventilation,  and air-conditioning systems that were minimally  acceptable under the SED but not the best solution for the post\u2019s  geographic climate.  Location. OBO officials commented that in some cases the 10-acre lot  specified by the SED required siting the embassy too far from urban  centers where foreign government offices and other embassies are  located. This issue also arose in a 2007 report to State entitled The  Embassy of the Future. Guided by a commission composed of former  U.S. ambassadors, among others, the report recommended that State  avoid constructing embassies in locations remote from urban centers. It  also noted that although the appearance of embassies as influenced by  security requirements deserves careful consideration, their location is of  higher importance.  Functionality. One former OBO official stated that because the SED was  \u201cvery complete\u201d as a standardized design concept and was based on a  completed embassy in Africa, its design was not always conducive to  being site adapted and applied to other regions in the world. For example,  the design criteria for the heating and cooling systems generally specified  by the SED may not always have been the best for climates that are very  hot, cold, or humid. Some design firms we spoke with echoed that  assessment, saying that project size, site shape or topography, regional  climate, or special post needs could render the SED difficult to apply.  OBO\u2019s most recent former Director has also stated that the SED did not  always permit OBO to meet posts\u2019 varied needs. Former OBO officials  told us that, in some cases, functional elements such as warehouses were eliminated from SED projects to deliver them on time and within  budget. Additionally,  current OBO officials emphasized a need to  acknowledge the frequency of which the scope of SED projects were  reduced to keep projects on time and within cost, without a corresponding  reduction to schedule and budget.", "Issues with the SED approach have been documented in past OBO and  GAO studies. For example, in 2008, OBO initiated a \u201clook back\u201d study to  examine shortcomings with the early SED projects (2001-2007). The  study identified deficiencies in newly completed SEDs stemming from  building functionality issues, construction flaws, maintenance issues, and  de-scoped facilities. Our 2010 review also examined functionality at 22  new embassy compounds where construction began in or after fiscal year  1999 and was completed by September 30, 2009. Officials at 21 of the  22 posts reported that the design of some spaces within their facility did  not fully meet their functional needs, with an average of five functionality- related issues per post. We reported that in some cases, functionality  challenges resulted in the need to conduct costly follow-on projects after  posts occupied the embassy. OBO officials assert that by using the SED  approach, a deficiency in one project was effectively built into each active  project as it was a standardized approach to project delivery. By  comparison, OBO officials assert that by designing each project  individually,  the Excellence approach provides OBO with the ability to  more quickly identify and make changes or improvements from project to  project.", "OBO took some steps to improve the exterior look of embassies prior to  adopting the Excellence approach. According to former senior OBO  officials we spoke with, OBO recognized there were some legitimate  criticisms about the aesthetics and architecture of the embassies built  under SED. Those officials indicated that one of OBO\u2019s interim Directors  initiated a study to improve future embassy projects such that they better  fit in with the streets and spaces around an embassy. These officials  cited OBO\u2019s 2011 Embassy Perimeter Improvement Concepts & Design  Guidelines as a direct effort to improve the exterior appearance of  embassies by using various design techniques and landscaping so that  they would look less \u201cfortress-like.\u201d", "OBO had previously prepared a report, in 2008, that reviewed its  embassy construction process and the SED. To address some of the  problems found in this report\u2014such as the need to balance SED  standardization with unique post conditions\u2014OBO\u2019s then-Director  approved the use of DB with bridging in 2008. Generally under this  delivery method, OBO first contracts with a design firm (the bridging  architect) to develop a project-specific, partial design package (bridging  design) that conveys State\u2019s design vision and a higher level of detail for  key design requirements. Upon completing a project\u2019s bridging design,  OBO\u2019s procedure is to separately contract with a DB contractor to  complete the design and build the project. Therefore, unlike the SED,  each bridging design is project-specific, customized, and separately  contracted to a design firm. According to senior OBO officials, as well as  construction contractor and design firm officials, the current extent of  design represented by Excellence bridging documents varies by project  but generally approximates an overall 35- to 50-percent design. Those  officials indicated that bridging designs include multiple design disciplines  whereby elements such as architectural design may be developed to a far  greater extent than others, such as electrical design. Under this method,  the DB contractor and its design firm are responsible for completing the  design. Figure 4 provides an overview of the embassy construction  process under bridging.", "In 2009, we reported that by providing more design detail up front, OBO  believed bridging would more effectively translate project requirements to  contractors, speed the design security certification process, and enable  construction to begin sooner. OBO documentation also indicates that  OBO believed bridging would better define the desired look and quality for  projects than the SED alone could achieve and provide less room for the  contractor to make interpretations and change OBO\u2019s vision of the  project.

AIA  officials we spoke with said that AIA never expressly  advocated that the SED be completely abandoned, because that  approach might remain appropriate for some projects. However, these  officials noted that as more SED projects were built, AIA\u2019s members (i.e.,  architects) believed that SEDs were not the optimal choice for most  projects, as the standardized design was not always conducive to  adapting to different climates, countries, or unique post functions.", "In April 2010\u2014a year before formally instituting Excellence\u2014OBO  released \u201cGuiding Principles of Design Excellence in Diplomatic Facilities\u201d  (Guiding Principles) to its Industry Advisory Panel.

Thus OBO did not contract with design firms to develop  customized designs. One senior OBO official said that OBO\u2019s intent under  Excellence is to \u201cown the quality of each project\u201d and that contracting for  project-specific designs provides control over the design process to avoid  what OBO reports were quality issues with some SED projects.

OBO identified 16 of these 24 project designs  as being Excellence projects.", "OBO\u2019s Excellence approach\u2014using bridging and DBB\u2014also represents a  new investment in up-front design time, potentially  up to 2 additional  years (compared to the SED approach) to develop custom, innovative  designs before OBO contracts for construction. OBO maintains that this  additional design time is integrated into its projects such that planned  construction contract award dates are not affected and remain consistent  with OBO\u2019s overall Capital Security Construction Program schedule for  constructing new secure facilities. In other words, by starting projects  earlier, OBO asserts that it can still meet the Capital Security  Construction Program schedule for delivering new embassies.

OBO\u2019s guidance indicates  that material advances and new technologies can result in the delivery of  better diplomatic facilities and that OBO must invest in innovation. For  most of its design projects, OBO utilizes an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite  Quantity (ID/IQ) contract mechanism\u2014under which five design firms have  been hired\u2014to task design firms to develop project designs, when  needed.

Four  of the five firms hired by OBO under its current ID/IQ are new to embassy  construction work. Officials we spoke with\u2014including DS officials, design  firms, construction contractors, and former OBO officials\u2014identified some  adjustment challenges facing design firms new to OBO that have never  designed an embassy before.

DS officials reported the firms require a great deal of work to bring them up to speed on State\u2019s security  requirements. To mitigate this situation, DS has been conducting \u201c101  Certification Workshops\u201d for new design firms so that they understand  DS\u2019s approach to the security certification of new embassy designs.

Those indicators include the following, among others: average duration  and cost growth for capital construction design standards are met and updated on an annual basis  incorporating lessons learned and other feedback from stakeholders  from prior years; and percent of new embassy and consulate compounds designed to  achieve LEED Silver certification.", "While the first set of indicators can quantitatively measure performance  and enable OBO to report on the efficiency of project delivery under  Excellence (as OBO did previously under the Inman program and under  SED), those schedule and cost indicators do not address new aspects of  Excellence, such as lower operating costs or better support for U.S.  conduct of diplomacy. In addition, the latter two indicators in the list above  are, if anything, even less useful for assessing Excellence performance.  First, OBO updates its design standards annually and conducts design  reviews to ensure that projects meet those standards. Thus, it is unlikely  OBO would fail to meet this performance indicator. Second, according to  OBO documentation, LEED Silver certification has been an OBO design  standard since 2009, before Excellence. Thus, to meet design standards,  every Excellence embassy built\u2014with an emphasis on greater sustainability\u2014should be at least LEED Silver, so the indicator should be  100 percent, or very near to it. Furthermore, the LEED indicator assesses  only the performance implied by the design itself, not the actual building  operations and maintenance performance and whether the actual utility  usage and costs are equal to or less than initially  estimated in the  designs.", "While no Excellence projects can be evaluated yet, as none have been  completed, without additional performance indicators relevant to the goals  of the Excellence approach, OBO has no way of knowing if its new  process is achieving the desired results. Furthermore, it lacks an  important tool for reporting on the Excellence approach to congressional  overseers, the public, and other State stakeholders such as other U.S.  diplomatic agencies that must help pay some of the costs for constructing  and maintaining new embassies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OBO Is Exploring Ways to Better Track and Evaluate Long-Term, Project-Level Performance", "paragraphs": ["OBO also lacks post-specific performance measures to track and  evaluate the long-term performance of its embassies. According to Office  of Management and Budget guidance, more than 80 percent of a  building\u2019s total cost over its lifespan can consist of ownership costs such  as operations, maintenance, and energy usage. When combined with  front-end costs such as design and construction, these costs embody a  project\u2019s \u201clife-cycle costs.\u201d OBO has attempted to address long-term  operations and maintenance costs on the front-end by, for example,  committing to include LEED Silver certification in its design standards  since 2009, according to OBO officials. Other sustainability \u201cstretch\u201d  initiatives OBO considers desirable (though not required) under  Excellence include trying to achieve LEED Platinum certification,  increasing use of renewable energy sources, reducing greenhouse gas  emissions, and achieving net-zero energy and water consumption on its  compounds, whereby enough renewable energy or water is generated to  meet a post\u2019s requirements. OBO design standards also require design  firms to incorporate operations and maintenance cost analysis into  embassy designs through sustainability studies. From 2001 through 2015,  in locations where OBO has constructed a new diplomatic compound,  OBO reported it has constructed 26 new LEED-certified embassy or  consulate office buildings, 19 of which were SEDs.", "However, despite the additional emphasis now focused on operations and  maintenance on the front end during design, OBO has no post-specific  performance measures related to operations and maintenance cost  performance after a new embassy is constructed. One reason for this is  the lack of available or reliable data. OBO officials stated that although  some embassies do have utility meters on site, getting data from there  back to Washington, D.C., is challenging. While OBO does have a data  system in place to capture some operations and maintenance  information, such as utility usage, it is dependent upon manual entry of  data at each specific post. According to OBO officials, this lowers data  reliability, and differences in data entry compliance by posts over time  make historical analysis of operations and maintenance costs difficult.  Also, while some posts have building-level  meters for the main office  building, other posts have compound-level utility meters that track data for  multiple buildings, making broader data comparisons difficult across  posts.", "OBO is taking some steps to address this situation. According to OBO\u2019s  2016 Guide to Excellence, OBO is in the process of developing  project  and portfolio operations and maintenance cost assessment procedures to  account for these costs over the estimated life of embassies. In 2016  OBO initiated an effort to develop a methodology and process to better  assess the full life-cycle cost of its projects. OBO\u2019s July 2016 statement of  work on its Life-Cycle Cost Assessment effort shows that OBO intends to  develop a methodology and plan to assess the total cost of ownership of  projects and facilities, which takes into account the costs of (1)  acquisition, (2) design, (3) construction, and (4) operations and  maintenance. According to OBO officials, this effort represents a gradual  shift in OBO\u2019s orientation, whereby OBO\u2019s portfolio is expected to reflect  less emphasis on new construction and greater attention to maintenance,  repair, and renovations. Therefore, decisions must be made regarding  what metrics should be tracked.", "OBO is also working with State\u2019s Office of Management, Rightsizing,  Policy, and Innovation  on a pilot effort\u2014called \u201cMeterNet\u201d\u2014with the intent  to install more metering systems on embassy compounds and to transmit  performance data back to Washington. Under MeterNet,  State intends to  automate and improve the collection of data on electrical energy usage  (both utility and renewable sources), water usage, and fuel consumption.  According to OBO officials, MeterNet  should relieve posts of manual data  entry and also enable OBO to more accurately monitor, collect, and  analyze more reliable data on sustainable energy and water performance.  OBO anticipates that this in turn will enable facility managers to manage  energy consumption data across State\u2019s facilities, as well as analyze and  track energy usage trends over time, such as energy per square foot or  overall electricity demand. OBO has also been working with the  Department of Energy to address challenges with its existing utility data  system. According to OBO officials, OBO has not yet determined how  MeterNet will interface with OBO\u2019s existing data systems.", "The steps OBO has taken to improve monitoring of post-specific  operations and maintenance costs are at a very early stage. Until OBO  clearly defines a process to assess the performance of its projects after  construction and establishes reliable data systems to track and report this  performance, OBO will lack an essential tool for determining whether  completed projects\u2014whether Excellence or SED facilities\u2014are  performing as intended by their designs from either a sustainability (e.g.,  energy and water usage) or an operating and maintenance cost  standpoint."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OBO Is Exploring a Centralized Data Solution to Better Manage Projects and Track Cost and Schedule Performance", "paragraphs": ["OBO currently lacks easily accessible data to provide overall project  management information.

However, OBO was unable to easily provide such information. According  to OBO officials, while these data did exist and could be retrieved, the  data were not available in any centralized data source. Rather, each OBO  office maintained separate data relevant to its own operations, and so  consolidated and current data to provide overall project information were  unavailable.", "OBO offices consolidate certain project management information in  periodic project performance reviews, whereby individual  offices and  project teams report on cost, schedule, and scope for specific embassy  projects. However, while this can facilitate some data retrieval from a  specific ongoing project, according to OBO officials it can be difficult and  time consuming to find information on older, completed projects for which  there is no longer an active project team. We reported on similar data  issues in September 2014, when OBO could not provide all of the real  property files we requested, at that time also citing lack of centralized  data, maintenance by different groups within OBO, and difficulty of  retrieval.", "According to federal internal control standards, quality information is an  essential tool for agency management to achieve an agency\u2019s  objectives.

In response to our request, OBO began assembling a wide  range of project management data to fulfill our request as well as to better  provide information to Congress. We received these data in the form of a  spreadsheet 10 months later in August 2016. OBO officials attributed this  delay to the aforementioned difficulty of retrieving historical project data  as well as having to address concurrent information requests from  Congress and State\u2019s Inspector General. The database we received  covers projects from January 2001 through September 2015, includes  many elements of the information we requested, and also includes some  other information useful to OBO management.

From fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2015, OBO has  allotted hundreds of millions of dollars to fund more customized designs  rather than applying a standardized design to build new embassies.  Though a greater upfront investment in design may yield embassy  improvements, it carries with it increased risk to project costs and  schedule. While OBO is attempting to manage this risk, without strategic  or project-level performance measures specific to the goals of Excellence,  OBO cannot fully assess the merits of this new approach. Furthermore,  as projects initiated during Excellence\u2019s implementation come to fruition  and begin operations, such measures will be essential to any long-term  assessment of their performance. Establishing reliable data systems to  measure, record, and report on building performance can help OBO  management evaluate all costs that occur over a building\u2019s lifespan.  Further, centralized project management data are also needed to allow  OBO to quantify and assess design and construction costs under  Excellence for each project. While OBO has begun efforts to establish  such systems, it will take time to complete these initiatives and collect  these crucial data.

Contract performance in particular is difficult to measure or, in some cases not obtained due to lack of  quantifiable criteria.", "New/slow/problematic processes and/or requirements resulting from more complex and varied projects:  Challenges have been introduced in realizing design intent in most of the underdeveloped countries that construction occurs in.  Designs are complex and the materials exotic for the location. Inefficiencies have been introduced in requiring senior  management reviews of  projects without fully defining what the intent of such reviews are. Challenges have been  introduced in the constructability of building features. Challenges introduced with reliance on outside architect firms to develop  plans and drawings and to judge design intent or answer questions.", "My  required time spent on projects has at least doubled because of the policies put in place since 2011. In terms of  improvements, more aesthetically pleasing facilities are being produced, but in my opinion the amount of effort required to attain  good design is very disproportionate to the effort required to achieve this goal. This is due to a poorly organized process and a  severe lack of communication throughout the organization.", "Schedule challenges; extended timelines:  Schedules are consistently moved forward with longer timelines to accomplish the design portion of the project.  Planning and design take much more time and effort than before. Assurance of meeting security criteria is challenging, since  every  new embassy is a \u201cone of a kind\u201d project. More daunting is the process by which the Front Office approves design  concepts. That alone has added 3 to 6 months to the planning and design schedule.", "Budget challenges; high costs:  Since no two posts have the same size, plan, finish materials, exterior components, or operating systems, I see no efficiencies  whatsoever. The push for high initial budgets is to be able to cover the costs associated with the fancier design elements.  Site acquisition is more difficult, and more costly than ever. Only urban locations and not cheaper bigger suburban sites are even  considered. Project design costs are exponentially higher through the Excellence program. Higher costs mean fewer projects  being planned for or constructed in any given year.", "Legend: OBO = Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations; SED  = Standard Embassy Design.", "Excellence costs more compared with SED  (\u201cbudget challenges\u201d)", "Excellence takes more time compared with SED  (\u201cschedule challenges\u201d)", "Excellence introduces new/ slow/ problematic  processes and/or requirements resulting from  more complex and varied projects      Under Excellence (compared with SED): Lack of,  inadequate, or inconsistent application of  policies/ procedures/ standards/ systems; poor  communication of policies, etc.", "Legend: \u2014 = No contrasting comments w ere identified in this category.", "Selected Survey Comments Regarding the SED and Excellence Approaches  The SED model streamlined many processes which apparently translated into a more expedient overall delivery of new facilities.  The Excellence program successfully addresses many of the SED program drawbacks (\u201cembassies looking similar and like  fortresses\u201d), however, at a price (arguably longer and more expensive projects). The decision clearly needs to be made whether it  is worth that price.", "While the SED program was severely limiting, it is my belief that there is a middle ground between the SED and the Excellence  program\u2014where OBO has a set of standards, specifications, and requirements that are clearly communicated to the design firm  while allowing them to customize the footprint and design features of the building. OBO has buildings in its portfolio that were built  using \u201cSED Criteria\u201d that are not \u201cprison-like\u201d and forbidding. It can be done in a thoughtful and efficient way that would appeal to  people architecturally. In plain words\u2014OBO didn\u2019t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.", "On the positive side, designing unique facilities improves the aesthetics of the U.S. presence abroad and sets an example for  building system efficiency and innovative systems to the world. On the negative side, each unique design requires re-inventing  the wheel and creates additional challenges for the designer to integrate physical and technical security, as well as accounting for  building maintenance and upkeep. These designs are often difficult to implement overseas, and the state-of-the-art systems are  difficult to maintain in some countries with unique equipment and a significant increase in facilities staff. Unique designs are more  difficult and frequently more expensive to implement, creating an impact on time and cost.  The Excellence program designs buildings that are architecturally pleasing, but in order to achieve nice aesthetics and achieve  the security mandates that embassies must adhere to, I believe a cost premium exists in order to meet the aesthetics of the  embassies designed under the Excellence program. I think a compromise can be achieved, and in that compromise some cost  savings could be realized, but in my opinion the pendulum has swung completely opposite that of the SED, and the evidence is in  a cost comparison between the embassies designed under the SED program to those designed under the Excellence program.  The designs of  are more challenging or difficult to introduce, implement, and execute. Every  design is unique and  different, takes longer to evaluate, and requires more coordination; more issues are encountered that need to be resolved. The  construction of  is also more challenging or difficult to execute. The distinct construction materials used are more  expensive, take longer to procure and transport, and are more difficult to install. Therefore, the schedule is longer, especially if  there are more issues encountered during design and construction, and the cost of construction and contingencies are much  higher.  SEDs were all about schedule and budget and when either of these were threatened, things were de-scoped or glossed over.  Many  times those were support annexes (shops, storage facilities) that allowed the facilities to be properly maintained or morale/  welfare/recreation facilities or amenities, meaning that these things had to be added after the fact, putting a great deal of pressure  on posts. Excellence does a better job in terms of incorporating architectural features, energy efficiency and sustainability design,  and delivering a fully realized compound.  I believe that the Excellence program produces a better product and platform for diplomacy; however, most of us also  acknowledge that the SED program gave us the ability to execute faster when needed. They should not be mutually exclusive.  There are principles in the SED that can be applied and probably should not have been just \u201cthrown out.\u201d It should have been a  good solution for an expeditious need, in a place where appropriate. We also know that it did not work well everywhere, and in  places with stringent code, zoning, or other restrictions (including the desire to operate in an urban context), it was definitely not a  good solution. As long as the Front Office doesn\u2019t focus solely on aesthetics, the Excellence program should produce some  outstanding facilities that have far more flexibility than the SED, better functionality, and improved suitability for the country in  which they reside.", "Legend: OBO = Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations; SED  = Standard Embassy Design.", "Many responses to open-ended questions in the survey touched upon  issues we reviewed through our separate audit work. We have included  some of these responses for illustrative purposes in the text boxes that  follow. In some cases, we edited comments for clarity or grammar.", "Selected Survey Comments on Concerns with SED  The SED program was a failure for site specific implementation. It is generally known around OBO that there was no such thing  as a real SED building. Due to the technical requirements and the site specific requirements, all SED compounds required  adaptation, usually at significant cost and time.  The SED had plenty of problems. Yes, the main issue was the boring and unimaginative concrete box; however, it did produce  embassies. There is a middle road that opens up the options and opportunities for improved design without going overboard.  The SED program was effective in quickly and efficiently providing safe and secure facilities to perform diplomatic activities  overseas using the  delivery method. However, the designs were not very attractive  and didn\u2019t represent the best in  American architecture.", "Legend: OBO = Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations; SED  = Standard Embassy Design.", "Selected Survey Comments on the Desire to Improve Embassies under the Excellence Approach  The Excellence initiative is a better way to design the  Department\u2019s projects and buildings. It takes advantage of  innovation in the design generated by architects and engineers from different points of view. The SED program produced more  and more generic buildings that translated into more or less a template mentality.  The architecture is less fortress-like, more approachable to local populations, more culturally sensitive (more diplomatic). It is  more attractive and something that Americans can be prouder of, as well as being greener and increasingly sustainable.  From my limited experience with OBO, it appears as though the Excellence program attracts better design firms to the program.  Better design firms should result in a better end product. The Excellence program also appears to result in more excitement from  the host country and allows for embracing culturally specific designs.", "Legend: OBO = Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations; SED  = Standard Embassy Design.", "Selected Survey Comments on Industry and Senior OBO Management Design Reviews  The incorporation of the Industry Advisory  Reviews gives design firms real-time feedback from their peers on not only how to  support the Excellence program, but how to save costs and make buildings more efficient during the design process.  I think that the new processes are moving forward, and we are seeing some positive results with stronger designs and hopefully,  construction. For example, there were positive reactions by both the staff and private sector architects to the Industry Advisory  Reviews that I attended.  Too much time and effort is spent on reviews by OBO Front Office and outsiders. Front Office seems to be inconsistent in what it  wants in a design and will change its mind from one review to the next. We are hiring professional design firms. They should be  able to do their jobs.  The design process has been significantly impacted by the introduction of numerous senior management and Industry Advisory  Group reviews. These reviews are expensive and time consuming. An independent evaluation of their value versus their cost is  warranted.", "Legend: OBO = Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations; SED  = Standard Embassy Design.", "Selected Survey Comments on OBO Guidance Related to the Excellence Approach  I do believe OBO as a whole is trying to maintain and keep up with outdated policies. In my observations OBO is very  understaffed or doesn\u2019t have the right mix of professionals necessary to maintain policy and regulations.  There is no mention anywhere of changes to the security program brought on by Design Excellence. In my opinion, no one has  ever thought through what it means to construct anything other than a SED. There is no Design Excellence guidance for security  professionals.  The Guiding Principles are widely available to staff and clearly reflect the vision of the senior leadership.  The Design Excellence guide took 2 years to write; then they wanted the operations and maintenance piece added but gave us  initially only 2 weeks.  Case in point.

Answer: none. Each project  takes as long as it takes. The project costs what it costs.  Several presentations have been given and a few documents produced to try to articulate Design Excellence; however, much of  the concept is subjective, due to the emphasis on architecture, and cannot be measured or effectively monitored for performance.
