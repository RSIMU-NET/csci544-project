College graduates earn much more than those with only a high-school education or less, and the differential has been increasing. Low-income and minority students have traditionally been underrepresented among college students. For them, federal student financial assistance programs have become increasingly critical as college costs have increased faster than the rate of inflation since the 1970s and as low-income families lost ground relative to high-income families. Federal assistance to students pursuing higher education has exceeded $300 billion (in 1994 dollars) over the past 15 years.", "While the federal government\u2019s investment to improve college access for low-income students has been substantial, recent changes in federal financial aid may inhibit broader college access. A growing proportion of federal aid has taken the form of loans rather than grants since the 1970s. With federal grant aid declining in relative terms, students and their families have had to shoulder a greater share of college expenses. Many policymakers have expressed concern that this trend in financial aid patterns, which increases students\u2019 net costs for higher education, has diminished college access\u2014both initial entry and attendance through graduation\u2014for low-income students.", "As agreed, this report is our second and final product responding to your request that we compare the relative effectiveness of grants and loans in helping students stay in college until graduation. In previous testimony,we focused on minority students and reported that while grant aid enhanced the chances that African American and Hispanic students would stay in college from year to year, loan aid did not. In this study, we focused on low-income students. We assessed the relative effects of grant and loan aid throughout a student\u2019s academic career and then separately by year. Specifically, we addressed two questions regarding low-income students: 1. Do grants and loans have equivalent effects on helping students stay in college? 2. Does the timing of grant aid influence the length of time students stay in college?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed two student-level databases to examine the statistical relationship between grants, loans, and staying in college. One database comprised a national sample of high school seniors who began full-time study at 4-year colleges; we traced these students through college. The other database consisted of a group of relatively low-income freshmen from a large public 4-year university that frontloaded some of its institutional grant dollars to improve these students\u2019 dropout rates.", "To complement our statistical analysis and provide additional perspectives on our findings and observations, we talked to financial aid directors and students from 12 colleges and universities. We judgmentally selected four schools from each of three areas\u2014Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Seattle, Washington\u2014for our study. We convened a discussion panel with financial aid directors from the schools in each area and asked them for their observations on trends in federal student financial aid, factors affecting students\u2019 staying in school, and the potential benefit of frontloading grants. We also interviewed 51 students from these 12 colleges and universities, asking them about their financial aid packages, the effects working has on their studies, and their thoughts about debt accumulation. Although the financial aid director and student responses illustrated ways financial aid affects students, neither group\u2019s responses were intended to be representative of the respective population as a whole.

Federal student financial assistance exceeded $30 billion in academic year 1993-94, and most assistance came from two programs\u2014the Pell grant and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. The Pell grant program, which primarily targets low-income students, accounted for about $5.7 billion, while the FFEL program comprised over $21 billion of the total federal aid. Maximum annual awards to students in each program are capped: In 1993-94, the maximum Pell grant was $2,300, and the maximum subsidized Stafford loan\u2014the largest of the FFEL loan programs\u2014ranged from $2,625 for freshmen to $5,500 for seniors.", "The Department of Education administers the Pell grant program in accordance with eligibility criteria and authorized maximum award amounts set by the Congress. In addition, the Congress effectively limits actual maximum Pell award amounts each year through the appropriations process. Actual maximum awards have been less than the authorized levels each year since 1980. For example, in 1993-94, the authorized maximum Pell grant was $3,700, but the appropriation for the program limited the actual maximum award to $2,300."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changing Federal Aid System Coincided With Rising College Costs", "paragraphs": ["The composition of student financial assistance has changed dramatically over the past two decades. Although total federal aid has increased since the late 1970s, loan aid has increased far faster than grant aid. From 1977 to 1980, grant aid exceeded loan aid, but since 1985 loan aid has exceeded grant aid by about twice as much (see fig. 1).", "Budgetary concerns and program changes have limited grant aid for low-income students. As the deficit rose during the 1980s, policymakers\u2019 awareness of budgetary trade-offs and the need to leverage resources grew. Loans are a less expensive form of aid for federal budgetary purposes than grants because the budget accounts only for the cost of interest subsidies and default payments. Thus, for a given federal expenditure, the government can offer more aid if it is provided as loans.In addition, the 1978 Middle Income Student Assistance Act extended eligibility for Pell grants to higher income students; however, appropriations did not allow for commensurate increases in program dollars. Consequently, more students now receive Pell grants, but the actual maximum award has remained approximately constant in nominal dollars since 1986.", "Cost pressures for low-income families have increased since the late 1970s, as the average cost of 4-year colleges and universities has increased faster than the inflation rate. Between 1978 and 1992, the average tuition, room, and board charge at 4-year public colleges and universities rose by 26 percent in real terms. This had two distinct effects. First, college expenses at the average public university absorbed 11 percent of median family income in 1978 and 14 percent in 1992. For families at the 20th-income percentile, this charge increased even more, from 22 to 31 percent of income. Second, the actual maximum Pell grant, which covered over half the costs at the average public 4-year school in 1985, now covers less than 40 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low-Income Students Less Likely to Enroll and Stay in College", "paragraphs": ["Low-income students are underrepresented among college students.

However, minorities are overrepresented among low-income families, so their rates serve as a reasonable proxy for low-income students\u2019 graduation rates. Sample data show that minority students are less likely to stay in school and graduate than white students. For example, in one sample of students entering 4-year colleges in 1983, 1984, or 1985, 56 percent of white students completed degrees within 6 years, but only 41 percent of Hispanic students and 32 percent of African American students did so.

In addition, grant aid for low-income students was most effective in the first year, with efficacy decreasing in the second and third years. The results of the university frontloading program strengthened our confidence in this finding. Students who received frontloaded grants had a lower dropout probability than other comparable students. Results of our statistical work showed the following.", "Grants versus loans: Grants significantly reduced dropout probabilities for low-income students. In the High School and Beyond database sample, an additional $1,000 in grant aid for a low-income student reduced the dropout probability by 14 percent for the award year.

For the lowest income students, those below the poverty line, the program reduced the dropout probability by 64 percent.", "These results, with certain qualifications, indicate that frontloading grants for college students, especially low-income students, could improve dropout rates. The results pertain only to 4-year college students and thus have no implication for students at 2-year schools. Also, the frontloading experiment took place at a university that combined it with other programs to reduce dropouts, and the results are not generalizable beyond that school. However, we believe the sum total of our results shows that frontloading grants holds promise.

One opinion arising in the directors\u2019 panels, for example, was that some low-income students are reluctant to borrow, especially during their first year or two in college. This observation is consistent with our statistical findings about grants being more effective than loans in increasing the likelihood that first-year, low-income students will stay in school. The directors we spoke with were generally positive about the potential benefits of frontloading grants, several saying it could help low-income students stay in college by giving them time to become acclimated to college and reducing financial pressures when students are most vulnerable to dropping out. One concern about frontloading was that students might perceive it as a bait-and-switch policy because it would involve reducing grant awards in later years. In the student interviews, we sometimes heard that borrowing was initially difficult for students and that grant aid made the difference in their being able to start college. Another theme among the students was that year-to-year consistency was important in their aid packaging, so that they could plan ahead without disruptions, and that frontloading seemed contrary to the principle of consistency.

This law authorizes the Department to designate institutions that volunteer to participate as \u201cexperimental sites.\u201d These institutions help evaluate the impact and effectiveness of proposed regulations or new management initiatives. The Secretary of Education may exempt participating institutions from legal requirements as necessary to conduct the experiments. The officials said that they had not yet determined whether this authority would permit a pilot frontloading program and that they might need specific authority from the Congress to conduct a pilot. We defer to the Department on whether it currently has the authority to do so or needs additional authority.", "Such a pilot program, moreover, would need to address several implementation issues. The potential benefits of frontloading could be lost if institutional aid policies were changed to offset the federal change. Schools would need to be encouraged to ensure that overall grant aid, meaning federal and institutional aid combined, were frontloaded. Also, because eligibility for federal financial aid is based in part on annual income and other family resources that change over time, the amount of aid a student qualifies for changes each year. Frontloading would entail estimating a 4-year package, requiring methods not currently employed in aid determination. It would also involve adjusting loan limits for third- and fourth-year students at pilot schools and developing aid award rules for students who transfer between pilot and nonpilot schools.", "In evaluating a pilot program, changes in dropout rates would have to be interpreted carefully. A policy of frontloading grants might attract students to college who would not have attended otherwise. Although some of these students would graduate, on the whole their dropout rate could be higher than that of the current student population. Frontloading might reduce the number of dropouts among students who now attend college, but high dropout rates among this new college population could leave the overall dropout rate unchanged or higher."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our statistical analysis indicates that loans and grants are not equal substitutes in terms of affecting education outcomes for low-income students.

In addition, some schools have redefined \u201chigh-need students,\u201d recognizing that they can adequately serve only those with the very highest need. Some directors expressed concern about (1) reaching the limits of their abilities to draw upon endowment and other outside resources to bolster their financial aid budgets or (2) the impact this may have on diversity goals for their student body.", "Several directors said that some states have responded by developing strong state financing programs. Because most state treasuries are not in a position to fill the gap created by declining federal dollars, discussion in the financial aid community has explored new and innovative financing strategies for public institutions. One example is a high-tuition/high-financial-aid model, under which tuitions are raised and some of the increased revenue is used to aid students who could no longer afford to attend.", "Students tend to borrow more and, at some schools, work more now than in the past, some directors said. One director observed that students are borrowing more to make up the gap between what his school expects them to save during the summer and what they are able to save, based on their earnings.

One director expressed concern that some low-income and minority students do not even apply for college because of perceptions about high costs and limited financial aid. Another director stressed that it is not the prospect of large loan balances that deters low-income students from enrolling at his institution but the difference between the total education costs and the available financial aid. Another director stated that the federal government needs to (1) concentrate grant dollars on needy families who do not have other resources and (2) give loan money to those who have the means to pay it back. For needy students, he said, more loans may not help as much as more grants, but, for less needy students, more loans may help keep them in school.", "Some of the directors discussed their schools\u2019 efforts to retain students and suggested that changes in federal financial aid would have hurt students more if their schools had not made such efforts. One director described his school\u2019s posture toward retaining students as aggressive.

Whether students choose to work while in school can also vary by the individual student\u2019s residence, according to one director\u2014commuters tend to work more than students living on campus.
