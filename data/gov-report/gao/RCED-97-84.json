The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has responsibility for managing this system and ensuring the safe and efficient movement of air traffic. To successfully accomplish this mission, FAA must have a sufficient number of adequately trained air traffic controllers working at air traffic control (ATC) facilities. Currently, FAA operates nearly 400 ATC facilities and employs over 17,000 individuals in its controller workforce.", "For nearly a decade after the air traffic controller strike in August 1981, FAA had to rebuild its controller workforce. Between fiscal years 1982 and 1990, FAA hired thousands of controllers to replace those fired by a presidential directive in 1981 and indefinitely barred from seeking future employment as FAA controllers. Most controllers hired during that period have remained with FAA. In August 1993, the bar was repealed through a presidential memorandum, and in 1995, FAA began rehiring some of the former controllers. FAA anticipates that a large number of these controllers, in addition to the controllers who did not participate in the strike and controllers hired after the strike, will become eligible to retire beginning in the early 2000s, when they first meet minimum retirement qualifications."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Role of Air Traffic Controllers in the U.S. Air Transportation System", "paragraphs": ["Air traffic controllers play a critical role in the nation\u2019s air transportation system. Specifically, controllers are responsible for ensuring the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the air and on the ground. Controllers manage air traffic visually and through the use of various types of equipment, such as radars and computers, at various ATC facilities\u2014control towers, terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities, and air route traffic control centers (commonly called \u201cen route centers\u201d).", "Controllers\u2019 responsibilities for managing air traffic vary according to the type of ATC facility. For instance, controllers that work at control towers are responsible for ensuring the safe separation of aircraft on the ground and in flight in the vicinity of airports, generally within a 5-mile radius. These controllers manage the flow of aircraft during takeoffs and landings and coordinate the transfer of aircraft with adjacent ATC facilities as aircraft enter or leave an airport\u2019s airspace. Controllers working at TRACON facilities manage the arrival and departure of aircraft within a 5- to 30-mile radius of airports. Controllers working at en route centers manage aircraft beyond a 30-mile radius. These controllers assign aircraft to specific routes and altitudes to separate aircraft while they are flying along federal airways or when operating into or out of airports not served by a terminal facility. These controllers also coordinate the transfer of aircraft control with adjacent en route centers or terminal facilities. The typical en route center has responsibility for more than 100,000 square miles of airspace, which generally extends over several states. Depending on the location of the en route center, some controllers manage domestic, international, and oceanic air traffic. Figure 1.1 shows how controllers working at the different ATC facilities track aircraft during ground, take off, landing, and in-flight operations. As of April 10, 1996, FAA operated 387 ATC facilities, consisting of 24 en route centers and 363 terminal facilities.", "FAA determines the appropriate level of staffing for its ATC facilities by using staffing standards forecast models. These models produce staffing standards\u2014the specified level of controller staff needed to manage the ATC system, within 10 percent. For example, the staffing standards indicated in fiscal year 1996 that there should have been 17,465 controllers in the controller workforce. The standards also specified staffing levels for each ATC facility, but according to FAA officials, the facility-level standards are not designed to be as accurate as the national standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Controller Candidates and Air Traffic Controller Training", "paragraphs": ["FAA relies on a number of sources to fill its controller positions.

The second group includes graduates of the collegiate training initiative (CTI) program, who received initial ATC academic and technical skills training prior to being hired by FAA as controllers. This type of training introduces the students to the terminology, airspace configurations, and technical skills necessary to manage air traffic and operate equipment. The third group includes former controllers fired in 1981, who were members of the Professional Air Traffic Controller Organization (PATCO) union; former controllers who left FAA voluntarily and are eligible for reinstatement; and former Department of Defense (DOD) civilian and military controllers.", "Controller candidates who have no prior controller training or work experience had received initial controller training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. However, FAA discontinued initial controller training for newly hired controllers at the Academy in 1992 due to a sharp decrease in controller hiring.", "Candidates who currently receive initial controller training through the CTI program are trained at one of four CTI schools located in various parts of the country. These schools are the Community College of Beaver County in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania; Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia; University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, North Dakota; and University of Alaska-Anchorage in Anchorage, Alaska. The type, length, and cost of controller training provided by the CTI schools vary, and students pay the cost of their training at all these schools. In addition, in 1989 the Congress established the Mid-America Aviation Resource Consortium (MARC) in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, to train controller candidates. Unlike the CTI schools, the MARC program is not part of a broader academic program, and the cost of training MARC students is paid by federal funds.", "Controller candidates with prior controller work experience, such as former PATCO members and former DOD controllers, are not required to repeat the initial controller training when hired by FAA. However, they must complete certain refresher courses at the FAA Academy.", "Once assigned to an ATC facility, controllers are classified as \u201cdevelopmental controllers\u201d until they complete all requirements to be certified for all of the ATC positions within a defined area of a given ATC facility. It generally takes new controllers who have had only initial controller training 2 to 4 years\u2014depending on the availability of facility staff or contractors to provide on-the-job training\u2014to complete all the certification requirements to become full-performance-level (FPL) controllers.

Depending on when they were hired, controllers are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS). Under these rules, controllers can retire if they meet certain age and years-of-service requirements. For example, a controller who is 55 years old can retire after 30 years of federal service. Under the special controller retirement rules, controllers may be able to retire earlier than under the general CSRS and FERS rules if they have enough service time as an active controller or immediate supervisor. For instance, controllers can retire at age 50 if they have spent at least 20 years as an active civilian controller or immediate supervisor or at any age if they have spent at least 25 years as an active civilian controller or immediate supervisor.

These officials provided information on the data used to support FAA\u2019s staffing requests, including FAA\u2019s projections of air traffic and attrition, which we compared to available data on actual traffic and attrition. We also used personnel data supplied by FAA to estimate the age and service characteristics of future retirees on the basis of characteristics of actual retirees between fiscal years 1992 and 1996. Additional information on how we made these projections is in appendix I. We did not, however, verify the validity of the staffing estimates generated by the staffing standards forecast models because the National Research Council\u2014which is the principal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering\u2014was reviewing FAA\u2019s methodologies for estimating the number of controllers needed at ATC facilities. However, the Council was not reviewing the part of the models that estimates future attrition. Furthermore, the Council expects to issue a final report in the spring of 1997.", "To address the second objective, we interviewed officials at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the MARC, and the four CTI schools to obtain information on the number of controller candidates trained at those facilities during fiscal years 1993 to 1996 and the annual capacity of these facilities to train new controllers. We also interviewed FAA headquarters officials and analyzed pertinent data to determine (1) what was the pool of controller candidates available to meet anticipated staffing needs, (2) whether FAA had developed plans to satisfy long-term staffing needs, and (3) what actions FAA had under way to expand the pool of available controller candidates.", "To address the third objective, we compared controller staffing levels specified by FAA\u2019s controller staffing standards with actual staffing at the national, regional, and facility levels as of April 10, 1996.

In addition, we sent the same survey to air traffic managers at 15 ATC facilities (see app. II), including 3 en route centers, and at 12 terminals, as well as NATCA representatives located at the Eastern, Great Lakes, and Southern regions to obtain their perspectives on (1) their staffing needs as compared to current controller staffing levels and the impact of these differences on controller operations, (2) the impediments or principal causes of staffing differences at ATC facilities, and (3) the initiatives FAA has under way to address the impediments. We selected a judgmental sample of 15 ATC facilities to obtain geographical diversity and a representative mix of facilities where the current controller staffing levels were greater or less than the 10-percent difference acceptable to FAA.

As a result of these updates, FAA\u2019s estimate of the total number of controllers it needs can change from year to year.", "According to FAA officials, its models have been used to estimate controller staffing needs at ATC facilities nationwide, plus or minus 10 percent, and have served as key components for formulating FAA\u2019s annual budget. Before being submitted to the Congress, the staffing budget is reviewed within FAA, as well as by the Department of Transportation and by the Office of Management and Budget.", "The size of the controller workforce grew each fiscal year from 1981 through 1992, when it reached 17,982 controllers. In fiscal year 1991, the last full year in which FAA offered initial training only at its Academy in Oklahoma City, FAA hired a total of 1,235 new controller candidates. Subsequently, FAA\u2019s hiring of new controllers decreased significantly because it had more controllers than specified by the staffing standards. Between fiscal years 1993 and 1996, FAA hired a total of 611 new controllers\u2014fewer than the 1,513 who had left the controller workforce over the same period\u2014resulting in a decrease in the size of the controller workforce (see fig. 2.1 and table 2.1). According to FAA officials, most of the decrease in the size of the controller workforce was due to the congressionally directed initiative to contract out the functions of lower-level control towers to private companies, instead of staffing them with FAA employees. As part of a larger presidential effort to reduce the number of federal employees, in 1994 FAA also offered a retirement incentive, called a buyout, to staff, including those controllers who worked at the towers whose functions were contracted out. In fiscal year 1995, FAA\u2019s end-of-year controller workforce dropped below the level specified by the staffing standards. Although the actual controller workforce differed from the staffing standards by as much as 400 in some years, nationwide staffing levels were well within the standards\u2019 10-percent tolerance level.", "This report does not evaluate FAA\u2019s staffing standards.

In addition, the standards process is currently undergoing a congressionally requested review by an expert panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences.

FAA currently plans to increase both hiring and the overall size of the controller workforce over the next 4 years. In fiscal year 1997, FAA requested and received funds to hire 500 new controllers\u2014250 to replace controllers expected to leave the workforce that year and 250 to meet projected future needs. FAA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 request includes funds for 800 new controllers\u2014300 replacements and 500 new positions. Table 2.2 provides FAA\u2019s estimates of controller hiring, attrition, and the total workforce through fiscal year 2002. As the table shows, estimated attrition is expected to increase from 280 controllers in fiscal year 1997 to 550 controllers in fiscal year 2002.", "According to officials at FAA headquarters, the attrition estimates that support its recent staffing requests are based in part on the staffing standards forecast models and in part on another method that is intended to address an anticipated increase in the number of controllers eligible to retire. This second method is based on FAA\u2019s assumption that 20 percent of those who are eligible to retire will do so each year. According to FAA officials, because many controllers hired after the 1981 PATCO strike will first be eligible to retire around fiscal year 2001, they expect more controllers to retire each year as more become eligible. Figure 2.2 shows FAA\u2019s estimates of the number of controllers who will become eligible to retire each year though fiscal year 2007, as well as the estimated size of the total pool of those eligible to retire each year through fiscal year 2002, the last year of FAA\u2019s controller staffing plan. However, FAA officials were not able to specify how much of the estimated increase in attrition is predicted by the staffing standards forecast models and how much is derived from its estimate of future retirements.", "In addition to reflecting changes in the number of controllers eligible to retire, FAA\u2019s staffing plan also differs from the annual staffing levels projected by the staffing standards in several other ways. First, the plan anticipates hiring replacements 3 years before they are needed to provide them with adequate training. In this way, FAA will have fully trained replacements for those who retire. According to FAA officials, the plan also reflects an effort to spread out hiring over several years to reduce the training burden on its Academy and ATC facilities. Thus, because FAA\u2019s staffing plan is designed to hire enough controllers to be at the level specified by the standards in fiscal year 2002, controller staffing is expected to again be above the standards in fiscal years 1998-2001.", "Officials we interviewed in eight of FAA\u2019s nine regions expressed concerns about the adequacy of the future controller workforce that were similar to those expressed by headquarters officials. The regional officials were concerned about an increase in attrition in the coming years due to the pending retirement eligibility of those controllers who did not strike, those hired after 1981, and former PATCO members who have been rehired by FAA. Many of these officials also emphasized that FAA needs an adequate supply of new controllers to provide time to train replacements for those who retire."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workload Estimates Are Reasonable, but Attrition Estimates May Overstate Future Retirements", "paragraphs": ["The first key variable FAA uses to project future controller staffing needs is an estimate of the growth in the volume of air traffic, which FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Policy and Plans derives from a model that includes several measures of overall economic activity (e.g., the consumer price index) and aviation-specific statistics, as well as expert opinions on future trends. These estimates have been closer to actual traffic levels in the short term than over longer periods. For example, between fiscal years 1992 and 1995, the estimates of activity at en route centers that were made 1 year earlier came, on average, within 1 percent of the actual level of activity. The estimates made 4 years earlier were, on average, 7.4 percent higher than the actual level (see table 2.3). According to FAA officials, these estimates are reasonable because they fall within the 10-percent tolerance level of its models.", "In addition to estimates of future workload, FAA\u2019s staffing standards forecast models use projections of future attrition to determine controller staffing needs. These projections, called pipeline models, are based on actual experience over a recent 3-year period. FAA looks at who entered and left the controller workforce through several methods, such as retirement or resignation, promotion, or moving to or from a staff position. Using 3 years of data on actual movements, FAA determines what percentage of controllers entered or left the workforce by each method, then projects that percentage to future years. For example, in fiscal year 1995, 114 of 6,432 controllers at en route centers (or 1.8 percent) retired or resigned. By performing the same comparison for fiscal years 1993 through 1995 and averaging the results, FAA determined that on average 1.69 percent of the controllers at en route centers retired or resigned during that period. FAA then used this percentage to project future retirements or resignations of controllers at its en route centers. By using similar calculations for all types of controller movements to estimate the net gain or loss of controllers, FAA annually determines how many new controllers need to enter the training pipeline as replacements. FAA uses a separate model that uses similar variables to estimate the pipeline needs of its TRACON facilities and control towers. FAA\u2019s two pipeline models are currently based on actual changes in its controller workforce during fiscal years 1993 through 1995 and are used to forecast the workforce needed for fiscal years 1996 through 2006.", "While the pipeline models include estimates of the number of controllers who leave the workforce to take staff positions or return from such positions each year, according to agency officials, the number of controllers leaving to take such positions has roughly equalled the number of controllers returning, so there has been little net impact on the overall size of the controller workforce. Also, agency officials estimate that the number of controllers resigning from the workforce without qualifying for retirement will remain steady at about 40 controllers per year. As a result, although the models forecast attrition from all sources, the forecasts for new controllers are primarily the result of retirement estimates.", "We asked FAA for previous versions of its pipeline models so we could compare attrition estimates made by earlier models to actual data from recent years. Because FAA does not maintain copies of the models from previous years, officials could not provide us with attrition estimates for years prior to fiscal year 1995. However, FAA did provide copies of the models used to project attrition for fiscal year 1995. Table 2.4 shows that 20 more controllers retired or resigned in fiscal year 1995 than projected by the terminal and en route center models. Without data from earlier years, however, we were not able to evaluate the reasonableness of the attrition estimates produced by FAA\u2019s previous pipeline models."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Five Factors Limit the Reasonableness of FAA\u2019s Projections of Long-Term Controller Needs", "paragraphs": ["Because the actual rate at which controllers retire depends on the decisions of thousands of individual controllers, definitively predicting how many controllers will actually retire in any year is impossible. Most controllers hired under FERS are required to retire from actively controlling air traffic when they first become eligible, if they are at least 56. In contrast, most controllers hired under CSRS are not subject to mandatory retirement rules, unless hired after 1972. According to FAA officials, if a controller is not subject to mandatory retirement, such considerations as the state of the economy and the family status of the controller can affect the controller\u2019s decision about whether to continue working after becoming eligible to retire. Because such considerations are not within FAA\u2019s control, either a greater or lesser number of controllers could retire than forecast. If attrition estimates are too high, FAA could hire too many controllers, unnecessarily increasing the cost of operating the nation\u2019s ATC system. If attrition estimates are too low, FAA could have fewer controllers than needed, causing an unanticipated increase in the use of overtime and, in extreme cases, flight delays to ensure that the safety of the ATC system would not be compromised.", "Despite the difficulty of accurately predicting future needs, FAA has to estimate these needs to justify its budget requests for staffing and equipment.

There was no consensus, however, among the FAA regional and headquarters officials that we spoke with on the impact of these changes. While some believe the changes will only increase the reliability of the air traffic system, others believed there will be a long-term increase in productivity, resulting in a need for fewer controllers in the future. Others anticipate a short-term decrease in productivity while controllers learn to use the new equipment. In addition, FAA is finalizing changes to its training program (see ch. 3) that could reduce the training burden on local ATC facilities. To the extent that current controllers and supervisors are used to provide on-the-job-training for newly hired controllers, these changes could allow the facilities to use more staff to control traffic. Because these changes are still being developed, FAA has no way to quantify their impact on controller workload.

While FAA can determine when an individual controller will be eligible to retire, the information is not currently stored in a way in which it could be used to determine the retirement eligibility of FAA\u2019s entire controller workforce. Instead of actual retirement eligibility data, FAA has based its estimates of future retirements on the assumption that all controllers spend their entire career as active controllers. For example, FAA has assumed that all controllers who are at least 50 years old and have worked for FAA for at least 20 years would be eligible to retire. While this assumption could prove true in many cases, data from FAA\u2019s pipeline models have indicated that more than 1,300 controllers moved between the controller workforce and staff positions each year between 1993 and 1995. Because many controllers spend at least some time in staff positions where they do not actively control traffic, the date on which they become eligible for special controller retirement may be later than the one FAA has used in its estimates. As a result, they could retire later than FAA has anticipated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data on the Age and Service Time of Recently Retired Controllers Indicate That Fewer Controllers Could Retire in Future Years Than FAA Has Forecast", "paragraphs": ["Rather than estimating future retirements on the basis of assumptions about who will be eligible to retire, FAA could use actual information on the age and service time of those controllers who retired in recent years, as well as current controllers, to predict future retirements. Using data provided by FAA, we conducted such an analysis and found that, on average, controllers could retire later than projected by FAA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 through 2002 staffing plan.", "The simplest way to use recent experience to estimate future retirements is to apply the average age and service time of recent retirees to those controllers currently working for FAA. Using this approach, we found that, on average, controllers who retired in fiscal years 1992 through 1996 had about 31 years of federal service. Fewer than 15 percent retired with 25 years of federal service or less, one of the requirements for special controller retirement. As figure 2.4 shows, should current controllers not retire until they have earned 31 years of federal service, the number of retirees will be much lower than FAA has projected for each year between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. In fact, while FAA expects 510 controllers to retire in fiscal year 2002, the first year in which at least 510 current controllers reach 31 years of federal service is fiscal year 2008.", "Next, we looked at the age of the controllers who retired during the past 5 years and found that their average age was about 56. This age is also significant because federal law mandates that most controllers hired under FERS and controllers hired under CSRS after 1972 retire from actively controlling air traffic at age 56 unless granted an exemption. As figure 2.5 shows, the number of controllers who will turn 56 is lower than the number FAA expects to retire each year between fiscal years 1997 and 2002. The first year in which at least 510 current controllers turn 56 is fiscal year 2009.", "While using data on either the age or the service time of current controllers can illustrate changes in the characteristics of future retirees, it is preferable to base estimates of future retirements on both variables because future retirees must meet both age and service criteria. According to the official responsible for FAA\u2019s staffing standards forecast models, such an analysis would project future retirements more accurately than the current staffing standards models. However, such an analysis is also more complicated. To illustrate the combined effect of the age and service of current controllers, we developed a probability model based on both factors to project when each current controller would be likely to retire. Figure 2.6 compares FAA\u2019s retirement projections with our model\u2019s projections for fiscal years 1997 through 2011. For each fiscal year between 1999 and 2002, our model projects that at least 100 fewer controllers will retire than FAA estimates. Using this model, the number of estimated retirees does not exceed 510 controllers until fiscal year 2008. Appendix I explains the model in more detail and contains additional data.", "Table 2.5 compares the number of controller retirements FAA has projected with projections based on age, service time, and a combination of both. As this table shows, while FAA\u2019s estimated levels of retirements are close to those calculated using the age and service data in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, the difference between the number of potential retirements under FAA\u2019s assumptions and the projections derived from the age and service data is greater in later fiscal years.", "FAA officials said that the accuracy of the agency\u2019s retirement estimates is not a significant issue because the agency monitors retirements monthly and can hire more or fewer controllers as needed in future years should its predictions prove inaccurate. However, while FAA can adjust its hiring plans annually to ensure that the actual controller workforce remains equal to the levels specified by its standards, that does not eliminate the need for accurate projections because of the time needed to fully train a new controller. FAA tries to hire new controllers about 3 years before the retirement of those they are intended to replace. As a result, while adjusting hiring to reflect actual retirements each year can ensure that FAA has the correct number of controllers in its workforce, this approach will not ensure that FAA has an adequate number of fully trained controllers.", "While we do not question the need for FAA to hire enough controllers to safely operate our nation\u2019s ATC system in the current budget cycle, we are concerned that, should future controller retirements more closely follow the projections derived from FAA\u2019s data on controllers\u2019 age and service time, the agency could hire too many controllers in later years. Should fewer controllers retire than FAA has forecast, this would in effect increase the cost of running the ATC system because FAA would be paying for both its new controllers and those who the agency anticipated would retire but did not for several years. Considering the salary of starting controllers and the time it takes to fully train them, hiring new controllers before they are needed can be costly. For example, FAA\u2019s estimate of future retirees for fiscal year 2002 differs from those projected by using age and service data by between 211 controllers and 273 controllers. A new controller currently makes about $29,000 annually, and once benefits are added, the total cost of employing a new controller reaches about $40,000 annually. Because it takes about 3 years for a new controller to reach the full performance level, the approximate cost of the salary and benefits for a fully trained new controller totals about $120,000 for the first 3 years. If actual controller retirements in fiscal year 2002 are 211 controllers to 273 controllers fewer than FAA projects, FAA would spend between $25.3 million and $32.8 million between fiscal years 2000 and 2002 to hire and train those replacements that would not be needed.", "Conversely, if FAA did not hire enough controllers to replace those who retired, those who remained would have to handle more of the workload. According to FAA officials, this increased workload could cause an unanticipated increase in the use of overtime, and, in extreme cases, lead to flight delays caused by the reduction in services at some air traffic facilities. According to FAA officials, while such delays would be costly to the airlines and their passengers, the delays would not affect flight safety. FAA was not able, however, to provide us with the data needed to estimate the costs associated with such delays.", "Although officials we interviewed in eight of the nine FAA regions anticipated a significant increase in retirements in the next 10 years, they disagreed on how soon this increase could occur. While some stated that they expected to see a significant increase by fiscal years 2001 or 2002, others believed retirements would not increase significantly until fiscal year 2005 or later."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Because air traffic controllers are responsible for the safety of millions of passengers each year, better estimates by FAA of the future attrition of controllers would help ensure that the agency hires and trains an adequate workforce.

On the other hand, hiring too few controllers would also be costly, due to an increased use of overtime and flight delays. Predictions of the number of controllers FAA will need in the future depend on many unknown variables, including how the workload of controllers might change as a result of technological advances, policy changes, and the future attrition rate of the current workforce.

Until fiscal year 1990, all new controller candidates were required to receive initial screening and controller training, which included academic and skill-building training, at the Academy in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In fiscal years 1990 and 1991, FAA began relying on the MARC and CTI schools, respectively, to supplement its training program and to make more controller candidates available. FAA hired CTI and MARC graduates and placed them directly at ATC facilities, bypassing any training at the Academy. The graduates completed their on-the-job training, which consisted of classroom and hands-on instructional training provided by FPL controllers and contractors, at the facilities. In fiscal year 1992, however, FAA stopped providing initial controller training for newly hired controllers at the Academy because of a sharp decrease in controller hiring. Nevertheless, the MARC and CTI schools continued to provide controller training even though only 250 graduates were hired by FAA from fiscal years 1992 through 1995.", "Beginning in fiscal year 1998 under its revised controller training program, FAA will require all controller candidates enrolled in the CTI and MARC programs to successfully complete the technical skill-building portion of initial controller training at the Academy before being assigned to a facility.

Newly hired controllers, other than ones from the CTI and MARC programs, will receive academic and technical skill-building training at the Academy.

These initiatives include programs to promote regional recruitment and hiring of new controllers for regions with staffing problems, an interim incentive pay program to attract controllers to facilities with long-standing controller staffing problems, and the creation of the Office of Air Traffic Operations (ATO) within FAA headquarters to better coordinate controller transfers and develop an information-based method to more accurately determine controller staffing needs at the facility level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regional Recruitment and Hiring Would Reduce Staffing Differences", "paragraphs": ["As part of its initiatives to alleviate staffing problems, FAA is considering actions to increase hiring directly from areas with hard-to-staff facilities, such as expanding the CTI program to include more schools near these facilities and reactivating the cooperative education program. By creating a pool of candidates near hard-to-staff facilities, FAA expects that regions can attract additional new controllers from their preferred geographic areas. Under the proposed initiatives, regional officials will play a greater role in recruiting employees on a more localized basis.", "In response to our survey, the majority of regional officials we contacted told us that a greater role in local hiring would significantly help reduce controller staffing differences. Moreover, FAA officials told us that localized hiring would reduce the costs for PCS moves and produce a more motivated and satisfied controller workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interim Incentive Pay Program Is Designed to Address Staffing Differences", "paragraphs": ["In April 1996, FAA established an interim incentive pay program, similar to a pay demonstration program implemented in 1989, to attract controllers to seven major facilities that have a history of staffing problems. This program provides an incentive of 10-percent of the base pay for controllers working at these seven facilities: the New York En Route Center, New York TRACON facility, Chicago En Route Center, O\u2019Hare TRACON facility, O\u2019Hare Tower, Bay TRACON facility, and Oakland En Route Center. The interim incentive program is intended to be in effect until fiscal year 1998 when a new ATS pay system is expected to be implemented. The new pay system is one of several efforts under FAA\u2019s new personnel reform initiatives, which the agency began implementing in April 1996.", "In response to our survey, officials at the Chicago En Route Center commented that the interim incentive pay program has played an important role in attracting new controllers to their facility. For example, over the last year, several new controllers have transferred to the facility, which has helped address staffing problems. FAA headquarters officials told us that they expect the interim program will help recruit and retain controllers at other hard-to-staff facilities until a long-term program is in place, such as the new pay system FAA is developing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Air Traffic Operations Oversees Controller Allocations to Reduce Staffing Differences", "paragraphs": ["In early 1996, FAA headquarters created ATO to (1) ensure that facilities are staffed at appropriate levels, (2) verify that newly-hired controllers are placed where critical staffing vacancies exist, and (3) monitor regional staffing allocations, among other resource allocation functions. ATO officials work with headquarters, regional, and facility officials to ensure that staffing imbalances do not occur due to controller transfers or reassignments and to verify that new controllers are placed where vacancies exist.", "For example, ATO officials gather information on staffing requirements and air traffic operations from regional and facility officials to verify that facilities are staffed according to current needs. Using this information, ATO officials have consulted with headquarters officials who are responsible for agencywide resources and budgeting to make recommendations on staffing allocations. As part of this process, ATO officials have monitored controller moves and transfers to ensure that staffing imbalances do not occur because of changes in controller allocations. Agreement between ATO and other headquarters officials must be reached on changes in controller allocations.", "To better address staffing needs at ATC facilities, ATO has developed and is testing a new computer program to provide a mechanism for air traffic managers in FAA headquarters, regions, and facilities to evaluate the past utilization of controller resources and more effectively project controller staffing requirements. According to ATO officials, the new computer program will provide more accurate facility-level staffing requirements than the staffing standards because it includes operational data on the number of hours controllers have actually performed ATC functions and activities such as training, leave, and administrative duties. ATO officials told us that the new computer program will also provide a standardized method to better project controller staffing needs at individual ATC facilities. They plan to use this program in conjunction with the staffing standards.

However, FAA\u2019s practice of distributing PCS funds at the end of the fiscal year not only delays controller transfers but could create staffing problems in future years. FAA officials recognize the potential for these problems but face difficult choices in their efforts to move controllers to fill critical vacancies, while maintaining the flexibility to respond to budget shortfalls throughout the fiscal year.
