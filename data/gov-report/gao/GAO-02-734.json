This increased use of interagency contracts is a result of reforms and legislation passed in the 1990s, allowing agencies to streamline the acquisition process, operate more like businesses, and offer increasing numbers of services to other agencies. Most of the contract service programs GAO reviewed reported an excess of revenues over costs in at least one year between fiscal years 1999 and 2001. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance directs agencies with governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC) or franchise fund programs to account for and recover fully allocated actual costs and to report on their financial results. Agencies are to identify all direct and indirect costs and charge fees to ordering agencies based on these costs. However, some GWAC programs have not identified or accurately reported the full cost of providing interagency contract services. OMB's guidance further directs that agencies return GWAC earnings to the miscellaneous receipts account of the U.S. Treasury's General Fund. However, this guidance conflicts with the operations of agencies' revolving funds, which were established by statutes that allow retention of excess revenues. The Federal Supply Schedules program has generated hefty earnings, largely because of the rapid growth of information technology sales. Rather than adjust the fee, however, the General Services Administration has used the earnings primarily to support its stock and fleet programs. However, the significant amount of earnings means that Federal Supply Schedules program customers are being consistently overcharged for the contract services they are buying."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are increasingly using contracts and acquisition services offered by other agencies and paying a fee for these services.

The Clinger-Cohen Act authorized creation of GWACs, which are typically multiple-award contracts for information technology that allow an indefinite quantity of goods or services (within specified limits) to be furnished during a fixed period, with deliveries scheduled through orders with the contractor. The providing agency awards the contract, and other agencies order from it.", "OMB was authorized by the Clinger-Cohen Act to designate agency heads as executive agents for GWACs. Some agencies had already established information technology contracts prior to the OMB designation. However, according to agency officials, the OMB designation is beneficial to them because it enables them to provide a streamlined contracting process, it creates opportunities to leverage the buying power of customer agencies, and it helps them market their contracting services. Table 1 shows the year in which agencies received OMB\u2019s designation.", "The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized the Director of OMB, in consultation with congressional committees, to designate six franchise fund pilots that would operate as fully self-supporting business- like entities within the federal government to compete for the delivery of common administrative support services to federal customers. Franchise fund programs provide administrative services such as contracting, systems operation, and payroll processing, in addition to information technology. Interior\u2019s program, GovWorks, provides contracting services for a wide range of goods and services.", "The Schedules program, part of GSA\u2019s Federal Supply Service, provides federal agencies with a streamlined process to obtain commonly used products and services at prices associated with volume buying. Information technology is the biggest business line in the Schedules program. Interagency purchases of information technology from the Schedules program exceed those made from all GWAC programs combined.", "GWACs, franchise fund pilot programs, and the Schedules program charge fees for services with the intent to recover costs. Fees are based on known costs, estimates of future costs and revenues, and consideration of the prices charged by the competition for similar services.

Table 2 shows reported earnings based on financial statements for the contract programs.", "Starting in 1999, OMB required that agencies with GWACs should identify, account for, and recover fully allocated actual costs in accordance with federal financial accounting standards. Actual costs include direct costs, such as labor and materials, and indirect costs, such as rent and support services. However, agencies do not consistently report revenues and costs in accordance with OMB\u2019s guidance. They have developed their own approaches to accounting and to reporting program costs, and these approaches are evolving as the agencies make periodic changes.", "OMB requires each GWAC agency to submit a semi-annual report of its activities. However, OMB has not required annual financial summaries of program results that would include a description of the agencies\u2019 indirect cost allocation methodologies and provide an entire year\u2019s worth of information on program results.  Accordingly, OMB was unaware that not all agencies are reporting revenues and costs in accordance with its guidance. Further, while GSA identifies, allocates, and reports actual costs for both its GWAC program and the Schedules program, other agencies\u2019 records are not as complete. We found instances of incomplete identification and allocation of indirect costs, partial reporting of program results, and overstated indirect costs, as shown in the examples below.", "Without more complete information on the costs of interagency contract services, there is no assurance that fees accurately reflect costs.", "NASA does not include any costs for rent, utilities, contract support, or program management in the account that summarizes GWAC costs. Further, NASA components do not pay a fee for using the GWAC because of an agencywide practice of not charging fees to internal users of NASA\u2019s own contracts. Consequently, both the costs recorded in the GWAC account and GWAC revenues are understated. NASA officials noted that NASA is making an in-kind contribution to the program by not charging administrative costs, and that this contribution is sufficient to ensure that external customer fees are not subsidizing NASA\u2019s own use of the GWAC program. However, NASA provided us only a rough analysis, prepared in 1999, of the costs and potential revenues involved. NASA stated that it intends to periodically reassess its financial contribution to the GWAC program.", "NIH\u2019s GWAC financial results do not include some indirect costs for support services provided by the NIH Office of the Director, such as acquisition policy, budget services, and equal opportunity programs. In addition, the fiscal year 2001 financial results, prepared by NIH\u2019s financial office, reported GWAC earnings of $57,837, an understatement due to two factors.  First, reported revenues from NIH\u2019s internal customers were not combined with revenues from external customers. If internal and external revenues had been combined as one line item, reported earnings would have increased to $268,219. Second, the program was overcharged by $729,870 for indirect costs, including rent and utilities, because of an accounting error. NIH officials informed us that corrective actions have been taken on both problems for fiscal year 2002. However, NIH officials do not plan to identify or allocate additional Office of the Director\u2019s costs, because they do not believe it would be cost-effective to do so.", "Transportation\u2019s GWAC operates within the Transportation Administrative Service Center and is allocated a portion of the center\u2019s indirect costs. Indirect costs allocated to the program have fluctuated substantially from year to year. Such fluctuations significantly impact reported program operating results. For example, the GWAC\u2019s indirect costs jumped by more than 90 percent in fiscal year 2001, because the indirect cost allocation was based on an estimated GWAC sales volume that was not realized. This allocation was not adjusted at the end of the year to reflect actual sales. If actual sales had been used, the indirect costs allocated to the GWAC would have been about $600,000 lower and would have substantially reduced the program\u2019s reported loss of about $1 million that year. Program officials restructured their fees for fiscal year 2002, in part due to prior year losses.", "Full costing is also a key principle of the franchise fund pilot programs. OMB\u2019s guidance states that the operation should be self-sustaining and that fees should fully recover costs. Interior\u2019s progress in identifying and recovering full costs has evolved over time. However, program officials have not fully allocated indirect costs at the department level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflict Exists between GWAC Agencies\u2019 Operation of Their Revolving Funds and OMB\u2019s Guidance on Earnings", "paragraphs": ["The legislation authorizing GWACs was silent with respect to how agencies should account for financial transactions under the contracts; for example, how to obligate funds for the contract and how to account for revenue. Thus, agencies administering GWACs were left to their own devices when determining whether these financial transactions would be accounted for through existing revolving funds or in stand-alone accounts. The GWACs at NIH, Transportation, and the Federal Technology Service operate under revolving funds, while NASA and Commerce operate their GWACs in stand-alone reimbursable accounts.", "OMB guidance on earnings stipulates that (1) GWAC fees should be adjusted so that total revenues do not exceed actual costs and (2) revenues generated in excess of the agency\u2019s actual costs are to be transferred to the miscellaneous receipts account of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s General Fund. However, the way agencies operate their GWACs under revolving funds conflicts with OMB\u2019s guidance. Agency officials told us that they have accounted for GWAC revenue in the same manner that the law authorizes them to account for revenue from other programs in their revolving funds. Thus, they have used earnings generated by some products and services\u2014including GWACs\u2014to offset losses incurred by other products and services. Further, they are permitted to retain earnings in their revolving funds and use those earnings for authorized purposes of the fund, unless the law governing operation of the fund requires them to transfer amounts to the Treasury. Agency officials maintain that their fund legislation prevails over the OMB guidance where there is a conflict between the two. OMB officials told us that they plan to review this issue.", "The different approaches GWAC programs have taken when revenues exceeded costs are discussed below:   From fiscal years 1999 to 2001, NIH reported revenues in excess of costs from its GWAC operations. For the 3 years combined, the GWACs\u2019 $4 million of earnings offset $3.6 million in losses in other revolving fund acquisition programs. For fiscal year 2001, the most recent year for which actual costs are available, reported GWAC earnings of $268,219 offset other programs\u2019 losses of $116,590.  NIH lowered its fee for orders placed with its small business contractors for the two GWACs awarded in fiscal year 2001. The fee for orders with larger businesses did not change.", "Within its revolving fund, the Federal Technology Service\u2019s IT Solutions program manages GWACs and provides other information technology services to federal agencies. The program\u2019s earnings are used to provide resources for future investment based on revolving fund plans approved by OMB. Losses within segments of the program are offset against earnings in other programs or covered by using retained earnings from this fund. For example, $3.6 million in earnings generated by GWACs in fiscal year 2001 offset losses in some other business lines, in particular the information security program.", "NASA does not have a revolving fund and, therefore, its GWAC operates in a stand-alone account. NASA records show that for revenues received in fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, NASA\u2019s GWAC accounts had year-end balances of $688,247, $1,106,155, and $573,114, respectively.  NASA\u2019s practice has been to carry over balances remaining from one fiscal year to the next. However, NASA now intends to revise its current practice and to obligate funds in support of its GWAC in the fiscal year received, to the extent possible. NASA lowered its fees in fiscal years 1999 and 2000, and raised them for fiscal year 2001, when it awarded a new version of its GWAC.", "Other interagency contracting services we reviewed allow the providing agency to retain funds. For example, franchise fund legislation allows Interior\u2019s franchise fund to retain an amount not to exceed 4 percent of the total annual income for the acquisition of capital equipment and other specified uses.

Nevertheless, program officials have not adjusted the fee.", "Because the program has been highly profitable since 1997, we analyzed the use of revenues in excess of costs over the past 5 years. From 1997 to 2001, the program reported $210.8 million in earnings. Figure 2 shows earnings and costs during this period.", "GSA records show that it used the $210.8 million in earnings as follows:   $192 million was used to support other programs, primarily GSA\u2019s fleet and stock programs. Support of the fleet program primarily involved financing the procurement of vehicles.  Support of the stock program primarily involved offsetting substantial losses in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The revolving fund legislation allows earnings to be used for these purposes.   $4.4 million of fiscal year 1998 earnings was transferred to the miscellaneous receipts account of the General Fund of the Treasury.", "GSA has not yet made a decision on how to use $14.4 million of Schedules program earnings from fiscal year 2001.", "The Schedules program fee was established at 1 percent in 1995. According to GSA officials, the program was intended to break even, with the fee recovering program costs including contract administration and program support. GSA officials explained that the profitability of the Schedules program is much greater than expected due to the inclusion of the information technology schedule and its dramatic growth. For fiscal years 1997 through 2001, information technology revenues grew 287 percent, and this program now comprises about two-thirds of all Schedules program sales.", "In 1999, the GSA Inspector General recommended that the fee be adjusted to bring it in line with costs, noting that for two years the program had been generating nearly twice the revenue needed to cover program costs.While GSA generally concurred with the recommendation, it did not implement a change in the fee at that time due to concerns about the administrative cost and the time such an action would entail. GSA told the Inspector General that it was not practical to take action until it was confident that the fee would be stable for an extended period of time. Despite an additional 3 years of similar earnings, GSA has taken no action to bring its fee in line with costs.", "GSA maintains that it still has not experienced marketplace stability sufficient to accurately forecast the Schedules business volume.  Further, GSA officials stated that adjusting the fee would be burdensome for the thousands of Schedules contractors. They said that one key obstacle is that the 1 percent fee is embedded in the unit cost of the goods and services on the Schedules. Our review showed that some other interagency contract programs, such as NIH\u2019s and NASA\u2019s GWACs, have established their fees as add-ons to the price of goods and services. This approach gives them the flexibility to change their fees without affecting the unit price of their goods and services and provides transparency to customers on the fee being paid.", "OMB has expressed concern about the large earnings the Schedules program has generated. With a 3-year restructuring of its business lines nearing completion, and recognizing the need for flexibility in setting Schedules program fees, GSA is now considering options to design a flexible fee adjustment.

Thus, there is no assurance that the fees they are charging accurately reflect their costs. Further, because some agencies have not submitted to OMB complete annual financial results, OMB is not receiving clear information on how earnings have been used and whether fees were adjusted accordingly.

The agencies have not brought the problem to OMB\u2019s attention. In its monitoring and oversight role over the GWAC program, OMB needs to determine how this conflict can be addressed.", "Despite consistently high earnings in the Schedules program, GSA has not adjusted the 1 percent contract service fee it charges customers.

OMB stated that it intends to work with OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Financial Management and the agencies to evaluate appropriate revisions to its reporting requirements on fees so that disparities between fees charged and costs incurred can more easily be identified and addressed. OMB also intends to work with GWAC executive agents and the GSA\u2019s Federal Supply Service to address the handling of excess revenues generated by their programs, including appropriate disposition of funds and adjustment of fees.

We believe that this characterization is warranted, based on the fact that revenues exceeded costs by more than 53 percent or $151 million during this period.  GSA also commented that \u201cthe statement that profits from the Schedules program are being held at too high a level in order to offset losses in another program is incorrect.\u201d  We revised the text to indicate that earnings from the Schedules program were used to offset losses in the stock program and to finance vehicle purchases for the fleet program.  GSA also stated that it does not seem very practical to compare the much smaller numbers of contracts at NASA and NIH with the number of Schedules contracts that would have to be renegotiated if the fee were adjusted. Our intent was to point out that because the fee add-on mechanism is used by other agencies, it may be one option GSA could consider in adjusting its fee.", "Finally, while agreeing that the current fee mechanism lacks the flexibility to match costs and revenues over time, GSA pointed out the complexity of such an undertaking and the desire to minimize the impact on customers, contracting partners, GSA, and the Schedules program itself. We acknowledge the complexity of implementing a flexible fee structure. However, given that the program has consistently reported earnings well in excess of costs for several years, we believe steps need to be taken now to begin the process of adjusting the fee.  GSA also offered technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate.  GSA\u2019s letter appears in appendix III.", "The Department of the Interior stated that the information and recommendations in our report provide OMB helpful guidance for oversight of a growing interagency program.

In responding to our draft report, NASA prepared the financial results that accompany its comments.  These annual results are substantially different than the semi-annual earnings results that NASA had reported to OMB for fiscal year 2001.  On a combined basis, the semi- annual reports showed a loss of $235,817, whereas the annual financial results showed that the program had earnings of $646,645.  We have incorporated the latest results into table 2 and appendix IX.", "NASA also provided additional details on its rationale for not assessing costs to NASA customers for use of the GWAC and asserted that NASA has not used assessments against other agencies to cover its share of the administrative costs. We have reflected these points in the report.  NASA also stated that program personnel conducted a \u201cdeliberative analysis\u201d of the costs involved. However, program personnel provided us with only a rough analysis, prepared in 1999, to support the cost assessment.  NASA plans to periodically reassess the apportionment of NASA and non-NASA costs and NASA\u2019s in-kind contribution versus the fees paid by external customers.", "NASA also elaborated on its rationale for carrying over balances remaining from one fiscal year to the next.  It now plans to revise this practice and to obligate, to the extent possible, funds in the fiscal year they are received. Recognizing that NASA\u2019s lack of authority for a working capital fund has caused concerns about the authority under which it manages its GWAC, NASA has proposed legislation to establish a fund for the agency in fiscal year 2003.
