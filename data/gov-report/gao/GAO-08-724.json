Ensuring that IHS-funded facilities enroll individuals in--and obtain reimbursement from--Medicare and Medicaid can provide an important means of expanding the funding for health care services for the population served by IHS. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Medicare and oversees states' Medicaid programs, is required by Executive Order and HHS policy to consult with Indian tribes on policies that have tribal implications. This requirement is in recognition of the unique government-to-government relationship between the 562 federally recognized Indian tribes and the federal government. GAO was asked to (1) describe interactions between CMS and IHS, (2) examine mechanisms CMS uses to interact and consult with Indian tribes, (3) examine mechanisms that selected states' Medicaid programs use to interact and consult with Indian tribes, and (4) identify barriers to Medicare and Medicaid enrollment and efforts to help eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives apply for and enroll in these programs. GAO reviewed documents, interviewed federal and state officials, and visited a judgmental sample of Indian tribes and IHS-funded facilities in six states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS and IHS have interacted to (1) provide support to IHS-funded facilities and tribes in their access to Medicare and Medicaid and (2) address broader policy and regulatory concerns regarding these programs. Their interactions to provide support have included education and technical assistance; the agencies also have interacted to obtain input from tribal representatives on program operations. On broader policy and regulatory concerns, CMS and IHS have worked on policy initiatives aimed at ensuring that existing health care policies meet the needs of IHS-funded facilities and the populations they serve. CMS and IHS have had mixed success identifying whether proposed CMS regulatory changes would affect IHS-funded facilities or their populations and thus warrant IHS review. CMS has been working to improve its identification of such regulations. CMS has used two key mechanisms--tribal liaisons and an advisory board--to interact with representatives from Indian tribes, and it has relied primarily on annual regional sessions sponsored by HHS as its mechanism to consult with Indian tribes. Tribal liaisons in CMS's central and regional offices generally served as the point of contact for tribal representatives. CMS's tribal advisory board, which is meant to complement but not replace consultation, has provided the agency with advice on policies affecting the delivery of health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives. CMS has used annual HHS regional consultation sessions as the primary basis for consulting with Indian tribes. However, consulting with tribes is an inherently difficult task, in part because of the variation in tribes' size, location, and economic status. Further, these HHS regional sessions--which generally lasted 1 to 2 days and covered all HHS programs--have offered limited time for consultation and discussion. The six state Medicaid programs we reviewed have used at least one of three mechanisms--tribal liaisons, advisory boards, and regular meetings--to interact and consult with Indian tribes. Five of the six states reported having policies in place that governed the interactions between the state's Medicaid program and Indian tribes, with most of these policies establishing guidelines for how consultation should be conducted. Five states reported consulting with tribes about changes to their Medicaid programs. American Indians and Alaska Natives have faced several barriers to Medicare and Medicaid enrollment despite efforts to assist them with the application process. Many of these barriers are similar to those experienced by other populations, such as transportation and financial barriers. To help eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives enroll in Medicare and Medicaid, almost all of the IHS-funded facilities we visited had staff who assisted patients with the application process, including helping them complete and submit applications, and collecting required documentation. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS noted that it was appreciative of GAO's review of CMS activities related to interactions with IHS and tribes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States recognizes each of the more than 560 federally  recognized Indian tribes as sovereign nations within its borders. These  tribes, which are located in over 30 states, vary greatly in population,  economic status, and land ownership, and have a unique government-to- government relationship with the federal government. According to  federal law, this unique relationship includes a responsibility for the  provision of health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The  Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), provides or arranges for the provision of  health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. In fiscal  year 2007, IHS provided or arranged health care services for  approximately 1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Services  are provided through IHS-funded facilities, including those operated by  IHS and those operated by tribes, or purchased from other public and  private providers\u2014referred to as contract health services.", "IHS is funded through appropriations, which in fiscal years 2006 and 2007  were approximately $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. In addition  to federal appropriations, IHS-funded facilities can seek reimbursement  for services they provide to individuals enrolled in Medicare, the federal  health insurance program for elderly and disabled individuals, and for  those enrolled in Medicaid, a joint federal and state health financing  program for certain low-income families and low-income individuals who  are aged or disabled. Reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid can  increase the amount of funds available to IHS-funded facilities because by  law they can retain reimbursement from these programs without an  offsetting reduction in their appropriated funding. In fiscal year 2007, IHS  reported approximately $677 million in reimbursement from Medicare and  Medicaid; however, facilities vary greatly in the total reimbursement  obtained from these programs. For example, our prior work found that  Medicaid reimbursement across 12 IHS-funded facilities ranged from   2 percent to 49 percent of the total direct medical care budgets of these  facilities, and that facilities with higher reimbursement had additional  funds to hire staff and purchase equipment and supplies. As a result,  ensuring that eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives are enrolled in  Medicare and Medicaid, and that IHS-funded facilities obtain  reimbursement for services provided to these enrolled individuals, can  provide an important means of expanding the funding for health care  services available to this population.", "Changes to Medicare and Medicaid can affect the enrollment of American  Indians and Alaska Natives in these programs and the ability of IHS-funded  facilities to claim reimbursement for enrolled individuals. Interactions  between Indian tribes, IHS, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), the agency within HHS that administers Medicare and  oversees states\u2019 Medicaid programs, can help prevent policy changes from  having unforeseen effects on tribes and IHS-funded facilities. For example,  if changes in a Medicaid program\u2019s delivery system\u2014such as moving to a  system of managed care\u2014are discussed with tribes and IHS officials, then  consequences\u2014such as IHS-funded facilities not being part of managed  care systems\u2014may be avoided. Recognizing the unique status of Indian  tribes, a 1998 Executive Order required a specific type of interaction  between federal agencies and Indian tribes, called consultation, which  required federal agencies to have an effective process to ensure  meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of  regulatory policies that have tribal implications. In 2005, HHS adopted a  tribal consultation policy, under which every agency within HHS shares  the responsibility to coordinate, communicate, and consult with Indian  tribes. Thus, CMS is required to consult with Indian tribes on program  issues that have tribal implications. In contrast, states are not subject to  the Executive Order or HHS\u2019s tribal consultation policy. However, CMS  has encouraged state Medicaid programs to consult with tribes when  making changes to their Medicaid programs. Moreover, some states have  policies requiring consultation between the state Medicaid program and  Indian tribes.", "Given the importance of CMS programs to American Indians and Alaska  Natives, you asked us to examine the interactions between the Medicare  and Medicaid programs with IHS-funded facilities. This report   (1) describes interactions between CMS and IHS, (2) examines  mechanisms CMS uses to interact and consult with Indian tribes,   (3) examines mechanisms that selected states\u2019 Medicaid programs use to  interact and consult with Indian tribes, and (4) identifies barriers to  enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid and efforts to help eligible American  Indians and Alaska Natives apply for and enroll in these programs.", "To describe interactions between CMS and IHS, we interviewed officials  from both agencies. Specifically, within CMS, we interviewed officials  from its central office and 9 of its 10 regional offices who have  responsibility for coordinating issues related to Indian tribes and IHS, as  well as other CMS officials, including officials knowledgeable about  interactions between CMS and IHS. Within IHS, we interviewed  headquarters officials involved in interacting with CMS, including those in  the Office of Resource Access & Partnerships. We also interviewed  officials in each of IHS\u2019s 12 area offices identified by IHS executives as  being the most knowledgeable about Medicare- and Medicaid-related  issues. (See app. I for a map of the locations covered by the IHS area  offices and the CMS regional offices.) In our interviews, we asked CMS  and IHS officials about their interactions with the other agency. During the  interviews we obtained information about the development and review  process for regulations and how CMS and IHS interact to identify  proposed CMS regulations that may affect IHS-funded facilities. To  supplement this information, we interviewed officials from the HHS Office  of the Executive Secretariat, which is responsible for determining which  agencies within HHS should have the opportunity to review a regulation.  We also interviewed officials from the HHS Office of Tribal Affairs about  HHS activities related to American Indians and Alaska Natives that involve  IHS and CMS. Additionally, we reviewed relevant CMS and IHS  documentation to supplement information obtained during our interviews.", "To examine mechanisms that CMS uses to interact and consult with Indian  tribes, we reviewed information obtained during our interviews with the  CMS and HHS officials noted above. We also interviewed tribal  representatives to obtain their opinions about interactions with CMS.  During the course of our interviews with CMS and HHS officials, we asked  them about past and present interactions, including consultations, with  tribes. We conducted site visits in 3 of the 12 IHS areas from September  through November 2007. We selected these 3 areas to represent a mix in  terms of geographic location, level of reliance on contract health services,  and the entities operating the facilities (IHS or tribes). (See app. II for  more detailed information about the methodology for our site visits.)  During our site visits we met with tribal leaders or designated officials  from 14 tribes, and interviewed them regarding their interactions with  CMS and elicited their opinions about CMS\u2019s consultation with Indian  tribes. To better understand CMS\u2019s consultation activities, we reviewed  CMS\u2019s involvement in HHS regional consultation sessions. To do this, we  interviewed HHS officials from the four HHS regional offices that  corresponded to the location of the tribes we visited and reviewed  agendas and reports from these regions\u2019 consultation sessions. We  interviewed over 15 additional tribal representatives, including officials  from area health boards\u2014who serve as the voice for tribes in their area on  health-related issues\u2014and tribal representatives who are members of  CMS\u2019s Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG), an advisory board  created to inform CMS about issues affecting the delivery of health care to  American Indians and Alaska Natives served by CMS programs. Finally, we  observed several TTAG meetings and reviewed relevant documentation,  such as minutes, from prior TTAG meetings.", "To examine mechanisms that selected states\u2019 Medicaid programs use to  interact and consult with Indian tribes, we interviewed Medicaid officials  in the six states that corresponded to the location of the 14 tribes we  visited. We asked these officials about interactions and consultations  between the state Medicaid program and Indian tribes in the state. We also  reviewed relevant documentation, such as state policies that govern  interactions with tribes. Additionally, we used information gathered from  our interviews with tribal leaders and other tribal representatives.", "To identify barriers to enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid and efforts to  help eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives apply for and enroll in  these programs, we used information obtained from our interviews with  CMS, IHS, and state officials as well as tribal representatives. Additionally,  during our site visits, we interviewed officials at 25 IHS-funded facilities,  13 of which were operated by IHS and 12 of which were operated by  tribes. During these interviews, we asked officials about barriers to  Medicare and Medicaid enrollment, enrollment assistance provided, and  outreach activities. We also interviewed officials from the Social Security  Administration (SSA), the federal agency responsible for Medicare  enrollment, about barriers to Medicare enrollment and the agency\u2019s  outreach activities. In addition, we conducted a literature review about  barriers related to enrolling in Medicare and Medicaid. Where available,  we reviewed relevant documentation to supplement the information found  during our interviews.", "The information from the six state Medicaid programs provides insight  about the interactions and consultations between state Medicaid programs  and Indian tribes, but it cannot be generalized to other states.

The  agenda for TTAG meetings has been formulated jointly by tribal  representatives and CMS officials, allowing for both CMS and tribal  priorities to be discussed. The TTAG\u2019s composition, schedule, and  structure have provided an opportunity for CMS to obtain input from tribal  members. For example:    The TTAG has members from each IHS area and TTAG members gather  information and views about CMS policies from tribes nationwide.  Specifically, seven of the eight TTAG area representatives we spoke with  indicated that they solicited information and obtained input from regular  meetings with tribes in their area, often through the area health board or  its equivalent.

The amount of notice  tribes were given about the date of the regional consultation session  ranged from 3 to 8 weeks across the four HHS regions we reviewed.", "In addition to the CMS-related discussions at the HHS consultation  sessions, CMS officials have held consultation meetings with individual  tribes or smaller groups of tribes. For example, CMS has consulted with  the Navajo Nation about Medicaid issues the tribe has faced since its  reservation is located across three states. Additionally, in January 2008,  CMS officials traveled to Washington State to consult with the state\u2019s  Medicaid program and Indian tribes about a proposed amendment to  Washington State\u2019s Medicaid program that would stipulate how tribes in  Washington state can receive federal reimbursement for Medicaid  administrative activities.", "Tribal representatives had varying opinions on the effectiveness of the  CMS and HHS consultations, including varying perspectives on the agency  officials involved and the format of the consultation sessions. One tribal  representative commented that leaders in CMS attend the meetings and  are willing to share information, while another tribal representative  commented that the officials who attend the sessions are not able to make  decisions. Additionally, a third tribal representative explained that high- level officials who can make decisions attend the consultation sessions,  but that these officials do not have the necessary information to answer  questions. This variation may be due, at least in part, to regional  differences in participation. Regarding the format of the consultation  sessions, one tribal representative commented that the regional  consultation sessions were fairly effective at identifying the issues that  should be raised at the national level.
