To build the capacity of Iraq's central and provincial governments to sustain this effort, the United States is implementing programs including Department of State's (State) Provincial Reconstruction Development Committee (PRDC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) National Capacity Development (NCD). The use of key management controls, such as appropriate organizational structure and program monitoring, helps ensure programs achieve their objectives. Through field visits in Iraq, interviews with program officials, analyses of official reports, and examination of a sample of projects, we assessed whether the PRDC and NCD's management controls support the programs' objectives of building the capacity of Iraq's government. We also assessed Iraq's commitment to sustaining these U.S. programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Through the PRDC program, State and USACE work with Iraqis in the provinces to develop proposals and undertake small-scale projects such as building schools, repairing roads, and developing water facilities. However, weaknesses in State's management controls hinder achieving the program objective to build provincial government capacity. First, the program involves multiple organizations and a complex process but had no clearly identified program manager until May 2009 when State designated one in response to GAO's findings. Second, State lacks a performance monitoring system that measures progress toward building provincial capacity to deliver essential services. Third, the program's guidelines and policies have changed frequently, but State did not adequately communicate or consult with the USACE, the program implementer, about these changes. Finally, USACE's financial controls for the timekeeping process did not ensure adequate documentation of time and attendance records for labor charges on projects. USAID's management controls generally supported the NCD program's objective of building ministry capacity by training Iraqi employees in administrative skills such as planning and budgeting and supporting Iraqi training centers. First, USAID's organizational structure is clear, including who is responsible for overall program management. Second, in response to an audit report, USAID narrowed the NCD program objective to improving ministries' administrative capabilities and clearly linked them to measures of outcome. Some of these measures include Iraqi ministries' execution of their capital budgets, including the number of capital projects approved and the rate of spending on capital projects. USAID reported it was on track to meet or exceed its 2008 targeted results. However, as of March 2009, final data on results were not available. Third, USAID's guidelines and program expectations for NCD are documented, clear, and communicated throughout the organization. However, with regard to financial controls, GAO found that USAID officials did not confirm receipt of goods and services for invoices totaling about $17 million of $79 million, prior to payment. The officials did not always document reasons such as security risks, when confirmation was not possible. Iraq has committed to sustaining U.S.-funded programs and sharing in their costs, but actual budget expenditures for such activities are unclear. For the PRDC program, 16 of the 40 projects in our sample had evidence that the Iraqi government agreed to sustain the project; however, the records did not specify actual financial or budget commitments. For the NCD program, the Iraqi government is supporting the program by providing trainers and allocating funds in their 2009 budgets for training center equipment and other NCD efforts. These funds are to be spent in 2009. We have previously reported that the Iraqi government includes funding in its budgets for investment activities such as operating and maintaining U.S.-funded reconstruction projects and training, but does not subsequently expend these funds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, the United States has provided $49 billion to rebuild and  stabilize Iraq, including the reconstruction of large water and power  plants.

In addition, according to a senior GRD official, ITAO had not  communicated adequately and consistently about the guidelines and  changes. For example, in January 2008, State shifted the focus of the  PRDC program from building infrastructure to maintaining and sustaining  projects. According to ITAO officials, State emphasized sustaining local  operations and maintenance services of U.S.-procured infrastructure,  strategic planning for the infrastructure projects, and capacity building for  provincial governments\u2019 professional staff.

By the end of its second year, the NCD program trained more than 25,000  Iraqi civil servants in project management, accounting, and risk analysis,  according to a USAID report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID Monitors NCD Program Impacts but Had to Revise Overall Objectives", "paragraphs": ["USAID uses a results framework with indicators that measure program  outputs and outcomes to monitor progress toward program objectives.  Through this framework, USAID reviews program activities, makes  corrections to identified problems, and responds to audit reports. During  the second year of the NCD program, USAID revised its indicators in  response to a November 2008 USAID Inspector General\u2019s report stating  that the NCD program did not have indicators to measure the program\u2019s  impact in improving key ministries\u2019 delivery of core services. For  example, USAID measured many of its output goals such as training Iraqi  employees, establishing regional training centers, and awarding  scholarships. However, there were no outcome indicators to measure the  achievement of USAID\u2019s goal to build the capacity of key Iraqi ministries  to deliver core services. As a result, USAID narrowed its overall program  indicators and stated it would begin to track the budget execution rates of  Iraqi ministries such as the percentage of ministries\u2019 approved budget that  is spent. For example, USAID will now monitor the value of capital  projects approved, the number of capital projects approved by the  Ministry of Planning, and the rate of capital projects implemented.", "In 2007, 3 out of the 20 NCD program accomplishment indicators were  output\u2014or numeric\u2014goals, such as number of civil servants trained or the  number of scholarships awarded. However, in 2008, the NCD program  emphasized the measurement of results and included additional outcome  indicators in its accomplishment reporting. For instance, 14 out of the 24  indicators measured outcomes, or actual improvements. Some of the  outcome indicators for 2008 included the extent to which trainees were  using their new skills at work and saw related improvements at their  office; whether the ministries were implementing improved fiscal  information technology systems, based on USAID contractor\u2019s  recommendations; and the extent to which ministries and the Iraqi  government\u2019s public administration training center, the National Center  for Consultation and Management Development, were initiating their own  training.

In October 2008, USAID reported that some target measures  were exceeded, some were not achieved, and several were on track. For  instance, the program did not achieve its target for significant  improvement reported by graduates within their ministry or unit. We  observed and participants told us during our site visits in October 2008  that many of the trainees were lower-level employees who lacked the  authority to implement their new skills within the units to which they  returned after training. USAID reported that ministries were either on  track to meet or had exceeded other results to establish more effective  administrative systems for 6 of 7 indicators. USAID stated it had achieved  or exceeded targeted results for 8 out of 10 indicators to expand the Iraqi  government\u2019s capacity to train its own officials.

The assignments included  assisting the Iraqi government in developing its own capacity-building  strategy, training government of Iraq employees at specific ministries,  introducing standard training modules for regional training centers, and  sending at least 50 Iraqis abroad to work on degrees or certificates related  to public administration.

The checklist is on the USAID Administrative  Approval Form and Checklist and includes six different options for  supporting administrative approval. Between April 2007 and June 2008,  USAID received 18 invoices from the NCD contractor totaling about $79  million. We found that the cognizant technical officer did not check off the  option indicating receipt of contractor services on the form for  administrative approval for 6 of these 18 invoices, totaling about $17 of the  $79 million. Instead, the cognizant technical officer indicated that  acceptance of the contractor\u2019s services was based on meeting(s) between  the officer and contractor personnel during which the contractor\u2019s  performance was discussed. Thus, the cognizant technical officer  appeared to rely on the contractor\u2019s statements that the billed services  were provided to authorize payment of the bill. Although the  Administrative Approval Form and Checklist provides an option for an  officer to confirm the receipt of goods or services by marking the  appropriate place, instructions do not require confirmation of receipt. For  example, the instructions direct the officer to mark as many reasons on  the form as possible to justify acceptance of the contractor\u2019s services, and  that at least one reason on the checklist must be checked for  administrative approval of the contractor\u2019s invoice. Not requiring the  confirmation of receipt invalidates this internal control and could  circumvent the regulatory and GAO internal control standards that require  confirmation of receipt prior to payment.", "The instructions for the form do not require an explanation if confirmation  of receipt is not possible. According to USAID officials, there is a  reasonable likelihood that security risks may arise that make confirming  the receipt of services impossible due to prohibitive personal danger or  security protection costs. If these conditions are not documented, USAID  managers cannot readily monitor the extent to which invoices were paid  without confirmation of receipt or take other measures to ensure that the  government\u2019s interest is protected.", "USAID policy also requires verification of the pricing and computations on  a contractor\u2019s invoice and assigns this responsibility to the financial  voucher examiner. We found that USAID did not have reasonable  assurance that the voucher examiner completed this function because  many of the contractor\u2019s invoices showed no indication that the examiner  had performed any verifications, causing a lapse in the internal control to  detect any errors in contractor billings. Furthermore, USAID policy did not  specifically address the documentation that voucher examiners should use  to support their analysis of contractor invoices. However, the USAID  Deputy Controller in Iraq stated that, as of November 2008, voucher  examiners began using a form to document their analysis of contractor  invoices. It is too early to determine whether this form has been an  effective control to prevent improper payments to the contractor.", "We observed that the complexity of these invoices and the process of  verifying pricing and computations against the terms of the contract are  unwieldy. This increases the risk that the voucher examiner\u2019s review may  not prevent improper payments. For example, two of the contractor\u2019s  invoices were more than 100 pages and listed numerous labor-hour costs  and other direct costs, including a variety of footnotes and adjustments.  Invoices listed the number of hours that specific individuals worked on the  NCD program and numerous labor hours for administration.

For the NCD program, two Iraqi ministries signed  memorandums of understanding for support of the program and eight  other ministries developed capacity-building strategies that incorporated  NCD materials.

Letters of sustainment indicate Iraqi government approval for  the design and construction of the project and an agreement to accept  staff, operate, and maintain the project. For example, on a 2007 PRDC  project to convert river water to drinking water, the Director General of  the Wasit Water Directorate signed a letter agreeing to staff, operate, and  maintain the water plant, once completed. For a 2007 PRDC project to  build four electrical feeders, the Director General of Electricity agreed to  prepare and submit an annual budget to the Ministry of Electricity to  operate and maintain the project.", "The Iraqi government has agreed to support some NCD efforts. For  example, the Ministry of Electricity pledged to provide ongoing support  for NCD efforts; sustain projects funded in whole or part by NCD; and  provide staff to NCD, including finance and accounting specialists, power  generation engineers, maintenance engineers, and others. Commitments  from other ministries have been demonstrated by their actions to develop  capacity-building plans with NCD assistance. In October 2007, we reported  that not all U.S. capacity development efforts were clearly linked to the  needs and priorities identified by the Iraqis, which may reduce the  sustainability of U.S.-funded efforts. USAID has attempted to identify  Iraqi government needs and obtain official government commitments by  helping the ministries develop their own capacity-building plans. As of  January 2009, eight ministries, plus the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the  Council of Ministers\u2019 Secretariat, had developed capacity development  plans with NCD assistance. Based on ministry self-assessments that  identify Iraqi needs and priorities, the plans emphasized the Iraqi  ministries partnering with the U.S. government on budget execution,  training in project management, strategic planning, human resources, and  fiscal management.

In August 2008, GRD officials  stated that Iraq had not provided any cost-share funds for implementing  fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007 PRDC projects to date. Moreover,  according to a GRD official, the Iraqis have been unable to meet their  commitments to sustain PRDC projects because the central ministries  have not budgeted sufficient funds to sustain projects.

Although Iraq\u2019s total expenditures grew from 2005 through 2007, Iraq was  unable to spend all of its budgeted funds, especially for investment  activities such as maintenance of roads, bridges, vehicles, buildings, water  and electricity installations, and weapons. In 2007, Iraq spent 28 percent of  its $12 billion total investment budget. In 2008, it spent 39 percent of its  $24 billion investment budget. In 2008, the Iraqi government spent $949  million, or about 2 percent of its total 2008 expenditures, for the  maintenance of Iraqi- and U.S.-funded investments. In 2008, the provinces  spent $2,054 million, or 22 percent of total investment expenditures of  $9,167 million.

According to a PRT official, the Director General for water in Basra has a  $2,500 per item requisition limit. For items higher than that amount, he  needs approval from the Ministry of Water in Baghdad. Most items cost  more than $2,500; a filter for the Garma water purification facility, for  example, costs $25,000.
