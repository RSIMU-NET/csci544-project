In part to provide insight into the cost, schedule, and performance of these acquisitions, DHS established an investment review process in 2003. However, concerns have been raised about how well the process has been implemented--particularly for large investments. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate DHS's implementation of the investment review process, and (2) assess DHS's integration of the investment review and budget processes to ensure major investments fulfill mission needs. GAO reviewed relevant documents, including those for 57 DHS major investments (investments with a value of at least $50 million)--48 of which required department-level review through the second quarter of fiscal year 2008; and interviewed DHS headquarters and component officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While DHS's investment review process calls for executive decision making at key points in an investment's life cycle--including program authorization--the process has not provided the oversight needed to identify and address cost, schedule, and performance problems in its major investments. Poor implementation of the process is evidenced by the number of investments that did not adhere to the department's investment review policy--of DHS's 48 major investments requiring milestone and annual reviews, 45 were not assessed in accordance with this policy. At least 14 of these investments have reported cost growth, schedule slips, or performance shortfalls. Poor implementation is largely the result of DHS's failure to ensure that its Investment Review Board (IRB) and Joint Requirements Council (JRC)--the department's major acquisition decision-making bodies--effectively carried out their oversight responsibilities and had the resources to do so. Regardless, when oversight boards met, DHS could not enforce IRB and JRC decisions because it did not track whether components took actions called for in these decisions. In addition, many major investments lacked basic acquisition documents necessary to inform the investment review process, such as program baselines, and two out of nine components--which manage a total of 8 major investments--do not have required component-level processes in place. DHS has begun several efforts to address these shortcomings, including issuing an interim directive, to improve the investment review process. The investment review framework also integrates the budget process; however, budget decisions have been made in the absence of required oversight reviews and, as a result, DHS cannot ensure that annual funding decisions for its major investments make the best use of resources and address mission needs. GAO found almost a third of DHS's major investments received funding without having validated mission needs and requirements--which confirm a need is justified--and two-thirds did not have required life- cycle cost estimates. At the same time, DHS has not conducted regular reviews of its investment portfolios--broad categories of investments that are linked by similar missions--to ensure effective performance and minimize unintended duplication of effort for investments. Without validated requirements, life-cycle cost estimates, and regular portfolio reviews, DHS cannot ensure that its investment decisions are appropriate and will ultimately address capability gaps. In July 2008, 15 of the 57 DHS major investments reviewed by GAO were designated by the Office of Management and Budget as poorly planned and by DHS as poorly performing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since it was established in 2003, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) has been responsible for integrating 22 federal agencies with  disparate missions into one department.

Where the budget  process is used to allocate resources for DHS acquisitions, the investment  review process is intended to provide departmental insight at key points in  an investment\u2019s life cycle to assess the cost, schedule, and performance of  these acquisitions. However, concerns have been raised about how well  the investment review process has been defined and implemented\u2014 particularly for large investments\u2014to achieve successful acquisition  outcomes. Weaknesses in the investment review process can have a  rippling effect on the budget process because these reviews are expected  to inform annual funding decisions for major investments.

We reviewed  decision memos and investment documents for all 57 level 1 and level 2  major investments identified by DHS. We specifically determined the level  of oversight provided for 48 of these major investments\u2014those that  required department-level review from fiscal year 2004 through the second  quarter of fiscal year 2008. We compared DHS budget practices with GAO  and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on capital  programming principles. We also interviewed representatives of the Chief  Procurement Office (CPO), Chief Financial Office (CFO) and Chief  Information Office as well as nine DHS components and offices that  manage major investments. We conducted this performance audit from  September 2007 until November 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

DHS components and offices sponsor investments to  address mission capability gaps and are the end-users of the developed  acquisitions. DHS has stated that the Undersecretary for Management, as  the Chief Acquisition Officer, is responsible for acquisition policy. The  purpose of DHS\u2019s investment review and budget processes are to provide  oversight of these major investments. Specifically, DHS established the  investment review process in 2003 to help protect its major investments by  providing departmental oversight of major investments throughout their  life cycles and to help ensure that funds allocated for investments through  the budget process are being spent wisely, efficiently, and effectively. In  2005, we reported that this process adopted many acquisition best  practices that, if applied consistently, could help increase the chances for  successful outcomes. However, we noted that incorporating additional  program reviews and knowledge deliverables into the process could better  position DHS to make well-informed decisions. In 2007, we further  reported that DHS had not fully defined and documented policies and  procedures for investment management or fully implemented key  practices needed to control its information technology (IT) investments.", "To strengthen DHS\u2019s investment management capability, we  recommended that the department fully define and document project and  portfolio-level policies and procedures and implement key control  processes. In addition to the investment review process, the DHS budget  process serves as the framework for decision making for ongoing and  future DHS programs. The framework is cyclic, consisting of planning,  programming, budgeting, and execution phases that examine existing  program funding and link the funding to program performance to ensure  funds are expended appropriately and that they produce the expected  results and benefits.", "The investment review process framework manages investment risk by  developing an organized, comprehensive, and iterative approach to  identifying; assessing; mitigating; and continuously tracking, controlling,  and documenting risk tailored to each project. The investment review  process has four main objectives: (1) identify investments that perform  poorly, are behind schedule, are over budget, or that lack capability, so  officials can identify and implement corrective actions; (2) integrate  capital planning and investment control with resource allocation and  investment management; (3) ensure that investment spending directly  supports DHS\u2019s mission and identify duplicative efforts for consolidation;  and (4) ensure that DHS conducts required management, oversight,  control, reporting, and review for all major investments. The process  requires event-driven decision making by high-ranking executives at a  number of key points in an investment\u2019s life cycle. The investment review  process provides guidance to components for all DHS investments, but it  requires formal department-level review and approval only for major  investments\u2014those that are categorized as level 1 or 2 (see table 1).", "The investment review process has two types of reviews: programmatic  and portfolio. Programmatic reviews are held at specific milestones and  require documentation and discussion commensurate with the  investment\u2019s life cycle phase. These reviews contribute to the investment  review goal of identifying investments that perform poorly, are behind  schedule, are over budget, or that lack capability so officials can identify  and implement corrective actions. Portfolio reviews are designed to  identify efforts for consolidation and mission alignment by monitoring and  assessing broad categories of investments that are linked by similar  missions to ensure effective performance, minimization of overlapping  functions, and proper funding. The IRB and JRC are responsible for  reviewing, respectively, level 1 and level 2 investments at key milestone  decision points, but no less than annually, and provide strategic guidance  (see table 2). In addition to requiring department-level review, DHS policy  directs component heads to conduct appropriate management and  oversight of investments and establish processes to manage approved  investments at the component level.", "The investment review process has three broad life cycle stages, covering  five investment phases and four decision points or milestones (see fig. 1).  In the preacquisition stage, gaps are to be identified and capabilities to  address them defined. In the first phase of the acquisition stage\u2014concept  and technology development\u2014requirements are to be established and  alternatives explored. In the next phase\u2014capability development and  demonstration\u2014prototypes are to be developed. In the final acquisition  phase, the assets are produced and deployed. With the high dollar  thresholds and inherent risk of level 1 and level 2 investments, IRB or JRC  approval at milestone decision points is important to ensure that major  investment performance parameters and documentation are satisfactorily  demonstrated before the investment transitions to the next acquisition  phase. IRB and JRC milestone reviews are not required once an  investment reaches the sustainment phase.", "As designed, knowledge developed during each investment phase is to be  captured in key documents and is to build throughout the investment life  cycle. Performing the disciplined analysis required at each phase is critical  to achieving successful outcomes. The main goals of the first investment  phase, program initiation, are to determine gaps in capabilities and then  describe the capabilities to fill the gap\u2014this information is then captured  in the mission needs statement. If the mission needs statement is  approved, the investment then moves to the concept and technology  development phase, which focuses both on setting requirements and  important baselines for managing the investment throughout its life cycle.  A key step in this phase is translating needs into specific operational  requirements, which are captured in the operational requirements  document. Operational requirements provide a bridge between the  functional requirements of the mission needs statement and the detailed  technical requirements that form the basis of the performance  specifications, which will ultimately govern development of the system.  Once the program has developed its operational requirements document,  it then uses these requirements to inform the development of its  acquisition program baseline, a critical document that addresses the  program\u2019s critical cost, schedule, and performance parameters and is  expressed in measurable terms. See figure 2 for a description of the  documents.", "The department\u2019s budget policy has two main objectives: (1) articulate  DHS goals and priorities, and (2) develop and implement a program  structure and resource planning to accomplish DHS goals. DHS uses the  process to determine investment priorities and allocate resources each  year. The budget process emphasizes the importance of ensuring  investments expend funds appropriately and that investment performance  produces the expected benefits or results. IRB decisions and guidance  regarding new investments are to be reflected to the extent possible in any  iteration of the budget as appropriate.

Poor implementation largely rests on DHS\u2019s inability to  ensure that the IRB and JRC effectively carried out their oversight  responsibilities. Of 48 major investments requiring department-level  review, 45 were not reviewed in accordance with the department\u2019s  investment review policy, and 18 were not reviewed at all. In the absence  of IRB and JRC meetings, investment decisions were reached outside of  the required review process. Moreover, when IRB meetings were held,  DHS did not consistently enforce decisions that were reached because the  department did not track whether components and offices took the  actions required by the IRB. In addition, 27 major investments have not  developed or received DHS approval for basic acquisition documents  required to guide and measure the performance of program activities\u2014and  the investment review process. Of those, over a third reported cost,  schedule, or performance breaches in fiscal year 2007 and second quarter  fiscal year 2008. According to DHS representatives, acquisition  management practices are still new to many components, and we found 24  investments lacked certified program managers needed to develop basic  acquisition documents. We found that two out of nine components do not  have required component-level review processes to adequately manage  their major investments. DHS has recognized these deficiencies and began  efforts in 2007 to clarify and better adhere to the investment review  process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Major Investments Lacked Required Departmental Reviews and Many of Those Exceeded Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Of DHS\u2019s 48 major investments requiring department-level review between  fiscal year 2004 and the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, only three had  all milestone and annual reviews. Of the 39 level 1 investments requiring  IRB review and approval to proceed to the next acquisition phase, as of  March 2008, 18 have never been reviewed by the IRB\u20144 of which have  already reached production and deployment. The remaining 21 level 1  investments received at least one milestone or annual review through the  investment review process. None of the 9 level 2 investments had JRC  review and approval. DHS policy provides that its major investments be  reviewed no less than yearly. However, in fiscal year 2007, the most  recent year for which data were available, only 7 of the 48 required annual  reviews were conducted. As a result, DHS lacked the information needed  to address cost, schedule, and performance deficiencies\u2014a problem we  identified with over one-third of DHS\u2019s major investments between fiscal  year 2007 and the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. In our prior work on  the Department of Defense (DOD), we found that when such reviews are  skipped or not fully implemented, programs build momentum and move  toward product development with little if any early department-level  assessment of the costs and feasibility. Committing to programs before  they have this knowledge contributes to poor cost, schedule, and  performance outcomes.", "DHS level 1 investments that were never reviewed through the IRB  process include some of the department\u2019s largest investments with  important national security objectives. For example, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Consolidated Alert and  Warning System, which has estimated life-cycle costs of $1.6 billion,  includes programs to update the Emergency Alerting System and other  closely related projects. In 2007, we reported that FEMA faces technical,  training, and funding challenges to develop an integrated alert and warning  system. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) Secure Freight Initiative,  which has estimated life-cycle costs of $1.7 billion, is designed to test the  feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers with  nonintrusive equipment and radiation detection equipment at foreign  seaports. Earlier this year, we reported that the Secure Freight Initiative  faces a number of challenges, including measuring performance outcomes,  logistical feasibility of some aspects of the investment, and technological  issues. While these two investments are still in the concept and  technology development phase, other major investments that have not  been reviewed are even further along in the investment life cycle\u2014when  problems become more costly to fix. For example, CBP\u2019s Western  Hemisphere Travel Initiative, with estimated life-cycle costs of $886  million, is in capability development and demonstration. The investment  aims to improve technologies to identify fraudulent documentation at U.S.  ports of entry. We recently reported that because key elements of planning  for the investment\u2019s management and execution remain uncertain, DHS  faces challenges deploying technology, and staffing and training officers to  use it.", "Reviews of the 9 level 2 investments\u2014those with acquisition costs  between $50 million and $100 million, or $100 million to $200 million for  information technology\u2014were similarly lacking. While the JRC met  periodically between fiscal years 2004 and 2006, senior officials stated that  it did not make approval decisions about any level 2 investments. As a  result, investments such as the following\u2014which are all now in the  operations and support phase\u2014were not reviewed and approved by the  JRC:    FEMA\u2019s Total Asset Visibility, which has $91 million in estimated life-cycle  costs, aims to improve emergency response logistics in the areas of  transportation, warehousing, and distribution.", "Transportation and Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) Hazardous Threat  Assessment Program, which has $181 million in estimated life-cycle costs,  was developed to perform a security threat assessment on applicants for  licenses to transport hazardous materials.", "The National Protection and Programs Directorate\u2019s National Security and  Emergency Preparedness investment, which has $1.8 billion in estimated  life-cycle costs, aims to provide specially designed telecommunications  services to the national security and emergency preparedness  communities in the event of a disaster if conventional communication  services are ineffective.", "During 2006, the JRC stopped meeting altogether after the chair was  assigned to other duties within the department. DHS representatives  recognized that since the JRC stopped meeting in 2006, there has been no  direction for requirements or oversight of level 2 investments at the  department level and that strengthening the JRC is a top priority. In the  meantime, oversight of level 2 investments has devolved to the  components.", "Without the appropriate IRB and JRC milestone reviews, DHS loses the  opportunity to identify and address cost, schedule, and performance  problems and, thereby, minimize program risk. Fourteen of the  investments that lacked appropriate review through IRB and JRC  oversight experienced cost growth, schedule delays, and  underperformance\u2014some of which was substantial. At least 8 investments  reported cost growth between fiscal year 2007 and the second quarter of  fiscal year 2008 (see table 3). Other programs experienced schedule delays  and underperformance. For example, CBP\u2019s Automated Commercial  Environment program reported a 20 percent performance shortfall in the  first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Moreover, we reported in July 2008 that  the Coast Guard\u2019s Rescue 21 program changed its acquisition baseline or  cost, schedule, and performance goals four times resulting in a total 182  percent cost growth and 5-year schedule slip.", "DHS has acknowledged that the IRB and JRC have not conducted  oversight in accordance with DHS policy\u2014largely because the process has  depended on direct involvement and availability of high-level leadership as  well as a lack of sufficient staff resources to organize the review meetings.  According to DHS representatives, the Deputy Secretary was unavailable  to commit to the time required to conduct reviews of all investments, so  only some major investments were reviewed. Our prior work shows that  this problem existed from the start. For example, in 2004, we reported that  DHS was having difficulty bringing all of its information technology  programs before the IRB in a timely manner. We reported in 2005 that key  stakeholders, such as the Chief Procurement Officer, did not receive  materials in time to conduct a thorough review and provide meaningful  feedback prior to investment review meetings and recommended that DHS  ensure that stakeholders, including CPO officials, have adequate time to  review investment submissions and provide formal input to decision- making review boards. Moreover, in 2007, we reported that DHS  investment boards did not conduct regular investment reviews and control  activities were not performed consistently across projects. DHS Chief  Procurement Office and Chief Financial Office representatives added that  the process was not adequately staffed to conduct annual reviews of  investments as required by the investment review policy. We have  previously recommended that DHS provide adequate resources, including  people, funding, and tools, for oversight of major investments. A 2007  DHS assessment of 37 major investments found that many investments are  awaiting senior management review. For example, FEMA\u2019s major  investment, the flood map modernization program, requested a key  investment review decision meeting in 2004 that was subsequently  scheduled and cancelled in 2006. As a result, the program proceeded from  development to operations and support without IRB review or approval.", "Because of these limitations, alternative approaches to obtaining decisions  were adopted. Numerous officials reported that rather than going through  the formal investment review process, in some cases DHS component  officials began to seek approval directly from the Deputy Secretary. For  example, in November 2006, the DHS Inspector General reported on the  CBP\u2019s Secure Border Initiative program, noting that the investment  oversight processes were sidelined in the urgent pursuit of SBInet\u2019s  aggressive schedule and that the IRB and JRC processes were bypassed  and key decisions about the scope of the program and the acquisition  strategy were made without rigorous review and analysis or  transparency. DHS officials indicated that some decisions were very  informal, based on conversations with the Deputy Secretary and without  input from other IRB members. In such cases, the investment review  process was bypassed, including consideration of supporting reviews and  recommendations. DHS CPO and CFO representatives said they did not  always know whether a decision had been made through this informal  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Programs Lack Required Cost, Schedule, and Performance Data Critical to Informing Investment Decisions", "paragraphs": ["DHS investment review policy requires programs to develop specific  documentation that captures key knowledge needed to make informed  investment decisions. This approach is similar to DOD\u2019s, which requires  adequate knowledge at critical milestones to reduce the risk associated  with each phase of the investment\u2019s life cycle and enable program  managers to deliver timely, affordable, quality products. GAO\u2019s work on  commercial best practices for major acquisitions has demonstrated that  this approach, if effectively implemented, can significantly improve  program outcomes. Our prior work has found that inadequate attention  to developing requirements results in requirements instability, which can  ultimately cause cost escalation, schedule delays, and fewer end items.", "Many major DHS investments do not have basic acquisition information  required by investment review policy to guide and measure the  performance of program activities and the investment review process. In  particular, mission needs statements, operational requirements  documents, and acquisition program baselines establish capability gaps,  requirements needed to address gaps, and cost, schedule, and  performance parameters, respectively. As of March 2008, of the 57 level 1  and 2 investments, 34 were in a phase that required all three documents,  but 27 did not have or only provided an unapproved draft of one or more  of these documents (see appendix III for the investments lacking these  approved documents). Of the 27 investments, we found that over a third  reported cost, schedule, or performance breaches between fiscal year 2007  and second quarter fiscal year 2008. For example, the Infrastructure  Transformation program, which did not have an approved operational  requirements document or acquisition program baseline, reported being  up to 19 percent behind schedule in 2007. In another instance, the  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Detention and removal  modernization program, which also lacked an approved operational  requirements document and acquisition program baseline, reported  schedule slippage of about 20 percent. Without required development and  review of key acquisition data, DHS cannot be sure that programs have  mitigated risks to better ensure good outcomes.", "CPO representatives explained that department acquisition management  practices are new to many DHS components. For most investments, CPO  representatives said that program managers were not familiar with basic  acquisition documents and investment oversight staff had to work with  program managers to help them develop these documents prior to  investment reviews. In addition, we found that in fiscal year 2007, 24 major  investments did not have program managers certified by DHS as having  the required knowledge and skills to oversee complex acquisition  programs. Moreover, other factors such as pressure to get programs up  and running, additional external requirements, and technological  challenges also impact the ability to successfully manage acquisitions to  support good acquisition outcomes. At the same time, some component  officials said that they received insufficient and inconsistent guidance  regarding what information should be included in key acquisition  documents. This issue is long-standing. For example, we reported in 2005  that because of the small number of department oversight staff, only  limited support was provided to programs to assist them in completing  their submissions for oversight reviews. In addition, component officials  told us that key acquisition documents are sometimes approved at the  component level but are not reviewed and approved at the department  level. For example, TSA officials indicated that documents needed for the  Secure Flight and Passenger Screening Programs were approved by TSA  and submitted to DHS for approval, but no action was taken to review and  approve them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Investments Move Forward without Addressing Deficiencies Identified in Reviews", "paragraphs": ["The investment reviews that have been conducted have not always  provided the discipline needed to help ensure programs achieve cost,  schedule, and performance goals\u2014even when a review identified  important deficiencies in an acquisition decision memorandum. DHS has  not routinely followed up on whether specific actions required by  acquisition decision memorandums to mitigate potential risks have been  implemented.", "The IRB issued a 2004 acquisition decision memorandum approving the  U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT)\u2014a  program that aims to facilitate travel and trade\u2014to move into the  capability development and demonstration phase although the IRB found  the investment\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance risk to be high. The  memorandum stated that more clarity was needed on the program\u2019s end- state capability, benefits related to life-cycle costs, and how it planned to  transition to the operations and support phase. We reported that in 2006  DHS had yet to develop a comprehensive plan describing what the end- state capability would be, and how, when, and at what cost it would be  delivered. In a 2006 decision memorandum, the IRB again instructed US-  VISIT to address the end-state capability, by requiring a comprehensive  affordable exit plan for airports, seaports, and landports. We subsequently  reported that, as of October 2007, US-VISIT had yet to establish critical  investment management processes, such as effective project planning,  requirements management, and financial management, which are required  to ensure that program capabilities and expected mission outcomes are  delivered on time and within budget. In addition, DHS had not developed  capability for the other half of US-VISIT, even though it had allocated  about one-quarter of a billion dollars to this effort.", "In a May 2006 decision memorandum, the IRB directed the Cargo  Advanced Automated Radiography System investment to develop within 6  months an acquisition program baseline, a concept of operations, and an  operational requirements document. It also called for the investment to be  reviewed annually. As of the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, a baseline  and the concept of operations had been drafted, according to program  officials. However, an operational requirements document had not been  developed even though a $1.3 billion contract had been awarded for the  investment. In addition, the Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography  System investment had not yet received a follow-on review by the IRB. In  another example, in a December 2006 decision memorandum, the IRB  directed ICE\u2019s major investment Automation and Modernization to update  its acquisition program baseline, its cost-benefit analysis and its life-cycle  cost analysis. Automation and Modernization has since updated its  acquisition program baseline, but its cost analyses were last updated in  2005.", "Current and former CPO and CFO representatives noted that staffing has  not been sufficient to review investments in a timely manner and conduct  follow-up to ensure decisions are implemented. They indicated that  support was needed to undertake a number of functions, including:  designing the investment review process, collecting and reviewing  investment documentation, preparing analyses to support investment  decisions, and organizing review meetings, as well as conducting follow-up  for major investments. According to DHS representatives, from 2004 to  2007 there were four full-time equivalent DHS employees plus support  from four contractors to fulfill those responsibilities. Many acquisition  decision memos provided specific deadlines for components to complete  action items, but according to CPO and CFO representatives IRB action  items were not tracked.

For example, CBP and TSA officials reported that  they relied on their component investment review processes to ensure  some level of oversight when the department did not review their  investments. However, for the nine components we reviewed, two did not  have a process in place and others had processes that were either in  development or not focused on the entire investment life cycle. For  example, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and the National  Protection and Programs Directorate did not have a formal investment  review process, meaning that in the absence of an IRB or JRC review, their  eight major investments received no formal review.

To gain an understanding and  awareness of DHS\u2019s major investments, in 2007 during the course of our  review, the Undersecretary for Management undertook an assessment of  37 major investments conducted under the CPO\u2019s direction. The  assessment identified a range of systemic weaknesses in the  implementation of its investment review process and in the process itself.  The DHS assessment found    many level 1 investments await leadership decisions;    acquisition decision memos lack rigor;    a lack of follow-up and enforcement of oversight decisions;   inadequate technical support at the investment level; and    unclear accountability for acquisitions at the component level.", "Many of the deficiencies identified are consistent with our findings. For  example, the DHS assessment of Citizenship and Immigration Services  (CIS) found that investments were either missing, or using draft or  unsigned versions of key investment management documents, limiting  DHS\u2019s ability to measure the investments\u2019 performance. In one case, DHS  found that the Verification Information Systems investment is poorly  defined.

CFO representatives explained that the CFO sought to align  resource allocation decisions with the IRB approvals in 2006, but this was  not possible because of the erratic investment review meeting schedule.  As a result, a number of CFO and CPO representatives confirmed that  funding decisions for major investments have not been contingent upon  the outcomes of the investment review process.", "One of the primary functions of the IRB is to review and approve level 1  investments for formal entry into the annual budget process. However, we  found that 18 of DHS\u2019s 57 major investments did not have an approved  mission needs statement\u2014a document that formally acknowledges that  the need is justified and supported. Specifically, the statement summarizes  the investment requirement, the mission or missions that the investment is  intended to support, the authority under which the investment was begun,  and the funding source for the investment. As such, approval of the  mission needs statement is required at the earliest stages of an investment.  Lacking information on which major investments have validated mission  needs, the CFO has allocated funds for major investments for which a  capability gap has not been established. We reported in 2007 that DHS  risked selecting investments that would not meet mission needs in the  most cost-effective manner. The 18 investments that lacked an approved  mission needs statement accounted for more than half a billion dollars in  estimated fiscal year 2008 appropriations (see table 4).", "In addition, two thirds of major investment budget decisions were reached  without a life-cycle cost estimate. A life-cycle cost estimate provides an  exhaustive and structured accounting of all resources and associated cost  elements required to develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a particular  program. Life-cycle costing enhances decision making, especially in early  planning and concept formulation of acquisition and can support  budgetary decisions, key decision points, milestone reviews, and  investment decisions. GAO and OMB guidance emphasize that reliable  cost estimates are important for program approval and continued receipt  of annual funding. DHS policy similarly provides that life-cycle cost  estimates are essential to an effective budget process and form the basis  for annual budget decisions. However, 39 of the 57 level 1 and level 2  major DHS investments we reviewed did not have a life-cycle cost  estimate. Moreover, DHS\u2019s 2007 assessment of 37 major investments also  found investments without life-cycle cost estimates and noted poor cost  estimating as a systemic issue. Without such estimates, DHS major  investments are at risk of experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines,  and performance shortfalls. Cost increases often mean that the  government cannot fund as many programs as intended.

Taking a portfolio perspective allows an  agency to determine how its collective investments can optimally address  its strategic goals and objectives. As part of this responsibility, the JRC is  expected to identify crosscutting opportunities and overlapping or  common requirements and determine how best to ensure that DHS uses its  finite resources wisely in those areas. Specifically, the JRC reviews  investments to identify duplicative mission capabilities and to assess  redundancies. While a certain amount of redundancy can be beneficial,  our prior work has found that unintended duplication indicates the  potential for inefficiency and waste. The Enterprise Architecture Board  supports the JRC by overseeing the department\u2019s enterprise architecture  and performing technical reviews of level 1 and level 2 IT investments. In  2007, we reported that DHS did not have an explicit methodology and  criteria for determining program alignment to the architecture. We  further reported that DHS policies and procedures for portfolio  management had yet to be defined, and as a result, control of the  department\u2019s investment portfolios was ad hoc.", "When it met regularly, the JRC played a key role in identifying several  examples of overlapping investments, including passenger screening  programs.

Because the JRC stopped meeting soon  thereafter, DHS may have missed opportunities to follow up on these  cases or identify further cases of potential overlap. In 2007, we reported  that while TSA and CBP had begun coordinating efforts, they had yet to  align their passenger prescreening programs to identify potential overlaps  and minimize duplication. We recommended that DHS take additional  steps and make key policy and technical decisions that were necessary to  more fully coordinate these programs. TSA and CBP have since worked  with DHS to develop a strategy to align regulatory policies and coordinate  efforts to facilitate consistency across their programs.

For example, in  response to our first recommendation, to establish a mechanism to  identify and track on a regular basis new and ongoing major investments  and ensure compliance with actions called for by investment review board  decisions, DHS\u2019s new interim directive requires major programs to  participate in an acquisition reporting process.
