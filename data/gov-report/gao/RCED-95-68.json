The number of joint R&D ventures has steadily increased since 1986\u2014years before NIST made its first ATP award. Some explanations for the causes of this trend and for the formation of joint ventures are unrelated to ATP. For example, the National Science Foundation cites the passage of the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 as one reason for this growth. The Foundation explains that this act encourages research collaboration among industry competitors by better defining joint R&D ventures and protecting them from antitrust suits by limiting potential liability.

For example, earlier versions of the ATP evaluation plan pointed to one ATP project that was achieving all of its technical milestones as evidence of the project\u2019s likely success in stimulating economic growth. The lead company involved in this joint venture, however, went bankrupt before the project was completed. Although the other company in the joint venture has stated its intention to continue the joint venture\u2019s commercialization plan, the lead company\u2019s bankruptcy reduces the likelihood of future economic effects being realized from this ATP project.", "Tracking the completion of technical milestones for ATP projects provides helpful information to ATP managers who need to know whether this vital step in the commercialization process is being achieved.

However, the number of collaborations and strategic alliances may not indicate ATP\u2019s economic success. A joint venture is one form of collaboration or strategic alliance that can occur between companies. As the previously cited example of the bankrupt company and its collaboration shows, the use of this measure to indicate \u201clong-term economic success\u201d may create the false expectation that collaboration will lead to commercial success.", "The ATP evaluation plan summarized in Setting Priorities shows that NIST intends to continue providing descriptive data on the program and its operations. Two of the five major components of the evaluation plan focus on obtaining this type of information and are descriptive in nature: (1) assessing ATP\u2019s operational activities and (2) profiling applicants, recipients, technologies, and projects.

Specifically, NIST made the following observations about our draft report: It overestimated the amount of \u201cadvanced\u201d R&D in the printed wiring board industry by citing industry figures that include R&D that is not \u201cadvanced.\u201d However, we point out in our response that the broader industry figure is appropriate to use for comparison purposes because the ATP project also includes R&D that is not \u201cadvanced.\u201d", "It introduced a negative bias to our conclusions by including only partial responses to a survey question. We have added language to the final report reflecting the additional information contained in responses to this survey question. However, this does not change our analysis or conclusions because the information still suggests that as many as half of the ATP projects would have been undertaken even without ATP support, although at a different level of funding. Moreover, a Congressional Budget Office study reached a conclusion similar to ours on the basis of the same data. It overlooked evidence and made it appear that NIST\u2019s conclusions about ATP\u2019s impact on forging relationships between companies and government or academic labs lacked support. Our review of this evidence is included in this report and shows that NIST\u2019s conclusions are based on an inconsistent methodology used in analyzing the evidence. It overlooked evidence supporting NIST\u2019s statement that ATP has led to an increase in the number of joint ventures. However, the evidence provided by NIST still does not demonstrate that ATP has caused an increase in the number of joint ventures for primarily two reasons. First, the National Cooperative Research Act was influencing the number of joint ventures over the same time period. Second, NIST has no evidence that shows why joint ventures that applied to ATP formed in the first place. NIST currently has a study under way to determine that information. The fact that the joint ventures registered with the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice when applying to ATP is irrelevant because joint ventures are not required to register with these agencies when they form.", "NIST\u2019s comments on our draft report also include important qualifications that help dispel false expectations about the indicators of long-term economic success in Setting Priorities.

We analyzed the ATP evaluation plan\u2019s \u201cindicators of future economic success\u201d but were unable to analyze the usefulness of those indicators that were too general for understanding the effects of ATP.

Our work focused specifically on the information provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in its document entitled Setting Priorities and Measuring Results at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We examined (1) the short-term results that NIST says indicate the impact of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and (2) the measures that NIST expects will indicate ATP\u2019s long-term economic success. We did not address the progress made by NIST in implementing its evaluation plan. After reviewing additional support provided by NIST, we maintain that our original assessment of NIST\u2019s conclusions about short-term results is valid. None of the information provided in the comments refutes our original conclusions. We have included additional information about NIST\u2019s ongoing evaluation efforts beyond those cited in Setting Priorities. We also maintain that the indicators of long-term economic success included in Setting Priorities may create false expectations. Although NIST\u2019s comments on our draft report included important qualifications that help dispel false expectations (e.g., \u201caccomplishment of technical milestones is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for the achievement of long-run economic success\u201d), Setting Priorities did not include any of these qualifications. 2. The draft report said \u201cATP evaluations would better assist the Congress in making budget decisions if the evaluations focused more on outcomes, which reflect the impacts of the program, than on outputs, which describe the activities of the program.\u201d This statement was not intended to be a broad conclusion about the plan. The report now discusses this topic within the context of the descriptive information that ATP collects. As the report notes, this information does not necessarily provide the Congress with information about the program\u2019s impact and economic success. 3. We continue to maintain that \u201ctracking technical milestones\u201d and \u201cincreased industrial collaborations and strategic alliances,\u201d when presented as indicators of long-term economic success, may create false expectations. Presenting additional information, such as NIST provides in its comments, would help avoid creating false expectations. 4. Since we focused our work specifically on the statements about ATP in Setting Priorities, we reviewed the studies and data supporting these statements to determine their consistency. We did not ignore any information provided that was relevant to this work. In addition, we have added information about NIST\u2019s evaluation efforts that does not appear in Setting Priorities. 5. We maintain that our analysis and estimates are appropriate and accurate. The details are provided in the body of the final report and in comments 13 and 14. Moreover, the evidence NIST provided\u2014a report on a single five-member joint venture\u2014cannot be extrapolated to the entire U.S. printed wiring board industry. 6. See comment 15. 7. We included all of the relevant information in our analysis and maintain that NIST\u2019s statements lack support and are based on a selective use of data. See comment 19. 8. Comment 23 summarizes our rationale for questioning NIST\u2019s statement about ATP\u2019s impact on the formation of joint ventures. 9. We have withdrawn the proposed recommendation in light of additional information about plans to refine the ATP evaluation plan. 10. We agree that our draft report did not lay out the full scope of the ATP evaluation plan. That was not our intent. Our work focused on the information contained in Setting Priorities, which states on page 15 that \u201cA number of measurable short-term effects are expected to provide indicators of long-term economic success. In addition to straightforward tracking of technical milestones, these indicators include: . . . increased industrial collaborations and strategic alliances; . . .\u201d 11. We have not changed our position. Our 1993 report did not evaluate NIST\u2019s ATP evaluation strategy but did present a NIST-provided summary of the ATP evaluation strategy. In addition, the current report contains similar language concerning the barriers and challenges facing NIST in evaluating ATP. For example, our report states, \u201cEvaluating ATP poses many challenges. For example, ATP research projects are intended not only to be technical successes but also to have commercial results. The linkage between technical work and commercial results may not always be direct and may be subject to interpretation. Also, several years can elapse between the end of technical work and the realization of commercial results.\u201d 12. According to NIST, the statement about ATP\u2019s impact on the printed wiring board industry is based on a study that is limited to a single five-member joint venture. We maintain that it is an overstatement to project the impact of this joint venture to the entire industry of over 800 manufacturers. For purposes of comparison, in the draft report we estimated spending for research and development (R&D) for the entire printed wiring board industry. We still maintain that these estimates are the correct figures to use for such purposes and that the figures further reinforce our conclusion. 13. Our analysis is based on the industry\u2019s overall expenditures for R&D for the following reason. As NIST comments, only a portion of the industry\u2019s R&D is focused on advanced technology. But similarly, only a portion of the joint venture\u2019s R&D is focused on advanced technology, and the larger balance is devoted to incremental improvements in existing technology. 14. NIST\u2019s suggested analysis still does not demonstrate that ATP has quadrupled total U.S. R&D work on advanced technologies for printed wiring boards. Taking into account the Department of Energy\u2019s contribution of $5.2 million, or $1.04 million annually, the total annual spending on R&D by the ATP-supported joint venture is that amount plus the joint venture\u2019s original annual expenditure of $5.7 million, for a total of $6.74 million. Since less than half of that total is spent for R&D on advanced technology, $3.37 million, or a half, is a high estimate of the amount spent annually by the joint venture on advanced technology R&D. NIST\u2019s claim remains overstated because the joint venture\u2019s annual expenditure of $3.37 million still does not quadruple the industry\u2019s expenditure of $2.65 million per year for advanced technology research on printed wiring boards. 15. Language has been added to the final report reflecting the information provided by responses to this question. This information, however, does not change our analysis or our conclusions. Our conclusions are reinforced by a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, which arrives at a similar conclusion about this evidence. According to the CBO report, \u201cOne privately funded study of the 11 projects supported by the first [ATP] competition in 1990 suggests that as many as half of them would probably have been undertaken even without ATP support, although at a lower level of funding.\u201d16. Language has been added to the body of the final report reflecting the information provided by these responses. This information does not change our conclusions. 17. We included all of the relevant information in our analysis, and our conclusions remain unchanged. See comment 19. 18. At the exit conference we said we understood NIST\u2019s logic and rationale for making the statement. We did not say we accepted it as reasonable. 19. As stated in our final report, this is an inconsistent use of survey data. NIST\u2019s synthesis of the results of two different questions, one open-ended and one closed-ended, does not adequately support NIST\u2019s statements, nor does the information provided by another question in the survey (section L.). 20. We included all of the relevant information in our analysis, and our conclusions remain unchanged. We agree with NIST\u2019s comment on the National Cooperative Research Act and feel that NIST should have included references such as this in Setting Priorities to avoid overstating any potential effects of ATP on the formation of joint ventures. As we pointed out, the effects of the National Cooperative Research Act make it difficult to determine the effects of ATP on the number of joint ventures during ATP\u2019s first four competitions. 21. Joint R&D ventures exist throughout industry and are not required to register with the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. Therefore, the joint ventures may have been formed before applying to ATP and may never have applied to the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. 22. None of this information shows that ATP caused 125 joint ventures to form. As shown in comment 21, registration with the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission does not mean a joint venture is new and did not exist before the time of registration. 23. As noted in comments 20, 21, and 22, the current evidence supporting ATP\u2019s impact on the formation of joint ventures is inconclusive and anecdotal. Moreover, the NIST statement says that \u201capproximately 125 joint ventures,\u201d i.e., all of the joint ventures that sent in a proposal to ATP, were formed because of ATP. We look forward to the completion of NIST\u2019s new survey, which is under way, for more definitive information on \u201cwhether or not the ATP had any influence on [ATP award recipients\u2019] decision to collaborate.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of the Chief Economist", "paragraphs": ["Loren Yager, Assistant Director The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
