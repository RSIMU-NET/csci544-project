Generally, a goal of export-oriented STEs is to maximize financial returns through the regulation of commodity sales from a particular country or region.

These imports constitute a significant share of the U.S. market. In crop year 1996-97, about 14 percent of the durum wheat and 7 percent of the red spring wheat supply in the United States came from Canada. The United States imported this wheat in part because of problems with disease, adverse weather conditions, and a shortfall in domestic supply. Also, U.S. food use of durum has risen 125 percent over the past 2 decades; thus, as the demand for durum wheat has increased, so too have U.S. imports of this wheat from Canada. The vast majority of durum wheat, red spring wheat, and barley arrives in the United States from Canada by rail direct from Thunder Bay, Ontario, and the Canadian western prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the Peace River district of British Columbia. In 1997, 70 percent of these Canadian grains were shipped by rail, 18 percent by vessel, and 13 percent by truck.", "For some export sales, the CWB relies on \u201caccredited exporters\u201d (AE), who are national and multinational companies authorized to purchase grain from the CWB for resale to customers. Some of the AEs are subsidiaries of U.S.-based multinational firms; some of the transactions that the AEs facilitate involve selling grain to other subsidiaries of the same company. Although the majority of the CWB\u2019s sales are made directly to an end user, CWB officials told us that AEs facilitate all wheat sales to buyers in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S.-Canadian Relations\u2014Grain Trade and the CWB", "paragraphs": ["With the rise in U.S. imports of Canadian wheat beginning in the mid-1980s, U.S. wheat farmers became increasingly concerned about what they perceived as Canadian wheat export subsidies and unfair barriers to U.S. wheat exports. U.S. wheat farmers thought that Canadian transportation subsidies gave Canadian wheat farmers an unfair advantage in foreign markets. Canadian wheat and barley producers have historically received transportation subsidies that reduced shipping costs. U.S. wheat farmers\u2019 market access concerns centered on Canadian import permits, or license requirements, which essentially prevented U.S. farmers from selling their grain to Canada without a permit. In addition, the U.S. government was concerned that the CWB might be selling its grain in an unfair manner.", "Specific provisions of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), effective January 1, 1989, dealt with several of these aspects of U.S.-Canadian grain trade. For example, under the CFTA, Canada agreed to eliminate Canadian transportation subsidies for agricultural goods originating in Canada and shipped via West Coast ports for consumption in the United States. CFTA called for ending Canadian import permits for grain pending changes in the comparative level of U.S. and Canadian support for producers. CFTA also dealt with the pricing of agricultural products, including wheat, providing that neither the United States nor Canada could export agricultural goods to the other at a price below the acquisition price of the goods plus any storage, handling, and other costs. Differences in U.S. and Canadian interpretations of this provision eventually led the United States to invoke CFTA dispute settlement procedures in May 1992. The subsequent 1993 CFTA dispute panel decision called for an audit of CWB pricing. An audit was conducted and its findings were reported in December 1993 (see ch. 4 for a discussion of the CFTA dispute panel decision).", "The Canada-United States Joint Commission on Grains, mandated by a 1994 U.S.-Canadian memorandum of understanding (MOU), released its final report in October 1995. Comprised of 10 nongovernment U.S. and Canadian officials with equal representation, it was formed to assist the two governments in reaching long-term solutions to existing problems in the grains sector. The report addressed policy coordination, cross-border trade, grain grading and regulatory issues, infrastructure, and domestic and export programs and institutions (see app. I for a chronology of U.S.-Canadian grain trade relations).", "While some areas of debate have been resolved, recent events have shown that difficulties remain in U.S-Canadian relations regarding the grains trade. Neither CFTA nor the use of trade remedies has resolved U.S. producer concerns about U.S. access to the Canadian wheat market, CWB practices, and increasing Canadian wheat imports into the United States. Despite CFTA\u2019s gradual elimination of all duties between Canada and the United States by January 1, 1998, and the removal of Canadian import license requirements in 1995, some barriers continue to impede trade. Canada still requires an end-use certificate and subsidizes grain transportation through its ownership of railcars, and reciprocal access to grain handling and transportation systems in the two countries is yet to be achieved. In addition, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) remains concerned that the CWB may be using its monopoly to undercut U.S. wheat prices and that U.S. farmers continue to be hurt by increased Canadian wheat imports.", "Regarding market access, Canada removed its import license requirement in 1991 but still requires that U.S. wheat be accompanied by an end-use certificate to maintain Canada\u2019s varietal controls and quality standards. The U.S. requirement that imports be accompanied by an end-use certificate is a direct response to Canada\u2019s requirement and will remain in effect until Canada removes its end-use requirement. It also serves as a method to prevent imports from being used in U.S. foreign aid, export, and credit guarantee programs. The Canada-United States Joint Commission on Grains recommended that both countries remove these requirements.", "Another long-standing issue involves U.S. wheat exporters\u2019 access to Canada\u2019s primary grain elevator system. Canadian access to U.S. elevators, on the other hand, is relatively less impeded. In addition, Canada provides its wheat farmers with government railcars to transport their wheat. The Canada-United States Joint Commission on Grains recommended that both countries pursue the long-term goal of providing reciprocal access to each other\u2019s grain infrastructure. In January 1998, the United States and Canada announced plans to implement a pilot program to facilitate U.S. wheat exports to Canada that would enable the United States to ship its grain directly to Canadian grain elevators. The United States is negotiating with Canada over Canada\u2019s current requirement that U.S. grain be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate\u2014an assurance that the grain is disease free. The United States is also concerned about the costs of the pilot program and how it will be applied to imports.", "The United States continues to disagree with Canada\u2019s interpretation of CFTA provisions defining the acquisition price of grains and the decision of the CFTA durum panel. In her May 1998 testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the U.S. Trade Representative stated that there was a problem with CFTA in this regard and that the United States may try to revisit this issue in the upcoming 1999 WTO multilateral trade negotiations involving agriculture. In March 1998, the United States requested a new audit of the CWB\u2019s grain pricing related to the acquisition price. Canada agreed to the new audit but disagreed with the United States on its terms. Canada wants to maintain the audit terms both countries agreed to after the 1993 CFTA dispute settlement panel decision. The United States wants to (1) deviate from the panel decision by applying a broader definition of \u201cacquisition price\u201d; (2) expand the audit to cover not only durum but also spring wheat and barley; and (3) include in the audit Canadian grain export prices to countries other than the United States.", "Wheat imports from Canada into the United States have risen since 1990, as shown in figure 1.3. Since the early 1990s, durum and red spring wheat imports have increased. Between 1990 and 1997, Canadian red spring wheat imports grew by more than 2,106 percent to 1,449,600 tons, while Canadian durum wheat imports have risen by 57 percent to 427,600 tons."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Durum Red Spring Other", "paragraphs": ["In our 1996 report on STEs, we developed an economic framework to assess the capabilities of three STEs, given their relationships to domestic producers, governments, and foreign buyers.

We also traveled to Canada to gather documents and interview officials from various agencies within the Canadian government who are involved with the Canadian grain trade, including Agriculture Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Canadian Grain Commission, Finance Canada, the Canadian International Grains Institute, and Transport Canada. In addition, we interviewed officials from the CWB, representatives from the Canadian railroad industry, and private sector representatives in the grain trade.", "To learn about the CWB from the U.S. government perspective, we interviewed officials from FAS and USTR.

Specifically, we obtained Customs\u2019 detailed data base on all wheat and barley shipments from Canada entered from 1992 through 1996. From Census, we obtained aggregate import data for 1992 through 1997. We also obtained information collected and compiled by USDA on the end use of wheat imported from Canada for the most recent  3 marketing years. We then reviewed all of the data to determine what they revealed about Canadian wheat imports. We requested a variety of data from the CWB, including transactional data, but were denied access.", "We also interviewed officials from Customs, Census, and USDA about their import data. Our discussions included what procedures they use for collecting and compiling the data and for ensuring quality control, how the data are used by government agencies and private industry, and what the strengths and limitations of the data are.

We reviewed appropriate provisions of international trade agreements.", "To determine the frequency with which dispute settlement procedures have been used for matters involving the CWB and other STEs, we reviewed appropriate provisions of international trade agreements. We identified WTO member country STEs; the type of information available about STEs; and STEs\u2019 compliance with the WTO\u2019s article XVII, by reviewing article XVII STE notifications submitted to the WTO Secretariat from 1995 to 1997. We also reviewed past GAO work. We requested that USTR identify all disputes under international agreements that involved an STE that had been notified to the WTO.", "To determine the frequency with which U.S. trade remedy laws have been applied to matters involving the CWB and other STEs, we reviewed those laws and spoke with officials at USTR, the ITC, the Department of Commerce, USDA, the Department of Justice, and the NAFTA Secretariat. We obtained a list of STEs that provided notifications to the WTO Secretariat. We then asked USTR, the ITC, and Commerce to search their trade remedy enforcement records for any actions involving those STEs, going back to 1980. We asked the agencies to provide us with a description of the actions and their outcomes. All of the agencies responded to our request by identifying trade remedy actions that, according to their records, had involved STEs. The agencies stated, however, that it was difficult to determine conclusively whether the cases the agencies had identified represented the entire universe of such matters involving STEs. The agencies provided several reasons for this difficulty: (1) the voluminous amount of documentation on some types of cases coupled with an absence of electronic records to facilitate searches; (2) the possibility that an STE\u2019s foreign name translation in a case file would differ from the translation on our STE list; (3) the fact that under U.S. law, STEs as institutions would not be the primary subject of a trade remedy action; and (4) the fact that the trade remedy action may not be country or foreign exporter specific; that is, it may involve imports of a particular product from all sources. We also examined Federal Register notices and reports issued by the agencies on their findings.", "To review CWB participation in U.S. futures and commodity markets/exchanges, we met with CWB officials and reviewed CWB documents concerning CWB objectives in participating in U.S. markets.

The CWB controls all exports of wheat and barley products through an export licensing process and directly markets most of its exports, including those made to import STEs. The operating costs of the CWB are deducted from payments made to producers. It enjoys pricing flexibility due to its assured supply of grain and ability to price discriminate. This assurance of supply is not absolute, however, as producers are free to plant non-CWB crops.

This status allows the CWB to capture premiums through price differentiation, a practice in which the CWB sells grain at differing prices into different markets and to different customers. CWB-contracted economic studies have concluded that the single-desk status of the CWB gives it market power in the world wheat and barley trade and increases farmer revenue through price discrimination. One study found that for 1981-94, the CWB on average increased wheat revenues by $14.56 per ton, or $289 million per year when compared to a system of multiple sellers offering wheat in competition with each other.These premiums represent about 8 percent of CWB wheat revenues for those years. A second study found that the CWB increased barley producer revenues on average by $70.5 million per year (1986 to 1995) when compared to what they would have received in a system of multiple sellers. These premiums represent about 15 percent of the CWB barley revenues for those years.", "In contrast, a study financed by the provincial government of Alberta concludes that the CWB lacks market power and finds that the Canadian grain system is more costly than the comparable U.S. system. The study concluded that Japan is the only market where a single-desk premium may exist, and that, based on Japan\u2019s share of CWB sales, the single-desk seller premium is small.", "As a single-desk seller, the CWB has market power and can price discriminate, according to officials at six grain companies located in the United States and in Canada. \u201cPrice discrimination\u201d is the practice of charging a higher price to some buyers and a lower price to others in order to maximize profits. CWB contracts include a provision that stipulates that the grain is for shipment to and consumption in a specific country. Grain companies reported that this stipulation prevents the AEs from competing against each other on price. One grain company characterized this as being good for Canadian and foreign producers but bad for consumers.", "As a single-desk seller, the CWB may also choose to sell quantities to a certain market that differ from what would be supplied by the private trade. Several grain industry officials representing grain companies, grain consumers, and industry organizations reported that they believe the CWB withholds grain sales to the United States, with some citing the sales\u2019 political sensitivity. An implication of withheld sales is that exports to the United States would increase in the absence of the CWB.

The CWB has an assured supply of grain that it does not compete for and, according to a Canadian government official, acquires the grain from farmers at about 70-75 percent of the expected final return. This provides the CWB with a large margin within which to set prices and absorb any risk from changes in market conditions. The Canadian government confirms that, within its mandate to maximize returns to producers, the CWB has a certain latitude in pricing grain to customers. In contrast, private grain companies compete to acquire farmer-held stocks of grains and then compete to market it to buyers. Their profits and operations are funded from this margin between the two, and they encounter considerable risk from changes in market conditions.", "CWB officials note that the CWB engages in price discrimination to benefit from differing market conditions around the world. Certain customers may be willing to pay more for CWB grain than other customers, so the CWB could charge them a higher price. In turn, the CWB may be able to lower its price to certain importing countries without affecting its sales to premium customers. We were not able to analyze the conditions under which this occurred, since we did not have access to CWB transactions, which the CWB considers commercially sensitive.", "CWB pricing flexibility into the U.S. market was restricted as part of the CFTA, which went into effect in 1989. According to the agreement, sales into the United States could not be for less than the acquisition price plus the cost of transportation and handling of the grain. The United States and Canada disagreed on what constituted the Canadian acquisition price. A CFTA dispute resolution panel determined that the acquisition price is the initial payment the CWB gives farmers when they deliver their grain (see  ch. 4). The initial payment is set by the government of Canada in consultation with the CWB. However, changes in how the government establishes the initial payment since the CFTA went into effect may have increased CWB flexibility in pricing grain headed into the United States.", "A USTR negotiator of the CFTA recalls that during the 1980s the initial payment was established close to 90 percent of the expected final payment to producers. During the early 1990s, the CWB initial payments were set at 80 percent while, according to an official of the government of Canada, the initial payment is now set at between 70 and 75 percent. We requested data on the expected final payment to producers from the government of Canada to confirm this trend, but the request was declined. According to a Canadian government official, the decisions on the amount of the initial payment are considered to be \u201cAdvice to Ministers\u201d and thus confidential. A USTR official believes that the reduction in the initial payment gives Canada more latitude in lowering its prices to the U.S. market. This effectively lowers the pricing floor established by the CFTA. The government of Canada interprets these changes differently. According to government officials, while the events during the 1980s and early 1990s may well have influenced the subsequent judgments of those involved in making decisions concerning initial payment levels, to attribute any trend in government decision making in this area to the CFTA or the relationship to acquisition prices would be misleading."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Canadian Government Assistance to the CWB", "paragraphs": ["The Canadian government provides important financial assistance to the CWB.

These guarantees allow the CWB to borrow in commercial markets at favorable interest rates. In parliamentary testimony, a CWB official estimated that in 1995, CWB borrowing costs were $30 million lower than if the CWB had borrowed at the rate faced by a large multinational grain company and $46 million lower when compared to the normal commercial business rate of borrowing. The effect of this difference varies over time. In order to update the estimated interest savings, we recomputed the savings based on data provided by the CWB on the interest difference between rates the CWB posts to investors on its commercial paper and market rates of commercial paper from highly rated, nongovernment-guaranteed issuers. As of December 1997, the annual interest savings on CWB borrowing were between $9.4 million and $14 million, substantially lower than the 1995 value.", "The CWB is in a position to profit from the interest rate differential between government borrowing costs and commercial rates on behalf of producers. In addition to enjoying reduced borrowing costs, the CWB can also earn interest on funds held following a grain sale but before making final payment to the producers. During the interim, the CWB can invest the funds at market rates and earn interest. The CWB does not distinguish in its public reporting between its earnings related to the indirect government support of below market rates of interest and its earnings from the reinvestment of sales revenues on behalf of producers. The latter earnings do not represent a benefit of the CWB since individual producers could also have invested the revenues at market rates if the CWB paid them at the time of sale.

This subsidy applies to all prairie grains, including the CWB grains. In addition to the federal government-owned hopper cars, the government leases another 1,982 hopper cars, and two provincial governments contribute another 1,973 cars. In total, government-provided cars constitute about two-thirds of the 25,000 grain cars in Canada.

The subsidy, since the CFTA in 1989, did not apply to shipments to the United States from Canadian west coast ports, but to shipments traveling overseas and to the United States through Thunder Bay, Ontario. The cash subsidy ended in 1995 with its elimination due to internal budget constraints and Canada\u2019s need to meet its obligations under the WTO agreements.

According to a CWB official, the shipping costs of moving grain to Canadian coastal ports more than doubled when the subsidy ended, while costs to ship to the United States were left unchanged. The observed impact of the removal of the subsidies has been obscured by concurrent factors that have influenced export volumes and destinations. The CWB official in charge of U.S. marketing explained that at the same time the end of the rail subsidies made the United States a more attractive market, the decline of U.S. usage of the USDA\u2019s Export Enhancement Program was working in an offsetting fashion, making the United States a less attractive market. According to a Canadian transportation official, it is too soon after the changes in the rail subsidy to see the effect, but Transport Canada anticipates the changes will lead to greater shipments to the United States or increased Canadian grain processing.", "During the same period in which the government rail subsidies ended, the CWB changed the way it computes the freight charges that it deducted from the payments it made to individual producers when they delivered their grain. This change in the pooling points for computing freight rate changes raised the shipping costs of grain for producers in the eastern prairies, making the United States a more attractive market. The impact of the subsidy elimination and of the CWB changes in freight charges is estimated to have a significant impact on the Canadian exports to the United States. The Producer Payment Panel, a Canadian government-appointed group representing industry, government, and academics, used an economic model of Canadian agriculture to estimate the impact. The panel estimated that the two changes would increase export shipments of wheat to the United States by 46 percent and barley by 44 percent. This assumed that commodity flows are allowed to respond to market signals and do not face U.S. border restrictions or diversion by the CWB.", "The government of Canada gave notice in 1997 that by 2002, the fleet of government-owned rail hopper cars would be privatized. The privatization of these hoppers is expected to change the attractiveness of shipment to the U.S. market relative to shipments to Canadian ports in a way reminiscent of the impact of ending the direct transportation subsidies.", "Currently, railcars are provided to the industry without cost for rail movements east, north, or west, but charges are levied if the cars are used for shipments to the United States. According to a Canadian rail manager, the application to rail shipments of full costs for the railcars will make it relatively cheaper to move grain to the United States than to port positions once privatization takes place.", "Recently, the Canadian government began a review of the grain handling and transportation system, with completion scheduled by the end of 1998. The grain review secretariat describes its scope as comprehensive, covering all handling and transportation actions between the farm bin and the loading of vessels for export. The objectives of the review are to ensure that the Canadian system meets expectations of customers; maximizes system efficiency, competitiveness, and capacity utilization; provides cost-effectiveness; promotes necessary investment; and establishes roles, responsibilities, and accountability for each system participant. A Montana State University study reviewed changes underway in the Canadian grain handling and transportation system and concluded that any reduction in freight costs due to system improvements is unlikely to fully offset the large increase in shipping costs due to the end of the direct subsidies and change in pooling costs.

According to CWB officials, prices for sales into the Canadian and U.S. markets are based on the trading values of grain on the MGE, adjusted for commercial freight.

This difference in transparency between the U.S. and Canadian pricing practices places U.S. firms at a strategic disadvantage when competing with the CWB.

The contract price is usually based on the current price of durum on the Minneapolis grain market. The market price of durum wheat can vary considerably from month to month.

However, one USDA official also told us that the new questionnaire may provide virtually no new information about CWB pricing. This official told us that the CWB has provided much more information and transparency on domestic prices in recent years; Canada now publishes prices daily in various publications, and these data are essentially the same kind of price data that are available in the United States for U.S. grain prices.
