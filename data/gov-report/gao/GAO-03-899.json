Charter schools are public schools that are exempt from certain state and local regulations in exchange for agreeing to certain student performance goals. To increase their understanding of problems faced during the start-up process, Congress included a provision in the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 108-7), which required GAO to report on charter school start-ups, including a comparison with charter schools in the District of Columbia. This report examines (1) the challenges faced by charter school start-ups across the nation and the resources available in various states to address these challenges and (2) how the District of Columbia compares in terms of charter school challenges and resources. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed federal, state, and D.C. charter school laws and interviewed Education and District officials, including representatives of the D.C. charter school authorizing boards, the D.C. public school system, and various city offices. GAO also conducted a discussion group consisting of District charter school experts and D.C. charter school founders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Securing a facility, obtaining start-up funding, and, to a lesser extent, acquiring the expertise necessary to run a charter school are the three greatest challenges facing new charter school founders nationwide, although the extent of the challenges varied from state to state. Charter school advocates report that charter schools need buildings that allow them to grow as their enrollment grows and that they have limited access to financing for facilities--both of which make securing facilities one of the most difficult aspects of opening a new charter school. Additionally, charter schools report that obtaining start-up money, particularly early in the charter application and planning periods, is difficult. In gaining approval for charters, they may incur significant expenses, such as hiring experts to review charters, purchasing curriculum programs, and placing down payments on facilities, before becoming eligible to receive most forms of public funding. Another challenge facing new charter school founders is acquiring the expertise--business, legal, managerial--necessary to open and run a charter school. Several federal, state, and local programs are available to help charter schools address these challenges across the country and in the District of Columbia. At the federal level, the Public Charter Schools Program has awarded about $1 billion in grants since 1994 to charter schools to help offset their start up costs. The program has also provided additional funding for a limited number of grants to organizations to increase charter schools' access to facilities financing. Some states also provide assistance to charter schools to address these challenges. The challenges facing D.C. charter schools are similar to those around the country; however, obtaining facilities is particularly difficult in D.C. due to the cost of real estate and poor condition of available buildings. To offset this challenge, the District provides charter schools with various forms of assistance, including a limited preference to buy or lease surplus public school buildings and a per-pupil allotment for the cost of facilities. To address challenges associated with start-up funding, the District provides charter schools with some funding prior to schools' opening. Although the District chartering authorities provide some guidance to charter applicants, they do not provide them with general technical assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The growing popularity of educational choice was highlighted in a May  2003 study by the Department of Education\u2019s National Center for  Education Statistics that reported a shift in public school enrollment away  from public, assigned schools into public, chosen schools from   1993-1999. Charter schools are one of the primary ways that parents can  exercise choice in the public school system. While their impact on student  achievement is still being debated, charter schools are a form of  educational reform that has enjoyed bipartisan support from Congress and  other policy makers. Since 1994, the federal government has provided  about $1 billion in grants to charter schools in addition to financial  support provided by state and local governments.", "Currently about 1.5 percent of students nationwide, and 15 percent in the  District of Columbia, are attending charter schools. Charter schools are  public schools that are exempt from certain state and local regulations in  exchange for accountability for improving student achievement. Like  traditional public schools, charter schools receive funding from state and  local governments on a per-pupil basis; however, unlike traditional public  schools, charter schools are responsible for a wide range of functions that  are usually administered by the local school district, such as managing  faculty payroll and securing and maintaining school facilities. Other  resources available to charter schools depend on specific state laws, local  school district decisions, and the availability of private or nonprofit  assistance.", "The opening of a charter school can present challenges to the founders.

In the 2002-2003 school year, public  charter schools enrolled nearly 700,000 students or approximately   1.5 percent of America\u2019s 48 million public school students in pre- kindergarten through 12th grade. Students enrolled in charter schools are  more likely to be members of minority groups than students enrolled in  traditional public schools according to a 4-year study of charter schools  conducted for Education.", "Charter schools are public schools established under contracts that grant  them greater levels of autonomy from school regulations in exchange for  agreeing to certain student performance goals. Charter schools are often  exempt from certain state and school district education laws and in some  states may receive waivers for exemptions from other laws; however,  charter schools must comply with select regulations, including those  pertaining to special education, civil rights, and health and safety  conditions. While charter schools are free from many educational  regulations, they are accountable for their educational and budgetary  performance, including the assessment requirements of the No Child Left  Behind Act. Charter schools may have their charters revoked by the  authorizing body if they fail to perform adequately.", "Charters to operate a school are awarded by various entities, depending  on the state\u2019s laws, but may include local school districts, state education  agencies, institutions of higher education, municipal governments, or  special chartering boards. The majority of charter school authorizing  bodies have formal procedures to regulate the charter application process,  including formal application deadlines and public hearings. The ease of the  authorizing process for charter schools varies from state to state,  depending on the specifications in state law governing charters and local  support or resistance to charter schools. For instance, some states limit  the number of charters that may be awarded either in total or by year.  Also, some state laws specify multiple authorizers, while others restrict  approval authority to a single entity, for example, a local school board, and  provide for appeal when a charter is denied.", "In addition to awarding charters, authorizing bodies are responsible for  monitoring school performance in areas such as student performance,  compliance with regulations, financial record keeping, and special  education services. If charter schools do not meet expected performance  measures, authorizing bodies may revoke a school\u2019s charter or decide not  to renew the school\u2019s charter when it expires. Since 1992, more than   100 charter schools have been closed, either through charter revocation or  nonrenewal. According to a recent study published by the Thomas B.  Fordham Institute, the majority of these closings have been due to  financial mismanagement, while the rest have been closed due to  unsatisfactory student achievement or other performance failures.", "A wide range of individuals or groups, including parents, educators,  nonprofit organizations, and universities, may apply for a school charter as  nonprofit organizations. Similar to other nonprofit organizations, charter  schools are governed by a board of trustees, which is selected by the  school founders. Although requirements for charter school board  membership vary across states, charter school boards are responsible for  school oversight. Specifically, charter school boards oversee legal  compliance, contracts with external parties, financial management and  policies, and facilities and equipment acquisition and maintenance.  Charter school board members are also responsible for identifying real  and potential risks facing the charter school, such as financial and school  liability risks and emergency preparedness, and taking steps to reduce or  eliminate these risks.", "Charter schools may be established in one of two ways. First, an existing  school may be converted to a public charter school. Traditional public  schools may convert to charter schools to focus on a specific segment of  the student body, such as at-risk students, to apply a new curriculum or  educational approach, or to operate in a less regulatory environment.  Charter schools may also be established when a new school is created and  awarded a charter. The majority of charter schools are newly created  schools rather than conversion schools. According to a study done for  Education, in the 2000-2001 school year, 76 percent of new charter schools  were newly created. Charter schools that are converted from existing  schools generally remain in their buildings, while newly created charter  schools must acquire facilities. These newly created charter schools may  operate in a variety of facilities, including surplus school buildings, shared  space with other groups, such as the YMCA or other charter schools, and  converted commercial buildings, including office and retail space. In  September 2000, we reported that new charter schools often experience  difficulty financing the purchase or lease of their facilities.", "With approximately 15 percent of its public school students attending  charter schools, the District of Columbia has one of the highest  concentrations of public students in charter schools in the country. Like  most charter schools, District charter schools have lower average total  enrollments and student to teacher ratios than traditional public schools.  Additionally, District charter schools, like their national counterparts,  serve a higher percentage of minority and low-income students than  traditional public schools. Charter school applicants in the District may  apply to either of two authorizing entities, the District of Columbia Public  Charter School Board or the District of Columbia Board of Education. As  of the 2002-2003 school year, the D.C. Public Charter School Board has  authorized charters for 23 schools, 1 of which closed voluntarily. The D.C.  Board of Education has authorized charters for 21 schools, 6 of which  closed for performance and management reasons.

The federal government and 27 states  provide limited assistance to address this problem. Charter schools also  report facing difficulties obtaining funding during the application and early  implementation periods, although the federal government and a small  number of states provide funding for charter school start-up grants. The  wide array of knowledge and skills necessary to open and operate a new  charter school, such as business, law, management, and education  expertise, also presents a challenge, according to charter school founders.  Few federal programs exist that specifically address this challenge;  however, some assistance is available from state, local, and nonprofit  sources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Securing Adequate Facilities Is a Major Challenge; Limited Assistance Provided in Most States", "paragraphs": ["According to research articles and national charter school experts,  securing adequate facilities is one of the most challenging aspects of  starting a new charter school. Unlike traditional public schools that rely  on school districts for support, charter schools are responsible for  locating, securing, and renovating their school buildings. Locating an  appropriate facility can be difficult for new charter schools. Because new  charter schools often open with few classrooms or grades and a limited  number of enrolled students, charter schools frequently expand  significantly, sometimes by several grades, during their first few years of  operation. As a result, new charter schools either look for a smaller  building that will meet their current size needs or a larger one that will  accommodate future growth. Both options can pose problems for new  charter schools, as opening in a smaller building requires an ongoing  search for a larger facility and the expense of a future move, while  selecting a larger facility, if one can be found, may not be financially  feasible in a school\u2019s early years. Additionally, schools have facilities  requirements\u2014they need facilities that will enable them to subdivide  space into classrooms and also contain common space to serve as  gymnasiums, cafeterias, or auditoriums. Transforming commercial space  into educational facilities with classrooms and common rooms can be  expensive. Some charter schools are able to acquire existing school  buildings to use for facilities, which can reduce transformation costs;  however, the number of excess school buildings available is generally  limited.", "In addition to encountering difficulties locating appropriate facilities,  charter schools have difficulty financing the building purchase or lease  and renovations. Traditional public schools generally rely on school  districts for facility financing, which is often provided either by raising  taxes or issuing municipal bonds. Charter schools, however, are generally  not part of a local school district and rarely have the authority to raise  taxes or issue tax-exempt bonds independently. Charter schools\u2019 access to  other facility financing options, such as private lending, is also limited.  Charter schools are often considered credit risks because they may have  limited credit histories, lack significant cash flows, and have short-term  charters that can be revoked. As a result, private loans are not easily  accessible to charter schools for facility financing. Because municipal  bonds and private loans may be inaccessible to charter schools, many  charter schools finance their facilities through per-pupil allocations  provided by the state or district. These per-pupil allotments are provided  to all public schools, including charter schools, to cover operating  expenses, such as teachers\u2019 salaries and the purchase of books and  supplies. Additionally, some charter schools finance their facilities  through private donations.", "Several states provide financial assistance to charter schools that is  specifically designated for facilities. Eleven states and the District of  Columbia provide direct funding to charter schools for facilities, either  through grant programs to help cover building acquisition costs or lease- aid programs to help cover building maintenance and facility lease or  mortgage payments. Of these 11 states, 5 \u2014 Arizona, California, Florida,  Massachusetts, and Minnesota \u2014 and the District of Columbia have  provided charter schools with a designated annual revenue source to  offset facilities expenses. Approximately half of all charter schools operate  in these 5 states and D.C., where charter schools receive a supplemental  per-pupil allotment that is designated to cover facilities expenses. For  example, charter schools in low-income areas in California may receive up  to $750 per student to cover lease expenses, while charter schools in  Florida may receive up to approximately $1,300 per student to offset  facilities costs. Additionally, at least 5 states \u2014 Colorado, Georgia,  Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas \u2014 and the District of Columbia have  enacted legislation that would enable the state bonding authorities to issue  tax-exempt bonds on behalf of charter schools.", "In addition to providing charter schools with funding for facilities, states  may provide charter schools with other forms of facilities assistance.  Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that allow  charter schools access to vacant public buildings. The extent to which  these laws enable charter schools to gain access to public buildings varies  considerably both in terms of how proactive the states are in providing  access and in terms of the cost of this access to charter schools. Some  state laws, such as those in Alaska, simply make it legal for charter  schools to operate in excess public space if it is available, while other state  laws provide charter schools with preferential access to available space or  mandate procedures for informing charter schools when public space  becomes available. For instance, Arizona law requires that an annual list of  appropriate public buildings be made available to charter schools.  Additionally, the amount charter schools must pay for this space varies. In  Virginia, charter schools do not have to pay rent for available school  buildings, while in Louisiana, charter schools must pay fair market value  to use excess public facilities. Table 2 summarizes the various types of  facility assistance provided. Appendix II provides greater detail about  facilities assistance provisions in state laws.", "Some federal support also exists to help public charter schools acquire  facilities. Under the Public Charter Schools Program, the federal  government provides a limited number of grants to public or private  organizations for the development of facilities-related \u201ccredit  enhancement initiatives.\u201d Organizations use credit enhancement grants to  leverage additional capital for charter schools for the acquisition,  construction, or renovation of facilities. Charter schools do not receive  this grant money directly; instead the grant money is provided to  organizations that use the funding for a range of activities to help charter  schools improve their credit. These activities include insuring or  facilitating the issuance of bonds, subsidizing interest payments, creating   a facilities loan pool, or serving as a loan guarantor. Grant recipients  generally provide support to charter schools in specific states or regions  or to specific types of charter schools. For example, one 2001 grant  recipient, the Raza Development Fund, a nonprofit Hispanic advocacy  organization, is using its grant to increase 30 Hispanic charter schools\u2019  access to direct loans. The credit enhancement program has received  funding twice, in fiscal years 2001 and 2003. Under the Public Charter  Schools Program, the federal government is also authorized to provide  grants to states to establish or enhance per-pupil facilities aid programs;  however, as of July 2003, this program has never received funding. Like  traditional public schools, charter schools may access federally  administered Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZAB), which provide  financial assistance for public school renovations. To qualify for these  bonds, public schools must be located in an empowerment zone or  enterprise community or have at least 35 percent of their students eligible  for free or reduced-price school lunch. In addition, federal law permits  local school districts, including charter schools, to enter into public- private partnerships that allow private entities to take advantage of tax- exempt bonds\u2014often referred to as private activity bonds\u2014for school  construction and renovation. However, as we reported in a 2000 study of  charter school facilities financing, the credit worthiness of most new  charter schools and concerns about their ability to repay remain a concern  for bond raters and buyers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obtaining Sufficient Start- Up Funding Is also a Major Challenge; Assistance Provided Primarily by Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["According to national studies of new charter schools, obtaining sufficient  start-up funding is one of the two greatest challenges facing charter  schools during the planning and early implementations stages. Charter  schools incur many start-up expenses during the planning and early  implementation stages, such as hiring lawyers and business consultants to  review charter plans and applications, buying curriculum programs and  instructional materials, purchasing school furniture and supplies, hiring  key staff, purchasing insurance, and placing down payments on facilities.  Unlike traditional public schools, most charter schools do not receive  financial support from local school districts during the early planning  stages, and many are not eligible for local funds until the school opens.  While the timetable for disbursing funds varies by location, charter  schools can incur a variety of expenses\u2014for example, attorney and  consultant fees\u2014before they are eligible to receive most sources of public  funding. To help meet these early expenses, many charter schools rely on  funds raised through private sources, such as individual fundraising or  awards from private foundations.", "Charter schools become eligible for financial assistance under the Public  Charter Schools Program after the application has been submitted and  certain other requirements met. Through this program, charter schools can  receive funding to help defray planning, design, and implementation  expenses. Grants are awarded under this program by Education to state  departments of education to be distributed directly to charter schools for a  period of not more than 3 years, of which no more than 18 months may be  used for planning and program design and no more than 24 months may be  used for implementation. Education recommends that states provide  charter schools with $450,000 over the 3-year period to be distributed in  $150,000 annual allotments. Charter schools that are still in the early  planning stages and have not yet submitted an application may apply for a  waiver to the program\u2019s eligibility requirements to receive a \u201cpre-planning\u201d  subgrant. Education recommends that states awarding pre-planning  subgrants provide sums of $10,000 to $20,000 and requires that pre- planning grants count towards a charter school\u2019s 3-year subgrant time  limit. According to an evaluation of the Public Charter Schools Program  conducted for Education in 2001, almost two-thirds of charter schools are  recipients of Public Charter School subgrants. The data also indicated that  of those schools not receiving subgrants through the Public Charter  Schools Program, about half did not apply. According to Education  officials, charter schools that are turned down for subgrants through this  program may have applied for the funding after they had completed their  early planning and implementation stages, which would make them  ineligible.", "An analysis of data collected by the Education Commission of the States  showed that in 2003 approximately one-fourth of states with charter  school laws had established programs to assist new charter schools with  start-up costs through grants or loans. Nine states, Alaska, California,  Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and  Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia made start-up loans or grants  available to new charter schools. The size and timing of these grants and  loans varied from state to state. In Georgia, for example, new charter  school founders were eligible for $5,000 grants during the school planning  phase, while new charter school founders in Pennsylvania were eligible for  $25,000 grants to cover expenses during the charter application process.  Additionally, Louisiana had established a $3 million loan fund to provide  charter schools with money during the start-up period, and charter schools  in California are eligible to receive loans for as much as $250,000, which  could be repaid over a 5-year period. Although these grant and loan  programs had been authorized, funding for these programs is uncertain.  For example, Minnesota will not fund its charter school start-up grant  program for fiscal year 2004 for budgetary reasons.  Additionally,  according to the Education Commission of the States data, Nevada, which  has authorized a loan program, has never funded it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Specific Expertise also Poses Difficulties; Some Assistance Is Available from Local or Nonprofit Sources", "paragraphs": ["The wide array of knowledge and skills necessary to open and operate a  charter school often presents a challenge for charter school founders.

As figure 2 shows, to successfully achieve these tasks, charter school  founders must have expertise in a variety of areas, including educational  systems, legal issues, and general business practices; however, few  individuals are well versed in all of these subjects. National surveys of  charter school founders cite their limited knowledge of certain areas as a  challenge to opening new charter schools.", "The federal government provides limited assistance to charter school  founders to help them acquire expertise. Education sponsors a Web site,  www.uscharterschools.org, that provides an overview of state charter  laws, lists state charter school advocacy groups, and promotes exchanges  between charter school founders. In addition, 5 percent of the Public  Charter Schools Program grant money may be used by the states to cover  administrative expenses, which can include funding for technical  assistance programs. For example, the Florida Department of Education  uses a small percentage of its approximately $26 million Public Charter  Schools grant to fund a resource center that provides new charter schools  with technical assistance throughout the chartering process. The Florida  program provides charter schools with assistance in management,  governance, and budgeting and fosters mentoring relationships between  new and established charter schools. Under the Public Charter Schools  Program, some states provide subgrants to high-performing charter  schools that have been open for at least 3 consecutive years to share best  practices with new charter school founders.", "Technical assistance programs that help charter school founders learn  more about how to open and operate a school are generally administered  by state or local governments. According to the Education Commission of  the States, 28 states and Puerto Rico provide some technical assistance to  charter schools through their state departments of education or local  school boards. The extent and type of this assistance varies. Some states  conduct periodic workshops, others provide targeted assistance to  individual charter schools upon request, and some states provide both  types of assistance. For example, the Pennsylvania Department of  Education conducts monthly regional workshops and provides assistance  to individual charter schools upon request. Additionally, states or local  school boards may provide charter school founders with assistance during  the charter application period or after the charter school has opened.  Types of assistance that are designed to help charter school founders  operate their schools include staff development and management, use of  student data, technology training, and curriculum development.", "Charter school founders also rely on nonprofit organizations to help them  gain expertise. Charter school resource centers, which are primarily  nonprofit organizations, assist charter schools in specific states or regions  in the opening and operation of the school. According to data from a  national charter school advocacy organization, these resource centers  operate in approximately half of the states with charter school laws. The  resource centers address founders\u2019 lack of expertise by providing new  charter schools with a wide range of services, such as budgeting  assistance, board development, and classroom management. The type of  services provided by these resource centers varies significantly. For  example, a charter school resource center in Wisconsin helps charter  schools with board development, networking, business management, and  legal compliance. The Massachusetts Charter School Resource Center  provides a fellowship to a small number of charter school founders.  Charter school founders selected to participate in this competitive  program are paid $50,000 for 1 year, as they learn how to effectively found  and operate a charter school through a training and internship program.  According to resource center representatives with whom we spoke,  charter school resource centers also may help potential founders make  decisions about moving forward with the application and chartering  process. By helping potential charter school founders better understand  what is involved with founding a new charter school, resource centers can  also offer potential founders advice as they decide whether or not they  should attempt to open a charter school. The funding and operation of  charter school resource centers also varies significantly. Charter school  resource centers may be funded by private donations, supported by fee- for-service arrangements, sponsored by university programs, or financed  by state or local governments.", "In addition to more formal resources, charter school founders rely on  other charter school founders and their own boards of directors to help  them gain needed expertise. Charter school founders often rely upon other  charter school founders who had opened schools in the same state or  region for expertise and advise. One charter school founder we  interviewed said that the insights and expertise provided by people who  had also gone through the local chartering process enabled him to more  fully understand what was required to charter and open a school.  Additionally, charter school founders seek expertise and assistance from  their boards of directors. As nonprofit organizations, all charter schools  must have a board of directors responsible for school governance issues.  Charter school boards often include members with varying areas of  expertise, such as lawyers, accountants, management consultants, and  community organizers.

Charter  school officials and charter school authorizing officials told us that in  recent years the expense of real estate in the District of Columbia has  limited the options available to new charter schools. National reports on  commercial real estate markets show that commercial property in the  District is among the most expensive in the nation and that there is  continued strong demand for commercial property. Additionally, D.C.  charter school founders reported that available buildings tend to be older,  in need of extensive and costly renovations, or not fit to be used as  schools. For example, one charter school organization that purchased an  unoccupied District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) building  estimated that the cost of renovating the building would be over   $5 million.", "To help alleviate some of this strain, the D.C. charter school law provides  charter schools with a limited preference in acquiring surplus DCPS  buildings. Specifically, the law provides charter schools with a preference  to purchase or lease DCPS surplus buildings at below market rates,  provided that doing so will not result in a significant loss of revenue that  might be obtained from other dispositions or use of the property. In March  2000, DCPS conducted an inventory of all its schools and designated   38 surplus school buildings. As of June 2003, charter schools are using   14 of these buildings: 11 set aside for their exclusive use by order of the  mayor in October 2000 and 3 others. According to District officials, of  these 14 buildings, charter school groups have purchased, or are in the  process of purchasing, about half at a 25 percent discount from fair market  value. The other half are being leased to charter schools at discounted  rates\u2014about 50 percent of fair market value. As of June 2003, DCPS had  designated no additional surplus buildings. However, as a part of its  Facilities Master Plan, a comprehensive plan for renovating or  modernizing its schools, DCPS is currently finalizing a facilities  assessment. This assessment, which DCPS expects to complete by  September 2003, could potentially identify additional surplus school  buildings. If such buildings were identified, a list of them would be sent  to the mayor\u2019s office, which would determine how to dispose of them.", "In addition to these preferences, DCPS designated one of its public school  buildings as a \u201chub school,\u201d where charter schools can lease space for up  to 3 years. Since 1998, the hub school has housed a total of 6 charter  schools, 3 charter schools at a time, with each charter school occupying its  own floor. All the schools in the building share common space, such as the  auditorium, gymnasium, and outdoor field space. The two authorizing  boards notify charter schools when space in the hub school becomes  available, and charter schools can submit an application to the Mayor\u2019s  Office of Property Management for consideration.", "In addition to the hub school, DCPS occasionally provides charter schools  with other temporary space. It provides such space when a DCPS school is  not using part of the building it occupies or when DCPS has a vacant  building that it has not designated as surplus. In such cases, DCPS allows  charter schools to lease the space on a year-to-year basis. According to an  official in the DCPS realty office, 2 charter schools rented excess space in  an occupied DCPS school building under this type of agreement in school  year 2002-2003. Currently, DCPS has no formal process for making  temporary space available to charter schools. In providing charter schools  with temporary space, the District and DCPS meet some needs particular  to charter schools. Specifically, the hub school and the DCPS temporary  space allow charter schools, which are often initially smaller than  traditional schools, to benefit from the economies of scale realized by  sharing space, such as cafeterias and gymnasiums, with another school.  Temporary space also allows charter schools to focus on the educational  component of their school first rather than focusing on finding a  permanent facility.", "Recent legislation increased the potential for additional shared space  arrangements. This legislation requires DCPS to present a plan to the City  Council for the co-location of charter and other public schools where  underutilized DCPS space exists. As of July 2003, the co-location plan had  not been completed, but DCPS was finalizing a use and capacity study of  all its school buildings, which should identify any underutilized space that  currently exists.", "In addition to the District, two nonprofit organizations have provided D.C.  charter schools with assistance in sharing facilities. The Appletree Charter  School Incubator\u2014a charter school start-up facility operated by a  nonprofit organization\u2014provided temporary space to 2 District charter  schools between 1998 and 2002. The Appletree Institute rented space in a  federally leased building at a discount for 4 years and then provided space  to District charter schools at a discounted rate. The Incubator closed when  the lease expired in 2002 and as of June 2003, both schools were leasing  space in other buildings. In 2003, another nonprofit group, the Charter  Schools Development Corporation (CSDC), purchased a surplus DCPS  building, which it is renovating and will use to permanently house   2 charter schools, according to a CSDC official.", "Besides providing some access to facilities, the District of Columbia also  provides financial assistance to help charter schools acquire facilities  through a variety of mechanisms. One of these is a per-pupil facilities  allotment. In addition to a per-pupil allotment that covers operating  expenses, District charter schools receive a per-pupil allotment for  facilities expenses. In the 2002-2003 school year, charter schools in the  District received a facilities allotment of approximately $1,600 per pupil  for traditional students and about $3,600 per pupil for students at public  charter boarding schools.", "Another way the District provides financial support for facilities to charter  schools is through its Credit Enhancement Revolving Fund. Under the  authority of the D.C. Department of Banking and Financial Institutions,  this program provides loan guarantees and collateral to help finance the  purchase or new construction of charter school facilities. The Credit  Enhancement Revolving Fund was first appropriated $5 million in fiscal  year 2000. It was not until 2003 that it received its second appropriation  totaling $8 million. To date, the Credit Enhancement Revolving Fund has  been able to enhance 6 charter school loans.", "In addition to the Credit Enhancement Revolving Fund, in fiscal year   2003, the District allocated $5 million to a new direct-loan program. Under  this program, the District can provide low-interest loans directly to charter  schools, rather than through private lenders. Charter schools can use the  proceeds from these loans as collateral for a larger loan on a purchase,  new construction, or renovation of a building. This program will  potentially benefit new charter schools the most because private lenders  often do not lend to charter schools that have not begun operating. District  officials told us that as of August 2003, the District has obligated funds  from the direct loan program to 7 charter schools for varying amounts, but  the loan process has not yet been completed.", "The District also provides financial assistance to help charter schools  acquire facilities by allowing charter schools to raise revenues through  tax-exempt bonds. The District will issue bonds on behalf of charter  schools if the charter school meets certain eligibility requirements,  including that the charter school holds nonprofit status, has sufficient  collateral, and has been operating as a school for at least 2 years.  According to the D.C. official overseeing the bond program, new charter  schools have not been able to benefit from this source of funding because  they have not been operating long enough to qualify. As of August   2003, the District has issued 7 bonds on behalf of 6 charter schools,   which has allowed District charter schools to borrow over $39.4 million   in bond revenues to use for their facilities.  One additional charter school  has a bond issue pending.", "In addition to tax-exempt bonds, two other federal bond programs are  available to both traditional schools and charter schools in the district\u2014 QZAB and private activity bonds. According to District officials, as of June  2003, no charter schools had applied for either of these programs.", "Figure 3 shows a summary of the kinds of facility assistance received by  D.C. charter schools operating during the 2002-2003 school year. Some of  this assistance was received at start-up, such as temporary housing in the  hub school, some was received after start-up, for example, tax-exempt  bonds for facilities, and some is received on an on-going basis, for  example, the per-pupil facilities allotment received by all schools. For a  list of charter schools operating in the District in the 2003-2003 school   year and their facility status, see appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The District, Like a Few States, Provides Early Access to Funds to Lessen Start-Up Funding Issues", "paragraphs": ["Like new charter schools in other parts of the country, new charter  schools in the District also incur high start-up costs early in the design and  planning stages. A variety of District charter school founders and others  knowledgeable about charter school issues said that there were limited  options for obtaining start-up funding to plan a new school, but that once  the charter application was approved, more funding options became  available. The D.C. Public Charter School Board and the D.C. Board of  Education have similar application processes, which usually start over a  year before the school\u2019s intended opening. Figure 4 shows a typical  timeline, including when a charter school might expect to become eligible  for public funds. Charter schools in the District must apply for their  charter by June for the school year that starts in September of the  following year. Between July and August, both chartering boards hold  public hearings to ask questions of the charter schools and to allow the  community to provide input on the charter school. In August, preliminary  decisions are made on the charter. At that point, charter applications  receive a preliminary approval, a full approval, or a denial. According to  officials from both authorizing boards, many of their applications receive a  preliminary approval before a full approval.", "Until fiscal year 2003, charter schools were not eligible for public funds  prior to receiving preliminary approval. As a result, charter schools relied  on private sources of funding to cover their expenses. For example, one  recently approved charter school founder reported spending close to  $200,000 in private foundation funds during the early planning stages of  the charter school to pay for fees and feasibility studies on a facility she  planned to use for her charter school. Another charter school founder said  that he had to take out a personal loan to put a deposit on a facility.  Charter school founders said that early funds would be helpful in paying  for such things as compensation for the time professionals spent on  writing the charter application and initial inspections of facilities.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2003, D.C. began awarding pre-planning subgrants  for up to $10,000 from its federal Public Charter Schools Program grant,  making some funds available earlier in the process. Potential charter  school applicants can obtain these grants prior to the submission of the  charter application. The D.C. program specifies that these funds may be  used for up to 12 months of pre-planning activities, such as the  professional development of the charter school planning team and  informing the community about the school. In fiscal year 2003, nine D.C.  charter school groups received these grants.", "D.C. charter school applicants that have received preliminary approval are  eligible to apply for Public Charter Schools Program subgrants for up to  $110,000 to be used the first year following preliminary approval. In the  second and third years, charter schools can receive subgrants in amounts  from $95,000 to $200,000 to be used for implementation purposes. In fiscal  year 2003, DCPS awarded 4 first-year subgrants for $110,000 each and   5 second/third year subgrants for $200,000 each. Applicants can apply for  one or all of these subgrants\u2014 pre-planning, first, second, and third year\u2014  but the total period of time in which these funds are received cannot  exceed 36 months.", "The District also provides charter schools with access to some local  funds\u2014a short-term loan against their annual funds and early payment of  their first-quarter funds\u2014after the charter is fully approved and prior to  the schools opening. To receive either type of funding, schools must have  obtained full approval of their charter, secured a facility, and hold  nonprofit status. According to District officials, no charter schools have  applied for the short\u2013term loan in the past 3 years because the District  changed its policy and now disburses its first-quarter payment in July,  approximately 6-8 weeks prior to the start of the school year. The timeline  for receiving the first-quarter payment is now consistent with when many  charter schools can meet the eligibility requirements for receiving this  loan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The District Charter School Resource Center\u2019s Closing Has Diminished Access to Start-Up Knowledge, although Some Local Resources Are Available", "paragraphs": ["New charter school founders in the District are similar to charter school  founders across the country in that they must have expertise in a wide  range of areas to successfully open and operate a charter school. In our  discussions, some D.C. charter school experts said that one of the  challenges that many charter school founders encounter is acquiring the  business and legal knowledge necessary to run a school. D.C. charter  school experts said that many charter school founders have a vision for  the education they want to provide their students but do not always know  how to manage the many tasks involved with administering a school. To  address this issue, the District chartering authorities provide some  assistance with the application and other technical assistance to school  founders during the chartering process. However, this support is often  limited to assisting charter school groups with the application process and  does not always include support once the application has been approved.  For this reason, many charter schools turn to private and nonprofit  resources to assist them with these issues.", "The nonprofit D.C. Charter School Resource Center offered assistance to  charter school groups until it closed in the spring of 2003.

In addition, recent steps taken to identify surplus  property and underutilized school buildings have potential for making  additional space available to charter schools.
