In accordance with the law establishing TSP, DOL conducts regular audits to determine the level of compliance with laws and regulations as well as to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Congress requires FRTIB to submit its annual budget and other reports, and to undergo an independent financial audit. However, Congress has not held regular FRTIB oversight hearings. Also, DOL does not submit its audit reports directly to Congress, and has not yet been provided with a mechanism to communicate issues of critical concern to Congress. FRTIB's fiduciary duties are similar to those of fiduciaries of private sector plans. To act prudently and solely in the interest of plan participants, FRTIB has implemented policies and practices in several of the areas mentioned in DOL's guidance for private sector plans. However, unlike the law governing private plans, the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA)--the law that governs the administration of TSP--contains special liability protections for Board members and the Executive Director. FRTIB has less discretion than private sector plan sponsors in setting investment policy because the investment options available to TSP participants are largely outlined in law, whereas private sector plan sponsors are responsible for choosing which investment options to offer participants. TSP's authorizing statute specifies the number and types of funds available to participants, and requires that some of these funds track indexes, which are broad, diversified market indicators. FRTIB chooses the particular indexes for the funds to track, reviews the investment options, and suggests additional funds. Changing TSP investment options requires legislation. FRTIB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are responsible for educating participants about TSP and general retirement issues, while the private and state and local government employee plan sponsors that we interviewed are governed by different rules. By statute, FRTIB is charged with developing educational materials for participants about TSP-specific issues. FRTIB also assists OPM, which is required to provide general retirement education to federal employees and train retirement counselors at federal agencies to provide information to federal employees. Private plan sponsors as well as the state and local government employee plan sponsors that we spoke with are responsible for educating participants about their plans, but often supply general retirement information as well. As the size and complexity of TSP have grown, an appropriate level of oversight of FRTIB is critical to ensuring that federal workers' retirement savings are properly managed. GAO previously recommended that Congress consider amending FERSA to require DOL to establish a formal process by which the Secretary of Labor can report to Congress issues of critical concern about actions of the Executive Director and Board members."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As of February 2007, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a retirement savings  and investment plan for federal workers, held approximately $210 billion  in retirement assets for 3.7 million current and former federal employees.  Similar to private sector 401(k) plans, TSP allows employees to save for  retirement by diverting a portion of their pretax income into investment  accounts that can grow tax-free until withdrawn in retirement. In April  2006, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held  hearings on TSP issues, resulting in concerns being raised about the  adequacy of the current oversight structure of TSP. The Federal  Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is responsible for day-to-day  operations of TSP, and the Department of Labor (DOL) has some oversight  responsibilities, primarily through conducting audits of TSP\u2019s operations.  Subsequently, you asked us to examine (1) the current structure for  overseeing FRTIB, (2) how the statutorily defined fiduciary  responsibilities of FRTIB compare to the responsibilities of private plan  sponsors and how FRTIB fulfills its responsibilities, (3) how FRTIB\u2019s  investment policies differ from those of private plan sponsors, and (4)  FRTIB\u2019s statutory responsibilities to educate plan participants about TSP  and other retirement issues and how these responsibilities compare with  those of private and state and local government employee plan sponsors.", "To address our objectives, we analyzed provisions of the Federal  Employees\u2019 Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), which governs the  administration of TSP, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act  of 1974 (ERISA), which governs the administration of pension plans in the  private sector. To examine the current structure for overseeing FRTIB, as  well as our other objectives, we interviewed DOL officials, and analyzed  various documents from both DOL and FRTIB, including DOL regulations,  audit manuals, and reports. Additionally, to determine how FRTIB\u2019s  statutorily defined fiduciary responsibilities compare to the  responsibilities of private plan sponsors, and how FRTIB fulfills its  responsibilities, as well as what FRTIB\u2019s investment policies are and how  its policies differ from those of private plan sponsors, we interviewed  representatives of industry associations and reviewed related documents,  including FRTIB memos, policies, Board meeting minutes, and  correspondences, and DOL\u2019s guidance to private plan sponsors. To  determine FRTIB\u2019s responsibilities for educating plan participants about  TSP and other retirement issues, we examined information from TSP\u2019s  Web site, spoke with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) officials, and  reviewed FRTIB documents. To compare FRTIB\u2019s education  responsibilities with those of other plan sponsors, we interviewed  representatives of industry associations, and officials representing  sponsors of five defined contribution plans\u2014four state and local  government employee pension plans and one private plan. We selected  plan sponsors based on plan assets, plan type, and absence of fiduciary  malfeasance. Appendix I describes the selection of plan sponsors in  greater detail. We also reviewed a 2005 industry survey to obtain  additional information about how private plan sponsors educate their  participants. We conducted our work between August 2006 and June 2007  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) created  TSP to provide options for retirement planning and encourage personal  retirement savings among the federal workforce. Most federal workers are  allowed to participate in TSP, which is available to federal and postal  employees, including members of Congress and congressional employees  and members of the uniformed services, and members of the judicial  branch.", "As of February 2007, TSP held approximately $210 billion in retirement  assets for 3.7 million current and former federal employees and their  families. Participants may allocate their contributions and any associated  earnings among five investment fund options: the G Fund, F Fund, C Fund,  S Fund, and I Fund. Since August 2005, TSP participants also may choose  one of five Lifecycle funds, which diversify participant accounts among  the G, F, C, S, and I Funds, using investment mixes that are tailored to  different time horizons for retirement and withdrawal. The investment mix  of each Lifecycle fund adjusts quarterly to more conservative investments  as the participant nears retirement.", "Pension plans are classified either as defined benefit or as defined  contribution plans. Defined benefit plans promise to provide, generally, a  fixed level of monthly retirement income that is based on salary, years of  service, and age at retirement regardless of how the plan\u2019s investments  perform. In contrast, benefits from defined contribution plans are based  on the contributions to and the performance of the investments in  individual accounts, which may fluctuate in value. Examples of defined  contribution plans include 401(k) plans, employee stock ownership  plans, and profit-sharing plans.", "As with other defined contribution plans, TSP is structured to allow  eligible federal employees to contribute a fixed percentage of their annual  base pay or a flat amount, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits, into  an individual tax-deferred account. Additionally, FERS participants are  eligible for automatic 1 percent contributions and limited matching  contributions from the employing federal agency. According to FRTIB,  TSP provides federal (and in most cases, state) income tax deferral on  contributions and their related earnings, similar to those offered by many  private sector 401(k)-type pension plans. Participants can manage their  accounts and conduct a variety of transactions similar to those available to  401(k) participants, such as reallocating contributions, borrowing from the  account, making withdrawals, or purchasing annuities.", "Administration of TSP falls under the purview of the Federal Retirement  Thrift Investment Board, an agency established by Congress under FERSA.  FRTIB is composed of five Board members appointed by the President,  with the advice and consent of the Senate. They are authorized to appoint  the Executive Director, who hires additional personnel, and an Employee  Thrift Advisory Council. The Employee Thrift Advisory Council is a 15- member council that provides advice to the Board and the Executive  Director on the investment policies and administration of the TSP. The  Board is responsible for establishing policies for the investment and  management of the TSP, as well as administration of the plan. The  Executive Director and staff of FRTIB are responsible for implementing  the Board\u2019s policies and managing the day-to-day operations of TSP,  prescribing regulations to administer FERSA, and other duties.

As we have previously reported, DOL is charged with conducting  regular compliance audits to determine if the Board is fulfilling its  fiduciary duties and properly safeguarding TSP participants\u2019 assets.  Congress created FRTIB and has the ability to change the structure for  overseeing FRTIB. As with every federal agency, Congress may exercise  oversight of FRTIB. Currently, Congress requires FRTIB to submit its  budget and other reports regularly, but it has not typically held hearings  unless a challenge has arisen or there has been a proposed change to  legislation. In addition, DOL officials do not have in place a specific  mechanism for sharing their audit program findings or other issues of  concern with Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOL Oversees FRTIB through Regular Audits", "paragraphs": ["DOL\u2019s oversight of FRTIB is based on a FERSA requirement that the  Secretary of Labor establish an audit program and conduct audits of  FRTIB and its operations. DOL compliance audits are designed to  determine whether FRTIB is complying with FERSA and applicable laws  and regulations. This includes whether TSP fiduciaries are acquiring,  protecting, and using plan resources prudently, efficiently, and solely in  the interest of participants and beneficiaries. The DOL Employee Benefits  Security Administration\u2019s (EBSA) Office of the Chief Accountant has  administered the audit program since its inception in fiscal year 1988.  According to DOL officials, DOL\u2019s audit program reviews all significant  activities of FRTIB, including FRTIB\u2019s policy formulation and  administration, record keeping, and other functions handled by service  providers under contract, and functions of federal agencies related to  contributions and employee participation programs. The audits include on- site reviews of TSP\u2019s principal service providers. Because service  providers carry out many day-to-day operations of TSP, from record  keeping to investment management, audits are primarily conducted on  TSP\u2019s service providers. DOL officials have developed an audit manual  that includes detailed audit guides, but a firm carries out the audits under  contract with DOL. DOL officials said that their ongoing audit presence for  TSP is greater than its presence for most of the private plans it oversees,  which numbered about 730,000 in 2002.", "According to DOL, each year, DOL develops a strategic plan that identifies  how many and which functions it could audit based on risk and funding.  For example, due to FRTIB\u2019s increased use of private contractors to  provide call center and other plan services formerly provided by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Finance Center, two of DOL\u2019s five  audits in fiscal year 2006 looked at particular operations of newer  providers, including certain internal controls. DOL officials also said that  the number of audits in a given year is based on the level of funding  allocated to the audit program. Fiscal year 2006 funding for the contract  audits was $630,000 and covered five audits.", "DOL exercises its authority over FRTIB by making recommendations for  improving operations based on audit findings. DOL officials and the  contract auditor meet with the Board members at least once a year to  highlight significant issues from audits and to present the department\u2019s  future compliance audit schedule. DOL\u2019s recommendations to FRTIB and  its service providers generally address compliance with FERSA and FRTIB  policies, significant weaknesses in internal controls, or areas where FRTIB  could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. For  example, during its fiscal year 2005 audit cycle, DOL\u2019s contractor audited  one of FRTIB\u2019s customer call centers, which is operated by a contractor.  The audit report included recommendations for FRTIB to implement and  enforce policies for information security, designated as a fundamental  internal control by DOL, at the contractor\u2019s sites; establish additional  performance measures; and implement consistent monitoring of call  volume at the two call centers. As of September 2006, DOL considered the  first recommendation partially implemented and the other two  recommendations implemented. DOL cannot compel FRTIB or its service  providers to implement its audit recommendations. However, FRTIB  generally had implemented a high percentage of DOL\u2019s audit  recommendations. According to DOL and FRTIB officials, this voluntary  implementation of audit recommendations has worked well for them  because DOL and FRTIB have a longstanding and positive working  relationship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress\u2019 Oversight of FRTIB Has Not Involved Regular Hearings", "paragraphs": ["Congress has not required FRTIB or DOL to testify regularly before  Congress on TSP operations, although it does receive routine reports from  FRTIB. As with other federal agencies, Congress may exercise oversight of  FRTIB by investigating agency operations, holding hearings, issuing  subpoenas, and requiring the agency to submit performance or financial  reports. Congressional committees have typically held hearings on TSP  when a challenge has arisen or when there was a proposed change to  legislation. For example, FRTIB officials were asked to testify in response  to customer service issues with TSP in 2003 and in response to abusive  trading practices in the private sector in 2004. In the 20 years since TSP  has been in existence, FRTIB estimates it has been called to testify  approximately a dozen times. Most recently, Board members and the  Executive Director provided testimony in 2005 and 2006 about adding a  new fund to TSP\u2019s investment options. According to DOL officials,  Congress does not require DOL to meet with committee staff or testify  about TSP or its audit findings on a regular basis.

The 2006 summary contained little information about audit  recommendations. DOL is not required to submit its audit reports directly  to Congress, and Congress has not asked DOL to share its audit findings  on a regular basis through hearings or meetings with committee staff.  Consequently, Congress may be unaware of concerns DOL may have. In a  2003 report, we noted that there have been times when DOL has had issues  of concern with FRTIB outside of its audit findings.

In addition, FERSA and ERISA  specifically prohibit fiduciaries from engaging in certain transactions that  that could raise questions about their ability to fulfill their duties, unless  certain safeguards are met or waivers are granted by DOL. For TSP, the  statute specifically lists Board members, the Executive Director, and any  person who has or exercises discretionary authority or control over the  management or disposition of TSP assets as fiduciaries.", "FRTIB has adopted a range of policies and practices that are similar to  those that private plans should follow to carry out these broad duties. DOL  has issued guidance for private plans describing important policies and  practices to fulfill fiduciary responsibilities. While the guidance is not  specifically designed for TSP, FRTIB has implemented policies and  practices for several of the areas in DOL\u2019s guidance. For example, FRTIB  has policies and practices for selecting and monitoring service providers,  as well as measuring investment performance. Because private service  providers perform many of TSP\u2019s operations, including record keeping for  participant accounts and investment management of all funds but one,  these areas are important for acting prudently and solely in the interest of  participants and beneficiaries. Specifically:    FRTIB generally uses a competitive process in order to select qualified  service providers at a reasonable cost. According to FRTIB, contracts  for major activities undergo review and competition at least every 5  years. While we did not review its procurement documentation, DOL  reviews the selection and monitoring of service providers as part of its  compliance audit program.", "FRTIB noted that it uses several approaches to monitor service  providers. FRTIB has included performance measures in certain  service providers\u2019 contracts. Also, since 2004, FRTIB has reviewed  quarterly financial reports for most of its major private providers,  including financial statements, credit scores, and overall viability.  FRTIB further noted that it monitors providers through daily contact  with them, periodic on-site visits, and reports from the provider, such  as monthly and annual reports from the annuity vendor.", "FRTIB also reviews its performance measures monthly, including the  investment performance of each fund. The company providing  investment management services must provide monthly reports to  FRTIB showing how closely each option is tracking its underlying  index. A measure of the difference between the performance of the  TSP fund and the underlying index is known as the \u201ctracking error,\u201d  and by contract, the investment manager must report the amount and  reasons for the error. Because the investment manager is allocated  fiduciary responsibility by contract, given the manager\u2019s control of plan  assets, this measurement of performance is essential for both FRTIB  and the investment manager to act prudently and ensure that the  investment manager is not trading needlessly or for self-gain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Can Take Civil Action against Private Plan Fiduciaries but Cannot Do So against TSP Board Members and the Executive Director", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Labor can take civil action against private plan  fiduciaries. Under ERISA, DOL is allowed to seek remedies if fiduciaries of  private plans do not fulfill their fiduciary duties, including using litigation  when necessary. According to DOL, its primary goal in litigating a case is  to ensure that a plan\u2019s assets, and therefore its participants and  beneficiaries, are protected. For example, DOL has brought legal actions  or filed briefs against private plan fiduciaries for investing imprudently in  company stock, not investing exclusively for participants\u2019 benefit, and  failing to monitor appointed fiduciaries.", "DOL cannot bring civil actions against Board members or the Executive  Director for breaching their plan duties or engaging in prohibited  transactions. FERSA allows DOL to bring civil actions against any  fiduciary, such as the investment manager, other than a Board member or  the Executive Director. While DOL was initially authorized under FERSA  to bring civil actions against any TSP fiduciary, a 1988 amendment  established an exception from such actions for Board members and the  Executive Director. The 1988 amendment was passed, in part, in  response to FRTIB\u2019s concerns about obtaining fiduciary insurance.  According to the then-Executive Director, it would be difficult to buy  adequate insurance for these TSP fiduciaries, as FRTIB officials expected  TSP to become the largest plan of its kind in the country. Congress took  this action in the face of concerns that, without protection, Board  members would resign and that they would be hard to replace.", "With regard to plan participants\u2019 recourse, participants can take civil  action against private plan fiduciaries and all FRTIB fiduciaries, including  Board members and the Executive Director. Under ERISA, available  remedies include awards for plan losses through monetary damages and  restoring any profits made from a fiduciary\u2019s improper use of plan assets.  Fiduciaries of private plans may guard against the legal risks of personal  liability by having fiduciary liability insurance, which the fiduciary, the  plan, or the employer may purchase. Fiduciary liability insurance  provides reimbursement for costs related to legal actions for breach of  their fiduciary responsibilities, including the costs of defending and  settling actions or awards of monetary damages. DOL officials said that  although fiduciaries of private pension plans may have insurance to largely  insulate them from the personal risks associated with their personal  liability as fiduciaries, they still face financial risks in certain  circumstances due to policy limits or exclusions. For example, fiduciary  liability insurance often includes coverage exceptions for intentional  harm, criminal acts, or self-dealing.", "Similarly, under FERSA, TSP participants or beneficiaries may bring civil  actions against Board members or the Executive Director, as well as other  TSP fiduciaries, for breaching their plan duties or engaging in prohibited  transactions. The 1988 amendment provided that any such claims against a  Board member or the Executive Director will be defended by the Attorney  General of the United States and, if he certifies that the Board member or  Executive Director was acting as a TSP fiduciary, deemed claims under  the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). As a result, rather than any  monetary relief awarded in such cases being paid personally by any Board  member or Executive Director who may commit a breach (or through  applicable fiduciary liability insurance), it would be paid out of the  Judgment Fund established to pay claims under the FTCA. According to  DOL officials, treating claims against a Board member or the Executive  Director in this way provides TSP participants with a greater ability to  obtain monetary relief than that available to participants in other pension  plans. In addition, DOL officials told us that without the special liability  protections, DOL could be in the unusual position of suing FRTIB\u2014 another federal entity\u2014and receiving assistance with prosecutions from  the Department of Justice, which is also responsible for defending Board  members or the Executive Director.", "TSP has been relatively free from any allegations that TSP fiduciaries have  breached their fiduciary duties or engaged in prohibited transactions.

FRTIB\u2019s process for reviewing and  suggesting additional funds has included investment analysis,  consideration of industry practices, and communication with Congress  and the Employee Thrift Advisory Council, which represents participants.  For example, in the early 1990s, FRTIB analyzed possible funds to add to  the lineup of options for participants to invest in, based on factors like  diversification, risk and return, cost, and administrative issues. It  submitted a legislative proposal in 1995 to add funds for international  stocks (the I Fund) and for stocks in small and medium-sized U.S.  companies (the S Fund), and Congress amended FERSA in 1996  accordingly. In 2005, FRTIB introduced Lifecycle funds without an  amendment to FERSA because it determined that the Lifecycle funds are  combinations of the five existing funds tailored to different time horizons  for withdrawal. FRTIB developed these funds partly based on its analysis  of inefficient participant behavior whereby participants were not  periodically shifting, or rebalancing, their investment portfolio or  diversifying their balances among the five funds, which the Lifecycle funds  would do automatically for the participant. In 2005, given congressional  interest in having FRTIB study the desirability of adding new funds, FRTIB  hired an outside consultant to analyze the existing TSP options, who  recommended in 2006 that FRTIB not add any additional funds to the plan.

Retirement counselors\u2019 roles were expanded with passage of the Thrift  Savings Plan Open Elections Act of 2004. To implement the act, OPM\u2019s  training will include information about retirement financial literacy and  education. According to information provided by OPM, it will provide  comprehensive training on the tools and resources it is developing, such  as the retirement readiness index, an age-based profile containing  information about an employee\u2019s state of readiness according to various  dimensions. As of April 2007, OPM had produced and made available on its  Web site a retirement video. According to OPM, the video provides an  overview of critical information federal employees need to know as they  plan for their retirement. OPM is required to consult with FRTIB about its  implementation of the act. In addition to retirement counselors, federal  agencies have TSP agency coordinators that, among other things, inform  eligible employees of TSP options and benefits, maintain TSP  informational materials, and respond to inquiries from active employees.  TSP officials offer training to agency coordinators.

ERISA requires sponsors of private retirement plans to make  available to participants the following:    an annual report, which is a summary of an annual financial report that  most plans must file with the Department of Labor;    a summary plan description, which provides information about what  the plan provides and how it operates, such as when an employee can  begin to participate, how service and benefits are calculated, when  benefits become vested, when and in what form benefits are paid, and  how to file a claim for benefits; and    account statements one or more times per year or upon request.", "A 2005 industry survey found that many private plan sponsors provide  additional educational information, not required under ERISA, for such  purposes as increasing employee participation, increasing satisfaction  with their plans, and improving asset allocation. They provide this  information through enrollment kits, seminars and workshops, fund  performance sheets, newsletters, retirement calculators, and Internet and  intranet sites. For example, the private plan sponsor we spoke with  provides one-on-one financial and investment counseling to its employees  through a service provider. Additionally, almost half of the plans that  responded to the industry survey indicated that they offer participants  investment advice.", "State and local government employee pension plan sponsors are required  to educate their participants in a manner consistent with the state or local  requirements and plan documents that govern their plans. Each of the four  plans we studied require that a statement be sent to participants  periodically or at the participant\u2019s request. At least two of the plan  sponsors provide participants with summary plan descriptions, and at  least one plan sponsor requires that participants be sent an annual report.  Local and state officials expressed the importance of providing plan  participants with information on a broad range of services and topics, for  example, how to make contributions and the array of investment options.  Each plan sponsor provides some information on its Web site; such  information may include answers to frequently asked questions, forms,  and information about investment options and retirement planning  conferences. All of the officials we spoke with provide some type of  general retirement information or non-plan-specific information to  participants, such as retirement calculators.

Although FRTIB is required  by law to provide Congress each year with a list of audits, including  summaries of significant DOL audit findings, there have been times when  DOL has had issues of concern with FRTIB outside of its audit findings.    In such instances, DOL has no formal process to communicate its issues of  dispute.  Consequently, we previously recommended that Congress amend  FERSA to require DOL to establish a formal process by which it can report  to Congress issues of critical concern.", "Historically, communications between congressional committees of  jurisdiction with FRTIB and DOL have been limited. Although Congress  has occasionally held hearings where DOL and FRTIB officials have  testified, such hearings are held irregularly, usually in response to a  particular issue, such as abusive trading practices or when Congress was  considering legislative changes to FERSA, such as adding an additional  fund to TSP\u2019s investment options.", "Congress created TSP as one of the basic elements of a new retirement  system for federal workers. Since its inception, TSP has grown to become  one of the largest defined contribution plans in the country, affecting the  retirement of millions of current and former federal employees.

The plans we studied were selected from a list of the 200  largest U.S. employee retirement plans as reported by Pensions &  Investments, a trade journal for plan sponsors and other investors, as of  September 30, 2005. Plans were selected based on three criteria\u2014plan  assets, plan type, and absence of fiduciary malfeasance. TSP is the largest  defined contribution plan in the nation. The plans we studied, while having  significantly fewer assets than TSP, were among the largest in total  defined contribution plan assets. The five plans had assets ranging from  approximately $3 billion to $21 billion. The plans we studied, like TSP, are  participant directed, that is, investors make investment decisions and plan  fiduciaries may receive limited liability from the results of these decisions.  Additionally, we reviewed Pension & Investments Online and LexisNexis,  and could find no citations over the last 2 years for fiduciary malfeasance  for the five plans we studied.", "The four government employee pension plans we studied are a state  supplemental 401(k) plan, a state 401(k) plan for all newly hired  employees, a university plan that includes a 401(a) plan and a tax deferred  403(b) plan, and a large city supplemental deferred compensation plan  with a 401(k) plan.
