To address objectives two and three above, our review extended beyond contract amounts paid with MMA funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS expended over 90 percent of the MMA appropriation by the end of December 2006. The majority, about $735 million, was paid to contractors and vendors for a variety of services. For example, because the volume of calls to the 1-800-MEDICARE help line significantly increased with the new outpatient prescription drug benefit, two contractors were paid about $234 million to support the help line. CMS also made payments to other federal agencies for services such as printing and mailing; to state agencies to fund educating the public; for CMS employee payroll and travel costs; and for purchase card transactions to acquire office supplies, equipment, and outreach materials. CMS management has not allocated sufficient resources, both staff and funding, to keep pace with recent increases in contract awards and adequately perform contract and contractor oversight. This operating environment created vulnerabilities in the contracting process. Specifically, CMS did not adequately fulfill critical contractor oversight, such as working with contractors to establish indirect cost rates. Further, certain contracting practices, such as the frequent use of cost reimbursement contracts, increased risks to CMS. After contract award, pervasive internal control deficiencies increased the risk of improper payments. Because CMS did not have clear invoice review guidance, invoice review procedures were often flawed or did not take place. CMS also had not taken steps to ensure contracts were closed within required deadlines and had a backlog of approximately 1,300 contracts as of September 30, 2007. GAO identified numerous questionable payments totaling nearly $90 million. These payments were for costs not compliant with contract terms, which could be potentially improper; costs for which we could not obtain adequate support to determine whether the costs were allowable; and potential waste caused by risks in CMS's contracting practices. Importantly, in some cases, because we were not able to determine whether or to what extent the costs were allowable, some of the questioned amounts may relate to allowable costs that are not recoverable.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS) is the agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and Part D benefit.  CMS relies extensively on contractors to carry out its basic mission. For  example, the contractors that process and administer medical claims have  played a critical role in serving both Medicare beneficiaries and health  care providers. During fiscal year 2006, CMS awarded contracts valued at  $3.8 billion.", "Congress appropriated to CMS $1 billion for start-up administrative costs  to implement MMA provisions.

HHS\u2019 FAR supplement, the Health and Human Services  Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR), contains additional requirements not  found in the FAR, such as disallowing payments to contractors for  independent research and development costs. The purpose of CAS is to  help achieve uniformity and consistency in contractors\u2019 cost accounting  practices and provide rules for estimating, accumulating, and reporting  costs under government contracts and subcontracts. For example, CAS  requires certain contractors to prepare a disclosure statement that  describes their accounting practices and requires that similar costs be  treated in the same manner. Contractor compliance with CAS is monitored  by a contractor\u2019s cognizant federal agency.", "The cognizant federal agency is usually the agency with the largest dollar  amount of negotiated contracts, including options, with the contractor. To  help ensure continuity and ease of administration, FAR recommends that  once an agency assumes cognizant federal agency responsibilities for a  contractor, it generally retains cognizant status for at least 5 years. If, at  the end of the 5-year period, another agency has the largest dollar amount  of negotiated contracts including options, the two agencies coordinate and  determine which one will assume the responsibilities. In addition to  monitoring CAS compliance, the cognizant federal agency is responsible  for determining if the contractor\u2019s billing and accounting systems are  adequate to record and bill costs in accordance with FAR. The cognizant  federal agency also establishes provisional indirect cost rates based on an  audit of information provided by the contractors that contractors use to  estimate indirect costs on their invoices. The cognizant federal agency also  establishes final indirect cost rates based on an audit of actual costs of the  contractor during the year. The final indirect cost rates are used to adjust  contractor billings (based on provisional indirect cost rates) for actual  costs and may result in an additional cost or savings to the government.  The final indirect cost rates established by the cognizant federal agency  are utilized by agencies dealing with the contractor. Because other  agencies rely on this cost information and oversight, it is particularly  important that the cognizant federal agency fulfills its responsibilities.", "MMA significantly changed Medicare law covering CMS\u2019s contracting for  Medicare claims administration services. CMS refers to these changes,  which are intended to improve service to beneficiaries and health care  providers, as Medicare contracting reform. The implementation of  contracting reform, which CMS is required to complete by October 2011,  will fundamentally change Medicare claims administration contracting  practices. Specifically, MMA requires CMS to use competitive procedures  to select Medicare Administrative Contractors (formerly referred to as  claims administration contractors) and to follow FAR except where  specific MMA provisions differ. Prior to MMA, CMS was generally exempt  from these requirements for its claims administration contractors.  According to data provided by CMS\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Grants  Management (OAGM), during fiscal year 2006 CMS awarded contracts  valued at about $3.8 billion. Of that amount, about half represented  Medicare claims administration contracts that were not previously subject  to FAR.

Prior to award, an agency identifies a need; develops a  requirements package; determines the method of contracting; solicits and  evaluates bids or proposals; and ultimately awards a contract. After  contract award, the agency performs contract administration and contract  closeout. Contract administration involves the agency monitoring the  contractor\u2019s progress and processing payments to the contractor. The  contract closeout process involves verification that the goods or services  were provided and that administrative matters are completed. Also during  contract closeout, a contract audit of costs billed to the government may  be performed and the agency processes the final invoice with an  adjustment for any over- or underpayments.", "Agencies may choose among different contract types to acquire goods and  services. This choice is the principal means that agencies have for  allocating risk between the government and the contractor. Contract types  can be grouped into three broad categories: fixed price contracts, cost  reimbursement contracts, and time and materials (T&M) contracts. As  discussed below, these three types of contracts place different levels of  risk on the government, which the government generally manages through  oversight.", "For fixed price contracts, the government agrees to pay a set price for  goods or services regardless of the actual cost to the contractor. A  fixed price contract is ordinarily in the government\u2019s interest when a  sound basis for pricing exists as the contractor assumes the risk for  cost overruns.", "Under cost reimbursement contracts, the government agrees to pay  those costs of the contractor that are allowable, reasonable, and  allocable to the contract. The government assumes most of the cost  risk because the contractor is only required to provide its best effort to  meet contract objectives within the estimated cost. If this cannot be  done, the government would provide additional funds to complete the  effort, fail to provide additional funds, or terminate the contract. The  FAR requires agencies to mitigate risks through adequate government  surveillance (oversight) during the performance of the contract. In  addition, the contractor must have adequate accounting systems to  record and bill costs.", "For T&M contracts, the government agrees to pay fixed per-hour labor  rates and to reimburse other costs directly related to the contract, such  as materials, equipment, or travel, based on cost. Like cost  reimbursement contracts, the government assumes the cost risk  because the contractor is only required to make a good faith effort to  meet the government\u2019s needs within a ceiling price.

CMS also used MMA funds to modify its contract with Computer  Sciences Corporation for the redesign of the beneficiary enrollment  and payment system so that the system could also handle prescription  drug beneficiaries. CMS also contracted with Iowa Foundation for  Medical Care (IFMC) to develop a system to facilitate studies of  chronic condition care, as specifically required by MMA.    1-800-MEDICARE help line: CMS paid $234.4 million for the  operation of the 1-800-MEDICARE help line, a CMS-administered help  line used to answer beneficiaries\u2019 questions about Medicare eligibility,  enrollment, and benefits. Because the help line\u2019s call volume  significantly increased with the anticipation of the new prescription  drug benefit, CMS used MMA funds to expand help line operations  and fund a portion of help line costs.

According to  CMS, noncompetitive procedures were used on the contracts in our review  because (1) there was an unusual or compelling urgency for the work, (2),  the award was made under the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a)  criteria, or (3) the contracted activities were considered to be a logical  follow-on to prior work. While these are permissible reasons to limit  competition, in the examples of the noncompetitive contracts described  below, CMS\u2019s contracting practices may not have sufficiently protected the  government\u2019s interest in obtaining the best value, in terms of fair and  reasonable prices.", "The FAR allows for noncompetitive procedures when there is an  unusual and compelling urgency that the government would be  seriously injured unless competition is limited. When this exemption is  used, an agency prepares a written justification and requests offers  from as many potential sources as is practicable. Prior to a  noncompetitive award to Maximus ultimately valued at about $6.5  million, the HHS Office of General Counsel reviewed CMS\u2019s  justification for other than full and open competition and had concerns  with the legal sufficiency of the justification. The Office found that  CMS did not demonstrate how it had met the FAR requirement to  obtain offers from as many sources as possible or how the agency  would be seriously injured if the exemption is not used. Additionally,  according to the Office of General Counsel, the urgent and compelling  justification did not support procurements in excess of a \u201cminimum  amount of time,\u201d and suggested limiting the contract to a 5-month term  and recompeting the contract during that time. Despite the advice of  the Office of General Counsel, 2 days later CMS awarded the contract  to Maximus for a 9-month period, never recompeted the contract, and  eventually extended the period of performance another 17 months for a  total of 26 months.", "For multiple awards to Z-Tech, CMS justified the sole-source  noncompetitive awards using SBA\u2019s 8(a) exceptions to competition  subject to contract value thresholds. To use these exceptions, generally  an agency obtains a written authorization from SBA, which places a  limit on the dollar value of the contract. For one Z-Tech contract, CMS  obtained authorization to award a contract for an amount up to $3.6  million. SBA also indicated that no other increases would be authorized  under this contract and that further increases should be competed  under a new contract. Nevertheless, CMS exceeded the SBA-authorized  amounts and made awards to Z-Tech totaling about $4.4 million.  Further, we found an agency internal document in a contract file that  expressed concern that contract awards to Z-Tech may have been  divided to avoid the dollar threshold that would require competition for  8(a) procurements.", "The FAR allows for limiting competition on the issuance of task orders  under multiple award contracts if doing so is in the interest of economy  and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an earlier task order that  had been subject to competition. However, the frequent use of the logical  follow-on exemption to competition may hinder an agency\u2019s ability to  obtain the best value for the taxpayer. About 24 percent of the contracts  and task orders in our review, with a total value of nearly $390 million,  were issued with no competition as a logical follow-on to a prior task  order. Two of these logical follow-on task orders had total values of $234.6  million and $67.8 million.", "One role of the contracting officer is to select the contract type that is in  the best interest of the government, places reasonable risk on the  contractor, and provides the contractor with the greatest incentive for  efficient and economical performance. Cost reimbursement contracts are  suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance  do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any  type of fixed-price contract. We found that about 78 percent of the  contracts we reviewed were cost reimbursement contracts. These cost  reimbursement contracts had a total contract value of $1.2 billion. Some  CMS officials told us that CMS was a \u201ccost-type shop,\u201d meaning that at  CMS they prefer cost reimbursement contracts. When cost reimbursement  contracts are utilized, FAR requires additional procedures to mitigate the  increased risk such as adequate government surveillance. However, as  discussed later in this report, CMS did not implement sufficient oversight  required for cost reimbursement contracts. In addition, before awarding a  cost reimbursement contract, the contracting officer is required by FAR to  verify that the contractor has an adequate accounting system for  determining costs applicable to the contract, which helps provide the  government assurance that the contractor has systems in place to  accurately and consistently record and bill costs in accordance with FAR.", "During our review of CMS\u2019s contract files, we found that contracting  officers did not always proactively ensure the adequacy of contractors\u2019  accounting systems prior to award of the cost reimbursement contracts.", "We also noted instances when CMS knowingly awarded cost  reimbursement contracts to a contractor with a deficient accounting  system, contrary to the FAR requirement. Specifically, the CMS cost/price  team noted numerous significant deficiencies in how Palmetto accounted  for costs and determined that Palmetto\u2019s accounting system could not  adequately account for its direct labor and indirect costs. The cost/price  team notified the contracting specialist of the accounting system  deficiencies and also stated that \u201ccorrections to  system  cannot be completed by the time this contract is awarded.\u201d Despite this  determination by the cost/price team, the contracting officer awarded two  cost reimbursement contracts included in our review to Palmetto with a  total contract value of $157.3 million. Further, the contracting officer  awarded a third contract valued at $3.3 million to Palmetto without  verifying whether or not Palmetto\u2019s accounting system deficiencies were  resolved.", "CMS also encouraged a contractor to use a cost reimbursement contract,  even though the cost/price team raised concerns regarding the  contractor\u2019s proposal of certain costs as direct costs and the contractor\u2019s  ability to accumulate and record direct and indirect costs. Despite these  concerns, CMS did not inquire with DCAA about whether or not an  accounting system audit had been performed until after the contract was  awarded. CMS eventually requested an accounting system audit about a  year and a half after contract award. Further, the contractor expressed  concerns regarding the cost reimbursement contract type requested by  CMS because it did not have prior experience with the contract type. CMS  documented in the contract file that \u201cafter much deliberation, the  contractor realized it was in  best interest to accept a [cost  reimbursement] contract.\u201d In some instances, contractors\u2019 inadequate  accounting systems inhibited our ability to audit costs billed to the  government because the contractors were unable to substantiate the costs  billed.", "While it is not inappropriate for a prime contractor to use subcontractors  to achieve the contract\u2019s objectives, CMS\u2019s approval of some  subcontractor agreements may have increased the cost to obtain the  services through additional indirect costs and fees. For the contracts we  reviewed, several of the prime contractors subcontracted for significant  volumes of work. For example, on one task order between February 2004  and February 2005, Ketchum billed about $34.7 million of which about  $33.8 million, or 97 percent, was for subcontractor costs. Furthermore,  about $32.3 million of these costs were related to a single subcontractor.  During this same period Ketchum billed only $59,509 for direct labor  (which would include Ketchum\u2019s oversight of the subcontractors) yet  received about $694,000 in fees, or over 10 times more than the direct  labor Ketchum provided under the contract.", "The contracts for the operation of the 1-800-MEDICARE help line are  another example of cost increases caused by subcontractor agreements.  CMS hired two contractors to operate the help line\u2014Pearson and  Palmetto. While each contractor had its own contract with CMS that  required them to provide similar services, Pearson and Palmetto  subsequently subcontracted with each other, again for the same services.  Consequently, the costs to operate the help line were increased through  additional indirect costs and fees. Specifically, CMS paid Palmetto an  additional $3.6 million (for indirect costs and fees applied to the Pearson  services included with Palmetto\u2019s invoices) that may not have been paid  absent the subcontract agreement, such as if Pearson provided the  services under its own prime contract.

As a  result, CMS often did not require contractors to provide adequate detail  in invoices to review billed costs, such as labor charges or travel. For  example, some contractors included only lump sum amounts showing  the number of hours worked and the associated dollar amount for  labor costs but did not provide a list of hours worked by employee or  respective labor rates. Without this information, it was not possible for  CMS to verify whether the amounts billed corresponded to employees  who actually worked on the project. One contractor stated that CMS  requested only lump sum amounts for travel with no detailed  information or travel receipts. Without this information, CMS could not  verify that travel costs were related to the contract or were in  accordance with FAR requirements.", "Insufficient training: CMS did not sufficiently train staff on how to  adequately review invoices, such as identification of risks to the  government based on contract type and how to verify labor rates or  hours worked. As a result, project officers and contracting specialists  were not always aware of their invoice review responsibilities. Some  project officers told us that they had only received training \u201con-the- job.\u201d Further, several staff we interviewed referred to the Project  Officer Handbook as a source for guidance on the project officer\u2019s  responsibilities. We reviewed this handbook and found that it did not  provide any practical guidance on how to review invoices and focused  more on the acquisition process (i.e., developing statements of work  and preparing acquisition planning documents). In addition, two  contracting officers said they attended a 2-hour training sponsored by  CMS\u2019s Office of Financial Management (OFM) and that it was helpful in  providing guidance on how to review invoices. We also reviewed this  training material and found that the training did not sufficiently cover  invoice review procedures. The training materials included one slide  that indicated that it was the project officers\u2019 responsibility to review  invoices, but it did not provide specific examples of invoice review  procedures. An OFM official told us that the training was intended to  provide detailed guidance on budgeting and appropriation procedures  and not invoice review.", "Lack of incentive to review invoices: CMS uses a payment  process\u2014negative certification\u2014whereby OFM paid contractor and  vendor invoices without knowing whether or not such invoices were  reviewed and certified. Negative certification is used, in part, to help  the agency meet Prompt Payment Act requirements. However, this  process is the default for all invoice payments regardless of factors that  may increase risk to the agency, including contract type or prior billing  problems with the contractor. By contrast, DOD allows for contractors  to participate in direct billing, a process similar to negative  certification, only if the contractors meet certain criteria such as  adequate accounting systems, billing rates established based upon  recent reviews, and timely submissions of cost information as required  by FAR. CMS\u2019s negative certification process provides little incentive  for personnel to perform timely reviews of invoices or for reviews to  even take place. In our review of contract files, we found that  certificates of review by the project officer were not always included in  the contract files, and when the certificates were included in the file,  they generally did not include evidence to document the review, such  as tickmarks or notes, and they were not always signed.", "Without sufficient policies and procedures, training, and incentives to  review invoices, we found that key staff often used flawed procedures.  Contracting officers, specialists, and project officers told us they reviewed  invoice costs, such as labor rates for cost reimbursement contracts, based  on amounts proposed by the contractor prior to award. However, this  practice has little value for cost reimbursement contracts because FAR  calls for the payment of actual allowable costs, rather than costs  proposed prior to performance of the contract.", "Contracting specialists and project officers also told us they reviewed  invoices by comparing current invoices to prior months and to burn rates  (the rate at which CMS is expending dollars that are obligated to the  contract). This procedure provides no assurance that the amounts billed  are allowable. Additionally, several project officers told us that they  compared invoices to monthly reports prepared by the contractors. This  procedure has limited value because it does not involve verifying amounts  billed to source documents, such as time sheets, payroll registers, or  vendor invoices. Also, when we reviewed the monthly reports, we noted  that the reports were not always reconcilable to the invoices, which would  hinder the project officer\u2019s ability to use the monthly reports in  determining the validity of the billed amounts. As described later in this  report, we found payments for potentially unallowable costs that could  have been identified had proper invoice review procedures been in place.", "Further, contracting and project officers did not call for additional  oversight procedures when they approved complex subcontractor  arrangements such as when a contractor provides the same services as  both a prime contractor and as a subcontractor to another contractor.  When these types of relationships exist, improper payments or double- billings may go undetected if a contractor bills the same services on both  its prime contract invoices (which are reviewed by the government) and  its subcontract invoices (which are reviewed by the other prime  contractor). Further, some officials indicated that they relied on contract  audits rather than invoice review procedures to catch improper payments.  One contracting officer stated that it was not the contracting officer\u2019s or  specialist\u2019s responsibility to review invoices for fraudulent billings, such as  double-billings, because such billings would only be found during a  closeout audit. While an audit during the closeout process may provide a  detective control to identify improper payments after they were made,  timely invoice review procedures provide the necessary preventive  controls to help ensure that improper payments are not made and would  allow CMS to take corrective actions, if necessary.

The closeout process includes verifying that  administrative matters are completed, adjusting provisional indirect cost  rates for actual final indirect cost rates, performing a contract audit of  costs billed to the government, and making final payments. The  complexity and length of the process can vary with the extent of oversight  performed by the agency and the contract type. The FAR generally calls  for fixed price contracts to be closed within 6 months; contracts requiring  the settlement of indirect costs rates, such as cost reimbursement  contracts, to be closed within 36 months; and all other contracts to be  closed within 20 months.

Several of the  contracts on the backlog list completed contract performance as far back  as 1999. CMS established agency-specific contract closeout policies in  February 2007. One CMS official stated that prior to the closeout policies,  some contracting officials and specialists often passed on contract files to  the closeout staff before compiling all required documentation.

In several instances, ViPS  billed the government $299 or more a night, in one case as high as $799  a night, excluding taxes, for hotel stays in Manhattan. During the  applicable period, the federal hotel per diem limit for Manhattan was at  most $200 a night. Additionally, the contractor billed the government  for business class train travel and amounts that exceeded the meals  and incidentals per diem.

The FAR defines a direct cost as a cost that benefits a  single cost objective (e.g., a contract) and an indirect cost as a cost that  benefits more than one cost objective. Costs such as employees\u2019  fringe benefits, vacation and sick leave, and other headquarters costs  are common indirect costs. IFMC billed vacation and sick leave directly  to contracts that an employee worked on only at the time the leave was  taken. By billing vacation and sick leave as direct costs, IFMC may  have billed more than CMS\u2019s portion of the costs to CMS. For example,  if an employee worked on one contract for 11 months and a new  contract in the twelfth month and also took leave in the twelfth month,  only the contract that the employee worked on in the twelfth month  would bear the entire cost of the leave. Had IFMC included its costs  associated with vacation and sick leave in its indirect cost rates, these  costs would have been proportionally allocated to all of IFMC\u2019s  contracts. Therefore, some of the nearly $20,000 of questionable  payments would likely be offset by an increase in the indirect cost  rates; however, we could not determine what that amount would be. In  total, IFMC billed CMS about $4.3 million for direct labor from June  2005 through January 2006.

To gain an understanding of the type of  information available that Palmetto could provide to support its other  direct costs billed, we asked Palmetto to support the costs billed on  four invoices. In response, Palmetto provided travel vouchers,  subcontractor invoices, and numerous cost center reports and  spreadsheets. The travel vouchers and subcontractor invoices  supported the amounts billed to CMS. The cost center information  represented costs that were directly allocated to the CMS contract.  However, Palmetto did not support how it determined the percentages  it used to allocate the costs to the CMS contract. Further, when we  analyzed the cost center information, we noted several unusual  transactions, including depreciation for office and cafeteria furniture,  computer equipment, and basketball goals; building and lawn  maintenance; and janitorial, security, and recycling services. Because  these costs could reasonably benefit more than one cost objective or  contract, these types of costs are generally included in a contractor\u2019s  indirect cost rates rather than billed directly to a contract. Essentially,  to audit these costs, all of Palmetto\u2019s operations\u2014not just the costs  allocated to the three CMS contracts included in our review\u2014would  need to be audited to determine whether the costs were allowable.  This type of contractor oversight is normally performed by the  cognizant federal agency, which for Palmetto is CMS.", "Because of the uncertainties associated with Palmetto\u2019s other direct  costs (which based on the cost center reports seem to include  significant allocations of indirect costs) we concluded that we were  unable to audit the other direct costs (excluding travel and  subcontractor costs) totaling $6.1 million billed to CMS prior to June  2005 when Palmetto changed its accounting system to be compliant  with CAS.", "In addition, we could not verify the allowability and reasonableness of  $34.5 million of indirect costs billed to CMS on the three Palmetto  contracts covering 2004 through 2006. On a cost reimbursement  contract, indirect costs can be a substantial portion of the total  contract cost. FAR requires that 6 months after the close of a year,  contractors with cost reimbursement contracts must submit a report  of their final costs to their cognizant federal agency. On October 2,  2006, Palmetto submitted to its CMS contracting officer a report of its  2005 final costs. However, CMS may not have realized that Palmetto  submitted this report because, according to a letter from CMS\u2019s  cost/price team to Palmetto dated June 4, 2007, CMS notified Palmetto  that its 2004 and 2005 final cost reports were delinquent according to  FAR. Further, as of October 2007, Palmetto had not provided to CMS  its final cost report for 2006, which is delinquent according to the FAR.  Because Palmetto\u2019s final cost reports for 2004, 2005, and 2006 have not  been audited by CMS its cognizant agency, Palmetto\u2019s final indirect  cost rates have not been established. Further, provisional indirect cost  rates have not been established. Therefore, we did not have support to  verify the allowability and reasonableness of the indirect costs that  were billed. Moreover, as discussed above, it appeared that indirect  costs from Palmetto\u2019s cost centers were directly allocated to the CMS  contract. As a result, there is considerable risk that CMS may have  been billed twice for Palmetto\u2019s indirect costs\u2014once as an allocated  direct cost and again as an indirect cost.", "The issues described above related to Palmetto\u2019s other direct costs and  indirect costs also affected the amounts CMS paid to Pearson for  Palmetto as a subcontractor. As a result, additional payments totaling  $10.2 million were unsupported.", "Because of these numerous concerns described above and lack of  documentation to verify amounts billed, CMS made questionable  payments totaling $50.8 million ($6.1 million, $34.5 million, and $10.2  million), which represents the direct and indirect costs that were not  adequately supported during our review.", "Unsupported contractor costs \u2013 $9.7 million: CMS paid about $9.7  million to TrailBlazer for costs that TrailBlazer did not adequately  support related to a cost reimbursement contract ($4.8 million) and a  portion of its Medicare contract ($4.9 million) paid with MMA funds.  After numerous requests spanning over 7 months, TrailBlazer did not  provide us with adequate documentation supporting the amounts billed  to CMS for these contracts. For the cost reimbursement contract, the  $4.8 million that TrailBlazer did not adequately support included $2.4  million of labor costs, $654,000 of other direct costs, and $1.8 million of  indirect costs. For the labor costs, TrailBlazer told us that only its  parent company could provide transaction information, which was  never provided. Instead, TrailBlazer provided several reports  summarizing labor and other direct costs; however, we could not use  these reports because they did not reconcile to the amounts billed to  CMS and often included only summary level information. For the  indirect costs, generally these costs are supported with provisional or  final indirect cost rates that have been audited by a contractor\u2019s  cognizant federal agency. However, as of October 2007, CMS,  TrailBlazer\u2019s cognizant federal agency, has not ensured that  TrailBlazer\u2019s indirect cost rates were audited. TrailBlazer submitted a  cost report of its indirect costs for 2006 to CMS in June 2007.", "For the $4.9 related to the Medicare contract, TrailBlazer provided a  one-page document that summarized the total amount by types of  costs, such as salaries, equipment, and fringe benefits. This was not  sufficient for us to review the costs.", "Unsupported indirect costs \u2013 $1.2 million: CMS paid at least $1.2  million to Ketchum for indirect costs that were not adequately  supported with recently audited provisional or final indirect cost rate  information. From May 2004 through October 2006, CMS paid Ketchum  for indirect costs based on indirect cost information from 1999.  Because FAR calls for indirect cost rates to be based on recent  information and established annually, rates based on information from  1999 did not adequately support costs billed in 2004 through 2006.  Further, in our review of the contract file, we noted documentation  from 2004 that alerted CMS to potential issues with Ketchum\u2019s indirect  cost rates\u2014namely, that the rates were too high. In September 2006,  Ketchum submitted cost reports for its 2001 through 2005 actual  indirect costs. According to Ketchum officials, CMS, as the cognizant  federal agency, has recently initiated an audit of this indirect cost rate  information to establish final rates for these years.", "Unsupported labor costs \u2013 $383,000: Based on the task orders in  our review, we estimated that $383,000 of BearingPoint\u2019s billings for  labor and fringe benefits costs were not adequately supported.  BearingPoint was unable to provide us with support for certain key  elements of the labor and fringe benefits costs it billed on the five task  orders in our review.", "Unsupported transactions \u2013 $463,000: During our audit, contractors  could not adequately support several miscellaneous transactions  totaling $463,000.", "Palmetto billed CMS for about $79,000 of labor and about $323,000  of Kelly Services costs which it did not support with documentation  such as time sheets or vendor invoices. Therefore, we were unable  to verify the amounts billed.", "IFMC billed CMS for about $49,000 of other direct costs such as  referral bonuses and placement fees that IFMC did not adequately  support. In some cases, IFMC provided invoices for the costs but  did not provide support that would enable us to verify that these  costs solely benefited and were directly allocable to the CMS  contract.", "BearingPoint billed CMS for about $5,000 of other direct costs  which it did not support with vendor invoices. Therefore, we could  not verify the amounts billed.", "CGI billed CMS for about $5,000 of other direct costs which it did  not support with vendor invoices. Therefore, we could not verify the  amounts billed.", "Maximus billed CMS for about $2,000 of other direct costs which it  did not support with documentation that would allow us to verify  that these costs were directly allocable to the CMS contract.", "Unsupported contractor costs \u2013 $60,000: CMS paid BAH more than  $60,000 for intercompany labor costs billed on a cost reimbursement  contract that the contractor did not adequately support the rates billed  to CMS. For example, on one task order, the intercompany hourly  rates, on average, were nearly 14 times higher than the average hourly  rate for other BAH employees and almost 6 times higher than the next  highest BAH employee. We noted that in a proposal review, CMS\u2019s  cost/price team raised a concern that BAH\u2019s proposed intercompany  hourly rates were \u201cexcessive and unreasonable\u201d and requested BAH to  provide support for the proposed rates. Even though BAH refused to  provide the support to CMS, CMS awarded the contract. We noted that  some of the rates BAH charged for intercompany labor exceeded the  proposed rates that were questioned by CMS by, on average, 65  percent. BAH did not provide us support for the rates, but stated that  the rates were commercial billing rates priced based on the private  sector market.", "Unsupported labor costs \u2013 $90,000: CMS paid Ketchum for labor  costs that Ketchum could not support were appropriately allocated to  the CMS contract. For cost reimbursement contracts, contractors  generally calculate an employee\u2019s hourly labor rate by dividing the  employee\u2019s annual salary by 2,080 hours (the standard number of work  hours in a year). Ketchum calculated standard hourly labor rates based  on 1,880 hours, which increased the hourly rates to account for  employees\u2019 leave time. However, this calculation method assigned  costs for leave time regardless of whether the leave was taken (when  the actual cost occurs). Generally, contractors include the costs of  leave time in indirect cost rates, which allocate costs proportionally to  all contracts, and when the indirect cost rates are finalized, billed costs  are adjusted based on actual costs. Because Ketchum incorporated  expected leave time in its hourly labor rates, its billings to CMS would  not be adjusted based on its actual costs. Since we were not able to  verify that the cost of the leave was appropriately allocated to the CMS  contracts, we estimated that CMS made almost $90,000 of questionable  payments as a result of Ketchum using 1,880 hours instead of 2,080 to  calculate hourly rates. A portion of the $90,000 would likely be offset  by an increase in indirect costs if Ketchum had allocated its leave time  to its indirect cost rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questionable Payments Related to Potential Waste", "paragraphs": ["During our review, we identified certain contracting practices that  increased the risk that CMS did not obtain the best value, thus leading to  potential waste. Therefore, we question whether certain contract costs  were an efficient use of government resources or might have been  avoided. Waste involves the taxpayers in the aggregate not receiving  reasonable value for money. Importantly, waste involves a transgression  that is less than fraud and abuse. Most waste does not involve a violation  of law or regulation but rather relates to mismanagement or inadequate  oversight. We identified $6.6 million of questionable payments for which  CMS may not have received the best value. Because waste is generally  caused by mismanagement or inadequate oversight, the total amount of  questionable payments we identified may not be recoverable from the  contractor.", "Excess subcontractor costs \u2013 $1.4 million: CMS missed  opportunities to save about $1.4 million associated with costs Z-Tech,  IBM, and CGI billed for subcontractors under T&M contracts.  According to DCAA, the \u201cT&M payments clause,\u201d generally included  in T&M contracts, required that contractors bill the government for  subcontractor labor hours at cost. GSA took the position that prime  contractors should bill for subcontracted labor at the prime  contractor\u2019s own labor rates (regardless of the contractor\u2019s cost).  DCAA stated that such a practice places the government at a greater  risk of paying costs higher than what prime contractors actually pay  without receiving any additional benefits. Further, DCAA noted that the  practice incentivizes contractors to maximize profits by subcontracting  more work and forces the government to expend additional resources  to monitor the subcontracted labor.", "We noted three instances where CMS allowed prime contractors to bill  subcontractor labor hours at their own labor rates rather than the  lower actual cost. For example, IBM paid about $1.1 million for its  subcontractor labor but billed CMS about $2.0 million, representing an  increase of about $900,000 or over 80 percent. Likewise, CGI billed  CMS about $420,000, or about 60 percent, more than the amount CGI  paid for subcontractor labor and Z-Tech billed CMS about $91,000, or  nearly 35 percent, more than the amount Z-Tech paid for subcontractor  labor. According to Z-Tech and CGI, they both notified CMS of their  plans to bill subcontractor labor hours under their own labor rates  (rather than actual cost) in their contract proposals, which were  accepted by CMS. Further, because CMS inappropriately issued IBM\u2019s  T&M contract off a commercial contract, as previously discussed, the  commercial contract did not contain the T&M payments clause.  Because CMS did not proactively limit the contractor\u2019s billings for  subcontractor services to cost, CMS missed an opportunity to save, in  total, about $1.4 million.", "Additional costs billed by prime contractors \u2013 $4.2 million: CMS  paid Palmetto and Pearson additional costs due to subcontracting  arrangements that may have been avoided. As previously mentioned,  Palmetto and Pearson each had a prime contract with CMS and  subcontracted with each other for similar services. For Palmetto\u2019s  prime cost reimbursement contract with CMS, Palmetto applied  indirect costs and fees to the amounts it billed CMS for the  subcontracted work provided by Pearson, which already included  Pearson\u2019s indirect costs and fees. As a result, two layers of indirect  costs and fees were applied to the same services. If CMS had not  permitted this subcontracting relationship, the additional layer of  indirect costs and fees applicable to Palmetto\u2019s billings, totaling $3.6  million, may have been avoided. Likewise, CMS paid Pearson an  additional $630,000 in fees that may not have been paid absent the  subcontract agreement.", "Unallowable costs included in indirect cost rates \u2013 $953,000:  Prior to September 2005, CMS did not require CGI to exclude  independent research and development (IR&D) costs from its indirect  cost rates. The HHSAR states that IR&D costs are unallowable;  however, according to CGI, CMS did not incorporate the HHSAR clause  into CGI\u2019s contract. CGI agreed to prospectively revise its indirect cost  rates to exclude IR&D once they were made aware of the clause. For  fiscal year 2005, CMS paid CGI about $953,000 for IR&D costs that were  included in CGI\u2019s indirect cost rates. We were unable to calculate the  financial impact prior to fiscal year 2005 because CGI did not  separately quantify the IR&D component of its indirect rates prior to  this point.

Likewise, CMS was not proactive in fulfilling its cognizant federal agency  responsibilities, which not only increased its own risk but the risk of other  agencies that use the same contractors. Further, significant deficiencies in  internal controls over contractor payments, such as inadequate policies,  procedures, and training to guide its invoice review process, increased the  agency\u2019s risk of improper payments. By not timely performing contract  closeout audits, CMS may have missed opportunities to detect and recover  improper payments. Without immediate corrective actions and  appropriate high-level management accountability to fix systemic issues,  CMS will continue to be highly vulnerable to waste and improper  payments.

We acknowledge that the time frames for  implementing MMA added schedule pressures for CMS. At the same time,  the compressed time frames and the resulting contracting practices added  risk to the contracting process.

CMS also stated its belief that  it was appropriate for contracting officers to approve invoices for payment  based on the information provided with the invoices, and that the  payments were interim payments that would be audited at a later date.  CMS also stated that the questionable payments we identified were based  on our review of the contractors\u2019 books and records rather than the  invoice amounts. CMS stated that it is premature to conclude that  questionable payments exist because it has not conducted a detailed audit  of the invoices for the contracts in question.", "We disagree.

However, we also  state that given CMS\u2019s poor control environment and the fact that our  work was not designed to identify all questionable payments made by CMS  or to estimate their extent, other questionable payments may have been  made.", "Further, CMS did not always ensure that contractors provided adequate  detail supporting the invoices to allow responsible CMS personnel to  sufficiently review and approve invoices. Regarding contract audits, CMS  had not demonstrated a willingness to allocate the necessary funding; thus  audits have not taken place in a timely manner. In addition, while we agree  that an audit of contract costs can provide a detective control to help  determine whether contractor costs were proper, CMS\u2019s reliance on an  after-the-fact audit is not an acceptable substitute for the real-time  monitoring and oversight of contractor costs\u2014preventative controls\u2014that  we recommend in this report.

We scanned these data files for obvious omissions or  errors in key data fields. To verify the completeness of the files, we  reconciled the total obligated amount to the MMA appropriation and  reconciled the liquidated obligation amount (a field within the obligation  data file) to the disbursement data totals. To determine the recipients of  the MMA appropriation, we categorized disbursement data by payee  category (contractors, government agencies, state government agencies,  etc.) based upon the vendor name in the file. Because CMS recorded about  $536 million of its disbursement to one budget object code, \u201cother  services,\u201d we were unable to use CMS\u2019s budget object codes to determine  the services provided by contractors and vendors. Therefore, to categorize  expenditures to contractors and vendors by activity (information  technology, 1-800-MEDICARE help line, etc.), we reviewed the project  titles in CMS\u2019s contracts database for all contracts with total  disbursements greater than $1 million; if the contract title was unclear, we  reviewed the statement of work in the contract file. We also categorized  some additional contracts based on our detailed review of selected  contractors.", "To identify additional details on the services obtained with MMA funds, we  (1) analyzed contract files including statements of work, (2) analyzed  interagency agreements, (3) discussed employee-related costs with CMS  officials, (4) discussed payments to state agencies with CMS officials  overseeing the State Health Insurance Assistance Program as well as  certain state agency officials, and (5) analyzed purchase card transaction  statements and supporting receipts and discussed these purchases with  applicable CMS officials.", "To determine whether CMS\u2019s contracting practices and related internal  controls are adequate to avoid waste and to prevent or detect improper  payments, we interviewed CMS officials including contracting officers,  contracting specialists, project officers, cost/price team members,  financial management officials, and Office of Acquisition and Grants  Management (OAGM) management about oversight responsibilities;  analyzed contract files and invoices; and assessed the sufficiency of CMS  policies, procedures, and training. As criteria, we used our Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government and the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR). We focused our internal control work on the  contractors that received the most MMA funding, based on the CMS  disbursement data. We also selected contractors with other risk factors  such as billing or accounting system problems for review. Our approach  resulted in the selection of 16 contractors. For these 16 contractors, we  then selected contracts to use for our work based on contracts that were  funded with at least $1.5 million of the MMA appropriation. As a result, we  nonstatistically selected 16 contractors and 67 contracts with a total  contract value of $1.6 billion. One contract selected was a Medicare  contract. Because Medicare contracts were not subject to FAR, we did not  include this contract in our internal control review. Therefore we  evaluated CMS contracting practices and related internal controls for 66  contracts. Additionally, we obtained from CMS information related to  oversight resources from fiscal year 1997 through 2006, the closeout  backlog, and its cognizant federal agency duties. We discussed cognizant  federal agency oversight activities with and obtained documentation such  as indirect cost rate agreements or audit reports from the National  Institutes of Health and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.", "To determine whether payments to contractors were properly supported  as a valid use of government funds, we started with the same 67 contracts  we had nonstatistically selected. We further refined the list of 67 contracts  based on individual contract values and other risk factors such as contract  type to arrive at a selection of 47 contracts for which we reviewed CMS  payments to contractors. Because CMS sometimes used other funding  sources in addition to MMA to pay invoices for one contract, we were not  always able to identify specific costs that were paid with MMA funds. As a  result, the scope of our review extended beyond payments made with  MMA funds. This nonstatistical selection methodology resulted in a  selection of CMS payments to contractors totaling $595.4 million, of which  $355.5 million was paid with MMA funds. The following table summarizes  the number of contracts and amounts of CMS payments to contractors  included in our review, as well as the amount paid with MMA funds.", "For the 47 contracts, we performed forensic auditing techniques, data  mining, and document analyses to select contractor costs billed to CMS to  test. Because we selected individual or groups of transactions for detailed  testing to determine whether costs were allowable, the amount of contract  payments we tested was lower than the amount of payments included in  our review shown in table 5. Following is a description of the types of  procedures we used to test transactions.", "Labor costs: We obtained from contractors their databases of hours  charged to CMS that included detailed information such as employee  name, hours worked per pay period, and pay rate information. Using  this information, we selected labor transactions for testing based on  quantitative factors such as (1) number of hours worked, (2) dollar  amount billed, (3) labor rates, or (4) anomalies in the data. For these  nonstatistical selections, we compared the information to supporting  documentation obtained from the contractor, including time sheets and  payroll registers and discussed billed amounts with contractor officials.", "Subcontractor, travel, and other direct costs: When contractor  invoices did not provide sufficient information, we obtained additional  information from the contractor, such as databases of transaction-level  detail, to select specific transactions based on criteria such as amount  billed, vendor names, and potential duplicate payments.

In addition, we questioned  payments for which we had concerns that risks in CMS\u2019s contracting  practices may have resulted in waste. When calculating our questionable  payment amounts, where applicable for costs not compliant with contract  terms and regulations we added the respective indirect costs that the  contractor charged on the item in question. For some of the questionable  payments we identified, a portion of the cost is most likely appropriate;  however, because of certain facts and circumstances involved, we were  unable to determine whether or to what extent the costs were allowable,  reasonable, and allocable.

Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We conducted our audit work in Washington D.C. and  Baltimore, Maryland from March 2006 through September 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  See \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section.  2.  The contracting authority CMS referred to (Section 1857(c)(5)) applies  specifically to Medicare Advantage contracts (formerly referred to as  Medicare+Choice contracts) and prescription drug plan contracts and  does not apply to the types of contracts included in our review.  3.  As stated in our report, CMS paid $735.4 million of its MMA funds for  start-up administrative costs to contractors and vendors. Our review  included 67 contracts with a total contract value of $1.6 billion, of  which $508.4 million was paid with MMA funds. Our sample covered  about 69 percent of the MMA funds paid to contractors and vendors.  4.  CMS compared the percentages of noncompetitively awarded and  logical follow-on task orders that were included in our review to  statistics it calculated for its 2007 contracting actions. The percentages  related to our review are not comparable to the statistics CMS  presented primarily because the percentages were calculated  differently. Our percentages were based solely on the number of  contracts in our review and included several years. Our calculation  showed that 45 percent of contracts in our review were awarded  without the benefit of competition. CMS used fiscal year 2007  contracts, which were outside the scope of our review, to arrive at a  total of $255 million awarded on a noncompetitive basis for that fiscal  year. Furthermore, CMS calculated the percentage of noncompetitive  awards for fiscal year 2007 by comparing the number of  noncompetitive contracts to the total number of contract actions.  Contract actions likely include contract modifications, and one  contract could have several modifications. For example, one of the  large information technology contracts in our review had over one  hundred modifications (contract actions).  5.  CMS stated that it had to use cost reimbursement contracts because  MMA was an entirely new initiative. We present the statistics about  cost reimbursement contracts to add perspective due to the increased  risk associated with these types of contracts.  6.  As stated in our report, CMS awarded cost reimbursement contracts to  Palmetto despite CMS\u2019s own cost/price team\u2019s determination that the  contractor had numerous accounting system deficiencies. The chart  CMS referred to is our summary of CMS\u2019s fulfillment of its cognizant  federal agency responsibilities. The chart illustrates instances in which  CMS did not sufficiently assess the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s  accounting system. The chart is not intended to present a conclusion  about the adequacy of the contractors\u2019 accounting systems.  7.  Because certain cognizant federal agency oversight responsibilities at  HHS were assigned to CMS, as discussed in our report, we believe it is  CMS\u2019s obligation to ensure that those responsibilities are performed.  In addition, we added wording to our report to clarify that we refer to  CMS as the cognizant federal agency in this report because HHS  delegated cognizant federal agency responsibilities to CMS.  8.  We modified our report to clarify that we reviewed CMS\u2019s Acquisition  Policy \u2013 16 Subject: Invoice Payment Procedures, August 2005.  9.  CMS issued the demand letter to Maximus as a result of our  preliminary audit findings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Staff members who made key contributions to this report include: Marcia  Carlsen (Assistant Director), Richard Cambosos, Timothy DiNapoli, Abe  Dymond, Janice Friedeborn, Leslie Jones, Jason Kelly, Steven Koons, John  Lopez, Meg Mills, Kara Patton, Ronald Schwenn, Omar Torres, Ruth Walk,  and Doris Yanger."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
