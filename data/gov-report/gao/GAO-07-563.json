As such, they do not have to pay federal income taxes. Exempt organizations are still required to remit amounts withheld from employees' wages for federal income tax, Social Security and Medicare, as well as other taxes. Previous GAO work identified numerous government contractors, Medicare providers, and charities participating in the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) with billions in unpaid federal taxes. To follow up on the CFC work, the subcommittee requested that GAO determine whether and to what extent (1) exempt organizations have unpaid federal taxes, including payroll taxes; (2) selected case study organizations and their executives are involved in abusive or potentially criminal activity; and (3) exempt organizations with unpaid federal taxes received direct grants from certain federal agencies. GAO reviewed unpaid taxes and exempt organization data from IRS and selected 25 case studies for audit and investigation. GAO also reviewed data from 3 major grant disbursement systems. GAO referred all 25 cases to IRS for collection activity and criminal investigation, if warranted. In its oral comments on a draft of this report, IRS noted several actions it is taking to enhance exempt organizations' tax compliance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 55,000 exempt organizations had almost $1 billion in unpaid federal taxes as of September 30, 2006. About 1,500 of these entities each had over $100,000 in federal tax debts with some owing tens of millions of dollars. The majority of this debt represented payroll taxes and associated penalties and interest dating as far back as the early 1980s. Willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a felony under U.S. tax law. The $1 billion figure is understated because some exempt organizations have understated tax liabilities or did not file tax returns. GAO selected 25 exempt organizations for investigation based primarily on amount of tax debt and number of periods delinquent. For the 25 cases investigated GAO found abusive and potentially criminal activity, including repeated failure to remit payroll taxes withheld from employees. Officials diverted the money to fund their operations, including paying themselves large salaries ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to over $1 million. Many of the 25 case studies accumulated substantial assets, such as million-dollar homes and luxury vehicles. Key officials and employees at 4 exempt organizations were engaged in criminal activities, including attempted bribery of an IRS official and illegal gambling. Despite repeatedly abusing the federal tax system, these entities continued to retain their exempt status. IRS does not have the authority to revoke an organization's exempt status because of unpaid federal taxes. Over 1,200 of these exempt organizations with unpaid federal taxes received over $14 billion in federal grants in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Six of the 25 exempt organizations GAO investigated received grants; of those 6 entities, 5 appear to have violated the False Statement Act by not disclosing their tax debt as required. For example, one entity that received millions of dollars in grants did not disclose unpaid taxes on multiple applications.

This tax gap undermines the  credibility of the tax system and costs the federal government billions of  dollars in lost revenue. IRS has reported that the estimated annual net tax  gap is $290 billion.", "Since 2004, we have issued testimonies and reports highlighting  government contractors, Medicare providers, and charities participating in  the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) that abused the federal tax  system.

Because of the significance of the issues raised in prior work,  and most notably our findings that CFC charities, which are exempt from  federal income taxes but are still required to pay payroll and other taxes,  abused the federal tax system, you requested that we perform work to  determine whether other organizations exempt from federal income taxes  were engaged in similar abuses of the federal tax system.

To  identify specific instances of abusive and potentially criminal activities by  selected exempt organizations and their executives, we performed  investigative work on a nonrepresentative selection of 25 exempt  organizations. We selected these 25 organizations using primarily the  amount of tax debt and number of delinquent tax periods as selection  factors. The investigative work included obtaining and analyzing tax,  financial, criminal history, and other public records.

These three agencies process the majority of federal  grants. We reviewed the grant applications of selected exempt  organizations with tax debts that received federal grants payments in fiscal  years 2005 and 2006 to determine whether they reported federal tax debt  as required.

Exempt organization  data provided by IRS indicated that nearly 1.8 million organizations in  various classifications are currently recognized as being tax exempt.  Charitable organizations (I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)3) constitute the largest  classification, accounting for over 60 percent of all exempt organizations  as of September 30, 2006. Other classifications of exempt organization  include civic and business leagues, labor organizations, recreational clubs,  domestic fraternal societies, and credit unions. Differences between the  various classifications include whether donations to the exempt  organization are tax deductible and whether the exempt organization has  to submit an application to IRS for specific recognition of its tax exempt  status. Specifically, donations to certain exempt organizations, such as  charitable and religious organizations, certain veteran\u2019s organizations, and  certain cemetery companies, are deductible on the donor\u2019s individual tax  return. Donations to other organizations not specifically recognized as  such are not deductible. Organizations that are qualified to receive  deductible donations, with the exception of churches, are required to  apply to IRS and receive a formal determination of their exempt status.  Generally, each exempt organization is required to file an annual  informational return that provides IRS with information about the  organization and its operations, officers and directors, and whether it is  required to obtain specific IRS recognition of its exempt status. An exempt  organization\u2019s annual information return (Form 990) also provides the  public with the primary or sole source of information about the  organization.", "The determination of exempt status and monitoring of exempt  organizations is the responsibility of the Tax Exempt and Government  Entities Division (TE/GE) of IRS. The division\u2019s responsibilities include  accepting applications for and determining whether organizations qualify  as exempt under the I.R.C., monitoring exempt organizations for  continued compliance with the I.R.C., and when appropriate, revoking the  exempt status of an organization that no longer meets requirements for  exemption.", "Like all other employers, exempt organizations with employees are  required to pay payroll taxes that they withhold from employees\u2019 wages \u201cin  trust\u201d for the federal government, as well as other applicable federal taxes.  Payroll taxes withheld from employees consist of income taxes; Old Age,  Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), commonly referred to as  Social Security; and Medicare. OASDI is taxed at 6.2 percent on the first  $94,200 of an employee\u2019s salary, and Medicare is taxed at 1.45 percent  with no income cap. The employer is also taxed, at the same rate, for  OASDI and Medicare on employee wages. To the extent that payroll taxes  are withheld and not forwarded to IRS, individuals within the business  (e.g., exempt organization officials) may be held personally liable for the  withheld amounts not forwarded, and they can be assessed a civil  monetary penalty known as a trust fund recovery penalty (TFRP). Willful  failure to remit payroll taxes is a felony under U.S. law punishable by a  fine, imprisonment, or both, and the failure to properly segregate payroll  taxes can be a criminal misdemeanor offense.", "Within TE/GE, the Exempt Organization (EO) Examinations Office is  charged with promoting compliance with the I.R.C. The EO Examinations  Office\u2019s activities include analyzing the operational and financial activities  of exempt organizations and developing other processes to identify areas  of noncompliance, developing corrective strategies, and assisting other  exempt organization functions in implementing these strategies. In the  process of performing the analysis, the EO Examinations Office may  assess exempt organizations\u2019 payroll or other taxes. If the EO  Examinations Office assesses taxes and the taxpayer does not make  payment, the matter is referred to IRS\u2019s Small Business / Self-Employed  (SB/SE) Collections Office.

Further analysis of the FAADS data  indicates that approximately 80 percent of all federal grants are pass- through grants, that is, they are federal grants provided to the state and  local governments, which, in turn, disburse the grants to the ultimate  recipients. Consequently, only about 20 percent of grants are provided  directly from the federal government to the organization that ultimately  spends the money.", "Grant applicants that apply directly to the federal government are required  to complete Standard Form (SF) 424.

All of these nearly 1,500 exempt organizations owed over  $100,000 each, with some owing more than $10 million. Another 8,400  owed from $10,000 to $100,000 each. Although the largest group\u2014nearly  45,000\u2014owed less than $10,000 in delinquent taxes, the majority of the  debt in this group of exempt organizations is related to payroll taxes  withheld from employees and not remitted to the federal government and  annual reporting penalties.

This  amount does not include amounts due IRS from exempt organizations that  did not file payroll taxes (nonfilers) or underreported payroll tax liability  (underreporters). Also, we did not include exempt organization tax debt  from 2006 tax periods, tax debt for entities owing $100 or less, or tax debt  for certain entities listed in IRS\u2019s database of exempt organizations.", "Limiting our ability to more fully estimate the extent of exempt  organizations with unpaid federal taxes is the fact that IRS\u2019s tax database  reflects only the amount of unpaid taxes reported by the exempt  organization on a tax return or assessed by IRS through various  enforcement programs. IRS\u2019s tax database does not reflect amounts owed  by exempt organizations that have not filed tax returns and for which IRS  has not assessed tax amounts due. Additionally, our analysis did not  account for exempt organizations that underreported payroll taxes and  had not been identified by IRS. As reported previously and as indicated in  our case study investigations, some exempt organizations underreported  payroll taxes or failed to file returns. IRS estimates that underreporting  accounts for more than 80 percent of the gross tax gap.", "We also took a number of steps in determining the amount of tax debt  owed by exempt organizations to avoid overestimation. For example,  some recently assessed tax debts that appear as unpaid taxes through a  matching of IRS unpaid tax and exempt organization records may involve  matters that are routinely resolved between the exempt organization and  IRS, with the taxes paid, abated, or both within a short period. We  eliminated these types of debt by including only unpaid federal taxes for  tax periods prior to calendar year 2006. Further, we did not include  exempt organizations with tax debt of $100 or less because these small  debts likely do not represent abusive behavior. We also eliminated all tax  debt IRS identified as not agreed to by the exempt organization.", "Further, the amount of exempt organization tax debt excludes amounts  owed by exempt organizations for which the statutory collection period  expired. Generally, there is a 10-year statutory collection period beyond  which IRS is prohibited from attempting to collect tax debt.  Consequently, if exempt organizations owe federal taxes beyond the 10- year statutory collection period, the older tax debt may have been  removed from IRS\u2019s records.

These cases  reiterate the need for IRS to improve its enforcement of tax laws as  previously noted by GAO. The amount of unpaid taxes associated with  these cases ranged from over $300,000 to nearly $30 million. All 25 exempt  organizations had unpaid payroll taxes, some dating as far back as the late  1980s. In one instance, an exempt organization had not remitted payroll  taxes to IRS for 14 years, thereby accumulating unpaid federal taxes of  nearly $8 million at the time of our audit. Rather than fulfill their role as  \u201ctrustees\u201d of this money and forward it to IRS as required by law, the  officials responsible for these exempt organizations diverted the money to  fund the organizations\u2019 operations, which sometimes included millions of  dollars in management fees to related entities, or for personal benefits,  such as their own salaries. At the time of our audit, IRS had completed  TFRP assessments on officials of 15 of the 25 exempt organizations.  However, as we have previously reported, collections of TFRP  assessments are generally minimal.

Our investigations found that 3 of these  exempt organizations are related to other exempt organizations, for-profit  entities, or both that are also tax delinquent. The related entities were  primarily discovered because of common top officials. Combined, the 3  exempt organizations and their related entities owed nearly $40 million in  delinquent taxes. Further, 4 of the 25 case study organizations we  investigated had key officials and other employees who were convicted of  criminal activities, including tax evasion and operating an illegal gambling  establishment, at the same time the organizations continued to benefit  from a tax exempt status.

The related entities appear to be set up under complex forms of ownership  designed to shield income and assets, such as limited liability companies  and offshore entities. Combined, these entities owe nearly $30 million in  federal taxes, of which more than $10 million is attributable to the exempt  organization. The exempt organization in particular had not paid federal  taxes since the late 1990s, despite receiving millions in federal payments.  At the same time, the exempt organization paid millions in management  fees to a contractor that, according to available public records, is affiliated  with the exempt organization. IRS has not placed a TFRP on any individual  with respect to this exempt organization\u2019s tax debt.", "Case 2: This industry association owes more than $6 million in tax debt  dating back to the late 1990s. A top official of the association admitted that  he intentionally failed to remit payroll taxes in order to fund operations,  which in a recent year included providing more than 10 officials with six- figure salaries, with one receiving a salary in excess of $500,000. At the  same time, another top officer owned a multimillion-dollar luxury estate  and purchased luxury vehicles. IRS has assessed a multimillion-dollar  TFRP against an officer of the organization.", "Case 3: This health care organization owes more than $15 million in tax  debt dating back to the early 2000s. While not paying its payroll taxes, the  organization paid several employees large amounts of annual  compensation, including a total compensation package for a top official in  excess of $1 million annually, and several other employees with combined  compensation of over $1 million. The top official also made several  hundred thousand dollars in cash transactions at banks and casinos while  the organization owed millions in unpaid taxes. Despite holding the  organization\u2019s top office and earning seven-figure compensation, this  official told IRS that he was not responsible for the exempt organization\u2019s  unpaid taxes.", "Case 5: This children\u2019s services organization owes more than $500,000  primarily related to payroll taxes dating back to the late 1980s. The top  official of this exempt organization was convicted of attempting to bribe  an IRS employee. Other organization employees have criminal records,  including records for violent crimes. Further, organization officials  allegedly requested that some payments to it be made in cash.", "Case 6: This community services organization owes almost $3 million in  tax debt dating from the late 1990s. The organization was fined for  employing convicted felons in positions responsible for public safety. In  addition, an organization employee was engaged in criminal activity at one  of the organization\u2019s job sites. To date, IRS has not assessed a TFRP  against organization officials.

Existing federal  statutes do not authorize IRS to revoke exempt status based on an  organization\u2019s tax delinquency. However, the I.R.C. provides IRS with the  authority to approve and monitor exempt organizations and also stipulates  the circumstances under which IRS can revoke an organization\u2019s tax  exempt status. Specifically, IRS can revoke exempt status when it  determines the organization has ceased to operate in a manner consistent  with the purpose for which it was granted the tax exempt status. For  example, if an organization was granted tax exempt status because it was  established to provide employment or other services to underprivileged  individuals, and it ceases to do so, IRS can revoke the organization\u2019s tax  exempt status. In addition, if an organization engages in excess benefit  behavior, IRS has the authority to assess a tax against the individual who  received the benefit. The I.R.C. provides IRS authority to revoke an  organization\u2019s tax exempt status if it repeatedly engages in excess benefits  behavior, including excess compensation.", "However, the I.R.C. does not provide IRS the authority to revoke tax  exempt status based on failure to pay taxes. According to IRS officials,  organizations whose exempt status is revoked may have delinquent debts,  but that was not the criteria for revocation. IRS officials also informed us  that revocation is an action of last resort, arrived at after evaluation of  many factors and after imposing intermediate sanctions to try and correct  the problem.

To perform this step,  we obtained the exempt organization business master file from the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as of September 30, 2006. This database  contained information on over 2.5 million entities, each with a code  indicating the most recent \u201cexempt\u201d status. In consultation with IRS, we  identified nearly 1.8 million entities with status codes indicating that they  are currently tax exempt.", "To identify exempt organizations with unpaid federal taxes, we obtained  IRS\u2019s September 30, 2006, unpaid assessments file and matched it to the  1.8 million entities we identified as currently tax exempt using taxpayer  identification numbers (TIN). To avoid overstating the amount owed by  exempt organizations with unpaid federal tax debts and to capture only  significant tax debt, we excluded tax debts meeting specific criteria. The  criteria we used to exclude tax debts are as follows:  tax debts IRS classified as compliance assessments or memo accounts  for financial reporting,  tax debts from calendar year 2006 tax periods, and    exempt organizations with total unpaid taxes of $100 or less.", "The criteria above were used to exclude tax debts that might be under  dispute or generally duplicative or invalid and tax debts that are recently  incurred. Specifically, compliance assessments or memo accounts were  excluded because these taxes have neither been agreed to by the  taxpayers nor affirmed by the court, or these taxes could be invalid or  duplicative of other taxes already reported. We excluded tax debts from  calendar year 2006 tax periods to eliminate tax debt that may involve  matters that are routinely resolved between the taxpayers and IRS, with  the taxes paid or abated within a short period. We also excluded tax debts  of $100 or less because they are insignificant for the purpose of  determining the extent of taxes owed by exempt organizations.", "To prepare case studies of selected exempt organizations and their  directors or senior officers for abuse of the federal tax system, we selected  25 exempt organizations using a nonrepresentative selection approach  based on data-mining results, our judgment, and a number of other  criteria, including the amount of unpaid taxes, number of unpaid tax  periods, amount of payments reported by IRS, and indications that key  officials might be involved in multiple entities with tax debts.", "We obtained copies of automated tax transcripts and other tax records  (for example, revenue officers\u2019 notes) from IRS as of September 30, 2006,  and reviewed these records to exclude exempt organizations that had  recently paid off their unpaid tax balances and considered other factors  before reducing the selection of exempt organizations to 25 case studies.  For the selected 25 cases, we performed searches of criminal, financial,  and public records. Our investigators contacted several of the exempt  organizations and performed interviews.", "To determine whether and to what extent exempt organizations with tax  debt received federal grants, we obtained and analyzed federal grant  payment databases from the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Grant  Administration and Payment System (GAPS), the Department of the  Treasury Financial Management Service\u2019s (FMS) Automated Standard  Application Payment system (ASAP), and the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) for fiscal  years 2005 and 2006. These three agencies process grants on behalf of  many other federal agencies and, in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, processed  the majority of direct and pass-through grants, excluding Medicare and  Medicaid. We then matched the grant payment data to the exempt  organizations with federal tax debt using the TINs. Of the 25 case studies  of exempt organizations with unpaid federal taxes, 6 submitted grant  application forms related to grant payments made during fiscal years 2005  and 2006. We requested and reviewed the grant application forms for all 6  entities. We also interviewed officials from HHS, Education, and the  Department of Agriculture on whether tax debts are considered in their  decisions on whether to provide grants to particular grant applicants.", "We conducted our audit work from August 2006 through March 2007 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards,  and we performed our investigative work in accordance with standards  prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Reliability Assessment", "paragraphs": ["For IRS unpaid assessments data, we relied on the work we performed  during our annual audits of IRS\u2019s financial statements.

Our financial audit procedures, including the reconciliation of  the value of unpaid taxes recorded in IRS\u2019s master file to IRS\u2019s general  ledger, identified no material differences.", "To help ensure reliability of the exempt organization data, we interviewed  IRS officials concerning the reliability of the data provided to us.
