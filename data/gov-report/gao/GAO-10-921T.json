GAO has issued more than 20 products since 2000 examining U.S.-funded international programs aimed at reducing the supply of drugs. These programs have been implemented primarily in drug source countries, such as Colombia and Afghanistan as well drug transit countries, such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela. They have included interdiction of maritime drug shipments on the high seas, support for foreign military and civilian institutions engaged in drug eradication, detection, and interdiction; and rule of law assistance aimed at helping foreign legal institutions investigate and prosecute drug trafficking, money laundering, and other drug-related crimes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's work on U.S.-funded international counternarcotics-related programswork has centered on four major topics: (1) Counternarcotics-related programs have had mixed results. In Afghanistan, Colombia, and drug transit countries, the United States and partner nations have only partially met established targets for reducing the drug supply. In Afghanistan, opium poppy eradication efforts have consistently fallen short of targets. Plan Colombia has met its goals for reducing opium and heroin but not coca crops, although recent data suggest that U.S.-supported crop eradication efforts over time may have caused a significant decline in potential cocaine production. Data also indicate an increase in coca cultivation in Peru and Bolivia that may eventually offset these declines. Interdiction programs have missed their performance targets each year since goals were established in 2007. (2) Several factors have limited program effectiveness. Various factors have hindered these programs' ability to reduce the supply of illegal drugs. In some cases, we found that U.S. agencies had not planned for the sustainment of programs, particularly those providing interdiction boats in transit countries. External factors include limited cooperation from partner nations due to corruption or lack of political support, and the highly adaptive nature of drug producers and traffickers. (3) Counternarcotics-related programs often advance broader foreign policy objectives. The value of these programs cannot be assessed based only on their impact on the drug supply. Many have supported other U.S. foreign policy objectives relating to security and stabilization, counterinsurgency, and strengthening democracy and governance. For example, in Afghanistan, the United States has combined counternarcotics efforts with military operations to combat insurgents as well as drug traffickers. U.S. support for Plan Colombia has significantly strengthened Colombia's security environment, which may eventually make counterdrug programs, such as alternative agricultural development, more effective. In several cases, U.S. rule of law assistance, such as supporting courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement organizations, has furthered both democracy-building and counterdrug objectives. (4) Judging the effectiveness of some programs is difficult. U.S. agencies often lack reliable performance measurement and results reporting needed to assess all the impacts of counterdrug programs. In Afghanistan, opium eradication measures alone were insufficient for a comprehensive assessment of U.S. efforts. Also, the State Department has not regularly reported outcome-related information for over half of its programs in major drug transit countries. Furthermore, DOD's counternarcotics-related measures were generally not useful for assessing program effectiveness or making management decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations to the Departments of Defense (DOD) and State and other agencies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. counternarcotics- related programs.

This involves seizing large quantities of narcotics from  transporters, disrupting major drug trafficking organizations, arresting  their leaders, and seizing their assets. The strategy also called for the  United States to support democratic institutions and the rule of law in  allied nations both in the transit zone and in drug producing countries,  strengthening of these nations\u2019 prosecutorial efforts, and the prosecution  of foreign traffickers and producers. According to State\u2019s International  Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the goal of U.S. counternarcotics  assistance to other countries is to help their governments become full and  self-sustaining partners in the fight against drugs.", "The updated U.S. National Drug Control Strategy, released in May 2010,  endorses a balance of drug abuse prevention, drug treatment, and law  enforcement.

According to State, the targets were met for  some but not all of these years. We recently reported that cultivation data  show increases from 2005 to 2007 and decreases from 2007 to 2009 and  that 20 of the 34 Afghan provinces are now poppy-free. However, the U.S.  and Afghan opium poppy eradication strategy did not achieve its stated  objectives, as the amounts of poppy eradicated consistently fell short of  the annual targeted amounts. For example, based on the most recent data  we analyzed-for 2008-2009-slightly more than one-quarter of the total  eradication goal for that year was achieved: of the 20,000 hectares  targeted, only 5,350 hectares were successfully eradicated.", "These eradication and cultivation goals were not met due to a number of  factors, including lack of political will on the part of Afghan central and  provincial governments. In 2009, the United States revamped its  counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan to deemphasize eradication  efforts and shift to interdiction and increased agricultural assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Colombia Partially Met Six-Year Drug Supply Reduction Goals and Recent Data Suggest More Improvements Have Been Made", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, we reported that Plan Colombia\u2019s goal of reducing the cultivation  and production of illegal drugs by 50 percent in 6 years was partially  achieved. From 2001 to 2006, Colombian opium poppy cultivation and  heroin production decreased by about 50 percent to meet established  goals. However, estimated coca cultivation rose by 15 percent with an  estimated 157,000 hectares cultivated in 2006 compared to 136,200  hectares in 2000. State officials noted that extensive aerial and manual  eradication efforts during this period were not sufficient to overcome  countermeasures taken by coca farmers. U.S. officials also noted the  increase in estimated coca cultivation levels from 2005 through 2007 may  have been due, at least in part, to the U.S. government\u2019s decision to  increase the size of the coca cultivation survey areas in Colombia  beginning in 2004. Furthermore, in 2008 we reported that estimated  cocaine production was about 4 percent greater in 2006 than in 2000, with  550 metric tons produced in 2006 compared to 530 metric tons in 2000.", "Since our 2008 report, ONDCP has provided additional data that suggests  significant reductions in the potential cocaine production in Colombia  despite the rising cultivation and estimated production numbers we had  cited. ONDCP officials have noted that U.S.-supported eradication efforts  had degraded coca fields, so that less cocaine was being produced per  hectare of cultivated coca. According to ONDCP data, potential cocaine  production overall has dropped from 700 metric tons in 2001 to 295 metric  tons in 2008\u2014a 57 percent decrease. According to ONDCP officials,  decreases in cocaine purity and in the amount of cocaine seized at the  Southwest Border since 2006 tend to corroborate the lower potential  cocaine production figures.", "In interpreting this additional ONDCP data, a number of facts and  mitigating circumstances should be considered. First, increasing  effectiveness of coca eradication efforts may not be the only explanation  for the data that ONDCP provided. Other factors, such as dry weather  conditions, may be contributing to these decreases in potential cocaine  production. Also, other factors, such as increases in cocaine flow to West  Africa and Europe could be contributing to decreased availability and  purity of cocaine in U.S. markets. Additionally, ONDCP officials cautioned  about the longer-term prospects for these apparent eradication  achievements, because weakened economic conditions in both the U.S.  and Colombia could hamper the Colombian government\u2019s sustainment of  eradication programs and curtail the gains made. Moreover, as we noted in  2008, reductions in Colombia\u2019s estimated cocaine production have been  partially offset by increases in cocaine production in Peru and, to a lesser  extent, Bolivia. Although It remains to be seen whether cocaine  production in Peru and Bolivia will continue to increase and these whether  Peru will return to being the primary coca producing country that it was  through the 1980\u2019s and into the 1990\u2019s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cocaine Interdiction Programs in the Transit Zone Has Fallen Short of Targets", "paragraphs": ["According to ONDCP data, the United States has fallen slightly short of its  cocaine interdiction targets each year since the targets were established in  2007.

The goal  included interim annual targets of 25 percent in 2008 and 27 percent in  2009. However, since 2006, cocaine removal rates have declined and have  not reached any of the annual targets to date.

ONDCP has cited aging interdiction  assets, such as U.S. Coast Guard vessels, the redirection of interdiction  capacity to wars overseas, and budget constraints, as contributing factors  to these lower-than-desired success rates.

Some counternarcotics initiatives  we reviewed were hampered by a shortage of resources made available by  partner nations to sustain these programs. We found that many partner  nations in the transit zone had limited resources to devote to  counternarcotics, and many initiatives depended on U.S. support.  Programs aimed at building maritime interdiction capacity were  particularly affected, as partner nations, including Haiti, Guatemala,  Jamaica, Panama and the Dominican Republic, were unable to use U.S.- provided boats for patrol or interdiction operations due to a lack of  funding for fuel and maintenance. Despite continued efforts by DOD and  State to provide these countries with boats, these agencies had not  developed plans to address long-term sustainability of these assets over  their expected operating life.", "Also, we found in 2006 that the availability of some key U.S. assets for  interdiction operations, such as maritime patrol aircraft, was declining,  and the United States had not planned for how to replace them. According  to JIATF-South and other cognizant officials, the declining availability of  P-3 maritime patrol aircraft was the most critical challenge to the success  of future interdiction operations. Since then, DOD has taken steps to  address the issue of declining availability of ships and aircraft for transit  zone interdiction operations by using other forms of aerial surveillance  and extending the useful life of P-3 aircraft. Recently, DOD\u2019s Southern  Command officials told us that they plan to rely increasingly upon U.S.- supported partner nations for detection and monitoring efforts as DOD  capabilities in this area diminish. However, given the concerns we have  reported about the ability of some partner nations to sustain  counternarcotics-related assets, it remains to be seen whether this  contingency is viable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Cooperation Between the United States and Partner Nations", "paragraphs": ["Our work in Colombia, Mexico, and drug transit countries has shown that  cooperative working relationships between U.S. officials and their foreign  counterparts is essential to implementing effective counternarcotics  programs. The United States has agreed-upon strategies with both  Colombia and Mexico to achieve counternarcotics-related objectives and  has worked extensively to strengthen those countries\u2019 capacity to combat  illicit drug production and trafficking. For example, to detect and intercept  illegal air traffic in Colombian air space the United States and Colombia  collaborated to operate the Air Bridge Denial Program, which the  Colombian Air Force now operates independently. Also, in Mexico,  increased cooperation with the United States led to a rise in extraditions  of high-level cartel members, demonstrating a stronger commitment by the  Mexican government to work closely with U.S. agencies to combat drug  trafficking problems. Similarly, in 2008 we reported that in most major  drug transit countries, close and improving cooperation has yielded a  variety of benefits for the counternarcotics effort. In particular, partner  nations have shared information and intelligence leading to arrests and  drug seizures, participated in counternarcotics operations both at sea and  on land, and cooperated in the prosecution of drug traffickers.", "However, corruption within the governments of partner nations can  seriously limit cooperation. For example, in 2002, the U.S. government  suspended major joint operations in Guatemala when the antinarcotics  police unit in that country was disbanded in response to reports of  widespread corruption within the agency and its general lack of  effectiveness in combating the country\u2019s drug problem.

Furthermore, Afghan governors had been slow to grant permission to  eradicate poppy fields until the concept for the central government\u2019s  eradication force was changed in 2008 so that this force could operate  without governor permission in areas where governors either would not or  could not launch eradication efforts themselves.", "Deteriorating relations with Venezuela have stalled the progress of several  cooperative counternarcotics initiatives intended to slow drug trafficking  through that country. In 2007, Venezuela began denying visas for U.S.  officials to serve in Venezuela, which complicated efforts to cooperate.  Additionally, the overall number of counternarcotics projects supported  by both the United States in Venezuela has fallen since 2005.

In 2008, we reported that drug traffickers  typically used go-fast boats and fishing vessels to smuggle cocaine from  Colombia to Central America and Mexico en route to the United States.  These boats, capable of traveling at speeds over 40 knots, were difficult to  detect in open water and were often used at night or painted blue and used  during the day, becoming virtually impossible to see. Traffickers have also  used \u201cmother ships\u201d in concert with fishing vessels to transport illicit  drugs into open waters and then distribute the load among smaller boats  at sea. In addition, traffickers have used evasive maritime routes and  changed them frequently. Some boats have traveled as far southwest as  the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean before heading north toward  Mexico, while others travel through Central America\u2019s littoral waters,  close to shore, where they could hide among legitimate maritime traffic.  Furthermore, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-South),  under DOD\u2019s U.S. Southern Command, reported an increase in suspicious  flights\u2014particularly departing from Venezuela. Traffickers have flown  loads of cocaine to remote, ungoverned spaces and abandoned the planes  after landing. Traffickers have also used increasingly sophisticated  concealment methods. For example, they have built fiberglass  semisubmersible craft that could avoid both visual- and sonar-detection,  hidden cocaine within the hulls of boats, and transported liquefied cocaine  in fuel tanks.", "According to DOD officials, these shifts in drug trafficking patterns and  methods have likely taken place largely in response to U.S. and  international counternarcotics efforts in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean,  although measuring causes and effects is imprecise. In addition, according  to DOD, drug trafficking organizations and associated criminal networks  commonly enjoy greater financial and material resources (including  weapons as well as communication, navigation, and other technologies)  than do governments in the transit zone.", "In addition to maritime operations, drug trafficking organizations have  adopted increasingly sophisticated smuggling techniques on the ground.  For example, from 2000 to 2006, U.S. border officials found 45 tunnels\u2014 several built primarily for narcotics smuggling. According to DEA and  Defense Intelligence Agency officials, the tunnels found were longer,  deeper, and more discrete than in prior years. One such tunnel found in  2006 was a half-mile long. It was the longest cross border tunnel  discovered, reaching a depth of more than nine stories below ground and  featuring ventilation and groundwater drainage systems, cement flooring,  lighting, and a pulley system.", "In production countries, such as Colombia, drug producers also proved to  be highly adaptive. In 2009 we reported that coca farmers adopted a  number of effective countermeasures to U.S. supported eradication and  aerial spray efforts. These measures included pruning coca plants after  spraying; replanting with younger coca plants or plant grafts; decreasing  the size of coca plots; interspersing coca with legitimate crops to avoid  detection; moving coca cultivation to areas of the country off-limits to  spray aircraft, such as the national parks and a 10 kilometer area along  Colombia\u2019s border with Ecuador; and moving coca crops to more remote  parts of the country\u2014a development that created a \u201cdispersal effect.\u201d  While these measures allowed coca farmers to continue cultivation, they  also increased the coca farmers and traffickers\u2019 cost of doing business."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Counternarcotics Initiatives Have Been Closely Aligned with Broad U.S. Foreign Policy Objectives", "paragraphs": ["U.S. counternarcotics programs have been closely aligned with the  achievement of other U.S. foreign policy goals.

Colombia  saw a significant drop in homicides and kidnappings and increased use of  Colombian public roads during Plan Colombia\u2019s six years. In addition,  insurgency groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  (FARC) saw a decline in capabilities and finances. While these  accomplishments have not necessarily led to a decrease in drug  production and trafficking, they signaled an improved security climate,  which is one of the pillars of Plan Colombia.", "In Afghanistan, we recently reported that the U.S. counternarcotics  strategy has become more integrated with the broad counterinsurgency  effort over time. Prior to 2008, counterinsurgency and counternarcotics  policies were largely separated and officials noted that this division  ignored a nexus between the narcotics trade and the insurgency. For  example, DEA drug raids yielded weapons caches and explosives used by  insurgents, as well as suspects listed on Defense military target lists, and  military raids on insurgent compounds also yielded illicit narcotics and  narcotics processing equipment. DOD changed its rules of engagement in  November 2008 to permit the targeting of persons by the military  (including drug traffickers) who provide material support to insurgent or  terrorist groups. Additionally, in December 2008, DOD clarified its policy  to allow the military to accompany and provide force protection to U.S.  and host nation law enforcement personnel on counternarcotics field  operations. DEA and DOD officials stated that these changes enabled  higher levels of interdiction operations in areas previously inaccessible  due to security problems. DEA conducted 82 interdiction operations in  Afghanistan during fiscal year 2009 (compared with 42 in fiscal year 2008),  often with support from U.S. military and other coalition forces. These  operations include, among other things, raiding drug laboratories;  destroying storage sites; arresting drug traffickers; conducting roadblock  operations; and seizing chemicals and drugs. The U.S. military and  International Security and Assistance Force are also targeting narcotics  trafficking and processing as part of regular counterinsurgency  operations. In addition, DEA efforts to build the Counternarcotics Police  of Afghanistan (CNPA) has contributed to the goals of heightening  security in Afghanistan. The DEA has worked with specialized units of the  CNPA to conduct investigations, build cases, arrest drug traffickers, and  conduct undercover drug purchases, while also working to build Afghan  law enforcement capacity by mentoring CNPA specialized units.

Several of our more recent recommendations  were aimed at improving two key management challenges that I have  discussed in my testimony today\u2014planning for the sustainment of  counternarcotics assets and assessing the effectiveness of  counternarcotics-related programs.", "Improved planning for sustainment of counternarcotics assets. In  our 2008 report on U.S. assistance to transit zone countries, we  recommended that the Secretary of State, in consultation with the  Secretary of Defense (1) develop a plan to ensure that partner nations in  the transit zone could effectively operate and maintain all  counternarcotics assets that the United States had provided, including  boats and other vehicles and equipment, for their remaining useful life and  (2) ensure that, before providing a counternarcotics asset to a partner  nation, agencies determined the total operations and maintenance cost  over its useful life and, with the recipient nation, develop a plan for  funding this cost.", "More consistent results reporting. In our report on U.S. assistance to  transit zone countries, we recommended that the Secretary of State, in  consultation with the Director of ONDCP, the Secretaries of Defense and  Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Administrator of  USAID, report the results of U.S.-funded counternarcotics initiatives more  comprehensively and consistently for each country in the annual  International Narcotics Control Strategy Report.", "Improved performance measures. Several agencies we reviewed did  not have sufficient performance measures in place to accurately assess the  effectiveness of counternarcotics programs. In our DOD report released  today, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take steps to improve  DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance measurement system by (1) revising  its performance measures, and (2) applying practices to better facilitate  the use of performance data to manage its counternarcotics activities. For  Colombia, we recommended that the Director of Foreign Assistance and  Administrator of USAID develop performance measurements that will help  USAID (1) assess whether alternative development assistance is reducing  the production of illicit narcotics, and (2) determine to what extent the  agency\u2019s alternative development projects are self-sustaining. The  existence of such measures would allow for a greater comprehension of  program effectiveness. For Afghanistan, we recommended that the  Secretary of Defense develop performance targets to measure interim  results of efforts to train the CNPA. We also recommended to the  Secretary of the State that measures and interim targets be adopted to  assess Afghan capacity to independently conduct public information  activities. Lastly, we recommended that the Secretary of State, in  consultation with the Administrator of DEA and the Attorney General,  establish clear definitions for low-, mid-, and high-level traffickers that  would improve the ability of the U.S. and Afghan governments to track the  level of drug traffickers arrested and convicted.", "In most cases, the agencies involved have generally agreed with our  recommendations and have either implemented them or have efforts  underway to address them.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the committee, this concludes my prepared  statement.
