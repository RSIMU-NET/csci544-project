According to a recent DOE estimate, the cleanup of contamination at over 7,000 sites\u2014at 15 major facilities (see fig. 1.1) and more than 100 smaller facilities across the nation\u2014will cost at least $300 billion (and perhaps as much as $1 trillion) and take more than 30 years to complete. Although DOE\u2019s predecessors and DOE long resisted environmental regulation, the Department committed itself at the end of the Cold War to achieving compliance with federal and state environmental laws and to establishing sound waste management practices for the future. DOE\u2019s primary mission is now to complete the single largest environmental program in history."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of DOE\u2019s Waste Management", "paragraphs": ["For more than 50 years, DOE and its predecessors focused on producing nuclear weapons, giving relatively low priority to managing waste, whether hazardous (toxic) or radioactive or both (mixed waste). Many people in DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons complex had been aware of the problems from the beginning, although they may have underestimated the severity of the hazards or the difficulty of cleaning up the contamination. During the Cold War years, when resources were constrained, production was generally given priority over waste management, barring an immediate safety hazard. Now, DOE\u2019s workforce is expected to give its highest attention to the cleanup activity that was long regarded as a secondary concern. At the Hanford Reservation in Washington State, for example, DOE\u2019s contractor generated radioactive waste without providing adequately for its disposal or control. Beginning in 1944, the contractor filled single-shell steel tanks with high-level radioactive liquids. In 1959, officials first identified leaks in the tanks. Since then, definite or possible leaks have been found in 67 out of 149 single-shell tanks. Estimates of leakage range between 670,000 and 900,000 gallons of waste. Starting in 1971, radioactive liquids were also placed in 28 double-shell tanks, whose walls have two layers of steel rather than one (see fig. 1.2). As of December 1992, no leaks had been detected in these tanks, but the wastes in six of them are potentially explosive.", "During the Cold War, DOE\u2019s predecessors and DOE operated in secrecy, largely without environmental guidelines. When environmental laws were enacted, starting in the 1970s, the energy agencies claimed exemption from both federal and state provisions on national security grounds. In 1984, however, a federal district court ruled that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) applied to nonradioactive hazardous waste at one of DOE\u2019s facilities. DOE accepted this ruling as applying to all of its nuclear facilities.", "Following the court\u2019s 1984 ruling, DOE\u2019s official policy called for full cooperation with federal and state environmental regulators, as well as full compliance not only with RCRA but also with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund), and other environmental requirements. DOE has acknowledged that its cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex is subject to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states.", "When the Cold War came to an end in 1989 and the demand for nuclear weapons declined, DOE declared a new mission for the Department\u2014compliance with environmental laws and the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites. To reconcile this new mission with the old weapons production mission, the previous administration undertook several initiatives: In June 1989, DOE announced a 10-point management plan to make production priorities and environment, safety, and health (ES&H) priorities compatible. The plan focused on (1) bringing facilities into compliance with federal, state, and local ES&H laws and regulations, as well as DOE orders; (2) strengthening safety, environmental protection, and waste management programs; (3) resetting priorities for incentives and awards paid to contractors by emphasizing ES&H requirements, including those associated with state and federal cleanup laws and compliance agreements; and (4) establishing a program under which teams of technical experts\u2014commonly called \u201cTiger Teams\u201d\u2014performed comprehensive assessments of compliance with ES&H requirements at DOE facilities. In August 1989, DOE released its first environmental restoration and waste management 5-year plan for the weapons complex. This plan set out an agenda for compliance with existing federal and state laws and outlined a 30-year goal for cleaning up all inactive waste sites. In the fall of 1989, DOE created the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management\u2014now known as the Office of Environmental Management\u2014to accomplish these goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Office of Environmental Management", "paragraphs": ["With the creation of the Office of Environmental Management (EM), DOE consolidated departmentwide responsibility for waste management and cleanup, giving this mission the attention of top-level management. EM has grown to spend over $6 billion a year\u2014nearly $1 of every $3 appropriated to DOE. Between 1989 and 1993, DOE received over $23 billion for environmental activities.", "EM is responsible for identifying and reducing risks and managing wastes at 137 facilities in 34 states and territories where weapons or nuclear energy research and production generated hazardous, radioactive, or mixed wastes. EM is also responsible for managing spent nuclear fuel, directing transportation and emergency response activities, controlling and accounting for materials, and ensuring safeguards and security. Finally, EM has site management responsibilities at four facilities where DOE formerly conducted nuclear operations. At the Hanford Reservation in Washington State, DOE produced plutonium at the world\u2019s first full-scale reactor; at the Fernald Environmental Management Project in Ohio and at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho, it produced uranium metals for weapons; and at the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado, it fabricated the triggers for nuclear weapons. EM may soon become responsible for cleaning up other DOE installations as they are shut down or decommissioned for other uses. In fiscal year 1996, EM will gain additional site management responsibilities at the Savannah River Site, where DOE produced tritium and plutonium and at the Mound and Pinellas plants, where DOE produced weapons components.", "EM is currently organized around four major activities: environmental restoration, waste management, facility transition and management, and technology development. EM has also given priority to strengthening its relationships with local communities and citizen review groups.", "Through the environmental restoration activity, for which $1.8 billion was made available for fiscal year 1994, DOE assesses and cleans up past environmental contamination. It decontaminates and decommissions permanently closed DOE facilities and cleans up soil and groundwater, seeking to eliminate or reduce risks to prescribed, safe levels.", "Through the waste management activity, for which $3 billion was made available for fiscal year 1994, DOE treats, stores, and disposes of all generated waste. The Department plans to dispose of highly radioactive defense waste in a proposed underground repository, while it intends to place less radioactive defense waste, contaminated with long-lived plutonium, in a repository called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, located near Carlsbad, New Mexico.", "Through the facility transition and management activity, for which $671 million was made available for fiscal year 1994, DOE plans and implements the final disposition of facilities that it no longer needs for its other operating programs. Because many of these facilities are contaminated with hazardous and/or radioactive materials, special controls and monitoring are necessary during and after closure to protect public health and the environment.", "Through the technology development activity, for which $397 million was made available for fiscal year 1994, DOE carries out applied research and development to focus, manage, and accelerate the development and implementation of new and existing technologies to meet specific requirements of the environmental restoration, waste management, and facility transition and management activities.", "The climate in which DOE now operates is more open and accountable to the Congress, state and federal regulators, environmental organizations, and community groups.

(The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 regulates both radioactive waste and the radioactive component of mixed waste.)", "RCRA requires a permit for a facility to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes. But before EPA or an authorized state can issue an operating permit for the facility, the facility must correct or plan to correct any release of hazardous materials, including any release from an inactive site.

Instead, federal agencies must pay for cleanups from their own or other appropriations. In addition, under CERCLA radioactive materials are considered hazardous substances.", "DOE\u2019s weapons facilities are subject to CERCLA\u2019s procedures, standards, and methods for identifying, assessing, and remedying releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The first phase of the remediation process is the preliminary assessment, during which DOE gathers readily available information on the extent of contamination at a facility so that EPA can determine whether emergency action is called for, additional investigation is needed, or no further action is necessary.", "If additional information is needed, the second phase begins and the site must be inspected. During this inspection, environmental samples are usually collected. If the results of the inspection reveal substantial contamination, EPA uses a hazard-ranking system to identify the site\u2019s potential hazard to the environment and public health; sites assigned a score of 28.5 or more may be added to the National Priorities List (NPL). Most of the facilities within DOE\u2019s weapons complex have been placed on the list or are being considered for listing. Currently, 19 DOE facilities are listed. Within 6 months of being listed, a facility\u2014in consultation with EPA\u2014must begin (1) a remedial investigation, which assesses the extent, nature, and potential risks of the contamination, and (2) a feasibility study, which evaluates various remedial alternatives. Within 180 days after EPA reviews the remedial investigation and feasibility study, officials at an NPL facility are required to enter an interagency agreement with EPA for remedial actions. DOE\u2019s policy has been to enter into agreements with regulators as soon as possible after a site has been placed on the NPL. If a DOE site is not on the NPL, CERCLA provides that state laws on removal and remedial actions shall apply.", "Interagency agreements provide for enforcement by the parties and citizens, penalties for failure to comply with the schedule or terms of the cleanup, and procedures for obtaining funds and resolving disputes. In addition, interagency agreements provide a means to integrate a facility\u2019s cleanup obligations under CERCLA and under RCRA.

Of 102 agreements signed since 1989, 22 have been completed or renegotiated, and 80 remain active.", "Both DOE and its regulators use agreements and milestones to set priorities and schedules at individual sites. In addition, DOE uses agreements in budgeting as a basis for requesting funding from the Congress for environmental management activities. DOE reports that about 80 percent of its cleanup budget is targeted to meet milestones and satisfy environmental regulations.", "Although DOE\u2014and, to a lesser extent, its regulators\u2014uses the number of milestones completed as a primary measure of its progress in performing agreements, milestones vary widely in their complexity and are often not comparable. For example, milestones range from completing studies or preparing reports to physically cleaning up contaminated areas. Furthermore, milestones are aggregated at some sites but not at others. Thus, at Hanford, one milestone requires DOE to complete six remedial investigations/feasibility studies per year, while at Rocky Flats, one milestone requires DOE to provide state regulators with a work plan for a remedial investigation/feasibility study of a single area or structure, called an operable unit, within the site.", "The scope of a cleanup agreement for an NPL site can be illustrated by the agreement addressing contamination at the Fernald Environmental Management Project, located near Fernald, Ohio. The cleanup of this 1,050-acre facility is organized around operable units that were defined on the basis of their location or their potential for the use of a similar cleanup technology. For each operable unit, a series of milestones defines activities that must be completed by certain dates. For example, one operable unit, which covers approximately 37 acres, includes a waste pit containing over 500,000 cubic yards of low-level radioactive waste and mixed waste. The milestones for this operable unit, which include conducting a feasibility study (to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment methods for stabilizing the waste) and preparing a draft record of decision (to document the chosen method of cleaning up this operable unit), were due to EPA in December 1994. Figure 1.3 shows the milestones associated with completing remedial investigations and feasibility studies for the entire facility.", "In addition to monitoring the number of agreements and milestones it has completed, DOE measures its progress in cleaning up sites by tracking the number of \u201cinterim actions\u201d it has taken. Unlike agreements and milestones, these actions are not negotiated with regulators but are planned by DOE to deal with immediate problems encountered in long-range projects. Examples of interim actions include removing asbestos from a reactor building at Idaho, applying herbicide to prevent the movement of contaminated tumbleweed at Hanford, adding security patrols at Oak Ridge to prevent the theft of contaminated scrap at a quarry, and posting radiological signs at Fernald."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objective of this report was to identify factors that hamper progress in the cleanup of DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.

They completed their revisions in January 1994, after 9 months of negotiation. Among other things, the new agreement emphasizes setting aggressive schedules to deal with urgent risks, striving to lower the cost of the cleanup by $1 billion over the next 5 years, and creating new opportunities for public involvement. The regulators allowed DOE to delay some of its milestones in return for a commitment to act more aggressively to reduce the greatest safety risks. The new agreement reflects revised views about the relative seriousness of different waste problems and the realization that new technologies for treating waste are more difficult to develop than originally anticipated. The agreement has been praised by federal and state officials as well as some public interest groups.", "However, even the revised milestones may not be realistic. In September 1994, the Washington State Department of Ecology expressed increasing concern over the pace of DOE\u2019s implementation of the tank waste remediation system.

Regulators, however, have often viewed agreements as less subject to change. At Hanford, for example, DOE saw the original tri-party agreement as a general framework for cleanup, while the state and EPA considered its milestones as enforceable.

According to some waste policy experts, having trusting relationships with regulators is one of the most important indicators of a well-managed cleanup operation. At Oak Ridge, for example, where a measure of trust has existed between DOE and its regulators, EPA was willing to consider any reasonable proposals for altering scheduled milestones when it found deficiencies in a remedial investigation report that DOE submitted. Acknowledging that DOE might not have anticipated the need for additional fieldwork and reports, EPA extended DOE\u2019s schedule. At Rocky Flats, however, where the relationship between DOE and its regulators has been more demanding, EPA and the state of Colorado agreed to extend an initial deadline but not to postpone subsequent deadlines. Although the regulators viewed this approach as reasonable, given the extended period of time between milestones, DOE officials said that it forced them to spend time applying for extensions that should have been spent performing technical work.

When it found that it did not have sufficient funds to complete a costly, high-priority milestone on schedule, it decided to perform several less costly, low-priority milestones instead. Specifically, in March 1993, it developed work plans for several sites at Rocky Flats rather than complete the draft of an investigation/inspection report that was due as part of its interagency agreement with EPA and the state of Colorado. To complete the draft, it would have had to conduct expensive fieldwork to assess the extent to which soil and groundwater had been contaminated by the leakage of hazardous and radioactive materials from drums stored at the site during the 1950s and 1960s. According to a DOE manager at Rocky Flats, \u201cWe have been driven to maximize the number of milestones we meet.\u201d The regulators, however, were not satisfied with DOE\u2019s substitution of quantity for quality; they faulted DOE for mismanagement and recommended a penalty. According to the regulators, DOE unilaterally decided which milestones to meet and which to miss, without discussing priorities with them or acknowledging that it could not complete all of the milestones on schedule. \u201cIf DOE had discussed the problem with us, possibly we could have found a solution to the problem and possibly we could not have, but with DOE\u2019s approach we never had the opportunity to try,\u201d said a state regulator.", "At 22 projects throughout the weapons complex, DOE has agreed to implement a groundwater remediation technique called \u201cpump and treat.\u201d This technique\u2014which involves pumping contaminated water out of the ground, treating it to remove hazardous and other constituents, and then discharging the treated water to the surface or injecting it back into the ground\u2014is commonly a part of EPA and state groundwater cleanup strategies because it is often the only technique available for attempting to remove contamination from groundwater.

But unless DOE is able to renegotiate its unrealistic agreements\u2014with or without a national strategy\u2014then the Congress may have to consider alternatives to the present cleanup structure.", "In 1989, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce proposed that a national commission be established to recommend to the President and the Congress (1) a process for setting national priorities for environmental remediation activities at DOE\u2019s nuclear facilities and (2) sources and methods of funding those activities, among other things. At that time, we testified that \u201cinformation and recommendations developed by the commission could help to clarify issues and form the basis for a national consensus in developing a comprehensive approach to cleaning up DOE\u2019s facilities.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Cleaning up contamination at DOE\u2019s facilities will not be easy because the risks to public health and the environment are large, the solutions to some problems are as yet unknown, the relationships between DOE and its stakeholders are often strained, and the gaps between the costs of the cleanups and the funds available for them are wide. The Congress has warned DOE that future funding levels may not meet all of the Department\u2019s existing commitments and that risk-based priorities should be established for cleanups.", "To its credit, DOE has begun to collect the data needed to evaluate and compare risks at each site and to identify milestones that may require renegotiation. Using these data, DOE and its stakeholders can begin to balance environmental risks with available cleanup resources across sites. Although DOE\u2019s past efforts to reach agreement with regulators and the public on nationwide priorities have not succeeded, recent progress in forging working relationships with stakeholders and accomplishing environmental goals at some sites suggest some opportunity for success in the future.", "If DOE cannot renegotiate unrealistic milestones and attain a higher level of progress, alternatives to the present cleanup program may have to be considered. Both the Office of Technology Assessment and the former chief of DOE\u2019s cleanup program have argued that DOE alone cannot make progress in cleaning up the weapons complex.

Given expected budgetary shortfalls, DOE needs a process for allocating limited funds among sites. Currently, DOE does not compare the risks at one site with those at another. We believe that DOE can allocate its cleanup budget effectively only if it has current information for comparing risks across sites.", "Following the administration\u2019s recent announcement of changes in budgetary priorities, DOE advised us, in a second letter, that it would be seeking to renegotiate milestones in existing agreements as we recommended.
