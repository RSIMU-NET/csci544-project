In that report, we noted that  the United States faces an extremely challenging national security  environment. At the same time, it is grappling with addressing an  unsustainable fiscal situation in which DOD accounts for approximately  half of the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending. As DOD faces  this environment, it is working both to rebuild the readiness of its current  forces and to modernize to meet future threats. Since we issued that  report in 2017, DOD released a new National Defense Strategy in  January 2018 that prioritizes the long-term challenges posed by highly  capable adversaries and emphasizes the need to rebuild readiness.", "This statement provides information on the Army\u2019s progress in rebuilding  readiness and some of the challenges it faces in the areas of (1) force  structure and personnel, (2) equipment repair and modernization of the  force, including warfighting concepts, and (3) training for potential large- scale conflict.

The prior work that we drew from examined a range of issues related to  Army readiness, including the Army\u2019s sustainable readiness process,  force structure changes, cyber training, the Patriot missile system, depot  maintenance, acquisition, and requirements development. To perform  our prior work, we analyzed Army readiness, personnel, maintenance,  acquisition, and training data, and interviewed cognizant Army officials  involved in operations and requirements development. In addition, we  issued several classified reports since 2016 examining some of these  issues and made recommendations to the Army. The statement also  includes updates to information as of February 2019 as appropriate,  based on Army documentation and discussions with Army officials.

In response, DOD has made rebuilding the readiness of the  military forces a top priority. The 2018 National Defense Strategy states  that the central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security is the  reemergence of long-term, strategic competition with China and Russia.  Further, the strategy stresses that restoring and retaining readiness for  large-scale combat is critical to success in this emerging security  environment. Nevertheless, DOD reported that readiness of the total  military force remains low and has remained so since 2013. In June 2017,  we found that Army readiness goals and timelines for rebuilding  readiness are not clear for all portions of the force, especially for the  reserve component, although the Army is making progress in these  areas.", "Across the department, DOD has made progress in developing a plan to  rebuild the readiness of the military force, with the military services  providing regular input on the status of their readiness recovery efforts.  In August 2018, we reported that the Office of the Secretary of Defense  developed a Readiness Recovery Framework that the department is  using to guide the services\u2019 efforts, and plans and to regularly assess,  validate, and monitor readiness recovery. The Office of the Secretary of  Defense and the services have recently revised readiness goals and  accompanying recovery strategies, metrics, and milestones to align with  the 2018 National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance.  According to The Army Strategy, the Army projects that it will reach its  readiness goals by 2022, at which point its priority is expected to shift to  modernization. We have ongoing work assessing DOD\u2019s progress in  achieving its overall readiness goals in each of five warfighting domains:  ground, sea, air, space, and cyberspace.", "The number one stated goal of Army leadership is readiness, including  recovering the readiness lost from years of sustained conflict while  preparing for potential large-scale combat operations against a global  competitor such as Russia or China. These efforts are occurring in a  challenging context that requires DOD to make difficult decisions  regarding how best to address continuing operational demands while  preparing for future challenges. An important aspect of this, across all of  the military services, is determining an appropriate balance between  maintaining and upgrading legacy weapon systems currently in  operational use, and modernizing to ensure the ability to outpace  advancing competitors. Our work has shown that the Army has improved  ground force readiness in recent years; however, the Army has also  identified capability shortcomings in its weapon systems and platforms  that have yet to be addressed through its modernization efforts.", "In an effort to achieve higher, more consistent levels of readiness over  longer time periods, the Army is implementing a redesigned way to  generate forces called the sustainable readiness concept. A key part of  the concept includes determining readiness objectives by unit type, which  are developed by comparing the numbers of key unit types against  planned and potential warfighting demands. In addition, since 2014 the  Army has invested significantly in stocks of warfighting equipment that are  being stored in Europe, and has begun deploying armored formations to  the continent on a continuous basis for training and exercises to enhance  its readiness against potential Russian aggression.", "As the Army works to rebuild and sustain higher readiness of its current  force, the service is moving to update its doctrine, equipment, and  formations to conduct operations in a more complex warfighting  environment. The Army believes that it must be able to operate not only  on land against potential adversaries, but also have the capability to act  against them in other domains, namely air, sea, cyber, and space. The  new Army Operating Concept, published in December 2018, describes  how the Army would operate in a \u201cmulti-domain\u201d environment. It identifies  readiness as being key to deterring aggression from potential adversaries  and, should conflict occur, addresses how Army forces would operate in  multiple domains to penetrate anti-access and area denial systems. To  support this concept, the Army\u2019s modernization strategy aims to build the  next generation of weapon systems and platforms that are more agile,  lethal, resilient, and sustainable on the future battlefield.

The Army  stated that at this level it could execute the National Defense Strategy,  but at significant risk. Army leadership testified in March 2015 that if there  were further end strength reductions, the Army would not be able to  execute the defense strategic guidance. We reported in 2016 that the  Army needed to assess the risks associated with the planned reductions  and better document its force-planning process. The Army concurred with  both of our recommendations, changed the way it assessed risk, and  made adjustments to its force structure based on these assessments.", "After our 2016 report, Congress partly reversed these planned reductions  by authorizing end-strength increases in fiscal years 2017 through 2019.  The principal increase occurred in 2017, when Congress authorized an  end strength of 1.018 million uniformed personnel, or 28,000 more than  the Army had planned for that year.

Also, to support  combat forces during a conflict, the Army is activating additional combat  sustainment formations that are responsible for supply, distribution, and  transportation.

The goal of Army leadership is to fill operational units to  100 percent by the end of fiscal year 2019, and 105 percent by the end of  fiscal year 2020. However, in preparing this statement we found that, in  three of the past four years, the Army has fallen short of meeting its  overall end strength authorizations. Army officials told us that these  differences from the authorized end strength fall under the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s authority to reduce the end strengths by a certain amount.  Moreover, these officials added that in 2015 and 2016, the Army was  drawing down end strength and planning further reductions. However, the  Army fell short of its end strength authorization by 0.38 percent in 2017,  and fell short again by 2.56 percent in 2018. The percentage differences  between authorized and actual end strength for the total Army, from 2015  through 2018, are summarized in figure 2.", "As we prepared this statement, Army officials told us that the primary  reason why it has struggled to meet its authorized end strength is  because it has had difficulty meeting recruiting goals, which have  negatively affected the Army\u2019s ability to expand the force. For example,  Army officials told us the Army was short of its goal for 2018 by 6,500  new recruits for the regular Army. Army officials told us that the Army  does not expect to be able to achieve its authorized end strength for fiscal  year 2019. Looking ahead, the Army is considering revisions to its  expansion plans and now expects to reach a new end strength goal by  2025.", "In addition to challenges in meeting authorized end strength, our past and  ongoing work indicates that the Army faces challenges in filling and  maintaining key skills in a number of areas, and in managing the time  Army personnel spend away from their home station. Both of these  challenges can negatively affect readiness. For example:", "Accelerated activation of Security Force Assistance Brigades led  to manning challenges. In December 2018, we reported that the  Army\u2019s decision to deploy the first security force assistance brigade 8  months earlier than planned posed challenges to manning the unit.  The Army currently plans to activate up to six of these brigades (one  in the U.S. Army National Guard) by the end of fiscal year 2019. The  Army views the Security Force Assistance Brigades to be critical to  restoring the readiness of its combat forces. Prior to their formation,  the Army met security force assistance missions by, among other  things, pulling senior leaders and other personnel with specific ranks  and skills from active-duty brigades, which compromised their  readiness for large-scale combat.", "The Army has had difficulty filling new cyber and electronic  warfare units. During our ongoing work, we have found that the Army  has had difficulty filling new formations with personnel to conduct  operations in the cyber domain, including electronic warfare.  In  October 2018, the Army activated part of a Multi-Domain Task Force,  which is focused on intelligence, information, cyber, electronic  warfare, and space missions and is being used in major exercises in  the Pacific region. However, Army headquarters officials told us that  the Army activated the unit as a pilot, or a test, unit and with an  accelerated timeline to learn how the new formation should be  structured, equipped, and trained. Based on our ongoing work, filling  the unit with personnel with the right skills has been a slow process.  Near the end of January 2019 the unit was staffed at 50 percent, and  the Army projects it will reach 75 percent by August 2019, according  to Army headquarters officials. The officials added that many of the  shortages are in senior level and cyber positions. Meanwhile, Army  documentation obtained during our ongoing work shows that the  service is considering options for creating more task forces for other  regions. Additionally, there are plans for new cyber and electronic  warfare force structure supporting Brigade Combat Teams. Army  officials stated that these will be fielded in an accelerated manner as  well, adding that filling these units could be challenging because cyber  personnel are in high demand. Army headquarters officials said they  are exploring options to address the challenges.", "Army depots have had difficulty filling and maintaining critical  skills in their workforces. For our December 2018 report, officials  told us that Army depots experienced consistent challenges in hiring  critical personnel. Also, we reported that workload fluctuations usually  resulted in too little workload to maintain proficiency in certain skills.  For example, we reported that a hiring freeze at Corpus Christi Army  Depot in 2017 caused shortages of civilian flight test pilots, who are  responsible for test flights before returning aircraft to service after  maintenance. The Army, however, had not assessed how effective  the depots have been at hiring, training, and retaining the critical skills  of their workforce. We recommended that the Army do this, as  personnel challenges such as these have affected depots\u2019 ability to  meet mission requirements and created maintenance delays for some  equipment. The Army concurred with our recommendation and stated  that it would assess the effectiveness of the depots\u2019 hiring, training,  and retention programs to ensure Army requirements are met and  critical skills are maintained.", "The Army has had difficulty manning ballistic missile defense  units. As we reported in October 2017, the Army\u2019s Patriot and  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile  defense forces have been in high demand for many years. Army  officials told us at the time that with reductions in end strength, the  Army in 2016 stopped its practice of assigning extra personnel to  these units to ensure operational requirements would be met. Army  officials stated that the high aptitude standards and specialized nature  of operating Patriot and THAAD systems reduced the number of  eligible recruits. Officials also stated that enlistment shortfalls could  have long-term effects on these forces\u2019 operations and career  development. Since we issued our report, Army officials told us that  fewer-than-expected new recruits had advanced into Patriot and  THAAD career fields in 2018, but the Army was forecasting  improvements.", "High personnel tempos can negatively affect personnel. In 2018,  we reported that the pace of operations has had a negative effect on  Army readiness, including Brigade Combat Teams and Combat  Aviation Brigades. We also reported that managing personnel  tempo\u2014the amount of time that individual service members spend  away from home on official duties\u2014had been a persistent challenge  for the Army. In 2015, the Army issued a regulation identifying a  personnel tempo threshold for its service members, but officials told  us that the threshold is not enforced and stated the regulation was  published only to emphasize that personnel tempo data was a priority.  We found that personnel tempo data collected by DOD was  incomplete. However, we estimated from the data that at least 41  percent of Army service members who were away from their home  station in fiscal year 2016 were away for more than 7 months.  Because time away from home can stress the force, we  recommended that DOD or the Army take steps to clarify and follow  personnel tempo guidance on thresholds, and also take steps to  emphasize the collection of complete and reliable personnel tempo  data to allow monitoring.

In  April 2018, the Army published its Army Modernization Strategy, which  identified six priorities that are key to operationalizing multi-domain  operations, including long-range precision fires and next generation  combat vehicles, as shown in table 1. All six of these priorities involve  modernizing equipment and/or acquiring new equipment with improved  capabilities.", "The Army has identified the need to make changes to how it develops  and acquires new weapons systems.

As we reported in May 2016, officials from different Army  entities disagreed about which documents constituted their guidance  for implementing retrograde and reset, suggesting that there was  confusion about the Army\u2019s strategies for these activities. We  recommended that the Army develop an implementation plan for its  retrograde and reset efforts. In August 2018, however, we reported  that the Army did not have plans to act on this recommendation.  According to one official, this was because guidance and plans are  adjusted based on the unique circumstances of each situation.  Given the Army\u2019s drawdown of equipment used during operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan is coming to a close, we continue to believe that  an implementation plan for retrograde and reset of equipment used  during any future operations would help ensure that the Army more  consistently and effectively budgets for and distributes resources.", "The Army has not comprehensively assessed the causes of reset  maintenance delays for Patriot equipment, which can limit unit  training time. In June 2018, we reported that of seven Patriot  battalions undergoing reset in fiscal years 2014 through 2017, only  one received all of its equipment back from depot maintenance within  the Army\u2019s policy of 180 days, as shown in figure 3.", "Since delays in returning equipment to units can reduce units\u2019 training  time, we recommended that the Army analyze the various factors  affecting reset delays\u2014such as equipment arriving late to the depot,  supply chain delays, and worker errors\u2014to identify their relative  importance and inform corrective actions. The Army concurred with our  recommendation, stating that it will identify and address factors that may  affect reset timeliness.", "The Army\u2019s near-term modernization efforts face management  challenges. In September 2018, we reported that the Army had not  established processes for evaluating its modernization efforts against  its overarching objective of outpacing rapidly advancing competitors,  such as Russia or China. Also, we found that the Army had not fully  estimated the costs of its near-term modernization efforts. Further,  we found that the Army\u2019s April 2018 modernization strategy report set  near-term goals for closing critical capability gaps and a longer term,  overarching objective of being able to decisively defeat major  adversaries. The strategy also identified the cost of key modernization  investments through fiscal year 2023, but did not discuss tens of  billions in already-programmed modernization-related investments, or  describe how the funding would support upgrades for existing weapon  systems. Moreover, the strategy did not disclose the extent to which  the Army had relied on Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)  appropriations for upgrading weapon systems. Army officials told us at  the time that the Army had been preparing to analyze its efforts to  address specific warfighting capability gaps, but had not decided on  an overall evaluation approach. Additionally, officials told us that the  Army planned to reflect its analysis of near-term modernization  investments in the fiscal year 2020 budget submission. We  recommended that the Army (1) develop a plan to finalize the  processes for evaluating how its near-term investments contribute to  the Army\u2019s ability to decisively defeat a major adversary, and (2)  finalize its cost analysis of near-term investments and report those  costs to Congress. The Army concurred with our recommendations.", "The Army has been unable to ensure that requirements for new  warfighting capabilities are feasible. In June 2017, we reported that  the Army had prioritized combat readiness and rebuilding force  structure over resourcing its requirements development process to  meet future readiness needs. We reported that even though the  Army made some improvements in this area, officials were unable to  ensure requirements for major defense acquisition programs were  well-informed and feasible because of workforce constraints. For  example, we found that the Army\u2019s requirements development  workforce declined by 22 percent from 2008 to 2017, with some  requirements development centers reporting more significant  reductions. In that report, we recommended that the Army assess the  resources necessary for the requirements development process and  determine whether shortfalls can be addressed given other funding  priorities.

Additionally,  we identified steps the Army had taken to make these requirements  less burdensome. We reported, for example, that the Army had  delegated authority to two-star commanders to exempt units, as  needed, from certain mandatory training. We reported that the Army  had begun to lock in a unit\u2019s planned training six weeks in advance, in  an effort to protect units from external tasks that could affect training  schedules of brigades and their subordinate units. The early setting of  training schedules was intended to prevent an external task from  interfering with that training. We did not make any recommendations  related to reducing mandatory training; however; since we completed  our work, the Secretary of the Army has directed the elimination of  numerous individual training requirements, such as eliminating certain  requirements to train in avoiding accidents, and other administrative  tasks, such as maintaining a physical reference library of corrosion  prevention and control publications.", "The Army is making better use of virtual devices to train and  prepare units. In the same 2016 report, we identified a number of  challenges the Army faced in using virtual training devices to help  units prepare for major conflict. Using such devices is important  because of the challenges of training for combat in a live environment,  such as limited range availability and resource constraints. We  reported that the Army had taken some steps to improve the  integration of virtual training devices into its operational training.  However, our work identified several factors that limited the Army\u2019s  ability to conduct training with virtual training devices, including  outdated virtual training policies, a lack of guidance for analyzing the  effectiveness of virtual training devices, and the need to better  integrate devices in training strategies. As of January 2019, the Army  has implemented two of the three recommendations we made in our  report. Specifically, the Army published a training analysis best- practices guide, analyzed virtual training devices\u2019 effectiveness, and  analyzed regular Army formations\u2019 readiness training models, among  other steps to implement these recommendations. Additionally, the  Army further plans to modify its policy on virtual training devices in  2021, which would require that training developers consider the  amount of time available to train with or expected usage rates of new  virtual training devices. Further, in preparing this statement, Army  officials told us that the Army has used acquisition authorities  provided by Congress to prototype new technologies to replace  existing simulators. It is investing in these prototypes based on the  usage rates of the older training equipment, and at the same time  involving operational forces in the prototyping for their feedback and  to help inform requirements.", "The Army is taking some steps to improve its Pacific Pathways  initiative. In November 2016, we reported on an initiative, known as  Pacific Pathways, intended to strengthen relationships with allies and  build readiness by combining certain exercises with partner nations.  The Army began the Pacific Pathways initiative\u2014which deploys a  battalion-size task force to the Asia-Pacific region to conduct multiple  exercises over 90 days\u2014as a way of building the readiness of its  participating units. We found that the size and complexity of the  operations under Pacific Pathways created potentially unique training  opportunities for supporting units\u2014such as transportation units\u2014to  exercise the capabilities they would be required to provide in a  contingency. However, we found that the Army could improve its  approach by fully synchronizing Army plans, stakeholders, and  objectives into the exercises. The Army has implemented two of the  recommendations that we made in our report to modify processes and  guidance so that stakeholders are integrated into the planning, and  also to seek and incorporate the training objectives of supporting  units.

In January 2017, we reported that the  Army\u2019s UAS pilot training strategy did not account for some  challenges the Army faced, such as a lack of adequate training  facilities and limited available airspace. The Army used flexibilities to  overcome some of these challenges, but at the time of our report it  was too early to tell whether these flexibilities would be enough to  overcome training shortfalls. In addition, we found that the way the  Army assessed whether service members were good candidates for  UAS pilot training could have been improved. For example, we  reported that the Army used only 3 of the 78 identified competencies  that an Army-Air Force research team identified as \u201cmoderately,\u201d  \u201chighly,\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d for UAS pilots. We made  recommendations on these issues, and DOD partially concurred,  stating that although the actions we recommended were prudent or  already an integral part of workforce management, additional Army  guidance would be unnecessary.", "Fielding and deploying new types of units can pose challenges  to training. The accelerated pace at which the Army is creating new  units can pose challenges to training and readiness. As previously  discussed, the Army is activating new units to sustain readiness and  to operate in a more complex environment. However, the Army\u2019s  approach can pose training challenges, and negatively affect  readiness. Also, our ongoing work indicates that the Army is fielding  new cyber units at an accelerated pace, resulting in the units not  having either fully trained personnel or the equipment to conduct  training, according to Army officials. For example, the Army is  planning to add uniformed personnel who specialize in cyber  operations to its combat units and as part of newly established Multi- Domain Task Forces, but there is not yet a clear understanding of the  tasks they will have to perform or an updated training strategy to  support them, according to Army officials. Army officials stated that  this will affect the readiness of the units to perform their missions, but  they are taking steps to clarify and update these issues.  - - - - -  In sum, while the Army has made progress in rebuilding readiness, it  continues to face challenges meeting its goals. Moreover, the Army will  need to balance the readiness of its existing force with plans to grow and  modernize. We have made 44 recommendations that the Army has  generally concurred with; the Army has implemented 7 of them, and taken  actions to begin implementing many others. These recommendations  provide a partial roadmap to address important readiness challenges, and  implementing our recommendations to improve the management of  personnel, equipment maintenance, and training would help the Army  meet current threats and assist it as it refocuses on readiness for large- scale combat operations. In addition, sustained management attention  and continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the  Army demonstrates progress in addressing its personnel, equipment, and  training challenges.", "Chairman Sullivan, Ranking Member Kaine, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
