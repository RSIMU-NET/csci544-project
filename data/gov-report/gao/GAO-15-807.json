For example, the Guidelines require agencies to document certain information when authorizing an informant to participate in an activity that would otherwise be considered illegal (e.g., purchasing illegal drugs from someone who is the target of a drug-trafficking investigation). DEA, USMS, ICE, USCG, and USSS do not fully address the requirements to provide the informant with written instructions about the authorized activity and require signed acknowledgment from the informant. Without such documentation, if an informant engages in an activity that exceeds the scope of the authorization, the agency may not be able to demonstrate that the informant's actions were not authorized, thereby limiting the agency's ability to prosecute the informant for the unauthorized illegal activity.", "The DOJ and DHS components that oversaw the most informants in fiscal year 2013\u2014the FBI, DEA, ICE, and USSS\u2014have monitoring processes in place to help ensure that agents are complying with their respective components' policies. Such monitoring activities include supervisory reviews, as well as headquarters inspections and self-inspections within the field offices. These agencies also use administrative tools, such as standardized forms, that cover the requirements in their policies and help ensure that agents capture necessary information. However, as noted above, some components' policies do not fully address the procedures in the Guidelines, and as a result, the components' monitoring processes likewise do not assess compliance with those procedures in the Guidelines. Consequently, agencies may not have reasonable assurance that they are complying with procedures established in the Guidelines to address the risks associated with using informants.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in March 2015.

Because of some informants\u2019 past  involvement in criminal activities or organizations, the informants often  have access to, or status in, such organizations and are uniquely situated  to provide useful and credible information to law enforcement agencies  regarding criminal activities. For example, an agency may need to  cultivate and use an informant who has a history with a drug cartel to  obtain information about the cartel\u2019s plans for trafficking illegal  substances. The information the informant provides may be critical to an  investigation, but problems can occur if an agency fails to exercise  appropriate oversight over the informant and the informant\u2019s activities. For  example, if an informant engages in unauthorized illegal activity, this  could undermine the credibility of the informant\u2019s testimony or role in an  investigation or give the impression that the government has condoned  the informant\u2019s illegal actions. Recent media reports have highlighted  concerns about agencies\u2019 judgment and oversight in instances where law  enforcement agencies have worked with informants with a known criminal  history or who have allegedly committed crimes while working as  informants.", "Law enforcement agencies in the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and  Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014such as the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), among others\u2014rely on the  use of informants as one of many investigative tools at the agencies\u2019  disposal.", "To help ensure appropriate oversight of informants, The Attorney  General\u2019s Guidelines (also referred to as the Guidelines in this report) set  forth detailed procedures and review mechanisms to ensure that law  enforcement agencies exercise their authorities appropriately and with  adequate oversight. In 1976, DOJ developed the first set of Guidelines\u2014 Use of Informants in Domestic Security, Organized Crime, and Other  Criminal Investigations\u2014following congressional hearings and published  reports criticizing the FBI\u2019s domestic surveillance activities in the 1950s  and 1960s. Since then, DOJ has revised the Guidelines three times  (1980, 2001, and 2002). The Guidelines include provisions for ensuring  that informants are considered suitable for their role in a criminal  investigation (vetting) and for overseeing informants\u2019 illegal activities.  Adherence to the Guidelines is mandatory for DOJ law enforcement  agencies and federal prosecuting offices, including the U.S. Attorneys\u2019  Offices, but it is not explicitly mandatory for DHS agencies. However,  according to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, federal prosecutors  expect all federal agencies, including DHS component agencies, to  adhere to the Guidelines to ensure the credibility of any informant  witnesses used in the cases the U.S. Attorneys prosecute, as well as the  sufficiency of evidence that informants contribute to a case.", "You requested that we examine DOJ\u2019s and DHS\u2019s use of confidential  informants.

ICE deemed some of the information in the prior report law  enforcement sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure.  Therefore, this report omits sensitive information regarding findings from  DOJ and DHS agencies\u2019 internal inspection reports. Otherwise, this report  addresses the same questions and uses the same overall methodology  as the sensitive report.", "For this report, we reviewed the policies and processes for the eight DOJ  and DHS component agencies that used confidential informants in fiscal  year 2013, the most recent year for which data were available. The DOJ  agencies included in our review are the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives (ATF); DEA; the FBI; and the U.S. Marshals  Service (USMS). The DHS agencies are U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), ICE, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the U.S.  Secret Service (USSS). We conducted interviews with officials  responsible for overseeing these agencies\u2019 respective informant  programs, as well as an attorney adviser from the Executive Office for  U.S. Attorneys because the U.S. Attorneys are responsible for  prosecuting cases for these agencies, including cases that involve the  use of informants.", "To address our first objective, we assessed the eight agencies\u2019 informant  policies against provisions in the Guidelines regarding vetting informants  or overseeing informants\u2019 illegal activities. Our assessment determined  whether agencies\u2019 policies meet the minimum criteria established in the  Guidelines but did not determine whether agencies\u2019 policies exceeded the  requirements in the Guidelines. Appendix I provides additional information  about our scope and methodology, including additional information about  our assessment, and appendixes II and III provide listings of the  provisions we assessed regarding vetting informants and overseeing  informants\u2019 illegal activities, respectively. For each agency, we also  interviewed officials responsible for overseeing the agency\u2019s informant  programs about policies and processes for vetting informants and  overseeing informants\u2019 illegal activities. We also reviewed guidance from  and interviewed representatives of DOJ headquarters offices (Office of  the Deputy Attorney General and Criminal Division) and DHS  headquarters offices (Office of Policy, Office of the Chief Security Officer,  and Office of General Counsel).", "To address our second objective, we analyzed monitoring processes at  four component agencies\u2014two from DOJ, and two from DHS. Out of  DOJ\u2019s total of four component agencies, we selected DEA and the FBI for  analysis because these agencies used the most confidential informants in  fiscal year 2013. Likewise, out of DHS\u2019s total of four component agencies,  we selected ICE and USSS for analysis for the same reason. We  compared agencies\u2019 internal review mechanisms and processes against  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We analyzed  documentation from agencies\u2019 monitoring processes, including examples  of inspection checklists, inspection reports, and corrective action reports.  We did not review a representative sample of monitoring documents;  however, the documents we reviewed demonstrate the structure of  agencies\u2019 monitoring processes, such as what is covered in inspections,  that allowed us to compare these monitoring processes against federal  internal control standards. We visited these agencies\u2019 field division  locations in three cities that we selected based on the number of  informants these agencies oversaw in those locations and geographical  diversity. At these 12 locations, we interviewed managerial and  supervisory agents regarding how they oversee and monitor the use of  confidential informants, and we analyzed supporting documentation,  such as supervisory checklists. The results of the site visits are not  generalizable to all field divisions, but provided important observations  and insights into how these agencies oversee the use of informants using  standardized, agency-wide methods and locally developed approaches.  We also interviewed attorneys at each of the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices  located in the same cities as the agency field offices we visited to obtain  the prosecutors\u2019 perspectives regarding the role of the Guidelines in  supporting prosecution.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2013 to March 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Additionally, the Guidelines require that  agents address these same factors through continuing suitability reviews  that are to occur at least annually. A first-line supervisor approves the  written initial and continuing suitability reports that the agent prepares and  ensures that new continuing suitability reports are completed when  information becomes available that could materially affect a prior  suitability determination. Upon registering an informant and every year  thereafter, the agent, along with another government official who must be  present as a witness, is required to review written instructions with the  informant to convey the scope of the informant\u2019s authority, the limits on  assurances of confidentiality, prohibitions against certain types of illegal  activity, and the possible consequences of violating these conditions.", "These instructions and the accompanying documentation are to ensure  that the constraints within which the informant is to operate are clear and  well documented so that unnecessary risk does not result.

Gonzalez was masterminding a scheme that  involved the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card  numbers from numerous U.S. retailers.

Such conduct is termed \u201cotherwise illegal activity.\u201d According to the DOJ  Office of the Inspector General, authorizing informants to engage in  otherwise illegal activity can facilitate their usefulness as a source of  information to the government but may also have adverse or unforeseen  consequences. For example, the informant\u2019s participation in authorized  otherwise illegal activity could hinder prosecution of the informant\u2019s  coconspirators by prompting, for example, defenses of public authority or  entrapment. Agency officials in field offices are responsible for  documenting authorization and oversight of otherwise illegal activity, in  some cases in consultation with the appropriate local chief federal  prosecutor.", "The Guidelines include certain requirements when authorizing otherwise  illegal activity and restrictions on the types of activities an agency can  authorize, as shown in figure 1. In particular, agencies must authorize the  activity in advance, in writing, and for a specified period not to exceed 90  days. Additionally, the authorizing official must document certain findings  as to why it is necessary for the informant to engage in the activity and  assess whether the benefits to be obtained from the activity outweigh the  risks. The Guidelines also prohibit agencies from authorizing an informant  to participate in an act of violence, obstruction of justice, and other  enumerated unlawful activities. After an agency authorizes an informant  to engage in otherwise illegal activity, the case agent or control agent,  along with another government official acting as a witness, must review  with the informant additional instructions addressing the scope and limits  of the otherwise illegal activity.", "According to the Guidelines, agents are to instruct informants that they  may be prosecuted for any unauthorized illegal activity. However,  informants who are prosecuted for such conduct may claim in defense  that the government authorized or immunized their crimes. To address  this concern, if an agency has grounds to believe that an informant has  engaged in unauthorized illegal activity, the Guidelines require the agency  to notify a federal prosecutor of the suspected activity and the individual\u2019s  status as an informant. The Guidelines require the federal prosecutor and  the agency\u2019s local special agent in charge to consult and concur  regarding whether to notify state and local authorities about the  individual\u2019s participation in illegal activity or the individual\u2019s status as an  informant.

As a result,  these agencies do not have policies that explicitly inform their agents of  all the activities and safeguards that the Guidelines outline for minimizing  the risks involved with using informants. Implementation of the processes  in the Guidelines helps increase the likelihood that informants will not  engage in criminal activity that may be detrimental to the agency or the  general public, thereby preventing issues with informants that agencies  have experienced in the past.", "Written, advance authorization of otherwise illegal activity: As  depicted in table 1, three of the agencies\u2019 policies (USMS, USCG, and  USSS) do not have any content that addresses the Guidelines\u2019  requirement to authorize otherwise illegal activity in advance, in writing,  and for a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days. Furthermore,  three of the agencies\u2019 policies (USMS, USCG, and USSS) do not require  officials to document why the agency needs the informant to engage in  the otherwise illegal activity\u2014for example, that the informant\u2019s role in the  activity would obtain information that is not otherwise reasonably  available or that it would prevent injury or significant damage to property.  These same agencies, along with DEA and ICE, are partially consistent  or not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 requirements to provide written  instructions to the informant regarding the parameters of the authorized  otherwise illegal activity and to have the informant sign an  acknowledgment of these instructions.", "Suspension or revocation of authorization for otherwise illegal  activity: Furthermore, as depicted in table 2, five agencies (DEA, USMS,  ICE, USSS, and USCG) do not have policies that are consistent with  some or all of the Guidelines\u2019 provisions regarding the suspension or  revocation of authorization for an informant to engage in otherwise illegal  activity. Under the Guidelines, agencies are required to take certain  actions when suspending authorization for otherwise illegal activity for  legitimate reasons unrelated to the informant\u2019s conduct, but DEA, USMS,  ICE, USSS, and USCG do not have any content in their policies that  addresses these requirements. If an agency has reason to believe that  an informant has failed to comply with the specific terms of an  authorization for otherwise illegal activity, the Guidelines require agencies  to undertake specific actions to revoke the authorization, but USMS and  USSS do not have any content in their policies that addresses these  requirements.", "Senior officials at multiple agencies told us that, in practice, their agencies  address required Guidelines provisions, even though the provisions are  not explicitly outlined in the policy. Headquarters officials from DEA, ICE,  USCG, and USSS who are responsible for developing and distributing the  agencies\u2019 informant policies stated that though their respective policies  may not explicitly contain some or all of a particular provision of the  Guidelines, these agencies believe their agents and supervisors  implement some of the Guidelines\u2019 provisions in practice. For example,  ICE officials stated that ICE\u2019s practice is to authorize otherwise illegal  activity for a specific operation and that such an authorization would not  cover a time period as long as 90 days. However, it is not clear in the  policy that authorization for informants\u2019 otherwise illegal activities is to be  limited to 90 days. Given that the Guidelines were developed to address  the substantial risks involved in using informants, it is important that  policies include the specific procedures that implement the requirements  of the Guidelines. For example, informant program management and  supervisory officials told us that when an agent has a question about a  required procedure, they will direct the agent to the requirements in the  agency\u2019s policy. Therefore, by explicitly including in the agencies\u2019 policies  certain practices that the Guidelines require, agencies would be better  positioned to provide sufficient guidance to their agents and supervisors  to ensure that agents are implementing these practices in accordance  with the Guidelines.", "Senior headquarters officials from DOJ agencies whose policies were not  consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 provisions discussed above provided  additional rationales and approaches for their agencies. Two senior  headquarters USMS officials who oversee the agency\u2019s policy stated that  USMS does not authorize otherwise illegal activity because USMS\u2019s  mission is to locate and arrest fugitives. Therefore, according to USMS  officials, USMS does not expect its informants to provide information over  a period of time regarding felonious criminal activities the way that other  agencies\u2019 informants do. However, USMS\u2019s policy includes instructions  that Deputy U.S. Marshals are required to provide to informants, and  these instructions refer to the possibility that the agency could authorize  otherwise illegal activity. Specifically, USMS\u2019s policy states that an  informant is not to engage in any unlawful acts, \u201cexcept as specifically  authorized by representatives of the USMS.\u201d This language suggests that  the agency could authorize an informant to engage in otherwise illegal  activity, and there are no USMS policy provisions to inform agents that  they are not permitted to authorize such an activity. Because the policy  does not provide any further discussion of the procedures for authorizing  otherwise illegal activity, this ambiguity in the policy could result in an  agent authorizing an activity without adhering to the provisions set forth in  the Guidelines. USMS officials agreed that, based on our findings,  information about the role of informants in otherwise illegal activity could  be stated more explicitly in the agency\u2019s policy, and they will plan to  update the policy in the future, but officials did not have specific details  about their next steps.", "With respect to the Guidelines\u2019 requirement to authorize otherwise illegal  activity in advance, in writing, and for a specified period of time not to  exceed 90 days, DEA officials stated that their policy is more restrictive  than the Guidelines because the agency authorizes otherwise illegal  activity for a given operation that occurs within a time frame shorter than  90 days. However, our review of DEA\u2019s policy found that it does not state  this explicitly, and therefore a DEA agent looking to DEA\u2019s policy for  guidance may not understand that agents are expected to prepare  documentation in accordance with the Guidelines for all circumstances  that would be considered otherwise illegal activity. With respect to  providing informants instructions for each instance of otherwise illegal  activity, DEA\u2019s policy requires briefing the informant for an operation, but  the policy does not meet the specific requirements in the Guidelines that  instructions be provided in writing and that the informant sign an  acknowledgment of these instructions. Without such documentation, if an  informant engages in an activity that exceeds the scope of the  authorization, the agency may not be able to demonstrate that the  informant\u2019s actions were not authorized, thereby limiting the agency\u2019s  ability to prosecute the informant for the unauthorized illegal activity.", "The Guidelines require DOJ component agencies to submit informant  policies to the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division for  review, but these reviews did not ensure that DEA\u2019s and USMS\u2019s policies  explicitly address all provisions of the Guidelines. DEA and USMS each  submitted agency-specific policies to the Criminal Division for review after  the latest version of the Guidelines was issued, in May 2002. Criminal  Division officials stated that they reviewed documentation, where  available, reflecting the review and approval of these agencies\u2019 policies.  According to Criminal Division officials, the agencies submitted their  respective policies and made revisions as a result of the Criminal  Division\u2019s review, and the Criminal Division approved the amended  policies. However, as discussed above, our assessment identified that  DEA\u2019s and USMS\u2019s policies were not fully consistent with the Guidelines.  The Guidelines permit component agencies to make departures from the  Guidelines by seeking an exception or through a dispute resolution  process. However, according to two senior Criminal Division officials,  neither agency applied for a departure from the Guidelines. During our  meeting with these officials, they stated that noncompliance with  provisions in the Guidelines could have serious effects on prosecution  and that agencies\u2019 policies are the tool for ensuring that agents know  what steps are required in using informants. Accordingly, policies that do  not address all requirements in the Guidelines could result in agents not  being aware of the necessary precautions to take when working with  informants, and not taking such precautions could jeopardize  prosecutions. In response to our findings, Criminal Division officials said  that they plan to revisit the agencies\u2019 policies in coordination with the  component agencies, but did not provide further details on their plans.", "As discussed earlier in this report, federal prosecutors expect DHS  agencies to adhere to the Guidelines to support successful prosecution  through DOJ prosecuting offices. Not adhering to the Guidelines can  affect agencies\u2019 cases for prosecution and put agencies at risk when  informants commit unauthorized crimes. For example, an official at one  field division of a DOJ component agency we visited said that an  informant continued to engage in illegal activities after an authorization  had expired, and because the agency had documentation that the  informant was no longer authorized to do so, the informant could not  claim that the activity was authorized. This ensured that the government  could successfully prosecute the informant for the activity that occurred  outside of the authorization. Additionally, complying with the Guidelines  can help an agency demonstrate control of how the informant obtained  evidence for the case. Demonstrating such control can help to prevent the  possibility that a defendant could undermine the prosecution\u2019s case by  attacking the credibility or role of an informant.", "In contrast to DOJ component agencies, DHS agencies do not have  guidance from the department level instructing or requiring the agencies  to develop policies that directly match the Guidelines. Officials from the  Offices of the Chief Security Officer, Policy, and the General Counsel said  that they do not have an oversight role regarding DHS agencies\u2019  informant policies or the agencies\u2019 use of informants, although the Office  of the General Counsel may provide guidance on a case-by-case basis  when an agency requests assistance. Senior officials from the Office of  the Chief Security Officer said that the DHS component agencies had  their own informant policies prior to the formation of DHS, and therefore  the agencies continued to operate under component-specific policies  since that time without additional involvement from the department.  Without departmental oversight, the DHS agencies have independently  managed their own policies and have different perspectives about the  importance of incorporating all provisions of the Guidelines. As a result,  some agencies do not incorporate all requirements in the Guidelines that  can be important for supporting prosecution. Specifically, four senior  USSS officials who manage the agency\u2019s informant policy said that they  would incorporate provisions that were missing, according to our review.  USSS subsequently made changes to its policy in February 2015.

Policies that explicitly  impose the safeguards identified in these provisions of the Guidelines can  put agencies in a better position to minimize the risks of using informants  and ensure optimal prosecution of cases when using informants. For  example, if an agency does not adhere to the Guidelines\u2019 provisions for  overseeing informants\u2019 otherwise illegal activities, a defendant could  attempt to undermine the prosecution\u2019s case by attacking the role of the  informant in the case. If the informant engaged in unauthorized illegal  activity, the agency could also find itself unable to successfully prosecute  the informant for the crime if the agency did not fully document and  explain to the informant the parameters of what the informant is and is not  allowed to do in furtherance of the investigation. Furthermore, without  ensuring that monitoring processes explicitly address all of the  requirements in the Guidelines for vetting and overseeing informants\u2019  illegal activities, agencies cannot fully ensure that they are complying with  the Guidelines.

We identified provisions in each set of Guidelines  that relate to vetting informants (see app. II) and overseeing informants\u2019  illegal activities (see app. III). To conduct our assessment, two  independent reviewers examined each agency\u2019s informant policy and  related documents to determine the extent to which an agency was  consistent with each provision we identified in the Guidelines.
