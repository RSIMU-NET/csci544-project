Universal access to, and increased use and adoption of, broadband service are policy goals stated in the National Broadband Plan, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released in March 2010. Some recent studies indicate that despite achieving nearly 95 percent broadband deployment and globally competitive adoption rates, the United States has moved from the top to the middle of the international rankings. Other developed countries, which have made universal access and increased adoption priorities, rank higher than the United States in these areas, and their experiences may be of interest to U.S. policymakers. GAO was asked to address (1) the status of broadband deployment and adoption in developed countries, (2) actions selected countries have taken to increase deployment and adoption, and (3) how recommendations in the National Broadband Plan align with the selected countries' actions. GAO analyzed relevant information for 30 developed countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and visited 7 of these countries selected for their broadband policies and economic or demographic characteristics. GAO also interviewed public- and private-sector contacts in these countries and FCC officials. FCC provided technical comments on this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Broadband infrastructure has been widely deployed in developed countries, but broadband adoption rates are more variable because of cost and other factors. In 27 of the 30 OECD countries, including the United States, broadband has been deployed to 90 percent or more of households, regardless of differences in demographic and geographic factors, while broadband adoption rates are affected by factors such as population, cost, and computer ownership. In the United States, which ranks 15th for both deployment and adoption, broadband has been deployed to 95 percent of households, with 26.4 subscribers per 100 inhabitants--above the OECD average of 23.3. To increase broadband deployment adoption, the 7 countries GAO selected--Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom--have taken actions that stakeholders in these countries considered effective. GAO placed these actions in five categories--(1) instituting plans and policies (2) providing funds through public/private partnerships, (3) increasing competition, (4) expanding online services, and (5) providing digital literacy training, consumer subsidies, or both. All 7 countries have instituted some type of broadband plan. To help increase deployment in areas private enterprise views as unprofitable, national or regional governments in all 7 countries have used public/private partnerships. To help increase usage and thus expand adoption, all 7 have enacted policies to encourage competition and have increased the number of government services available online. Several countries have also offered training or subsidies, often targeting populations with low adoption rates. The recommendations outlined in the National Broadband Plan reflect actions taken in GAO's 7 selected countries to increase broadband deployment and adoption. The plan contains over 200 recommendations for FCC, other government agencies, and Congress, which the plan's executive summary groups in four broad areas. These four areas are not identical to the five types of actions GAO identified in the selected countries, but both represent similar approaches to expanding broadband deployment and adoption. For example, the plan calls for adopting strategies and long-term goals, while the actions taken by the selected countries include instituting plans that contain strategies and goals. Similarly, the plan advocates policies to promote robust competition, just as the selected countries have taken actions to promote competition. While the United States plans to take actions similar to those of other leading countries to achieve the National Broadband Plan's goals of universal access and increased adoption, achieving these goals will be challenging. Actions will be required by governments at all levels and the private sector. Furthermore, implementing the plan's recommendations will require coordinating the work of multiple stakeholders and obtaining sufficient funding, among other actions. How effectively federal agencies will be able to address these challenges and implement the plan's recommendations, as well as what the private sector will do to further deployment, use and adoption, remains to be seen."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Increasingly, broadband Internet service is viewed as a critical component  of a nation\u2019s physical infrastructure and a key driver of economic growth  in the world\u2019s most economically developed countries. Both the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2014 which brings together the governments of about 30 developed countries to  promote sustainable economic growth and expand world trade\u2014and the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have recognized the  economic and social importance of broadband service today. Ensuring  that the infrastructure necessary to provide broadband service is  universally available and that all citizens who wish to subscribe are able to  do so are policy goals of many governments. Universal availability is, for  example, a policy goal set forth in the National Broadband Plan, issued by  FCC in March 2010 in response to a congressional mandate. To achieve  their policy goals, governments of developed countries around the world  have taken actions to increase broadband infrastructure deployment, and  to increase usage and adoption, particularly in areas with little or no  service. Several recent studies on levels of broadband deployment and  adoption across countries allow for international comparisons. Although  such studies have limitations, as we noted in an earlier report,  stakeholders across countries have agreed that they are useful for alerting  policymakers and the public to areas deserving of particular attention in  future policy decisions.", "Some recent studies show that, as other developed countries have enacted  policies to increase their levels of deployment and adoption, the United  States has moved lower in the international rankings. Specifically, despite  achieving nearly 95% broadband deployment and globally competitive  adoption rates, the United States has moved from the top to the middle of  the scale in both areas. Hence, the actions of stakeholders in other  countries that have achieved higher deployment and adoption rates are of  interest and offer examples that could inform future U.S. broadband policy  decisions. To obtain a better understanding of these actions, you asked us  to examine efforts of other countries. Accordingly, this report addresses  the following questions:  1.  What is the status of broadband deployment and adoption in  developed countries? 2.  What actions have selected countries taken to increase broadband  deployment and adoption? 3.  How do recommendations outlined in the National Broadband Plan  reflect the actions of selected countries to increase broadband  deployment and adoption?", "To address the first question, we obtained information on broadband  deployment and adoption in the 30 countries that were members of OECD  as of January 1, 2010, through a review of OECD\u2019s ranking of broadband  subscribers per 100 inhabitants, and we analyzed key demographic and  socioeconomic data identified by FCC as potentially affecting broadband  deployment and adoption in all 30 countries.", "To address the second question, we selected 7 countries from the original  30 countries\u2014Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea,  Sweden, and the United Kingdom\u2014for further analysis and comparison  with the United States, using a case study approach. These countries were  among those that had instituted policies or practices credited with  increasing broadband deployment, adoption, or both, and had economic or  demographic characteristics somewhat similar to those of the United  States. To determine the actions these selected countries have taken to  increase broadband deployment and adoption, we obtained and analyzed  relevant policies, plans, and guidance issued by responsible government  agencies, regulatory authorities, and broadband providers in our 7 selected  countries and actions taken by these countries\u2019 governments and other  stakeholders to increase broadband deployment and consumer adoption.  We identified these actions through semistructured interviews with public-  and private-sector stakeholders in the 7 countries and placed these actions  in five categories. Actions in the first two categorizes serve primarily to  increase deployment, while those in the remaining three categories are  largely intended to increase adoption, although some actions may promote  both deployment and adoption. Furthermore, to better understand  stakeholders\u2019 views on the effectiveness of these actions, we interviewed  national and local government officials and representatives of broadband  providers and consumer interest groups in each of the selected countries.", "To address the third question, we analyzed the National Broadband Plan\u2019s  recommendations, which the plan\u2019s executive summary groups in four  broad areas, and compared these areas with the five categories in which  we placed the selected countries\u2019 actions. We also compared individual  recommendations with specific actions taken in the selected countries and  spoke with relevant FCC officials about how the actions recommended in  the plan align with the five identified categories. We did not evaluate the  potential impact or effectiveness of the recommendations.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 to September 2010,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. See appendix I for more  information about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["During the 1990s, the primary means for residential users to access the  Internet was a dial-up connection, in which a standard telephone line is  used to make an Internet connection at data transmission speeds of up to  56 kilobits per second (kbps). Broadband access to the Internet became  available to residential customers by the late 1990s. Broadband  connections offer a higher speed Internet connection than dial-up. For  example, some broadband connections in the United States offered over  telephone lines can provide speeds exceeding 1 million bits per second  (Mbps) both upstream (data transferred from the consumer to the Internet  service provider, also known as upload) and downstream (data transferred  from the Internet service provider to the consumer, also known as  download). These higher speeds enable consumers to receive information  much faster and thus access certain applications and content that might be  inaccessible with a dial-up connection. Also, broadband typically provides  an \u201calways on\u201d connection to the Internet, so users do not need to  establish a connection to the Internet service provider each time they want  to go online. The higher transmission speeds that broadband offers  generally cost more than dial-up, and some broadband users pay a  premium to obtain very-high-speed service.", "Consumers can receive a broadband connection to the Internet through a  variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, the following:  Cable modem. Cable television companies first began providing  broadband cable modem service in the late 1990s. This service, which is  primarily available in residential areas, enables cable operators to deliver  broadband service through the same coaxial cables that deliver pictures  and sound to television sets. Although the speed of service varies with  many factors, download speeds of up to 6 Mbps are typical. Some cable  providers are offering even higher download speeds, up to 100 Mbps.", "Digital subscriber line (DSL). Local telephone companies provide DSL  service, another form of broadband service, over their telephone networks  on spectrum unused by traditional voice service. To provide DSL service,  telephone companies must install equipment in their facilities as well as  installing or providing DSL modems and other equipment at customers\u2019  premises; they may also have to remove devices on phone lines that may  cause interference. Most residential customers receive older, asymmetric  DSL (ADSL) service with download speeds of 1.5 Mbps to 3 Mbps. ADSL  technology can achieve speeds of up to 8 Mbps over short distances.  Newer DSL technologies can support services with speeds of over 8 Mbps  up to 50 Mbps in some areas.", "Satellite. Satellites transmit data to and from subscribers from a fixed  position above the equator, eliminating the need for a telephone or cable  connection. Typically, a consumer can expect to download data at a  speed of about 1 Mbps and upload data at a speed of about 200 kbps.  Transmission of data via satellite results in a slight lag in transmission,  typically one-half to three-fourths of a second, thus rendering this service  less suitable for certain Internet applications, such as videoconferencing.  While satellite broadcast service may be available throughout the country,  its use requires a clear line of sight between the customer\u2019s antenna and  the southern sky. The equipment necessary for service, the recurring  monthly fees, and the installation costs are generally higher for satellite  broadband service than for most other broadband transmission modes.", "Wireless. Land-based, or terrestrial, wireless broadband service connects a  home or business to the Internet using a radio link. Some companies are  offering fixed wireless broadband service throughout cities. Also, mobile  telephone carriers have begun offering broadband mobile wireless  Internet service, allowing subscribers to access the Internet with their  mobile phones or laptops in areas throughout cities where their provider  supports the service. Also, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks\u2014which  provide broadband service in so-called \u201chot spots,\u201d or areas within a  radius of up to 300 feet\u2014can be found in cafes, hotels, airports, and  offices. Hot spots generally use a short-range technology that provides  speeds up to 54 Mbps. In addition, Fourth Generation, i.e., 4G, wireless  technology, now in the early stages of deployment, is expected to achieve  broadband speeds as fast as 50 to 100 Mbps for a few users over an  extended period of time or for short periods of time for many users. Some  4G technologies, such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave  Access (known as WiMAX), can provide broadband service up to  approximately 30 miles, but at that distance, data transmission rates would  be low.", "Fiber optic. Fiber optic technology converts electrical signals carrying  data to light and sends the light through transparent glass fibers about the  diameter of a human hair. In countries such as Japan and Korea, the  government is encouraging providers to offer, in the next 3-5 years, data  transmission speeds exceeding current DSL or cable modem speeds,  typically by tens or even hundreds of megabits per second, up to 1 gigabit  per second (Gbps) in some areas. Fiber may be provided in several ways,  including direct connection to a customer\u2019s home or business, or to a  location somewhere between the provider\u2019s facilities and the customer. In  the latter case, the last part of the connection to the customer\u2019s premises  may be provided over coaxial cable, copper loop, or radio technology.  Such hybrid arrangements may be less costly than providing fiber all the  way to the customer\u2019s premises, but they generally cannot achieve the high  transmission speed of a full fiber-to-the-premises connection.", "In the United States, FCC is the federal agency principally responsible for  broadband but the scope of its authority has not been resolved. In a series  of decisions starting in 2002, FCC classified broadband Internet services as  \u201cinformation services\u201d under the Communications Act. \u201cInformation  services\u201d are not subject to Title II of the Communications Act, which  addresses telecommunications services like phone service, but gives FCC  authority to regulate these services.  However, FCC asserted that it had  authority to regulate broadband Internet service using its \u201cancillary  authority\u201d under Title I of the Communications Act. A recent decision of  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit called that  authority into question. In this case, Comcast Corp. v. FCC, the court  reviewed an FCC decision that relied on ancillary authority to address an  Internet service provider\u2019s network management practices.  The court  held that the use of ancillary authority must be tied to a specific statutory  mandate in the Communications Act and that FCC had not done that in its  order. Since that time, FCC has released a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) to seek  public comment on its legal framework for regulating broadband Internet  services. The NOI suggests that there are at least three legal options for  FCC as follows:  1.  Maintain the current \u201cinformation service\u201d framework for broadband  Internet service based on the Title I ancillary authority questioned in  Comcast. 2.  Identify the connectivity portion of broadband Internet service as a  \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d to which all requirements of Title II of  the Communications Act would apply. 3.  Following the framework Congress established for cell phone services  in 1993, identify the connectivity portion of broadband Internet service  as a telecommunications service and simultaneously forbear from  applying all but the minimum number of provisions of Title II needed  to implement fundamental universal service, competition and market  entry, and consumer protections.", "The NOI seeks comment on the three legal options and any other  approaches that will restore a solid legal foundation for FCC\u2019s broadband  policies. Public comments were due on July 15, 2010, and replies on  August 12, 2010.", "Three other federal agencies also have responsibilities for broadband in  the United States:    The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within the Executive  Office of the President has a broad mandate to advise the President and  the federal government on the effects of science and technology on  domestic and international affairs and has led interagency efforts to  develop science and technology policies and budgets.", "Within the Department of Commerce, the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA) serves as the President\u2019s principal  telecommunications and information adviser and works with other  executive branch agencies to develop the administration\u2019s  telecommunications policies.", "Within the Department of Agriculture, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS)  provides financial resources for broadband deployment.", "Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery  Act), enacted on February 17, 2009, NTIA and RUS have responsibility for  distributing federal moneys to expand broadband. The act provided $7.2  billion to extend access to broadband throughout the United States,  including $4.7 billion for NTIA and $2.5 billion for RUS. Specifically, the  Recovery Act authorized NTIA, in consultation with FCC, to create the  Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) to manage  competitive grants to a variety of entities for broadband infrastructure,  public computer centers, and innovative projects to stimulate demand for,  and adoption of, broadband. The Recovery Act made up to $350 million of  the $4.7 billion available for developing and maintaining a nationwide map  featuring the availability of broadband service, as provided in the  Broadband Data Improvement Act. In addition, the Recovery Act made  some of NTIA\u2019s appropriation available for transfer to FCC for the  development of a national broadband plan to help ensure that all people in  the United States have access to broadband. The Recovery Act also  authorized RUS to establish the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) to  make loans and to award grants and loan-grant combinations for  broadband infrastructure projects in rural areas. Pursuant to the Recovery  Act, all BTOP and BIP funds must be awarded by September 30, 2010.", "In May 2009, we reported on the broadband deployment policy of the past  administration, the principal federal programs that helped fund broadband  infrastructure, and stakeholders\u2019 views on the usefulness of those  programs.

For example, in Denmark, which is one of the smallest and  most densely populated OECD countries, with an average of 128 people  per square kilometer, broadband has been deployed to 99 percent of  households. Yet in the United States, which is 228 times larger  geographically, and 56 times more populous, and which has an average of  32 people per square kilometer, broadband has been deployed to more  than 95 percent of households.

The United States, with assessed average speeds of 3.808 Mbps,  ranks 14th among the OECD countries. However, broadband speeds can  exceed averages under certain conditions. For example, in the United  States, three localities\u2014Berkeley, California (18.730 Mbps); Chapel Hill,  North Carolina (17.483 Mbps); and Stanford, California (16.956 Mbps)\u2014 offer the highest average broadband speeds in the world. In addition, 21 of  the 100 top cities Akamai evaluated are in the United States.", "The quality of broadband infrastructure is often characterized by the  speed it is capable of providing to users. Greater broadband speeds enable  the use of more services over the Internet. For example, the United States  and Japan lead the world in demand for high-definition television (HDTV),  which can consume up to 18 Mbps if broadcast over the Internet. Current  Internet-based video requires 1-4 Mbps; if these speeds grow over time and  demand for Internet-based HDTV is combined with demand for other  broadband-based services, such as Web browsing and online gaming, a  household\u2019s demand for broadband speeds could exceed 20 Mbps or  more.

Furthermore, the United States has more subscribers than any other  OECD country\u201481 million, or more than twice as many as Japan, which  has 31 million, the second highest number of subscribers.", "Population is an important factor to consider when analyzing broadband  adoption rates. For example, 7 of the 10 countries with the highest  adoption rates are also among the 10 countries with the smallest  populations. Because the population of the United States is significantly  larger than that of the other OECD countries, a 1-unit increase in the  broadband adoption rate in the United States requires more than 3 million  new U.S. broadband subscriber lines. By contrast, the Netherlands would  need another 160,000 subscriber lines to achieve a 1-unit increase.  Assuming all other factors are equal, the cost of a 1-unit increase in  broadband subscriber lines per 100 inhabitants is considerably higher in  the United States than in any other country.

A 2009 survey conducted for FCC  determined that 65 percent of American adults use broadband at home,  although another 12 percent use the Internet, either through a dial-up  connection or at a place other than their home. However, this study also  surveyed nonadopters in the United States and determined that more than  one-third identified cost as the main factor affecting their decision not to  subscribe to broadband service. Additionally, subscription costs generally  increase with speed, making higher-speed services typically more  challenging for users to adopt. As a result, cost concerns may limit the  level of Internet-based applications consumers can access.", "Broadband service prices can be assessed along several criteria, such as  the average price per megabit or the price for a given \u201cspeed tier.\u201d As  table 2 shows, prices for broadband service in the United States are below  OECD averages except for very-high-speed service.", "In the United States, several demographic factors, including education and  income, are also thought to affect broadband adoption. For example,  having a child in school and having a higher income are associated with  higher broadband adoption levels. According to FCC\u2019s 2009 survey, 75  percent of parents with a minor child have broadband services at home, as  do 91 percent of households with annual incomes of more than $75,000.  Conversely, 40 percent of households with annual incomes of less than  $20,000 have broadband services at home. See table 3.", "Personal computer ownership has also been linked to broadband  adoption, since computers enable users to access Internet-based services.  Of the 30 OECD countries, the United States ranks fifth in personal  computer ownership, with 80.6 per 100 inhabitants\u2014a rate considerably  above the average of 52.3 per 100 inhabitants. Yet despite this high  personal computer ownership rate, FCC\u2019s 2010 survey indicates that 10  percent of U.S. individual nonadopters surveyed cited the cost of  computer ownership as one of the main reasons for nonadoption.", "According to our analysis of OECD and World Bank data, income is a  factor that drives broadband adoption across the OECD countries. For  example, Turkey, which has the lowest adoption rate (9.0 subscribers per  100 inhabitants), also has the lowest gross national income (GNI) per  capita ($9,020) of the OECD countries, while the United States, which  ranks 15th in adoption (with 26.4 subscribers per 100 inhabitants), ranks  eighth in GNI per capita ($47,930).

Whereas private enterprises have  deployed broadband infrastructure in high-density urban areas where  there is a strong business case for such investment, they have  independently invested less in low-density rural areas or isolated  communities, where deployment costs more per household and offers less  opportunity for profit. Officials in both the public and private sectors of  several of the countries we visited acknowledged that some areas are  unprofitable to serve and some incentive, usually in the form of  government funding, is required to motivate private investment and  achieve universal access. The public/private partnerships in our case-study  countries range from local authorities and private companies that have  shared the cost of building a network to municipalities that own  broadband networks and contract with private companies to operate and  maintain them. The following are examples:    Japan\u2019s Ministry of Information and Communications told us that,  although 98.6 percent of households have broadband access, the  government has instituted a public/private partnership program to support  the establishment of broadband infrastructure in rural and remote areas  where broadband service is not available and hopes to eliminate all areas  without broadband access by the end of March 2011. Under this  arrangement, the national government provides one-third of the total cost  of installing broadband networks, requiring that the local government  formulate plans in collaboration with the private sector and help create  demand for broadband. Local governments in Japan maintain ownership   of the network and attract the private sector by selecting one company to  provide service for the area.", "From 2001 to 2007, Sweden initiated a broadband funding initiative to  expand broadband to rural and remote areas using a public/private  partnership model. Financing was provided through state funds, local  authorities, and broadband operators, and, in order to participate, a local  authority had to provide at least 5 percent of the funding. A government  evaluation of the funding program determined that broadband had been  deployed to more remote areas than would have received broadband  without the funding.", "In 2006, in order to stimulate economic growth, a large suburb of Paris,  France, Hauts-de-Seine, issued a request for proposal; in 2007, Hauts-de- Seine hired a private company to deploy a fiber network to all its  residents, enterprises, and public sites within 6 years and to operate the  network as a shared fiber network, one open to all competitors. Regional  officials told us they entered into this arrangement to prevent the creation  of a digital divide, which would have occurred without the involvement of  the municipality because no commercial provider was expected to deploy  infrastructure equally to all areas, both rich and poor, urban and suburban.  Public officials of Hauts-de-Seine told us that the public/private  partnership arrangement would optimize the implementation of the  network by reducing the cost of deployment of a fully open infrastructure  and allowing service providers to increase their customer base.

At that time  in the rural areas, 2 percent of the residents had access to broadband. To  bring broadband to the entire amalgamated area, in 2007, Ottawa entered  into a partnership with a private broadband provider. Ottawa issued a  request for proposal, set a goal of 100 percent availability, and selected a  company that provided both fixed wireless and satellite service. A city  official told us that some satellite coverage was necessary because  Ottawa\u2019s uneven terrain would have made it too costly to erect enough  towers to provide wireless connections for all residents. The city official  told us that the private company had given the city more than it had asked  for and its bid did not request the maximum contribution from the city.  Currently, broadband service is available to 100 percent of the  amalgamated area\u2019s residents, with 98 percent of rural areas served by  terrestrial wireless and the last 2 percent served by satellite.

For example,  rural villages with more than 50 households are receiving broadband  service at speeds of up to 50 Mbps from Korea Telecom (KT) in  partnership with the Korean government. When KT transitioned from  government to private ownership in 2002, it had to commit to providing  infrastructure to rural areas.

Nevertheless, some municipalities have  determined that fiber is necessary for their future well-being and have  decided to deploy it despite private companies\u2019 unwillingness to bear the  full investment costs. To finance the deployment of fiber in their area,  some of these municipalities have established public/private partnerships  and examples of some of these are as follows:    Stokab, a municipally-owned fiber network, was founded in 1994. Stokab  officials told us that the municipality of Stockholm had determined that  fiber appeared to be the most viable technology for the foreseeable future,  although the local telephone provider did not express any interest in  deploying fiber infrastructure at that time. In addition, city officials told us  they knew that if, in the future, multiple companies chose to provide fiber  to the city, the streets could be dug up several times, causing disruption  and damaging Stockholm\u2019s historic buildings and cobblestone streets. To  avoid such a scenario, Stockholm officials set up Stokab, which deploys  and maintains the physical infrastructure and leases dark fiber to  multiple businesses, which may use the fiber for their own business or to  provide service to others. Stokab is thus a wholesaler to other business   entities. Stokab officials told us that many municipalities in Sweden have  adopted models similar to Stokab.", "In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in 2000, broadband service was widely  available over cable and telephone lines, but there was no fiber to the  home. Officials said they believed fiber would protect the city\u2019s future  competitiveness, although commercial companies did not want to invest in  fiber at that time. Accordingly, in 2006, Amsterdam formed Glasvezel  Amsterdam (GNA) to finance a fiber network in conjunction with private  investors to provide broadband services throughout the city. The city is  not a majority shareholder in GNA, and it is treated like any other private  investor.

However, in other  countries, such as France and Sweden, wireline cable service has not been  universally deployed, and there is no cable provider that is competing  nationwide with the telephone company. To ensure a national competitive  market for wireline broadband services, six of seven countries have  increased the level of competition in the provision of wireline broadband  service through laws, regulations, or both, which require the incumbent  telephone carrier to open its copper networks (the legacy infrastructure  used to provide telephone service) and provide access to competitors at  wholesale prices. This activity is commonly referred to as \u201cunbundling.\u201d  Unbundling has been credited with giving most urban residents in France,  the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Japan a choice of three  or more providers.

One company official attributed the limited success of  unbundling in South Korea to difficulties in getting access to the  incumbent\u2019s network. Another company official said several competing  telecommunications infrastructures had developed because competition  for customers is based on speed. If a company is using another company\u2019s  network, it cannot provide faster service than the company whose  network it is leasing. Consequently, in most urban areas of Korea,  residents have a choice of four providers, each of which offers service  over its own infrastructure.", "To further encourage competition and ensure that incumbents do not stifle  competition by charging prohibitively high prices for access to their  infrastructure, all seven countries also regulate the price the incumbent  carrier can charge competitors for network access.", "The majority of our case-study countries have benefited from requiring the  incumbent telecommunications carrier to unbundle its copper telephone  lines, but the benefits of fiber unbundling are less clear. Both the  Netherlands and Japan have required fiber unbundling, and Great Britain  has proposed virtual unbundling of fiber; however, officials in some case- study countries cited concerns about the effect of requiring unbundling,  pointing out that overregulation too early in the fiber rollout will hamper  investment.", "Furthermore, industry representatives in Japan told us that although the  unbundling of copper lines has increased competition, the unbundling of  fiber has had less effect, because of the high cost of accessing a  competitor\u2019s fiber network. These industry representatives explained that  G-Pon, the most cost-effective and most widely used architecture for  deploying fiber, is currently cost-prohibitive to unbundle and technological  limitations restrict the profitability of leasing an incumbent\u2019s fiber  infrastructure.
