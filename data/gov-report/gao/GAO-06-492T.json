Previous problems we identified with contractors with unpaid taxes have led to concerns over whether any interagency contractors, such as those on the General Services Administration's (GSA) federal supply schedule, failed to pay their taxes. GSA, through its federal supply schedule and other interagency contracts, arranges for federal agencies to purchase billions of dollars of goods and services directly from private vendors. GAO was asked to determine if GSA contractors, including both contractors that were paid by GSA and GSA interagency contractors, have unpaid federal taxes, and if so, to (1) determine the magnitude of tax debts owed by GSA contractors; (2) identify examples of GSA contractors that have tax debts and are also engaged in potentially abusive, fraudulent, or criminal activities; and (3) determine whether GSA screens contractors for tax debts and criminal activities prior to awarding contracts and at the exercise of any government contract options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over 3,800 GSA contractors had tax debts totaling about $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2005. This represented approximately 10 percent of the number of GSA contractors during fiscal year 2004 and the first 9 months of fiscal year 2005. GAO investigated 25 GSA contractors with abusive and potentially criminal activity. These businesses had not forwarded payroll taxes withheld from their employees and other taxes to IRS. Willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a felony under U.S. law. Furthermore, some company owners diverted payroll taxes for personal gain or to fund their businesses. These contractors worked for a number of federal agencies including the departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. A number of owners or officers of the 25 GSA contractors have significant personal assets, including commercial properties, houses worth over $1 million, and luxury vehicles. In addition, several of the owners of these GSA contractors gambled hundreds of thousands of dollars at the same time they were not paying the taxes that their businesses owed. Neither federal law, as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), nor GSA policies require contracting officers to specifically consider tax debts in making contracting decisions either at initial award or when considering options to extend. In addition, federal law generally prohibits the disclosure of taxpayer data, and consequently contracting officers have no access to tax data directly from the IRS. GSA contractors that do not pay tax debts could have an unfair competitive advantage in costs because they may have lower costs than tax compliant contractors on government contracts. This is especially true in wage-based businesses that provide homogenous types of goods and services. GAO's investigation identified instances in which contractors with tax debts won awards based on price differential over tax compliant competing contractors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss General Services Administration  (GSA) contractors that have abused the federal tax system while doing  business with the federal government. In hearings held by this  subcommittee in February 2004 and again in June 2005, we testified that  some Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agency federal  contractors abused the federal tax system with little consequence. In 2005,  we designated interagency contracting, in which GSA plays a prominent  role, as a new high-risk area. This designation is partly based on the fact  that interagency contracting tends to create an incentive for the agency  awarding the contracts to focus more on increasing contracting volume  that generate fees than on compliance with sound contracting policy and  required procedures (see app. II for further details on GSA\u2019s contracting  role).", "This testimony continues a body of work which has identified federal  contractors with unpaid taxes. Our prior work gave rise to concerns over  whether GSA interagency contractors, such as those on GSA\u2019s federal  supply schedule, have also failed to pay their fair share of taxes.

We matched the identities of contractors with IRS tax debts to  federal contractors that were either paid or awarded contracts by GSA to  contract with federal agencies during fiscal year 2004 and the first 9  months of fiscal year 2005. To illustrate indications of abuse or potentially  criminal activity, based on our data mining, we selected 25 GSA  contractors for a detailed audit and investigation. For these 25 contractors,  we reviewed copies of automated tax transcripts and other tax records  (for example, revenue officer\u2019s notes) and performed additional searches  of criminal, financial, and public records. To determine whether GSA  contracting officers are required to consider tax debts or other criminal  activities, we examined the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and GSA  regulations, policies and procedures for conducting responsibility  determinations on prospective contractors. We also discussed acquisition  policies and procedures used to award contracts with GSA officials and, as  part of these discussions, we determined whether contracting officers  specifically consider tax debts or perform background investigations in  determining whether a prospective contractor is a responsible source  before the contract is awarded and before the option to extend the  contract is exercised.

Unlike our  previous reports on contractors with tax debts, a larger percentage of  taxes owed by GSA contractors was comprised of corporate income taxes,  which are unpaid amounts that corporations owe on the income of their  business. This was due to a handful of GSA contractors that owed a  significant amount of corporate income tax debts as of June 2005.  Excluding this handful of cases, payroll taxes make up about 40 percent of  the outstanding taxes owed by GSA contractors.", "Unpaid payroll taxes include amounts that an employer withholds from an  employee\u2019s wages for federal income taxes, Social Security, and  Medicare\u2014but does not remit to IRS\u2014and the related matching  contributions of the employer for Social Security and Medicare.  Employers who do not remit payroll taxes to the federal government are  subject to civil and criminal penalties.", "The amount of unpaid federal taxes we identified among GSA  contractors\u2014$1.4 billion\u2014is likely understated. First, to avoid  overestimating the amount owed by government contractors, we  intentionally limited our scope to tax debts that were affirmed by either  the contractor or a tax court for tax periods prior to 2005. We did not  include the most current tax year because recently assessed tax debts that  appear as unpaid taxes may involve matters that are routinely resolved  between the taxpayer and IRS, with the taxes paid, abated, or both within  a short period. We eliminated these types of debt by focusing on unpaid  federal taxes for tax periods prior to calendar year 2005 and eliminating  tax debt of $100 or less.", "Also limiting the completeness of our estimate of the unpaid federal taxes  of GSA contractors is the fact that the IRS tax database reflects only the  amount of unpaid taxes either reported by the contractor on a tax return  or assessed by IRS through its various enforcement programs. The IRS  database does not reflect amounts owed by businesses and individuals  that have not filed tax returns and for which IRS has not assessed tax  amounts due. During our review, we identified instances from our case  studies in which GSA contractors failed to file tax returns for a particular  tax period and, therefore, were listed in IRS records as having no unpaid  taxes for that period. Further, our analysis did not attempt to account for  businesses or individuals that purposely underreported income and were  not specifically identified by IRS. According to IRS, underreporting of  income is the largest component of the estimated $345 billion annual gross  tax gap. IRS estimates that underreporting accounts for more than 80  percent of the total gross tax gap.

In addition to  civil penalties, criminal penalties exist for an employer\u2019s failure to turn  over withheld employee payroll taxes to IRS.

The 25 case-study contractors typically operate in wage-based industries,  providing security, building maintenance, computer services, and  personnel services for GSA and the departments of Defense, Homeland  Security, Justice, and Veterans Affairs. The types of contracts that were  awarded to these contractors included products and/or services related to  law enforcement, disaster relief, and national security. The amount of  unpaid taxes associated with these case studies ranged from  approximately $100,000 to over $9 million. Furthermore, we determined  that several of the case studies had unpaid state and local taxes where  state and local taxing authorities had filed multiple tax liens against them.  Subsequent to the award of the most recent contract by GSA, one case  study company and its owner were debarred from future federal contracts  for illegal activity unrelated to their failure to pay their payroll taxes.", "Table 1 highlights 10 case studies with unpaid taxes.

However, the FAR does not require contracting officers to  consider tax debt in making this determination. Similarly, GSA policies in  implementing the FAR do not provide any additional guidance to GSA  contracting officers on whether or how tax debts should be considered  when making a determination of financial responsibility. According to  GSA officials, contracting officers may consider delinquent tax debts as  part of their overall determination of a prospective contractor\u2019s financial  capability; however, the focus of such evaluation is on determining  whether the contractor has the financial capability to deliver the products  and services. Thus, there is no expectation that the contracting officer will  consider tax compliance when evaluating whether companies have the  integrity or ethics to perform the contract. In addition, according to GSA  officials, the determination for financial capability of the contract is only  applicable when awarding new contracts. Thus, if the contractor does not  pay its tax debts after the contract award, no consideration of this will be  made by GSA contracting officers for the duration of the contract or at the  subsequent exercise of any options to extend, which for certain GSA  Supply Schedule contracts can last up to 20 years.", "The FAR specifies that unless compelling reasons exist, agencies are  prohibited from soliciting offers from, or awarding contracts to,  contractors that are debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment for  various reasons, including tax evasion. Conviction for tax evasion is cited  as one of the causes for debarment, while commission, i.e., indictment, for  tax evasion is cited as a cause for suspension. However, the deliberate  failure to remit taxes, in particular payroll taxes, while a felony offense,  will likely not result in a company being debarred or suspended unless the  contractor was indicted or convicted of the crime.

Federal law does not permit IRS to disclose  taxpayer information, including tax debts. Thus, unless the taxpayer  provides consent, certain tax debt information can only be discovered  from public records when IRS files a federal tax lien against the property  of a tax debtor. However, contracting officers are not required to obtain  credit reports, which provides public record information, and when credit  reports are obtained, GSA contracting officers generally focus on the  contractor\u2019s credit score and not necessarily any liens or other public  information. In addition, public record information is limited because IRS  does not file tax liens on all tax debtors, and, while IRS has a central  repository of tax liens, contracting officers do not have access to that  information. Further, the listing of a federal tax lien in the credit reports of  businesses or individuals may not be a reliable indicator of a contractor\u2019s  tax indebtedness because of deficiencies in IRS\u2019s internal controls that  have resulted in IRS not always releasing tax liens from property when the  tax debt has been satisfied.", "Unless reported by prospective contractors themselves, contracting  officers face significant difficulties obtaining or verifying tax compliance  information on prospective contractors.

Clearly, contractors that do not pay their  taxes do not bear the same costs that tax compliant contractors have  when competing on contracts. As a result, when in direct competition for  homogenous types of goods and services in wage-based businesses, these  contractors could offer prices for their goods and services that are lower  than their tax compliant competitors. Our investigations showed that some  GSA contractors that did not fully pay their payroll taxes were issued task  orders based solely on price over competing contractors that did not have  any tax debts. The following provides information on these cases.", "Case 1: A GSA Schedule contractor was competitively awarded a task  order from the GSA schedule in the late 1990s to provide temporary  personnel services over another GSA contractor that was compliant with  its taxes. The task order award was based solely on the hourly cost of the  temporary employee. At the time, the contractor had owed taxes for at  least 10 years. This contractor had a history of incurring payroll taxes on  one company, then upon being assessed a trust fund recovery penalty on  that company but making little or no payments, closing that company and  starting another.

On  both task orders, the contractor\u2019s offer for services was significantly less  than three competing offers on the first order and two competing offers on  the second order. The contractor owed about $700,000 in unpaid taxes  (mostly payroll taxes) while its competitors did not owe any unpaid taxes.

Specifically, compliance assessments or memo accounts were  excluded because these taxes have neither been agreed to by the  taxpayers nor affirmed by the court, or these taxes could be invalid or  duplicative of other taxes already reported. We excluded tax debts from  calendar year 2005 tax periods to eliminate tax debt that may involve  matters that are routinely resolved between the taxpayer and IRS, with the  taxes paid or abated within a short period.
