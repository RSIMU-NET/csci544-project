For  example:  In January 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security ended the  Secure Border Initiative Network program after obligating more than  $1 billion for the program because it did not meet cost-effectiveness  and viability standards. Since 2007, we have identified a range of  issues and made several recommendations to improve this program.  For example, in May 2010, we reported that the final acceptance of  the first two deployments had slipped from November 2009 and  March 2010 to September 2010 and November 2010, respectively,  and that the cost-effectiveness of the system had not been justified.  We concluded that DHS had not demonstrated that the considerable  time and money being invested to acquire and deploy the program  were a wise and prudent use of limited resources. As a result, we  recommended that the department (1) limit near-term investment in  the program, (2) economically justify any longer-term investment in it,  and (3) improve key program management disciplines.

In addition, to assist agencies in managing their  investments, Congress enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Among  other things, the act requires agency heads to appoint CIOs and specifies  many of their responsibilities.

Additionally,  with regard to incremental development, Clinger-Cohen calls for  provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation that encourage agencies  to structure their IT contracts such that the capabilities are delivered in  smaller increments. The Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions are  also to provide, to the maximum extent practicable, that the increment  should be delivered within 18 months of the contract solicitation.", "As set out in these laws, OMB is to play a key role in helping federal  agencies manage their investments by working with them to better plan,  justify, and determine how much they need to spend on projects and how  to manage approved projects.

For example, the Federal CIO testified in June 2013 that  he holds TechStat meetings on large investments that are not being  acquired incrementally.

Specifically, we reported that department officials identified seven  successful investment acquisitions, in that they best achieved their  respective cost, schedule, scope, and performance goals.

For  example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh  increment of an ongoing investment; the Department of Energy system  was the first of two phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two  locations prior to deployment to 37 additional locations; and the  Transportation investment had been part of a prototype deployed to four  airports. In addition, common factors critical to the success of three or  more of the seven investments were: (1) program officials were actively  engaged with stakeholders, (2) program staff had the necessary  knowledge and skills, (3) senior department and agency executives  supported the programs, (4) end users and stakeholders were involved in  the development of requirements, (5) end users participated in testing of  system functionality prior to formal end user acceptance testing, (6)  government and contractor staff were stable and consistent, (7) program  staff prioritized requirements, (8) program officials maintained regular  communication with the prime contractor, and (9) programs received  sufficient funding.

Specifically, with regard to Defense,  although the department\u2019s acquisition framework calls for investments  to use incremental development, its policy on IT budget submissions  encourages investments to deliver functionality every 12-18 months\u2014 not every 6 months.

According to an HHS Office of the CIO  official, HHS does not require its projects to deliver functionality every  6 months because it wants to provide projects with flexibility. For  DHS, in June 2012, the former DHS CIO issued a draft policy  encouraging IT projects to move towards Agile development  approaches. Additionally, with respect to financial systems  modernization programs, DHS\u2019s policy calls for providing financial  capabilities to the customer in small increments of 6-12 months.  According to DHS officials representing the Office of the CIO, the  department is currently developing a departmentwide policy on  incremental development; however, they said that the draft currently  encourages investments to deliver the first release 18 months after  program initiation and thereafter deploy functionality in cycles no  longer than 12 months, but ideally less than 6 months. Lastly,  Transportation also did not address the component because, although  Transportation has a policy that calls for projects to deliver  functionality every 6 months, officials from the Office of the CIO  explained that this policy does not apply to the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA). These officials explained that how often FAA  projects deliver functionality depends on their size, scope, risk,  visibility, and interdependencies with other programs.", "Define functionality. Only one of the five agencies\u2014VA\u2014fully  addressed this policy component. VA has a policy that defines what it  means to deliver functionality\u2014both in terms of what constitutes an  increment and what should be delivered at the end of an increment.  For example, VA defines an increment as the segment of the project  that produces, in a cycle of 6 months or less, a deliverable that can be  used by customers in an operational environment. For the agency  that partially addressed the component\u2014Defense\u2014although it has  defined functionality for purposes of its acquisition framework, it has  not defined the functionality that its IT budget submission policy  encourages projects to deliver every 12-18 months. The department  stated that it is working with OMB to define this term. Lastly, three  agencies\u2014HHS, DHS, and Transportation\u2014had not defined  functionality in terms of what they expected projects to deliver at the  end of a development cycle. Officials representing these agencies\u2019  respective Office of the CIO acknowledged that they have not defined  functionality. These officials told us that they would update their  policies to define the term, but officials from HHS and Transportation  did not provide a time frame for doing so. DHS officials stated that,  although they did not have a definitive timeframe, they hoped to  finalize the policy in 2014.

In particular, VA\u2019s policy requires the agency to hold  a TechStat session when any increment delivery date has been or will  be missed. Two agencies partially addressed this component\u2014 Defense and HHS\u2014because, although they established processes for  ensuring that IT is acquired incrementally, these processes do not (1)  require enforcement of incremental development within the specific  time frames consistent with OMB guidance (12-18 months for  Defense and 3-6 months for HHS) or (2) include using TechStat  processes to identify investments that are not being acquired  incrementally. Finally, two agencies\u2014DHS and Transportation\u2014have  not established processes for enforcing compliance with their  incremental development policies.

Transportation officials representing the Office of  the CIO stated that it would update its policy later this year; DHS  Office of the CIO officials stated that, although they did not have a  definitive timeframe, they hoped to finalize their policy in 2014.", "Agencies cited several underlying reasons that contributed to these  weaknesses: (1) they were not always aware of OMB guidance, (2) they  did not believe that the guidance was realistic, and (3) they said the  guidance was not always clear. Regarding agency awareness of the  guidance, since the 2010 IT Reform Plan, OMB has communicated  changes to incremental development requirements, such as the change  from 12 to 6 months, through budget guidance. However, selected  agency officials said they were not always aware of this guidance. For  example, DHS Office of the CIO officials told us that did not know about  OMB\u2019s requirement to deliver functionality every 6 months. Additionally,  Transportation officials representing the Office of the CIO were not aware  that in 2012 OMB had changed its guidance from recommending to  requiring that projects deliver in 6-month cycles.", "With respect to whether OMB\u2019s guidance is realistic, officials from  Defense, HHS, DHS, and Transportation explained that they do not want  to require all of their projects to deliver functionality every 6 months  because it may not be reasonable for all investments to do so. Defense,  DHS, and Transportation officials said that delivering every 12 months, as  advocated in OMB\u2019s IT Reform Plan, is more reasonable.Defense officials from the Office of the CIO, 12-18 month incremental  development is better aligned with the acquisition framework that many of  its IT investments have used. DHS and Transportation Office of the CIO  officials stated that, depending on program size, scope, complexity,  budget, schedule, and expertise, it may be more reasonable to deliver  functionality every 12 months. As discussed later in this report, we agree  that OMB\u2019s requirement to deliver functionality every 6 months is  unrealistic. OMB staff members from the Office of E-Government and  Information Technology noted that it will take time for agencies to  embrace delivering functionality every 6 months because of the perceived  risk of adopting such approaches. Those staff members explained that  agencies, such as Defense, have been using the waterfall development  method for many years, and they perceive less risk in continuing with that  method than with changing to a method that produces functionality more  rapidly.", "Lastly, two key components of OMB\u2019s guidance are not clear. First, in  revising Circular A-130 in 2000, OMB did not identify the minimum  requirements of what the agencies\u2019 policies are to include and did not  specify when the policies are to be completed. Although OMB issued later  guidance on incremental development, it has not yet specified what  agencies\u2019 incremental development policies are to include. Second,  OMB\u2019s guidance did not provide a complete definition of the functionality  it expects to be delivered every 6 months. According to staff from the  Office of E-Government, OMB intends for agencies to deliver functionality  that can be tested by business users; nevertheless, they noted that they  left this definition out of their guidance so that agencies could develop a  definition that would be flexible enough to meet their needs. However, in  the absence of further guidance from OMB, agencies may continue to not  define this term or may create definitions that are inconsistent with the  intent of OMB\u2019s policy. For example, HHS officials from the Office of the  CIO told us that the completion of requirements documents could meet  OMB\u2019s definition of delivering functionality. Additionally, an FAA Office of  the CIO official explained that some investments have classified the  delivery of requirements documentation as functionality. These two  examples are not consistent with OMB\u2019s intent since they do not deliver  functionality that can be tested, but instead only plan to deliver project  documentation.", "Until OMB explicitly issues realistic and clear guidance and Defense,  HHS, DHS, and Transportation address the identified weaknesses in their  incremental development policies, it will be difficult to deliver project  functionality more rapidly, measure how often projects are delivering  functionality, and enforce compliance with the delivery time frames called  for in their policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Selected Investments Do Not Plan to Deliver Functionality Every 6 or 12 Months", "paragraphs": ["In its 2010 IT Reform Plan, OMB called for IT programs to deliver  functionality at least every 12 months.

Specifically, of the 23 investments that planned to deliver  functionality in 6-month cycles, 9 had cost estimates that were less than  $250 million, 4 had estimates between $250 and $575 million, 5 had  estimates between $575 million and $2 billion, and 5 had estimates  greater than $2 billion.", "Twenty-seven of the 89 investments in our review (30 percent) reported  using an Agile development methodology for one or more of their  projects. Of those 27 investments, 14 (52 percent) planned to deliver  functionality every 6 months. The other 13 investments using Agile did  not plan on delivering functionality as frequently as OMB guidance  requires. We have previously found that Agile projects typically produce  working functionality every 1 to 8 weeks; as such, it appears that these  investments may not be properly implementing an Agile development  methodology.", "Agency officials cited three types of investments for which it may not  always be practical or necessary to expect functionality to be delivered in  6-month cycles: (1) investments in life-cycle phases other than acquisition  (i.e., planning and budgeting, management in-use, and disposition); (2) investments intended to develop IT infrastructure; and (3) research and  development investments.", "Life-cycle phases other than acquisition. Officials from Defense, HHS,  DHS, and Transportation stated that it is not reasonable to expect  investments to deliver functionality every 6 months when their  investments\u2019 projects are not in the acquisition phase. Specifically,  24 investments did not have projects in the acquisition stage. Of those  24 investments, 22 did not plan to deliver functionality in 6-month  cycles (10 from Defense, 3 from HHS, 1 from DHS, and 8 from  Transportation), and 2 investments did plan to do so (2 from HHS).  For the 2 investments that planned to deliver functionality every 6  months, both had at least one project in the management in-use  phase, meaning that at least one of the investments\u2019 projects were  beyond the planning and development stages and were being used to  support agency operations.", "Infrastructure investments. Officials from Defense, DHS, and  Transportation explained that not all infrastructure investments can be  expected to deliver functionality every 6 months. Specifically, 21  investments provide infrastructure, such as IT security, office  automation, and telecommunications. For example, officials  representing two of the DHS investments explained that, prior to  deploying functionality, they need to acquire real estate, conduct  environmental assessments, and perform construction work, such as  digging trenches, burying cables, and building facilities. Of the 21  investments, 20 did not plan to deliver functionality every 6 months  (17 from Defense, 1 from HHS, and 2 from DHS); however, 1  investment did plan to do so (1 from Defense).", "Research and development investments. Officials from FAA\u2019s Office  of the CIO explained that FAA\u2019s research and development  investments are not intended to deliver functionality. Those officials  stated that, before the agency approves a technology for further  development, it performs research and development to ensure that  the technology meets safety standards. If those standards are met,  FAA creates a new investment aimed at deploying that technology.  Consistent with this, none of FAA\u2019s six research and development  investments planned to deliver any functionality during fiscal years  2013 and 2014.", "These concerns have merit. For example, with respect to investments in  life-cycle phases other than acquisition, at the outset of a new investment,  an agency may need more than 6 months to, among other things, define  high-level requirements and find a contractor to help develop the system.  In addition, it may not be necessary for an investment to continue  delivering new functionality when all planned functionality has been fully  deployed.", "Regarding infrastructure investments, it may not be practical or cost- effective for an investment to refresh fully functioning hardware every 6  months. Additionally, it may not be feasible for an agency to build a  physical facility (e.g., data center) within 6 months. Further, for research  and development investments, industry practices and our work on best  practices support FAA\u2019s efforts to thoroughly validate the feasibility and  cost-effectiveness of new technology prior to making significant  investments.", "Although OMB requires all investments to deliver functionality every 6  months, an OMB staff member from the Office of E-Government  explained that not all investments will be able to meet this goal. Instead,  that staff member said that about half of the federal government\u2019s major  IT investments will deliver functionality in 6 months or less, and the other  half will have longer development cycles. However, OMB\u2019s guidance does  not make this distinction. As a result, agencies may be confused about  whether OMB\u2019s incremental development guidance applies to all  investments.", "If these three types of investments, which account for 40 of the selected   29 of the remaining 49 investments  89 investments, are not considered,did not plan to deliver functionality in 6-month cycles. Table 3 shows, after  removing the three types of investments discussed above, how many of  the selected investments at each agency planned to deliver functionality  every 6 months during fiscal years 2013 and 2014.", "Considering agencies\u2019 concerns about delivering functionality every 6  months for the three types of investments discussed above and OMB\u2019s  own expectations that many investments will not meet this goal, it is  unclear whether this is the most appropriate governmentwide goal, and it  raises the question of whether OMB should consider a longer time frame,  such as 12 months, as called for in OMB\u2019s IT Reform Plan. However,  even using the time frame of 12 months as the target, less than half of the  selected investments planned to deliver functionality in 12-month cycles.  Specifically, 41 of the 89 selected investments planned to deliver  functionality every 12 months during fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and 48  did not. Most notably, the preponderance of Defense and Transportation  investments (70 percent for Defense and 65 percent for Transportation)  did not plan to deliver functionality every 12 months. Table 4 shows how  many of the selected investments at each agency planned on delivering  functionality every 12 months during fiscal years 2013 and 2014.", "The previously discussed weaknesses in agency policies have permitted  the inconsistent implementation of incremental development approaches.  OMB staff members from the Office of E-Government acknowledged that  inconsistent implementation of OMB\u2019s guidance can be at least partially  attributed to challenges in ensuring that agencies develop consistent  definitions of and approaches to incremental development.", "Although OMB has led the government\u2019s recent effort to improve  incremental development, it has not completed a key commitment aimed  at improving incremental development\u2014namely, OMB has rarely used  the TechStat process to turn around or cancel investments that are not  using incremental development. As previously mentioned, TechStat  sessions are intended to terminate or turn around IT investments that are  failing or are not producing results. Additionally, many failed IT  investments have not used incremental development approaches.  Therefore, OMB could use TechStat sessions as a powerful tool to turn  around investments that are not being acquired incrementally. However,  OMB staff members from the Office of E-Government said that OMB has  only held one such TechStat.", "OMB staff from the Office of E-Government explained that, in order to  select investments in need of a TechStat session, agency exhibit 300  data are reviewed for evidence of poor performance. However, the  usefulness of the exhibit 300 data for the purpose of identifying whether  investments are using incremental approaches is limited. For example,  OMB does not require agencies to explicitly identify whether their  investments are using incremental approaches. Additionally, of the 89  selected investments, 34 had activities in their exhibit 300 submissions  that were inaccurately classified as delivering functionality (9 from  Defense, 8 from HHS, 5 from DHS, 9 from Transportation, and 3 from  VA). For example, one Defense investment indicated that awarding a  contract constituted a delivery of functionality. OMB staff from the Office  of E-Government acknowledged that the exhibit 300 data are not as  helpful as possible in addressing incremental development.  Consequently, for its TechStat reviews, OMB\u2019s insight into investments\u2019  use of incremental development approaches is limited. Officials from  Defense, HHS, DHS, and Transportation attributed the problem to a lack  of guidance from OMB on what is to be delivered every 6 months.  Nevertheless, officials from Defense, DHS, and VA stated that they would  properly classify activities in future exhibit 300 submissions.without additional guidance from OMB, agencies may continue to  improperly classify activities. Additionally, as previously mentioned, four  of the five selected agencies\u2014Defense, HHS, DHS, and Transportation\u2014 have not updated their TechStat policies to include identifying  investments that are not being acquired incrementally.", "Without better implementation of incremental development approaches  and identification of investments using incremental development, IT  expenditures will likely continue to produce disappointing results\u2014 including large cost overruns, long schedule delays, and questionable  mission-related achievements.

Officials from four  of the five agencies indicated that the use of an Agile development  methodology helped them to deliver functionality every 6 months. For  example, Defense officials explained that the use of Agile  development processes allowed software to be broken into smaller  releases that were easily achieved, tested, and fielded.

In addition, VA  officials reported that their ability to retain key personnel with both  functional and technical expertise has enabled them to deliver high- quality functionality rapidly.", "Programs successfully implemented cost and schedule estimating  best practices. Officials from four of the five agencies cited the  implementation of cost and schedule estimating practices as enabling  the frequent delivery of functionality. For example, Defense officials  told us that development of realistic cost estimates and  comprehensive program schedules helped programs to deliver  functionality while meeting established performance goals. Further,  Transportation officials stated that improved guidance and training on  cost estimating and scheduling helped them to deliver functionality in  6-month cycles.", "Officials used various contracting strategies to increase flexibility and  improve contractor oversight. Officials from four of the five agencies  cited the use of specific contracting strategies. For example, DHS  officials indicated that they worked with contractors to modify their  contracts from the traditional waterfall approach to a structure that  allows for Agile development.

Table 6 shows the distribution of the seven factors among the agencies,  and examples of how the factors impacted the agencies are discussed  following the table.", "Programs did not receive sufficient funding or received funding later  than needed. Officials from all five departments cited insufficient  funding, such as reductions caused by the fiscal year 2013 sequester,  or receiving funding later than needed because of continuing  resolutions. For example, Defense officials representing one of the  investments we reviewed stated that furloughs brought on by the 2013  sequester significantly impacted program schedules, both in terms of  lost work days and the inability to coordinate integration between  software providers, resulting in overall inefficiencies. In addition,  several FAA officials explained that the delivery of planned  functionality was adversely affected by the uncertainty brought about  by the 2013 sequester, and that future funding instability has impacted  the agency\u2019s ability to plan when functionality is to be delivered.", "Program characteristics made rapid delivery of functionality infeasible  or impractical. Officials from all five agencies indicated that some of  their programs have certain characteristics\u2014such as the deployment  of new physical infrastructure, human health and safety concerns, or  external dependencies\u2014that make the delivery of functionality in 6- month time frames infeasible or impractical. For example, DHS  officials explained that their infrastructure projects cannot deliver  functionality until all key activities (e.g., land acquisition,  environmental assessments, site preparation, and construction) have  been completed and the new infrastructure has been fully deployed,  tested, and accepted. Additionally, Transportation officials reported  that air traffic control systems require years of development and  testing in order to ensure that the systems do not compromise  airspace security.", "Programs did not have stable, prioritized requirements. Officials from  all five agencies stated that not having complete requirements at the  beginning of their investments\u2019 development or having changes made  to requirements and their relative priorities during development was a  factor that negatively affected their programs\u2019 delivery of incremental  functionality in 6-month periods. For example, HHS officials  representing one of the selected investments explained that that final  rules detailing eligibility for a medical program were not completed  until late in the development cycle; consequently, the program could  not define the corresponding business requirements in time to meet  the development schedule. Further, VA officials stated that schedules  are disrupted when stakeholders identify new program requirements  that must be delivered before others.", "Development work was slowed by inefficient governance and  oversight processes. Officials from three of the five agencies cited  inefficient governance and oversight processes. For example, DHS  officials representing the Office of the CIO stated that the current DHS  governance model was not conducive to frequent delivery of  functionality. To illustrate, those officials noted that it can take up to 2  months to schedule a meeting with DHS review boards prior to  releasing functionality. However, a DHS official from Program  Accountability and Risk Management disagreed with this statement,  explaining that DHS\u2019s acquisition review boards perform reviews very  quickly, and that any delays in completing these reviews are  attributable to investments being unprepared. Further, DHS Office of  the CIO officials suggested that governance over programs using an  Agile development methodology should be performed at the lowest  practicable level of the organization. In addition, VA officials explained  that, although the periodic approvals required of various department  groups are useful, these approvals can slow the testing and release  processes and could use further streamlining.", "Development schedules were impeded by procurement delays.", "Officials from three of the five agencies explained that procurement  delays\u2014such as delays in getting contracts awarded or approving  contract modifications\u2014contributed to difficulties in delivering  incremental functionality.

Officials from three of the five agencies indicated that  they did not have enough program staff with the expertise and  experience necessary to deliver functionality every 6 months. For  example, officials representing one of the HHS investments stated  that the loss of key personnel and the lack of staff with knowledge and  skill in key disciplines, such as incremental development, have  negatively impacted the agency\u2019s ability to deliver functionality.", "Incremental development was impeded by select technologies.  Officials from three of the five agencies in our review explained that  the software and tools they selected for their programs either  introduced delays in development or were ultimately not usable by the  program. Transportation officials representing one of the selected  investments reported that their chosen technology added a new level  of complexity to storage and data processing that required all  development and testing to be completed before the implementation  could occur. As a result, those officials told us that all functionality had  to be deployed in one release, instead of being spread out in stages.", "Many of the factors that the five agencies identified as inhibiting delivery  of functionality in 6-month increments were consistent with our work on  the challenges we identified in the application of Agile software  development methods.deploying software developed using an Agile development method is that  traditional governance and oversight activities were difficult to execute   For example, we noted that one challenge in  within an iterative time frame.

OMB explained that changing  the requirement from 6 to 12 months would reduce the emphasis on  incremental development that it has been advocating. OMB also  noted that it believes requiring investments to deliver functionality  every 6 months is an appropriate governmentwide goal and said that  updating and clarifying its guidance on incremental development will  make it easier for agencies to meet this target.

We  therefore maintain that OMB should require projects associated with  major IT investments to deliver functionality at least every 12 months.", "In written comments, Defense stated that it generally concurred with  the report and outlined planned actions to address the  recommendations. However, Defense explained that many of its IT  investments are consistent with the three types of investments for  which it may not always be practical or necessary to expect  functionality to be delivered in 6-month cycles or have other  exceptional circumstances. Given these issues, Defense stated that  requiring the delivery of functionality every 12 months is not a useful  management constraint. However, as we state in our report, many  failed projects have been broadly scoped in that they aim to deliver  their capabilities several years after initiation. Additionally, the  Defense Science Board reported that Defense\u2019s acquisition process  for IT systems was too long, was ineffective, and did not  accommodate the rapid evolution of IT. In order to resolve these  issues, we continue to believe that investments and their projects  should deliver functionality more frequently. In addition, the existence  of many investments that are consistent with the three types of  investments identified in this report for which it may not be practical to  deliver functionality quickly does not excuse Defense from the  requirement of delivering functionality every 12 months. Consistent  with our recommendation to OMB, investments and projects that meet  these three exceptions should be exempt from the requirement, but all  other investments and projects should aim to meet this requirement.  Further, we expect that Defense\u2019s actions to implement our  recommendation to consider the factors identified in this report that  enable and inhibit incremental development will help its investments  and projects deliver functionality more rapidly.

To choose the agencies\u2019 investments, we identified the 98 major IT  investments for which the selected agencies planned to spend more than  50 percent of the investments\u2019 fiscal year 2013 and 2014 budgets on  development, modernization, and enhancement as reported in OMB\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 exhibit 53. We removed 9 investments because, after  reporting their planned budgets for OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2014 exhibit 53,  these investments changed their budgets so that they no longer planned  to spend more than 50 percent of the investments\u2019 fiscal year 2013 and   The  2014 budgets on development, modernization, and enhancement.final 89 investments are identified in appendix II. The investments  selected for the review account for about 58 percent of the development,  modernization, and enhancement spending on all federal agencies\u2019 major  IT investments for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 reported in OMB\u2019s exhibit  53 for fiscal year 2014.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed OMB guidance related to the  use of incremental development, as well as industry guidance, and  identified three key components of incremental development that  agencies should include in their policies. In order to identify these  components, we reviewed OMB\u2019s guidance and leading industry  guidance on institutionalizing processes throughout an organization.analysis identified three key policy components that will help agencies  effectively implement OMB\u2019s requirement for incremental development.", "Require delivery of functionality every 6 months. According to the  Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) Capability Maturity Model\u00ae  Integration for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ), as part of institutionalizing a  process, organizations should document their processes, to include  defining standards and requirements. According to OMB budget  guidance, projects associated with major IT investments must deliver  functionality every 6 months.", "Define functionality. As previously stated, according to SEI\u2019s CMMI- ACQ, as part of institutionalizing a process, organizations should  document that process, to include defining standards and  requirements.", "Define a process for enforcing compliance. According to SEI\u2019s CMMI- ACQ, as part of institutionalizing a process, organizations should  document that process, including management review activities (e.g.,  taking corrective action when requirements and objectives are not  being satisfied). Additionally, OMB Circular A-130 requires agencies  to ensure that investments comply with their policies. Further,  according to the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2014 Budget, agencies are to  use their TechStat processes to identify investments that are not  being acquired incrementally and undertake corrective actions.", "At each selected agency, we then analyzed agency policies for  incremental development and compared these policies to the three  components identified above.", "For each agency, each policy component was assessed as either being  not met\u2014the agency did not provide evidence that addressed the  component or provided evidence that minimally addressed the  component; partially met\u2014the agency provided evidence that addressed  about half or a large portion of the component; or fully met\u2014the agency  provided evidence that addressed the component. We also interviewed  officials from OMB and the five selected agencies to obtain information  about their current and future incremental development policies.", "To address our second objective, we administered a data collection  instrument to each of the selected investments about how often each  investment planned to deliver functionality during fiscal years 2013 and  2014. We then analyzed information obtained from data collection  instruments describing how often the selected investments planned to  deliver functionality. We prepopulated these instruments with data  obtained from OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2014 exhibit 53, as well as each  investment\u2019s exhibit 300 data, which describe the investments\u2019 projects  and how often each project plans to deliver functionality. We asked  officials from each investment to verify the accuracy and completeness of  the data and to make corrections where needed. Because the exhibit 300  data did not always describe the investments\u2019 plans for delivering  functionality in fiscal year 2014, we asked the officials to indicate for each  project whether they planned to deliver functionality in the first half of  fiscal year 2014 (i.e., from October 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014) and in the  second half of fiscal year 2014 (i.e., from April 1, 2014, to September 30,  2014). We also asked the investments to provide their life-cycle cost  estimates and, for each project, the development methodology used and  phase of the acquisition life cycle.", "Using the information obtained through the data collection instruments,  we determined the extent to which the selected investments and their  projects planned to meet OMB\u2019s guidance on incremental development.  To assess whether investments had planned to deliver functionality every  6 months, we determined whether the selected investments planned to  deliver functionality in each of the following four time frames: (1) the first  half of fiscal year 2013 (i.e., from October 1, 2012, to March 31, 2013), (2)  the second half of fiscal year 2013 (i.e., from April 1, 2013, to September  30, 2013), (3) the first half of fiscal year 2014, and (4) the second half of  fiscal year 2014. To determine whether investments had planned to  deliver functionality every 12 months, we analyzed whether the selected  investments planned to deliver functionality in each of the following two  time frames: (1) fiscal year 2013 and (2) fiscal year 2014. We presented  our results to the five selected agencies and OMB and solicited their input  and explanations for the results.", "To determine the reliability of the exhibit 300 data, we performed three  steps. First, as previously mentioned, we asked officials from each  investment to verify the accuracy and completeness of these data and  provide the correct information where needed. Second, we removed  projects that were not intended to deliver functionality and activities that  were inaccurately classified as resulting in the delivery of functionality. To  do so, we compared the descriptions of the projects and activities with a  definition of functionality that we developed. To develop this definition, we   reviewed OMB and agency guidance, as well as leading practices.We defined functionality as follows: the implementation of IT requirements  that is intended to either (1) ultimately be used by one or more customers  in production (actual deployment may occur at a later date than when the  functionality is reported as being delivered) or (2) be a delivery of a  prototype or pilot. We then assessed the descriptions of the activities and  projects agencies reported in their exhibit 300 submissions against our  definition. We presented the activities and projects that did not meet our  definition to the selected agencies and solicited their input and  explanations. Third, where there was a conflict between the exhibit 300  data and agencies\u2019 answers to our questions regarding plans for  delivering functionality in fiscal year 2014, we presented the conflict to the  agencies and obtained clarification. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report, which is to determine the  extent to which the selected investments planned to deliver functionality  every 6 and 12 months, during fiscal years 2013 and 2014.", "GAO, Information Technology: Critical Factors Underlying Successful Major  Acquisitions, GAO-12-7 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 21, 2011). methods. Additionally, we compared the factors to OMB\u2019s 25 Point  Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology  Management.", "Further, because Defense guidance encourages investments to deliver  functionality every 12-18 months where possible, we asked the selected  investments and officials from Defense\u2019s Office of the CIO to identify the  key factors that have both enabled and inhibited their efforts to deliver  functionality for their major IT investments every 12-18 months. We  compared the information we received to the eight factors the five  selected agencies commonly identified as enabling incremental  development during a 6-month period and the seven factors commonly  identified by the five agencies as inhibiting incremental development  during a 6-month period. We also performed a content analysis of the  information we received in order to identify additional factors.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to May 2014, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
