Since 1990, because of concerns about Education\u2019s vulnerabilities to losses due to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, GAO has included student financial aid on our high-risk list. To address these and other longstanding management weaknesses, Congress amended the Higher Education Act in 1998, establishing FSA as a performance-based organization (PBO) within the Department of Education. A PBO is intended to transform the delivery of public services by having the organization commit to achieving specific measurable goals with targets for improvement in exchange for being allowed to operate without the constraints of certain rules and regulations to achieve these targets. As a PBO, FSA specifies how it will achieve these targets through its performance plan, which includes its longer-term strategic goals and annual performance goals as well as strategies that it will use. In creating the PBO, Congress provided FSA, subject to the direction of the secretary of education, with more flexibility to manage its operations while requiring Education to retain policy-making functions. It has been more than three years since Congress created the PBO at FSA.", "To respond to your interests concerning FSA\u2019s progress since becoming a PBO, we focused our review on addressing three questions: 1.  What FSA has done to develop and implement a strategic direction\u2014its plan for achieving the goals Congress specified for it in the PBO legislation\u2014to accomplish its mission, 2.  What human capital strategies FSA has adopted to ensure that it can carry out its mission, and 3.  What steps Education has taken to clarify FSA\u2019s level of independence and its relationship with other Education offices.", "To identify this information, we reviewed FSA\u2019s strategic and annual performance plans and annual reports. We interviewed Education and FSA officials in headquarters and FSA officials in 5 of its 10 regional offices\u2014 Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. We selected these regional offices primarily because they oversee the largest number of postsecondary institutions and because they oversee a variety of public and private institutions. We also met with representatives of the secretary of education\u2019s Management Improvement Team. We interviewed experts in federal agency/union relationships, higher education associations, an official with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (also established as a PBO), and officials with Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG). We used our Human Capital Self-Assessment Checklist and Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool to assist us in reviewing FSA\u2019s actions.", "We conducted our work between March 2001 and March 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FSA manages and administers student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended.

Annually, these programs provide more than $50 billion in student aid to approximately 8 million students and their families. As a consequence, the student financial aid environment is large and complex. It involves about 5,300 schools authorized to participate in the title IV program, 4,100 lenders, and 36 guaranty agencies. Currently, FSA oversees or directly manages approximately $200 billion in outstanding loans representing about 100 million borrowers.", "Congress has recognized the need to make federal agencies more results- oriented by shifting from a focus on adherence to required processes to a focus on achieving program results and customer satisfaction. Toward this end, Congress established PBOs, which are discrete management units remaining in their current department under the policy guidance of the department secretary. PBOs are to commit to clear management objectives and specific targets for improved performance. These clearly defined performance goals, coupled with flexibility in managing operations and direct ties between the achievement of performance goals and the pay and tenure of the head of the PBO and other senior managers are intended to lead to improved performance.", "In October 1998, Congress established FSA as the government\u2019s first PBO. As defined in the legislation, the specific purposes of the PBO are to improve service in the student financial assistance programs; reduce costs of administering the programs; increase accountability of officials;   provide a greater flexibility in management;  integrate information systems;  implement an open, common, integrated delivery system; and   develop and maintain a system containing complete, accurate and timely data to ensure program integrity.", "FSA\u2019s enabling legislation also, among other things, requires the appointment of a chief operating officer; requires the development of 5-year and annual performance plans; requires the PBO, through the secretary, to report annually on the performance of the PBO; requires the PBO to have performance agreements for the COO and other senior managers; requires the COO in consultation with the secretary to appoint a student loan ombudsman; allows for the payment of performance bonuses to the COO and other senior managers; allows FSA to make use of certain personnel and procurement flexibilities.", "We have reported on selected agencies\u2019 use of performance agreements, including FSA, the Department of Transportation, and the Veterans Health Administration. Although these three agencies developed and implemented agreements that reflected their specific organizational priorities, structures and cultures, we identified five common emerging benefits from each agency\u2019s use of the agreements. These emerging benefits include: strengthened alignments of results-oriented goals with daily operations, collaboration across organizational boundaries, enhanced opportunities to discuss and routinely use performance information to make program improvements, results-oriented basis for individual accountability, and continuity of program goals during leadership transitions.", "In addition to FSA, other PBOs include the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), established as a PBO in March 2000, and the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Air Traffic Organization (ATO), in December 2000. Similar to FSA, USPTO, and ATO are subject to the policy direction of their parent departments and are to have the flexibility and independence to operate more like a business, with greater autonomy over their budget, hiring, and procurements in carrying out their functions. Further, USPTO and ATO are also required to designate an individual responsible for operational improvements, develop multiyear and annual performance plans, implement performance agreements, and provide for performance bonuses.", "The British Next Steps initiative was used as a model in crafting the PBO concept in the United States. The Next Steps agencies\u2014now known as executive agencies\u2014are still the predominant form of service delivery in the United Kingdom.

Finally, FSA and the department have not met its requirement to report annually to Congress on its progress in meeting the goals laid out in its performance plan, along with other requirements specified in the PBO legislation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FSA Has Three Strategic Goals Addressing Important Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s performance plan discusses strategic goals for increasing customer and employee satisfaction and reducing unit costs. In addition, it includes measures for gauging FSA progress in meeting each of these strategic goals. (See table 1.) FSA\u2019s management uses these goals and associated performance measures to determine areas for quality improvement, monitor changes in customer perceptions, and evaluate the success of ongoing quality improvement efforts in its student aid delivery.", "To measure customer and employee satisfaction, FSA uses the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and the Gallup Q12, respectively. Both measures are used by the private sector and other government entities, and, as a result, FSA can compare its own scores with those of others. FSA\u2019s scores on both the ACSI and Gallup Q12 increased from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2001, suggesting improvement in both areas. Indeed, comments from representatives from several higher education associations we interviewed and who work closely with FSA also suggest that customer satisfaction has improved. For example, an association official noted the willingness of FSA managers to listen and learn from students, schools, and lending institutions.", "To track reductions in costs, FSA has developed a unit cost measure. FSA uses the measure to demonstrate how it is reducing the cost of administering the student aid programs. However, FSA\u2019s current calculation has some limitations in this regard. First, in calculating unit cost, FSA divides budget obligations (an obligation reserves funds for an eventual cash payment for goods and services) by the total number of people who received aid. This means that FSA\u2019s unit cost does not measure costs, per se. Further, the unit cost calculation does not include obligations FSA sees as beyond its control\u2014obligations for services shared with the department (e.g., telecommunications) and obligations associated with loan consolidation, which is influenced by demand, for example. Obligations FSA considers as fully under its control include those for salaries and benefits, operations and modernization contracts, and general operations, such as travel, training, printing, and equipment. This means that unit cost does not measure total obligations per person receiving aid. Second, the way FSA currently calculates unit cost is a change from the way it calculated it in the past. This change makes comparing unit cost across years difficult. In 1998 through 2000, FSA calculated unit cost by dividing the actual cost (those it considered under its control) of administering student aid (instead of budget obligations) by the total number of people who had received aid. According to FSA officials, FSA changed the calculation of unit cost to make it more useful as a management tool, in part because actual costs for a particular year are sometimes not known until well into the next fiscal year and because managers are more accustomed to using budget obligations, in part because of their experience in using obligations in budget formulation and execution. Using actual cost in the calculation, the unit cost in fiscal year 2000 was $19.08. When FSA recalculated unit cost for fiscal year 2000 using budget obligations instead, the amount changed to $20.14.", "FSA officials told us that they believe the unit cost measure is a useful tool for internal management information purposes, allowing managers to gauge the efficiency of their operations and to highlight, for its employees, the importance of reducing costs. Although these are important objectives, FSA\u2019s unit cost measure is less useful to congressional decision makers because, among other things, FSA does not include all program obligations in the measure nor explain the basis of its measure in reporting on its performance. According to the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), decision makers in Congress as well as the public should be provided with information on the full costs of programs and their outputs. The FASAB has also stated that agencies should develop and report cost information on consistent bases and that using different accounting bases and measurement methods can confuse users of cost information. Because FSA does not relate its unit cost measures to total program costs and because it has changed its method for calculating it, it is difficult to discern whether changes in the measure are indicative of changes in total program costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSA\u2019s Performance Plan Can Be More Useful to Congressional Decision Makers, Especially with Respect to Systems Integration and Enhancing Program Integrity", "paragraphs": ["In addressing systems integration and program integrity, FSA\u2019s performance plan has several limitations. It is not always obvious how the goals and strategies included in the plan relate to systems integration, or how FSA can effectively assess systems integration by relying on measures for its strategic goals. Moreover, the performance plan provides only limited information regarding FSA\u2019s strategies for achieving program integrity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Systems Integration", "paragraphs": ["Congress designated FSA as a PBO, in part, to encourage the integration of the many, disparate information systems used to deliver student financial aid. In 1997, we reported that Education would likely be unable to correct longstanding problems resulting from a lack of integration across its student financial aid systems until a sound systems architecture was established and effectively implemented. FSA subsequently devised an enterprise-wide systems architecture in response to our conclusion that such an architecture was needed, and in response to our related recommendations. As part of its continuing systems integration efforts, FSA recently initiated a new approach, commonly referred to as middleware, to provide users with a more complete and integrated view of information contained in multiple databases. We recently reported that in selecting middleware, FSA adopted a viable, industry-accepted means for integrating and using its existing data on student loans and grants. FSA\u2019s implementation of the middleware technology remains in its early stages. FSA now needs to properly implement and manage its strategy. If implemented and managed properly, this new technology should help ameliorate FSA\u2019s longstanding database integration problems.", "While FSA\u2019s strategy for integrating its many computer systems shows promise, both we and Education\u2019s IG have found that neither its performance plans nor its subsequent annual reports readily provide information about its progress in integrating systems. As a step toward providing this information, the IG recommended that FSA include an overall systems integration goal that was objective, quantifiable, and measurable. The IG stated that an overall systems integration goal would help to inform Congress and others of FSA\u2019s progress in integrating systems. However, FSA\u2019s COO disagreed with this recommendation, arguing that FSA could not achieve its strategic goals without integrating its systems and therefore a distinct systems integration goal was unnecessary.", "While FSA\u2019s performance plans included numerous goals and strategies, it is not always obvious how they relate to systems integration. For example, the performance plan identifies one of FSA\u2019s strategies as \u201ccreate the data mart.\u201d However, what the data mart is or how completing it would bring FSA closer toward integrating its systems is never explained. Similarly, in an earlier performance plan, FSA referred readers to its Modernization Blueprint\u2014 its plan for integrating and modernizing its student aid information systems\u2014for additional information on its goals and strategies. However, Education\u2019s IG characterized the Modernization Blueprint as lengthy, complex and lacking clear performance goals and measures.", "FSA relies on the measures for its strategic goals to reflect the results of its system integration effort, even though they were not specifically designed to do so. Many factors unrelated to FSA\u2019s systems integration efforts influence these measures. FSA\u2019s technical assistance activities, for example, may result in increased customer satisfaction even though these activities do not involve systems integration. On the other hand, FSA could make technological progress in integrating its systems that would not be evident to the customer. For example, before implementing systems to integrate databases, FSA spends considerable time developing the databases. Measures of customer satisfaction would not capture these initial efforts. As a result, FSA\u2019s customer satisfaction measure may not fully reflect progress made or lack of progress with regard to systems integration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Integrity", "paragraphs": ["Another goal Congress prescribed for FSA was to enhance program integrity. FSA had no strategic goal for program integrity in its fiscal year 2001 and earlier performance plans, but draft documents FSA provided to us suggest that its fiscal year 2002 plan may include such a goal. It is unclear from these draft documents, however, how FSA will define measurable outcomes to demonstrate its progress in enhancing program integrity. FSA works to ensure program integrity in many ways, including providing technical assistance to schools to increase compliance with regulations, working to prevent defaults, and collecting on defaulted loans.", "FSA\u2019s draft fiscal year 2002 performance plan reflects its increasing reliance on providing technical assistance to schools as a way to ensure their compliance with financial aid rules and regulations. In the past, FSA relied much more extensively on conducting on-site program reviews to assess schools\u2019 compliance with rules and regulations. The following list, taken from FSA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan, shows the technical assistance strategies FSA plans to implement during fiscal year 2002:   Develop and deliver a series of services to new schools, which includes assistance during the first 12 months of their participation in Title IV programs.

Identify areas for improving compliance effectiveness and take the appropriate steps to fix them.", "While FSA has developed strategies intended to improve schools\u2019 regulatory compliance, it is not clear how FSA will know whether its strategies are effective. First, FSA has not developed an indicator of schools\u2019 compliance. Second, while FSA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan defines success for the strategies shown above, the definitions may not be appropriate. For example, FSA plans to conduct at least three national conferences for schools to disseminate information about student financial aid programs and processes including program integrity. FSA states that high scores on participant evaluations of these national conferences will indicate its success in disseminating this information. While participant evaluations may reflect the quality of presentations, they will not indicate whether the information helped institutions comply with applicable laws, regulations, and procedures.", "Another way that FSA ensures program integrity is through its efforts to collect and prevent defaulted student loans. FSA\u2019s draft fiscal year 2002 performance plan specifies the goals it has for default management; however, it includes only limited information about the strategies it will use to achieve those goals. For example, in its fiscal year 2002 plan, FSA includes the following goals for default management: increase the fiscal year 2002 default recovery rate to 15 percent, ensure that the defaults recovered exceed the total default claims for the fiscal year, demonstrate the pursuit of improved default management and prevention strategies, and keep the default rate under 8 percent. FSA\u2019s plan, however, only includes one strategy to address these goals\u2014expand the use of the National Directory of New Hires\u2014a database matching program\u2014to recover $200 million in defaulted student loans.

Some staff reported that it was difficult to understand how they could influence scores for customer satisfaction and unit cost measures.

Despite attempts to finalize the report, Education, in a subsequent review of the draft late in the year, still found that the report did not comply with statutory requirements.

According to FSA officials, the realignment was intended to improve the organization\u2019s performance and increase coordination of mission-critical activities. FSA also created a number of \u201centerprise\u201d units to support the channels by focusing on internal customer or stakeholder needs. These units, each with its own enterprise director, focus on activities such as analysis, communications, and human resources. The operations of the chief financial officer (CFO) and chief information officer (CIO) are considered support organizations responsible for technical and financial management practices and infrastructure.

The council is comprised of the COO, CIO, CFO, each of the channel general managers, and representatives from FSA\u2019s primary contractors responsible for modernizing information systems.", "To hold FSA accountable for achieving results, FSA\u2019s enabling legislation requires the COO and each senior manager to enter into an annual performance agreement that sets forth measurable organizational and individual goals. According to FSA officials, the organization\u2019s annual performance plan serves as the basis of these agreements. The annual goals and strategies for which each manager has responsibility serve as his or her agreement. Since the annual goals and strategies contribute to one or more of FSA\u2019s three strategic goals, the performance agreements ensure that managers are responsible for contributing to the organization\u2019s overall performance. For example, a channel manager may be responsible for increasing the number of aid applications filed electronically and, in so doing, help FSA achieve its strategic goals of increasing employee and customer satisfaction and reducing unit cost. Each fall, senior managers submit to the COO a document indicating how their work over the prior year has led to the accomplishment of the annual goals and strategies in their performance agreements. If they achieve their goals, they are awarded bonuses\u201450 percent of the bonus is based on the COO\u2019s evaluation of the managers\u2019 overall contribution; the remaining 50 percent is based on the extent to which FSA reached its three strategic goals.

The PDP has two core components\u2014improving employee performance by introducing Individual Development Plans (IDP) to the workforce and documenting employee skills through a comprehensive skills catalogue\u2014intended to identify employees\u2019 training needs. IDPs would allow all staff to link their professional goals to the goals of FSA by developing work plans in collaboration with their supervisors. FSA managers would appraise employees\u2019 job performance by determining whether they\u2019ve met, exceeded, or failed to reach the goals they have self- assigned in their IDP. The second part of the PDP, the skills catalogue, will attempt to allow FSA managers to identify employees\u2019 training needs by ascertaining the skills they already have.", "FSA proposed the PDP not only as a sound human capital management tool, but also in order to meet legislative requirements. The PBO legislation requires FSA to establish a performance management system that creates goals for the performance of employees, groups, and the organization consistent with the PBO\u2019s performance plan. Despite the steps discussed above, FSA\u2019s relationship with its union has made implementation of many of these initiatives difficult. Both FSA and union officials have had difficulty negotiating on related proposals. According to its collective bargaining agreement, the union has the opportunity to review actions affecting any aspect of employee working conditions, including those related to training, development, and appraisals. According to an FSA official, because FSA and the union could not reach agreement on the proposed PDP, due to unresolved differences regarding the appraisal component of the PDP, FSA has recently withdrawn the proposal from negotiations, leaving the status of an integral component of its human capital plans undecided."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Education Continues to Take Steps to Clarify FSA\u2019s Level of Independence", "paragraphs": ["Education continues to take steps to clarify FSA\u2019s level of independence and its relationship with other Education offices.

To address this issue, Education and FSA, under the previous administration, developed and signed memorandums of understanding (MOU) to specify the authorities provided to FSA and procedures concerning how FSA would interact with other Education offices. With the arrival of the current administration in January 2001, Education established special interim procedures for all its department units, including FSA, that were intended to ensure that personnel and financial resources are managed effectively and efficiently throughout the department while long term management plans are being developed.

Interviews with FSA and former Education officials indicated that together they struggled with balancing the PBO\u2019s independence and identifying how the organization fit into the structure of the department. For example, issues of service duplication with other Education offices in areas like human resources and information technology had to be balanced with FSA\u2019s desire to mold these functions to meet its mission. To address such issues, the department and FSA, under the previous administration, developed and signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) for human resource management, acquisition and contracting, and information technology. These documents delegated certain authorities to the COO and set out policies and guidelines to be followed because FSA\u2019s operations in these areas interacted with the rest of the department. For example, in the area of human resources, the MOU delegated authority for, among other things, establishing the performance management system and hiring to FSA.

In contrast to the past, FSA is currently subject to special interim procedures established by the department for all of its units in January 2001 and updated in September 2001. According to a departmental memo, the special procedures were put into place to allow the department to manage its personnel and financial resources in the most effective and efficient ways possible and in accordance with the President\u2019s Management Agenda. An overall strategy for improving the management and performance of the federal government, the Agenda specifically includes taking actions that result in FSA\u2019s student financial aid programs no longer being designated as high risk by GAO. The special procedures, for principal offices with senior political appointees in place, require prior departmental approval to (1) advertise and fill positions at the senior level, (2) reassign employees, (3) hire or continue the services of any consultant, or (4) award any new contracts above $100,000. The special procedures pertaining to FSA are stricter and the same as those applicable to principal offices with vacancies at the senior political level. These procedures require department-level officials to review and act on all administrative, management, and policy issues. As a result of these changes, FSA\u2019s independence has lessened.

As noted in its Blueprint, the department is reviewing the prior MOUs to \u201cdetermine what is and is not working as intended.\u201d The Blueprint also provides that after consultation with the community and members of Congress, the department will resolve relationship issues between FSA and other department offices. To help develop comprehensive strategies to implement its Blueprint, the department is currently working with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and the Private Sector Council(PSC).

As we have discussed, elements of PBO reform include an expectation for results in exchange for flexibility. Although established as a PBO for a relatively short time, FSA has made important progress in undertaking reforms and its performance to date, as reflected in gains in customer and employee satisfaction, shows promise. Despite these gains, FSA needs to make additional improvements. As a PBO, FSA must ensure that it meets its obligation to report the progress it is making towards the goals Congress established for it. Key to reporting results is submitting complete, useful, and timely information to Congress. Because of the longstanding concerns over FSA\u2019s lack of the financial and management information needed to ensure the integrity of the student financial aid programs, FSA needs to clearly inform Congress and the public of its progress in addressing this issue. In particular, FSA needs to improve its reporting of the progress it is making with regard to implementing its plans for integrating its student financial aid data systems and enhancing the integrity of its student loan and grant programs. In addition, in light of the complexity of FSA\u2019s unit cost calculation as well as recent changes in how it calculates costs, it will be important for FSA to disclose these issues in future performance plans and reports. FSA also needs to ensure it makes human capital management an integral part of its strategic approach for accomplishing its mission.
