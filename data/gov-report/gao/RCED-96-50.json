Although the Fund has historically been financially self-sufficient, it began to experience substantial losses during the 1980s, primarily because foreclosure rates on single-family homes supported by the Fund were high in economically stressed regions.

The primary purpose of FHA\u2019s Fund is to insure private lenders against losses on mortgages that finance purchases of one to four housing units. There are two primary sources and three uses of cash for the Fund. The two sources of cash are income from mortgagees\u2019 premiums and net proceeds from the sale of foreclosed properties. The three uses of cash are (1) payments associated with claims on foreclosed properties, (2) refunds of premiums on mortgages that are prepaid, and (3) administrative expenses for management of the program.", "To cover losses, FHA deposits insurance premiums from participating borrowers in the Fund. According to 12 U.S.C. 1711, the Fund must meet or endeavor to meet statutory capital ratio requirements; that is, it must contain sufficient reserves and funding to cover estimated future losses resulting from the payment of claims on defaulted mortgages and administrative costs. A determination of reserves and funding to cover estimated future losses requires the use of an accrual basis of accounting. The accrual concept is particularly important for an entity such as FHA (or any insurance enterprise) because the actual payout or collection of cash may precede or follow the event that gave rise to the cash transaction by a substantial time period. Thus, a favorable cash position, or positive cash flow, at any given point may not reflect the true financial position of the entity.", "The Fund remained relatively healthy until the 1980s, when losses were substantial primarily because foreclosure rates were high in economically stressed regions, particularly in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest regions. For example, in fiscal year 1988, the Fund lost $1.4 billion. If the Fund were to be exhausted, the U.S. Treasury would have to directly cover lenders\u2019 claims and administrative costs.", "Reforms designed to restore financial stability to the Fund and to correct problems in loan origination and property disposition were initiated by the Congress and HUD. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508), enacted in November 1990, contained reforms to FHA\u2019s single-family mortgage insurance program designed to place the Fund on a financially sound basis. The legislation, among other things, required FHA borrowers to pay more in insurance premiums over the life of the loans by adding a risk-based annual premium to the one-time, up-front premium. It effectively raised the present value of the insurance premium from 3.8 percent of the loan amount to from 5.5 to 6.8 percent, depending on the amount of the down payment made. It accomplished this change via two actions: lowering the up-front premium from 3.8 to 2.25 percent of the loan amount over a 4-year transitional period and, during the same period, phasing in a new annual premium of 0.5 percent of the loan balances. Those borrowers who make higher down payments pay the annual premium for a shorter period.", "Other changes made by the legislation in response to the Fund\u2019s financial problems included (1) limiting the loan-to-value ratio to a maximum of 97.75 percent of the value of homes appraised at more than $50,000 and (2) effectively suspending the payment of distributive shares (distribution of excess revenues to mortgagors) until the Fund is financially sound.", "The legislation also required the Secretary of HUD to endeavor to ensure a capital ratio of 2 percent by November 2000 and maintain that ratio or a higher one at all times thereafter. The act defined the capital ratio as the ratio of the Fund\u2019s capital, or economic net worth, to its unamortized insurance-in-force.", "We and HUD\u2019s Inspector General have been reporting on FHA\u2019s management problems since the early 1980s. We have concluded in previous testimonies and reports that in addition to economic factors, poor program management and waste, fraud, and abuse contributed to the losses sustained by FHA\u2019s Fund. For example, FHA did not have accounting data and internal controls in place to reconcile funds from the sales of government-owned properties with deposits to the U.S. Treasury. As a result, private real estate agents were able to steal millions of dollars by simply retaining the proceeds from the sale of FHA-owned properties rather than transferring the funds to the Treasury.", "HUD\u2019s efforts to improve the financial stability of the Fund have consisted of initiating several audits of the Fund; modifying the program, primarily to tighten controls and improve monitoring; and developing automated systems. For example, to reduce problems with loan origination, HUD tightened its screening of applicants, took steps to improve how it targets its efforts to monitor lenders, and strengthened appraisal requirements. To reduce problems with property disposition, HUD, among other things, tightened controls over closing agents and area management brokers and took actions to improve property pricing and automated accounting and management systems. Any success achieved by HUD and FHA in reducing FHA\u2019s losses through better management will improve the Fund\u2019s financial health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Estimates of the Fund\u2019s Economic Net Worth", "paragraphs": ["The Fund had amortized insurance-in-force valued at about $305 billion as of September 30, 1994.

We generated three different economic scenarios, assuming for each a different rate of appreciation in house prices over the next 30 years. The actual economic net worth and capital ratios of the Fund and the validity of our estimates will depend on a number of future economic factors, including the rate of appreciation in house prices over the life of the FHA mortgages of up to 30 years. This factor is significant because, as house prices rise, the borrowers\u2019 equity increases and the probability of defaults and subsequent foreclosures decreases.

FHA\u2019s streamlined refinanced mortgages accounted for about 40 percent of the loans originated by FHA in fiscal year 1994. About 19 percent of FHA\u2019s amortized insurance-in-force at the end of fiscal year 1994 consisted of streamlined refinanced mortgages for which there is little experience with the tendency for such loans to be foreclosed and/or prepaid. Because FHA insured properties for which mortgages were streamlined refinanced were not required to be appraised, the initial loan-to-value ratio of these loans\u2014a key predictor of the probability of foreclosure\u2014is unknown. The impact of these loans on the financial health of the Fund is probably positive, since they represent preexisting FHA business whose risk has been reduced through lower interest rates and lower monthly payments. However, the lack of experience with these loans increases the uncertainty associated with their expected foreclosure rates.", "This refinancing activity also raises questions about the credit quality of the loans that were not refinanced despite the fall in interest rates. Since, under these circumstances, most borrowers who could refinance would find it to their financial advantage to do so, those borrowers who did not refinance may not have been able to qualify for a new loan. This suggests that future foreclosure rates on these loans, which originated in previous years when interest rates were higher, may be greater than we have forecasted.

While potential home buyers may consider many other factors when financing their mortgages, such as the fact that FHA will finance the up-front premium as part of the mortgage loan, this action by private mortgage insurers could reduce the demand for FHA-insured mortgage loans. In particular, by lowering the required down payment, private mortgage insurers may attract some borrowers who might have otherwise insured their mortgages with FHA. If by selectively offering these low down payment loans, private mortgage insurers are able to attract FHA\u2019s lower-risk borrowers, such as borrowers with better-than-average credit histories or payment-to-income ratios, new FHA loans may become more risky on average.

In its most recent report dated May 8, 1995, Price Waterhouse reported that the Fund had an economic net worth of about $6.68 billion\u2014compared with our baseline estimate of $6.1 billion\u2014and a resulting capital ratio of 1.99 percent of the unamortized insurance-in-force as of the end of fiscal year 1994\u2014compared with our baseline estimate of 2.02 percent of the amortized insurance-in-force. It also reported that the Fund will meet the fiscal year 2000 capital ratio of 2 percent of the unamortized insurance-in-force with a capital ratio of 3.03 percent and that the economic net worth of the Fund will be about $15.2 billion. These projections are based on forecasted economic assumptions and the assumption that FHA does not change its premium and refund policies.", "Although our estimate of the Fund\u2019s economic net worth is lower than Price Waterhouse\u2019s estimate by about 9 percent, in view of the uncertainty associated with any forecast of the performance of the Fund\u2019s loans over their life of up to 30 years, these estimates can be considered roughly equivalent. Each of us used somewhat different modeling techniques and assumptions that account for some of the $580 million difference. However, in general, our model and Price Waterhouse\u2019s rely on many of the same key factors, such as the rates of appreciation in house prices and changes in mortgage interest rates, as important determinants of mortgage terminations and the economic net worth of the Fund.", "However, our estimate of the Fund\u2019s capital ratio is slightly higher than Price Waterhouse\u2019s estimate\u20142.02 percent compared with 1.99 percent\u2014even though our estimate of economic net worth is lower that Price Waterhouse\u2019s. The primary reason for this is the fact that we used a lower insurance-in-force amount ($305 billion of amortized insurance-in-force) to calculate the capital ratio than Price Waterhouse did ($335 billion of unamortized insurance-in-force). As discussed previously, the act defined the capital ratio as the ratio of the Fund\u2019s economic net worth to its unamortized insurance-in-force. However, the act\u2019s definition of unamortized insurance-in-force as the remaining obligation on outstanding mortgages is commonly understood to be the definition of the amortized insurance-in-force.", "The insurance-in-force amount that we used differs from the amount used by Price Waterhouse primarily because we deleted the loan principal payments made on mortgages to date to arrive at an amortized insurance-in-force amount of $305 billion. We calculated the capital ratio on the basis of the amortized insurance-in-force and not on unamortized insurance-in-force, as did Price Waterhouse. We used the amortized insurance-in-force for our calculations because FHA-insured mortgages are in fact fully amortized over the 30-year life of the loans. Therefore, the amortized insurance-in-force represents a better measure of the Fund\u2019s potential liability. Price Waterhouse used the unamortized insurance-in-force for its calculations to be consistent with its previous reports and because the data on unamortized insurance-in-force are considered more reliable than the data on amortized insurance-in-force.

However, it should be recognized that fiscal year 1994 was a good year for FHA because actual economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions were favorable. Nevertheless, forecasting economic net worth and resulting capital ratios to determine whether FHA will have the funds it needs to cover its losses over the life of the loans it has insured for up to 30 years is uncertain.

The comments by the Director, Program Evaluation Division, focused on (1) the effect of proposed changes to FHA\u2019s program and (2) FHA\u2019s actions to improve the financial health of the Fund. Specifically, the Director commented that the draft report\u2019s discussion of proposed changes to the program implied that they would have an exclusively negative impact on the financial health of the Fund. He believes that many of the proposed changes will have a positive effect on the Fund\u2019s financial health. The report was changed to eliminate this implication.", "The Director also commented that the draft report attributed progress in achieving the capital reserve target to favorable actual economic conditions and favorable forecasts of future economic conditions. He pointed out that FHA had taken many actions to improve the financial health of the program, such as revising the premium refund schedule, and that this contribution to economic health should be recognized in our report. We agree. As pointed out in our October 1994 report on the economic net worth of the Fund as of September 30, 1993, we estimated that if FHA had not revised its premium refund schedule, the economic net worth of the Fund would have been about $500 million (10 percent) less than our baseline estimate. We added to our report information on additional actions taken by FHA to improve the financial health of the Fund.", "However, we continue to believe that favorable prevailing and forecasted economic conditions were primarily responsible for this improvement.

On the basis of this examination, we developed econometric and cash flow models to prepare our estimates. For these models, we used data supplied by FHA and DRI/McGraw-Hill, a private economic forecasting company.", "Our econometric analysis estimated the historical relationships between the probability of loan foreclosure and prepayment and key explanatory factors, such as the borrower\u2019s equity and the interest rate. To estimate these relationships, we used data on the performance of FHA-insured home mortgage loans\u2014such as data on foreclosure, prepayment, and loss rates\u2014originated from fiscal year 1975 through fiscal year 1994. Also, using our estimates of these relationships and of economic conditions, we developed a baseline forecast of future loan performance to estimate the Fund\u2019s economic net worth and resulting capital ratio. We then developed additional estimates that assumed higher and lower future rates of appreciation in house prices; the scenario with the lower rates of appreciation of house prices also assumed higher unemployment.", "To estimate the net present value of future cash flows of the Fund, we constructed a cash flow model to measure the primary sources and uses of cash for loans originated from fiscal year 1975 through fiscal year 1994. Our model was constructed to estimate cash flows for each policy year through the life of a mortgage. An important component of the model was the conversion of all income and expense streams\u2014regardless of the period in which they actually occur\u2014into 1994 dollars. In addition to estimating the economic net worth of the Fund as a whole, we also generated approximations of the economic net worth of the loans originated in the 2 most recent fiscal years. To conduct this analysis, it was necessary not only to project future cash flows but also to estimate the level of past cash flows.", "To test the validity of our model, we examined how well our model predicted the actual rates of FHA\u2019s loan foreclosures and prepayments through fiscal year 1994.

This increase is attributable to our estimates of positive contributions to economic net worth made by two factors\u2014the inclusion in our estimate of some fiscal year 1993 loans that had been excluded from our fiscal year 1993 estimate and loans insured by FHA in fiscal year 1994. The increase in economic net worth attributable to these two factors was offset to some extent by our estimate of a decrease in the Fund\u2019s economic net worth from loans insured by FHA in fiscal year 1993 and earlier years. Table I.1 summarizes these factors.", "Data provided by FHA last year and used in our September 30, 1993, economic net worth estimates did not include information on all loan originations and terminations occurring in fiscal year 1993. FHA subsequently updated its records to include the remaining fiscal year 1993 activity. As shown in table I.1, including this loan activity increases our estimate of the Fund\u2019s economic net worth by about $260 million, resulting in a revised estimate of about $5.16 billion as of the end of fiscal year 1993. We also estimate that loans insured by FHA in fiscal year 1994 contributed about $1.4 billion to the economic net worth of the Fund. This represents the third consecutive year in which the Fund\u2019s new loans made a positive contribution to the Fund\u2019s economic net worth. However, this increase in economic net worth was reduced by a $460 million decrease in the economic net worth of loans insured by FHA in fiscal year 1993 and earlier years. As a result, a net increase of $940 million was realized in our baseline estimate during fiscal year 1994, bringing our baseline economic net worth estimate as of September 30, 1994, to $6.1 billion.", "The $460 million decrease in the Fund\u2019s estimated economic net worth for loans insured by FHA in fiscal year 1993 and earlier years is the result of several factors, some of which involved large increases or decreases in economic net worth. Table I.2 summarizes the factors contributing to changes in the economic net worth of loans made in fiscal year 1993 and earlier years.", "We estimate that the economic net worth of the Fund\u2019s loans made in fiscal year 1993 and earlier years increased by about $620 million because updated data showed that these loans performed better in fiscal year 1994 than previously forecasted. This occurred, in part, because during fiscal year 1994, house prices increased more rapidly, and the unemployment rate was lower than in previous economic forecasts. Interest earned on investments accounted for an estimated increase of $618 million.", "Offsetting these increases were several factors that resulted in a decrease in the estimated economic net worth of the Fund\u2019s loans made in fiscal year 1993 and earlier years. A $235 million decrease in economic net worth is attributable to our revised forecasts for loan foreclosures and prepayments for these loans during fiscal year 1995 and beyond. These revisions resulted largely from revised assumptions of future economic conditions that in combination, had a less favorable financial effect on the Fund. A $953 million decrease occurred because our 1994 forecast uses an economic model different from the model we used to derive our fiscal year 1993 estimate. Our revised model uses a different statistical approach and recognizes the higher risks associated with the performance of refinanced and adjustable rate mortgages rather than treating these mortgages like other FHA mortgages, as we have done in the past.

Equity is a measure of the current value of a property compared with the current value of the mortgage on that property. Previous research strongly indicates that borrowers with small amounts of equity or even negative equity are more likely than other borrowers to default. We computed equity as the difference between the value of the property and the value of the mortgage, expressed as a percentage of the value of the property. For example, if the value of a property is $100,000 and the value of the mortgage is $80,000, then equity is 20 percent, or 0.2. To measure equity for modeling the foreclosure behavior of fixed-rate mortgages, we calculated the value of the mortgage as the present value of the remaining mortgage payments (up to a maximum of 10 years), evaluated at the current quarter\u2019s fixed-rate mortgage interest rate, and added the book value of the mortgage at the end of 10 years, thus assuming a prepayment 10 years into the future. We calculated the value of the property by multiplying the value of the property at the time of the loan\u2019s origination by the change in the state\u2019s median nominal house price between the year of origination and the current year. Because the effects on claims of small changes in equity may differ depending on whether the level of equity is high or low, we used a pair of equity variables, LAGEQHI and LAGEQLOW, in our foreclosure regression. The effect of equity is lagged 1 year, since we are predicting the time of foreclosure, which usually occurs many months after a loan first defaults.", "We also included lagged equity in our prepayment regression. We anticipated that higher levels of equity would be associated with an increased likelihood of prepayment. Borrowers with substantial equity in their home may be interested in prepaying their existing mortgage and taking out a larger one to obtain cash for other purposes. Borrowers with little or no equity may be less likely to prepay because they may have to take money from other savings to pay off their loan and cover transaction costs.", "For the prepayment regression, we defined equity as book equity (LAGBKHI and LAGBKLOW).

A borrower\u2019s incentive to prepay is high when the interest rate on a loan is greater than the rate at which money can now be borrowed, and it diminishes as current interest rates increase. To capture the relative attractiveness of prepaying, we calculated the present value of the mortgage payments over the remaining term of the mortgage (up to 10 years) using the currently prevailing mortgage interest rate to estimate the market value of the mortgage. This value was divided by the book value of the mortgage (the unpaid principal balance), and the relative balance was used as an explanatory variable for prepayment.", "In our prepayment regression, we used the two relative interest rate variables defined above, RELEQHI and RELEQLO, so that the effect of changes in relative interest rates could be different over different ranges.

A negative relationship might also exist if a borrower\u2019s passing up of one profitable refinancing opportunity reflected a lack of financial sophistication that in turn, would be associated with passing up additional opportunities. However, a borrower who anticipated moving soon might pass up an apparently profitable refinancing opportunity to avoid the transaction costs associated with refinancing. A positive relationship might exist in this case, with the probability of prepayment if the borrower fulfilled his/her anticipation and moved, thereby prepaying the loan.", "Another explanatory variable is the volatility of interest rates, INTVOL, defined as the standard deviation of the monthly average of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\u2019s series of 30-year fixed-rate mortgage effective interest rates.

Instead, we defined four variables, CHANGEPOS, CHANGENEG, CAPPEDPOS, and CAPPEDNEG, to capture the relationship between current interest rates and the interest rate paid on each mortgage. CHANGEPOS measures how far the interest rate on the mortgage has increased since origination, with a minimum of zero, while CHANGENEG measures how far the rate has decreased, with a maximum of zero. CAPPEDPOS measures how much farther the interest rate on the mortgage will rise, if prevailing interest rates in the market do not change, while CAPPEDNEG measures how much farther the mortgage\u2019s rate will fall if prevailing interest rates do not change. For example, if an ARM is originated at 7 percent and interest rates have increased by 250 basis points 1 year later, CHANGEPOS will equal 100 because FHA\u2019s ARMs can increase by no more than 100 basis points in a year. CAPPEDPOS will equal 150 basis points, since the mortgage rate will eventually increase by another 150 basis points if market interest rates do not change, and CHANGENEG and CAPPEDNEG will equal zero.

Our results also indicate that the probability of foreclosure is higher when the contract rate of interest is higher. Mortgages on more-expensive houses have higher prepayment probabilities. For purchase money mortgages, foreclosure probability declines with the price of a house, but for refinanced mortgages foreclosure probability rises with price.
