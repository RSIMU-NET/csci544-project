We do know, however, that domestic and foreign banks operating in the United States have been increasing their private banking activities and their reliance on income from private banking. The target market for private banking\u2014individuals with high net worth\u2014is also growing and becoming more sophisticated with regard to their product preferences and risk appetites. of the largest monetary penalty ever imposed on a bank in a money laundering-related case.

During these examinations, regulators focus on a bank\u2019s compliance program; internal controls; and, in particular, on its KYC policies. Regulators instruct their examiners to determine whether banks have implemented sound KYC policies in general and to ensure that these policies extend to their private banking activities. Until recently, U.S. regulators were attempting to incorporate KYC requirements as uniform regulations. However, the proposed KYC regulation, which was published for comment in December 1998, was met with an overwhelming public response that raised concerns about the government\u2019s scrutiny of personal banking accounts. In the face of these concerns, U.S. regulators have since withdrawn the proposed regulations. Nevertheless, regulators we interviewed for this statement told us that, during the course of examinations, they continue to verify that banks have prudent banking policies, including KYC policies, that ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.", "Although regulatory efforts to establish uniform KYC requirements have stopped, Congress continues to look for ways to reinforce current anti- money-laundering laws and, more specifically, to promote due diligence in customer banking relationships. For example, the Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services recently introduced legislation that would, among other things, require financial institutions that open or maintain a U.S. account for a non-publicly-traded foreign entity to maintain a record of identity for each beneficial owner of the account. The legislation would also prohibit U.S. depository institutions from maintaining banking relationships with banks that are not licensed to provide services in their home countries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Banking Regulators Focus on Private Banking", "paragraphs": ["The growing importance of private banking over the last several years led the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to undertake a special initiative focusing on private banking that disclosed a number of key weaknesses in selected institutions\u2019 internal controls for detecting or preventing money laundering. In 1996 and 1997, FRBNY attempted to review private banking activities at about 40 domestic and foreign banking institutions in the New York district. During the course of these reviews, examiners focused on assessing each bank\u2019s ability to recognize and manage money laundering risks associated with inadequate knowledge of its clients\u2019 personal and business backgrounds, their sources of wealth, and their use of their private banking accounts.", "FRBNY officials explained to us that most of the banks reviewed had adequate anti-money-laundering programs for their private banking activities, although a few were antiquated and vulnerable to money laundering. Deficiencies identified in the private banking area primarily involved poor internal controls, such as insufficient documentation and inadequate due diligence standards. In a systemwide study conducted during 1998, the Federal Reserve assessed the risk management practices at seven banks with private banking activities. The study found that internal controls and oversight practices over private banking activities were generally strong at banks that focused on high-end domestic clients, while similar controls and oversight practices were seriously weak at banks that focused on higher risk Latin American and Caribbean clients.", "In the latter part of 1997, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency began targeting national banks\u2019 private banking activities based on law enforcement leads or on the bank activities meeting OCC\u2019s high-risk criteria.  A primary focus of these reviews has been the banks\u2019 implementation of sound KYC policies and procedures. In these reviews, OCC targeted 10 high risk national banks for expanded Bank Secrecy Act examinations, three of which focused on the banks\u2019 private banking activities.

Offshore entities, including private investment companies and offshore trusts, provide customers with a high degree of confidentiality and anonymity while offering such other benefits as tax advantages, limited legal liability, and ease of transfer. Detecting or preventing money laundering by offshore entities can pose special difficulties because documentation identifying the individual or group that controls these offshore entities and their U.S. private banking accounts (referred to as their \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d) is frequently maintained in the offshore jurisdiction rather than in the United States.", "Regulators recognize that the use of offshore entities to establish or maintain U.S. private banking accounts tends to obscure the account holders\u2019 true identities. Consequently, they instruct their examiners to look for specific KYC procedures that enable banks to identify and profile the beneficial owners of these offshore entities. In the course of examinations, examiners may test the adequacy of beneficial-owner documentation maintained in the United States.

For this reason, U.S. banking regulators do not attempt to determine whether offshore branches are in compliance with specific anti-money-laundering provisions contained in the Bank Secrecy Act, such as the one requiring that suspicious transactions be reported to U.S. authorities. Instead of monitoring formal compliance, U.S. banking regulators try to identify what efforts the branches are making to combat money laundering and to determine whether the banks\u2019 corporate KYC policies are being applied to activities, such as private banking activities, that the offshore branches may engage in.", "Although examiners are able to review the written policies and procedures being used in these branches, they must rely primarily on the banks\u2019 internal audit functions to verify that the procedures are actually being implemented in offshore branches where U.S. regulators may be precluded from conducting on-site examinations.

Two such deficiencies were inadequate client profiles and weak management information systems. For example, examiners found that some banks\u2019 client profiles contained little or no documentation on the client\u2019s background, source of wealth, or expected account activity, or on client contacts and visits by bank representatives. Examiners also found that some banks\u2019 management information systems did not track client activity or did not allow bankers to systematically examine all accounts related to a given client. Both of these deficiencies make it difficult for banks to monitor clients\u2019 accounts for unusual or suspicious activity, according to the banking regulators.", "At the time of our review in 1998, we noted that most banks with deficiencies identified during FRBNY\u2019s private banking initiative had started to take corrective actions to address these deficiencies.

Updated information on these nine jurisdictions showed that five would allow U.S. regulators to conduct on-site examinations of banking institutions in their jurisdictions and that only two of these five would provide some access to individual bank account information. Each of the jurisdictions had secrecy laws to protect the privacy of individual account owners.  However, some  jurisdictions provided for an exception to their secrecy laws when criminal investigations were involved. We were told that these jurisdictions had established judicial processes through which U.S. and other foreign law enforcement officials could obtain access to individual bank account or customer information.
