The real costs of benefits grew by close to 18 percent, while real wages grew by 10 percent. Wages and benefits increased by about the same percentage for most of the period until 2002, after which time real wages began to stagnate and real benefit costs continued to grow. The increase in the cost of a total benefits package from 1991 to 2005 was largely composed of increases in health insurance and retirement income costs. Paid leave had been the most costly benefit to employers, but by 2005, the cost of health insurance equaled that of paid leave. In comparison to paid leave and health insurance, retirement income was the least costly, but it grew by an estimated 47 percent. During the time under review, employees' access to most benefits remained stable, but participation rates declined for health benefits as the real dollar amount of the premiums increased. Between 1991 and 2003, roughly half of all workers participated in employer-provided retirement plans. Holidays and vacations were generally available to most workers, but a smaller percentage of workers had access to personal and sick leave. A panel of experts from a variety of backgrounds agreed that rising benefit costs are forcing private employers and their employees to make increasingly difficult trade-offs between wages and benefits. They noted that the employer-sponsored system of benefits in its current form may be unsustainable, largely because productivity growth is unlikely to support the rising costs of some benefits, especially escalating health insurance costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Trends in the costs and availability of employer-sponsored  compensation\u2014wages, health insurance, retirement income, and paid  leave\u2014have a significant bearing on U.S. workers and U.S. industry.  Traditionally, employers used robust compensation packages to attract  and retain talented workers in order to maintain their competitiveness.  However, in today\u2019s changing global environment, some employers are  citing compensation costs as an obstacle to competing against foreign  businesses where the cost of doing business is lower. As a result,  employers, in the absence of sufficient growth in productivity, may alter  compensation packages or ask workers to accept a greater responsibility  for such costs in the future.", "Through tax subsidies and payroll taxes, federal government policy also  has a bearing on employees\u2019 access to benefits and on the costs carried by  employers. The federal government provides significant tax subsidies for  both health insurance plans and qualified retirement plans. In offering  these subsidies, the federal government seeks to promote health care and  retirement income for individuals and families. In addition, workers and  employers are required to pay taxes that fund various programs. These  include Social Security and Medicare, programs intended to provide  financial security in retirement, as well as contributions to the  Unemployment Insurance program, which partially replaces income for  workers who are involuntarily unemployed. In this way the private system  of employer sponsored benefits works in tandem with social insurance  programs to promote the well-being of workers and retirees.", "Given the significance of employer-sponsored compensation for the U.S.  workforce and the economy, we have examined federal data on employee  compensation for current workers in private industries to identify   (1) recent trends in employers\u2019 total compensation costs\u2014including both  wages and benefits; (2) the composition of these trends; (3) whether  employees\u2019 costs, participation, or access to benefits have changed; and  (4) the possible implications of those changes for private systems.", "Specifically, we examined data from two federal surveys: the Bureau of  Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) National Compensation Survey (NCS) and the  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s Medical Expenditure Panel  Survey (MEPS). We used NCS data to determine trends in private  employer costs for wages and salaries, total benefits (including those that  employers are legally required to contribute to, such as Social Security),  and specific employer-provided benefits\u2014retirement income, health  insurance, and paid leave\u2014for 1991 through 2005. All data are from the  first quarter of each year. Although employers spend funds on benefits and  may change the benefit package based on cost increases to control  spending, BLS characterizes its survey data as \u201ccosts\u201d to employers. As  such, we refer to costs to employers in our analysis. The NCS data reflect  employers\u2019 costs for active employees and do not include costs for  benefits employers may provide to retirees. We also used NCS data to  examine trends in current employee participation in retirement plans and  paid leave between 1990 and 2003.", "We used MEPS data to determine for 1996 through 2003 the trends in  current employees\u2019 access to and participation in health insurance  benefits, and the premium cost to private employers and their employees.  We examined cost and participation data in the aggregate and whenever  possible by industry sector (goods-producing and service-providing),  industry type (such as manufacturing), establishment size, workers\u2019 full- time and part-time status, and workers\u2019 union and nonunion status. The  NCS measures costs per employee hour worked, and MEPS measures  costs as an annual average. We report the data as they were measured.  Because the data are for multiple years, we report all costs in 2004 dollars  to adjust for inflation. In reviewing both NCS and MEPS data, we  determined that they were reliable for our purposes.", "In addition to examining data, we convened a panel of 17 experts  representing the human resources field, industries, unions, and academia  to discuss the trends in the cost and availability of worker benefits. We  completed our work between May 2005 and December 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. For additional  discussion of our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Currently, U.S. workers rely primarily on their employers to provide both  wages and benefits (such as paid leave, retirement, and health insurance)  as part of a total compensation package, with wages comprising  approximately 70 percent of total compensation. Of the benefits package  employers provide to employees, almost one-third is mandated by law, and  includes contributions to programs such as Social Security, Medicare,  workers\u2019 compensation, and unemployment insurance, and other  programs. The remaining portion of the benefits package is discretionary  and typically includes paid leave, retirement income, and health  insurance\u2014some of the more costly benefits.", "Over the last century, employer-sponsored benefits have become an  increasingly important part of compensating workers. Prior to the turn of  the 20th century, workers relied primarily on their own, their families\u2019, or  the communities\u2019 resources in the event of a health or economic  emergency. With the advent of the industrial revolution in the United  States, unions began to offer disability and death coverage to workers in  order to protect them against workplace risks of factory work. The tight  labor market of World War II, along with Supreme Court rulings and  federal legislation, helped make benefits a legitimate part of collective  bargaining and, in part, fueled the offering of employer-sponsored  benefits.", "Outside the benefits that are legally required, those benefits that  employers choose to provide serve a number of purposes. From a business  perspective voluntary benefits assist employers to attract and retain highly  skilled workers. For example, pension plans can be a means of attracting  workers, reducing turnover, and encouraging productivity. Defined benefit  pension plans, which are typically offered as periodic payments over a  specified period beginning at retirement age, can be used to foster a  worker\u2019s long-term commitment to his or her employer. Defined  contribution pension plans, which are individual accounts to which  employers and/or employees make contributions, may be attractive to  employees who desire more portable benefits. In deciding to offer  benefits, companies must assess the nature of their particular workforce  to determine if offering benefits is a necessary employment inducement.", "Employers may also choose to sponsor benefit plans because of favorable  federal tax treatment for certain forms of compensation. To encourage  them to establish and maintain pension plans, the federal government  provides preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code for  plans that meet certain requirements. A purpose of tax preferences for  employer-sponsored pensions is to encourage savings for workers\u2019  retirement. Pension tax preferences are structured to strike a balance  between providing incentives for employers to start and maintain  voluntary, tax-qualified pension plans and ensuring participants receive an  equitable share of the tax-favored benefits. In fiscal year 2004, the federal  government was expected to forgo an estimated $95 billion in federal  income tax revenue due to the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored  pension plans. Tax policies also contain significant tax benefits for  employer-sponsored health insurance and medical care. Most notable, the  tax exclusion for health care permits the value of employer-paid health  insurance premiums to be excluded from employees\u2019 taxable earnings for  income taxes. It also excludes the value of the premiums from the  calculation of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes for both  employers and employees. The tax exclusion is credited with increasing  health coverage for employees. The risk pooling under group health  insurance allows employees to obtain insurance at lower costs than the  individual insurance market. The federal government was expected to  forgo an estimated $153 billion in taxes in fiscal year 2004 due to the  exclusion of employer contributions for health care.", "Recent developments are leading employers to make decisions about the  provision of the employer-based benefits system. An aging population with  longer life expectancies increases the long-term obligations of companies  that provide defined benefit pension plans. Some companies have cited  this obligation as a contributing reason for declaring bankruptcy,  reorganizing, and terminating large plans of this type. Advances in  expensive medical technology, increased use of high-cost services and  procedures, and an aging population have contributed to escalating health  care costs. Advances in other technologies have stepped up competition  from foreign firms by increasing global competition. In response to such  competition, U.S. firms have continued to look for ways to reduce their  costs, such as offshoring and using contingent workers (many of whom  are not offered benefits).", "In addition to employer-sponsored benefits, multiple federal programs  supplement workers\u2019 and retirees\u2019 benefits. For example, Social Security  pays monthly cash benefits to more than 36 million eligible retired or  disabled workers. Intended to complement retirement incomes, in many  cases Social Security may provide the only source of such retirement  income. In addition, the federal-state Medicaid program provides health  insurance to certain low-income individuals including older Americans in  need of long-term care who meet financial eligibility and other  requirements. Most recent figures show Medicare provides health  insurance to 35 million individuals age 65 years and more than six million  disabled individuals under age 65."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Average Compensation Costs Grew by 12 Percent between 1991 and 2005, with Benefits Outgrowing Wages by 8 Percentage Points", "paragraphs": ["Private employers\u2019 average cost of total compensation (comprised of  wages and benefits) for current workers grew by 12 percent between 1991  and 2005, but benefit costs outpaced wages in the most recent years after  controlling for inflation.

Regarding trends in  retirement income, an expert noted that employers decreased their  contributions to funds for defined benefit plans during the 1990s, which  was reflected in a decrease in employer spending for retirement income.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, defined-benefit pension plan  assets grew rapidly in the middle to late 1990s as the stock market  continued to rise, so employers often did not need to contribute funds to  defined-benefit pension plans. Stock prices generally fell from April 2000  to February 2003, and interest rates on bonds and other investments  remained low, requiring employers to contribute more funding to defined- benefit plans beginning in 2003 to meet minimum funding requirements.  Recent increases in employer costs for retirement benefits can be  attributed to a similar phenomenon. Legislation enacted in 2004\u2014the  Pension Funding Equity Act\u2014provided 2-year relief for businesses,  allowing contributions to be reduced compared to what would have  otherwise been required.", "In the case of health care benefits, in addition to increases in the cost of  providing medical services, several factors were noted to drive trends in  employer costs. These include the health insurance underwriting cycle, the  emergence of managed care, competition, and consolidation in the health  care industry. In the underwriting cycle, health insurance companies  forecast premium costs and then set their prices either higher to maximize  profitability or lower to maximize market share. In the early 1990s,  managed care plans lowered their premium prices in order to increase  market share, fueling price competition among health insurance  companies. However, later in the decade, many plans moved away from  tightly managed health care plans. As one expert noted, in the late 1990s,  insurer consolidation and mergers led to a more concentrated industry.  Research in this area suggests that many of the remaining plans shifted  their strategies from gaining market share to improving profitability,  stimulating premium increases and spurring the upward trend in costs for  employers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "For Most Employers, Retirement Income Showed the Greatest Percentage Increase", "paragraphs": ["Most types of employers experienced the largest percentage increases in  costs for retirement income compared to the growth in costs for health  insurance and paid leave between 1991 and 2005 (see table 4).

On the other hand, it was noted by a  small business leader that in his experience some employees, particularly  younger people, prefer to increase wages rather than preserve benefits.

Panelists also observed that with regard to health  benefits, employers are experimenting with consumer-directed health care  plans, which may also shift more responsibility and risk to the individual  employee. In addition, employers are considering changing the way they  offer compensation. Experts agreed that there has been a movement from  fixed to incentive compensation, wherein employers tie cash  compensation to productivity. It was noted that some employers are  turning to stock options in lieu of wage increases. Given the risks implied  for the individual in such private sector plans, for both retirement and  health care, a panelist emphasized that employees will need adequate  education to make informed decisions.", "Panelists also made observations about the rise in compensation costs and  their current and future implications for business and for employees. One  benefits expert stated that if an employer is locked into paying  compensation costs that the productivity of their workers cannot support,  jobs will go elsewhere. A union representative noted that the garment  industry has faced international competitors with lower compensation  costs, which has led to lowered compensation for U.S. workers and a loss  of domestic jobs. It was noted that employers may attempt to remain  competitive by cutting wages and benefits for workers, offshoring jobs,  and increasing the use of contingent workers, who may not be provided  benefits. It was also noted that businesses have concerns about their  ability to sustain long-term liabilities associated with certain benefit  packages.", "Experts disagreed on whether or how much of the responsibility for  addressing the rise in benefit costs should rest with the public sector. In  the view of a union spokesperson, such benefits amount to a social good,  something that supports the well-being and overall productivity of society.

Other panelists expressed belief in the marketplace as an  arbiter of resources and said that government or public benefit models are  not a solution to employers\u2019 rising costs for compensation. These panelists  suggested competition would eventually resolve the distribution of  benefits by winnowing out companies that could not attract the kind of  employees needed with the type of compensation they provide. One  panelist emphasized that government, therefore, should have limited  involvement in the provision of employer-sponsored benefits. A human  resources representative suggested that businesses should be allowed to  experiment with different means of providing benefits.

We used the BLS\u2019 Employer  Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC), which is derived from data  collected in the BLS\u2019 National Compensation Survey (NCS). Although  employers spend funds on benefits and may change the benefit package  based on cost increases to control spending, BLS characterizes its survey  data as \u201ccosts\u201d to employers. As such, we report on costs to employers.  NCS data are collected from a sample of establishments and include  information about the hourly costs of the components of total  compensation for a number of establishments and employee  characteristics. Samples are selected using a methodology called  probability proportional to employment size, which means that  establishments with larger employment have a greater chance of selection.  Weights are then applied to establish the estimates. Survey coverage  includes private sector establishments with one or more workers and state  and local governments with one or more workers. Agricultural, private  households, and the federal government are not included in the survey.  Our analysis focuses on private sector employers\u2019 hourly costs for total  compensation, wages and salaries, and total benefits. Within total benefits,  we focus on the three most costly discretionary benefits\u2014paid leave,  health insurance, and retirement benefits. Costs are calculated for active  workers and do not include costs for retiree benefits. We analyzed data for  the period 1991 to 2005. All data are from the first quarter of each year.  Those data that were not available from BLS\u2019s on-line resources were  obtained directly from BLS.", "In the ECEC, costs are measured as the average employer costs per  employee hour worked for wages and salaries and total benefits. To  control for the effect of inflation, we adjusted all dollars to 2004 terms by  using the BLS\u2019s Consumer Price Index Research Series (CPI-U-RS) for  2004. The CPI-U-RS presents an estimate of the CPI for all urban  consumers from 1978 to 2004 that incorporates most of the improvements  in the CPI calculations made by BLS over that time period.", "We used a z-test to test whether the costs in 2005 were statistically  significantly different from the costs in 1991. BLS provided us with the  relative standard errors (RSE) for the years 2000 to 2003, which BLS  officials contend provide reasonable estimates of what the RSEs are for  the earlier data. To ensure the greatest level of confidence, we used the  highest RSE between 2000 and 2003 to ensure a conservative measure of  statistical significance.", "Our analysis included the following data elements:    Total compensation consists of the sum of costs for wages and salaries  and total benefits.", "Wages and salaries are defined as the hourly straight-time wage rate, or  for workers not on an hourly basis, straight-time earnings divided by the  corresponding hours. Straight-time wages and salary rates are total  earnings before payroll deductions and include production bonuses,  incentive earnings, commission payments, and cost-of-living adjustments.", "Total benefits include legally required benefits (Social Security,  Medicare, federal and state unemployment, and workers\u2019 compensation).  Voluntary benefits reflected in the total benefits calculation are paid leave;  supplemental pay (overtime and premium pay, shift differentials, and  nonproduction bonuses); insurance benefits (life, health, short-term  disability, and long-term disability); retirement and savings benefits; and  other benefits (severance pay and supplemental unemployment plans).", "Paid Leave includes vacation, holidays, sick leave, and other leave  such as personal leave, military leave, and funeral leave.", "Retirement and Savings includes savings and thrift plans, defined  benefit, and defined contribution plans. Due to a change in the way  BLS classifies retirement plans, we report on the broader category of  \u201cretirement and savings\u201d in this report. Beginning in 1996, pension and  savings plans within existing sampling units were examined to  determine which were defined benefits or defined contributions and  were reclassified as such. Although the old divisions cannot be  compared with the new divisions, the overall category of retirement  and savings remains comparable.", "Health insurance includes medical, stand-alone dental, and stand- alone vision.", "Establishments are defined as single physical locations, such as a factory  or a retail store, and may be part of a larger firm. The break-outs for  establishment size were provided to us from BLS as small (1 to 99  employees), medium (100 to 499 employees), and large (500 or more  employees).", "Union status is determined separately for each occupation in an  establishment. An occupation is considered union if all of the following  conditions are met: a labor organization is recognized as the bargaining  agent for workers in the occupation; wage and salary rates are determined  through collective bargaining or negotiations; and settlement terms, which  must include wage provisions and may include benefit provisions, are  embodied in a signed mutually binding collective bargaining agreement.  Not all employees need to belong to the union for the occupation to be  classified as such.", "Full-time and part-time status is defined by the establishment reporting  the data.", "Industry sectors and industries are based on the Standard Industrial  Classification System (SIC). The industries within each sector are in table  7. The industry definitions in the NCS changed in 2004, making data prior  to 2004 not comparable to the newer data. Therefore, we only present  industry data for the period 1991 to 2003.", "We assessed the reliability of the ECEC data by reviewing BLS  documentation, interviewing BLS staff, and performing electronic tests to  check for outliers or other potential data problems. Based upon these  checks, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our work.", "To determine whether employees\u2019 costs, participation, or access to  benefits have changed, we relied on data from two sources: (1) the BLS\u2019  National Compensation Survey (NCS) and (2) the Medical Expenditure  Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS IC) administered by the  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) at the Department of  Health and Human Services.", "The BLS uses the NCS to measure the incidence and provisions of selected  employer provided benefit plans. We focused on employee coverage by  retirement and savings plans, including defined contribution and defined  benefit plans, and the provision of paid leave benefits. Coverage is not  necessarily the same as participation. For example, NCS produces data on  the availability of sick leave, but not on employees\u2019 use of such benefit. In  addition, benefits data were not published every year. Data were available  between 1991 and 2003. Despite these issues, we felt the data were reliable  and useful in understanding whether and how employers\u2019 provision of  retirement and paid leave has changed over time. We collected these data  from various BLS publications. We assessed the reliability of the data by  reviewing BLS documentation and interviewing BLS staff. Based upon  these checks, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our work.", "We used the MEPS IC to provide a detailed analysis of employee access  and participation in employer provided health insurance. The MEPS IC is  an annual survey of establishments that collects information about  employer-sponsored health insurance offerings in the United States. MEPS  IC data are tabulated by the AHRQ and tables are available for the period  1996 through 2003. MEPS tables include standard errors, which we used  to determine statistical significance in percentage changes over time. We  received electronic copies of the MEPS IC tables directly from the AHRQ.", "The MEPS IC is derived from a random sample of private-sector business  establishments with at least one employee and a sample of state and local  government employers. We focused our analysis on the private-sector  only. The sample contains businesses that existed at the beginning of the  sample year and is supplemented with business births through the third  quarter of that year. The MEPS IC tables are reported both nationally and  for individual states. For our purposes, we focused on the national data  only.", "We analyzed MEPS IC data to determine the trends in the percentage of  employees at establishments that offer health insurance, the percentage of  employees eligible for health insurance at these firms, the percentage of  eligible employees who enroll in the health insurance plans, and the  average annual premium for employer-provided health insurance for single  workers and the employees\u2019 share of these premiums. To control for the  effect of inflation, all premium costs are reported in 2004 terms by using  the BLS\u2019s Consumer Price Index for Medical Care. Inflation for medical  care has been great, and using an all items CPI (such as the CPI-U-RS)  would overstate the growth in premium costs.", "Our analysis included the following data elements.", "Offer health insurance\u2014whether an establishment makes available or  contributes to the cost of any health insurance plan for current employees.", "Health insurance plan\u2014an insurance contract that provides hospital  and/or physician coverage to an employee or retiree for an agreed-upon  fee for a defined benefit period, usually a year.", "Single coverage\u2014health insurance that covers the employee only. Also  known as employee-only coverage.", "Employee\u2014a person on the actual payroll. Excludes temporary and  contract workers, but includes the owner or manager if that person works  at the firm.", "Firm\u2014a business entity consisting of one or more business  establishments under common ownership or control. Also known as an  enterprise. A firm represents the entire organization, including the  company headquarters and all divisions, subsidiaries and branches. A firm  may consist of a single-location establishment or multiple establishments.  In the case of a single-location firm, the firm and establishment are  identical.", "Firm size\u2014the total number of employees for the entire firm as reported  on the sample frame. The data were made available in the following break- outs: 1 to 9 employees, 10 to 24 employees, 25 to 99 employees, 100 to 999  employees, and 1000 or more employees.", "Union status\u2014employers are asked to identify if they have union or non  union employees.", "Full-time and part-time employee\u2014full-time is defined by the  respondent and generally includes employees that work 35 to 40 hours per  week. Part-time status is considered an employee not defined as full-time  by the respondent.", "Industry categories\u2014the primary business activity as reported by the  respondent. The industry categories that we report are based on the  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. These definitions match  those used in the ECEC (see table 7). The data were not readily available  by industry sector (goods-producing and service-providing).", "We assessed the reliability of the MEPS IC data by reviewing AHRQ  documentation, interviewing AHRQ staff, and performing electronic tests  to check for outliers or other potential data problems. Based upon these  checks, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our work.", "To determine the possible implications of changes for private systems, we  convened a panel of 17 experts representing the human resources field,  industries, unions, and academia. Prior to the panel, we provided the  experts with a list of discussion questions and the completed data analysis.  During the half-day discussion, panelists provided their unique  perspectives on the trends we identified and offered comments on the  implications of these trends. We identified the panelists through  consultation with internal and external parties who work on the issues  covered in this report.
