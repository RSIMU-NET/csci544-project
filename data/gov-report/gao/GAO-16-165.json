The length of time it took the agencies to approve the mine plans ranged from about 1 month to over 11 years, and averaged approximately 2 years. Of the 68 approved mine plans, 13 had not begun operations as of November 2015. Agency officials attribute this to difficulties mine operators may face, such as obtaining other required federal and state permits.", "BLM and Forest Service officials GAO interviewed said they experienced 13 key challenges that affected the length of time to review hardrock mine plans. The two most frequently cited were (1) the low quality of information operators provided in their mine plans and (2) the agencies' limited allocation of resources for their hardrock mining programs. To address the low quality of information in mine plans, some BLM and Forest Service officials held pre-mine plan submittal meetings with operators. However, officials do not always do so because BLM does not have specific guidance on how to implement these meetings, and Forest Service does not have any guidance instructing them to do so. Federal standards for internal control state that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. Without taking further actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions, BLM and the Forest Service may be missing opportunities to help expedite the review process. To address the limited allocation of resources, BLM and Forest Service officials are leveraging existing resources by collaborating with other agencies, among other actions, but neither agency has fully used its authority to collect fees for conducting mine plan reviews as authorized by law. In addition, Forest Service is not authorized to retain these fees, as BLM is, but has not proposed the legislative changes that would allow it to retain fees, as is suggested by Office of Management and Budget guidance. BLM officials said the agency has not prioritized cost recovery for certain types of environmental analyses, and Forest Service officials were unaware of these authorities. By not using these authorities, BLM and Forest Service may be missing opportunities to expedite the mine plan review process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the agencies take actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions and seek additional recovery of the costs associated with conducting mine plan reviews.

Since then,  thousands of operators have extracted billions of dollars worth of  hardrock minerals, which play an important role in our nation\u2019s economy.  For example, according to the Department of the Interior (Interior), at  least 2.5 million ounces of gold were extracted from federal land in 2014,  with an average price of $1,270 per ounce. Two federal agencies  oversee the extraction of hardrock minerals on federal land\u2014the Bureau  of Land Management (BLM) within Interior and the Forest Service within  the Department of Agriculture. Together, these two agencies manage  about 450 million acres of federal land, comprising about 38 percent of  the combined land area of the 12 western states where these lands are  located.", "Because mining, by its very nature, disturbs the land and creates the  potential for serious public health, safety, and environmental hazards,  BLM and the Forest Service have processes for overseeing mining  operators to help prevent, mitigate, or manage these hazards. The  primary method BLM and the Forest Service use to analyze the  potentially harmful effects of mining is known as the mine plan review  process. Under agency regulations, a mine operator must submit a plan,  known as a mine plan of operation (mine plan), that details the  operational aspects of the mine, such as the mining methods and  techniques that will be employed and how the site will be reclaimed once  operations are concluded. BLM and the Forest Service typically then  conduct an environmental review of the mine plan under the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies to  evaluate the likely environmental effects of a proposed project using an  environmental assessment (EA) or, if the project is likely to significantly  affect the environment, a more detailed environmental impact statement  (EIS). At the conclusion of the environmental review, the agencies may  then approve the mine plan or approve it subject to possible changes or  conditions to prevent environmental damage. The agencies may also  withhold approval of the mine based on the findings of the environmental  analysis; however, BLM and Forest Service officials told us that they were  not aware of any instances where this had occurred.", "Because an operator cannot generate revenue until the mine plan review  process has been completed, and the mine has been constructed, mine  operators typically seek to expedite the time it takes to complete the mine  plan review process so that they may begin to recoup their costs. These  costs may include expenses for exploration to locate and study the  mineral deposit, environmental studies at the mine site and surrounding  areas, engineering studies to develop a mine plan, and third-party  contractors to provide analytical services to the federal agencies to help  facilitate their review. For large and complex hardrock mines, it can be  very costly to develop a mine and complete the mine plan review process.  For example, according to an industry estimate, operators may spend  more than $100 million even before constructing a mine.", "You asked us to review the mine plan review process for hardrock mines  on federal land. This report examines (1) the number of mine plans BLM  and the Forest Service approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014, the  time it took these agencies to approve these mine plans, and the extent to  which these agencies track this process; and (2) the challenges, if any,  that have affected the length of time for BLM and the Forest Service to  complete the review process, and the actions, if any, these agencies have  taken to address these challenges.", "To determine the number of mine plans that were approved from fiscal  years 2010 through 2014, we examined data from BLM\u2019s Legacy  Rehost 2000 (LR2000) system and the Forest Service\u2019s Locatable  Minerals database\u2014automated information systems the agencies use to  track key dates and milestones in the mine plan review process. Through  interviews with agency officials, our analysis of these data, and  comparisons to other publicly available information from federal agencies,  we determined that these data from these databases were not sufficiently  reliable to measure the time it took these agencies to complete the mine  plan review process, as discussed later in the report. Consequently, we  did not rely on data from LR2000 and the Locatable Minerals database,  but instead worked with agency officials to collect data from paper and  electronic records maintained by BLM field offices and Forest Service  ranger districts to develop a list of mine plans approved from fiscal years  2010 through 2014. To ensure that we reviewed data on comparable  projects, we requested data on mine plans that were 5 acres in size or  larger, and were plans for new mines or mine expansions. We obtained  detailed information on dates and milestones associated with these mine  plans from BLM and Forest Service field and district officials. We asked  BLM and Forest Service officials from the agencies\u2019 Washington, D.C.,  offices to verify the accuracy and completeness of these data and then  reviewed these data and compared them to other publicly available  sources, such as published NEPA documents. Based on this review, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of  determining the time frames for completing the mine plan review process.  Using these data, we calculated and summarized the elapsed days  between key milestones in the mine plan review process. We also  analyzed the extent to which the data systems used by BLM and the  Forest Service reflected practices consistent with federal standards for  internal control for tracking and recording events and transactions.", "To examine any challenges that have affected the length of time for BLM  and the Forest Service to review the mine plans, and any actions officials  have taken to address these challenges, we identified and refined a list of  13 challenges based on interviews with agency officials, industry  representatives, nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions,  and a review of nine studies and reports issued from 1997 through 2014  on the mine plan review process and its associated challenges. We  identified these studies and reports with assistance from mining  associations, industry consultants, and federal agencies. From our list of  mine plans approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014, we selected  23 BLM and Forest Service locations for additional interviews. We  selected locations in each of the 12 western states where hardrock  mining occurs. At least one mine plan was reviewed in each of these  states in this time frame.  We also selected locations to ensure that the  mine plans reviewed by the agency officials varied in the length of time it  took for the officials to complete their review. Further, we selected 2  additional locations where officials had conducted mine plan reviews that  were particularly difficult or complex, according to agency headquarters  officials. Because we selected a nonprobability sample of BLM and Forest  Service locations, our findings are not generalizable to all BLM and Forest  Service locations conducting reviews of mine plans. The officials we  spoke with had worked on about three-fourths of the mine plans that were  approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014. In each of these  interviews, we used a standard set of questions that we developed to  discuss this list of challenges with officials who review mine plans. We  asked these officials to indicate whether they had experienced each of  the challenges and, if so, whether the challenge affected the length of  time necessary to complete the mine plan review process and the  approximate length of time each challenge added to the process. In  addition, we asked whether they experienced other challenges not  already identified and the actions they had taken to address these  challenges. Other challenges mentioned by officials were all related to  one of the 13 identified categories of challenges we asked them about,  and these responses were included with those results. We then compiled  and analyzed information from these interviews and compared this  information to applicable laws and regulations, federal standards for  internal control, and agency handbooks and guidance to identify ways, if  any, in which these challenges could be further addressed.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to January 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Some of these stages can  take place simultaneously, depending on the characteristics of the  operation. Exploration involves staking a mining claim, prospecting, and  other steps, such as drilling, to locate and define the extent and value of  mineral deposits. The development stage entails completing the mine  plan approval process by investigating how mining will impact the  environment, determining how to mitigate the risks associated with  mineral extraction, and obtaining permits and authorizations associated  with the entire life cycle of the mine from federal, state, local, and  regulatory entities. After obtaining permits and authorizations, the mine  operator constructs the mine infrastructure, such as the necessary  buildings, roads, and facilities that will facilitate production. The  production stage generally entails drilling, blasting, and hauling ore from  mining areas to processing areas. During production, operators crush or  grind the ore and apply chemical treatments to extract the minerals of  value. The material left after the minerals are extracted\u2014waste rock or  tailings (a combination of fluid and rock particles)\u2014is then disposed of,  often in a nearby pile or tailings pond. In addition, some operators use a  leaching process to recover microscopic hardrock minerals from heaps of  crushed ore by percolating solvent (such as cyanide for gold and sulfuric  acid for copper) through the heap of ore. Through this heap-leaching  process, the minerals adhere to the solvent as it runs through the leach  heap and into a collection pond. The mineral-laced solution is then taken  from the collection pond to the processing facility, where the valuable  minerals are separated from the solution for further refinement.", "Reclamation activities can include reshaping and revegetating disturbed  areas; measures to control erosion; and measures to isolate, remove, or  control toxic materials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Structure of BLM and the Forest Service", "paragraphs": ["BLM manages and oversees hardrock mining on public land through its  headquarters office, 12 state offices, 49 district offices, and 126 field  offices.

Specifically, in nine locations we contacted, across offices in  Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming, BLM  and Forest Service officials said they have requested that operators  voluntarily meet with them and other relevant agencies before the  operators begin developing their mine plans. During these pre-mine plan  submittal meetings, officials have, for example, provided operators with  information on relevant regulations, guidance on the review process and  conducting baseline surveys, and examples of mine plans. In addition,  three BLM state offices\u2014Alaska, Arizona, and Nevada\u2014have developed  guidance on holding pre-submittal meetings with mine operators and  other relevant agencies to help ensure critical information is collected.  BLM\u2019s surface management handbook states that BLM officials may meet  with operators and other agencies before a mine plan is submitted to  discuss what information to include in the mine plan and what data may  be needed to support a NEPA analysis. BLM Alaska, Arizona, and  Nevada officials said these pre-submittal meetings have been helpful in  reducing the length of the review process. In addition, Nevada BLM state  officials said the meetings have helped them improve their workforce  planning efforts because they have been better able to determine the staff  needed for mine plan reviews and plan accordingly. Furthermore, Nevada  BLM staff said the guidance and its implementation throughout the state  helps the operators working in multiple locations within the state know  what to expect during the permitting process.", "However, some BLM and Forest Service officials in other states do not  always meet with operators prior to their mine plan submittals to help  mine operators to improve the quality of information in their mine plans.  While BLM\u2019s surface management handbook states that BLM officials  may meet with operators and other agencies, it neither provides specific  guidance on how to implement pre-submittal meetings nor does it instruct  BLM offices to notify operators of the option of pre-submittal meetings. As  a result, use of these meetings varies among BLM offices. Similar to  BLM, the Forest Service has not developed guidance for ranger districts  and mining operators on holding pre-plan submittal meetings. According  to an official at one Forest Service office, it has held pre-plan submittal  meetings, and the official stated this has helped streamline the process.  One operator also commented on the advantages of these meetings and  said it would have been helpful to know that such meetings were an  option to help avoid delays and reduce costs; these costs were roughly  $20,000 to $30,000 per month, according to the operator. BLM and  Forest Service officials leading the hardrock mining programs said they  did not think it was necessary to further encourage offices to hold pre- plan submittal meetings, leaving discretion to the regions.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining  information from, external stakeholders that may have a significant impact  on the agency achieving its goals. In addition, internal control activities  should provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the agency  are being achieved through effectiveness and efficiency of operations  including the use of the entity\u2019s resources. Without taking further actions  to improve the quality of mine plan submissions by, for example,  developing specific guidance to encourage offices to hold pre-mine plan  submittal meetings whenever possible, BLM and the Forest Service may  be missing opportunities to help expedite the mine plan review process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM and Forest Service Have Taken Some Actions to Address Limited Allocation of Resources but Could Collect More Fees", "paragraphs": ["In 15 BLM and 4 Forest Service locations we contacted, officials said the  agencies\u2019 limited allocation of resources for their hardrock mining  programs has added a few days to 1 year to the mine plan review  process. This was the second most frequently cited key challenge. In  particular, BLM and Forest Service officials said they do not have enough  staff in certain critical positions involved in NEPA analyses, such as  archaeologists and biologists. This causes \u201cbottlenecks\u201d in the review  process and increases the length of time it takes to review hardrock mine  plans, according to officials. BLM and Forest Service officials also said  that they have had difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified staff, in  part, because private mine operators seek similarly qualified staff and can  generally offer higher salaries.", "Each agency has taken some actions to address this key challenge. For  example, BLM has worked to leverage existing resources by collaborating  with other agencies, such as by requesting assistance from U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service employees on a NEPA analysis in one BLM field office.  BLM has also undertaken some workforce planning to assess its goals,  resource needs, and any existing resource gaps, and the agency has  increased salaries for some key positions related to the mine plan review  process. BLM also charges operators fees to review EISs and, under the  Federal Land Management Policy Act of 1976, can retain those fees to  cover the agency\u2019s costs. BLM uses these fees to offset the costs  associated with reviewing the mine plan for which the fees were  recovered, which supplement the hardrock mining program funds it  receives through annual appropriations.", "Similarly, Forest Service officials told us they have collaborated with state  agencies to leverage existing resources and have provided training for  Forest Service staff to more effectively manage the mine plan review  process. In addition, some Forest Service officials said they have  encouraged some operators to keep their mining activities below 5 acres  and under a significant level of disturbance so that they are not subject  to the mine plan review process. The Forest Service also began  conducting regional program reviews in 2013. For these reviews, which  occur every 1 to 2 years, staff are requested to perform self-evaluations  of their minerals and geology programs, including their staffing and  budget planning. Depending on the findings, a program review report may  include recommendations on issues, such as the need to develop  workforce needs analyses. Further, a Forest Service official at a  national forest said the forest requested that an operator voluntarily cover  the costs associated with preparing and reviewing EISs and hiring  contractors to help prepare and review NEPA documents. The operator  agreed to do so, which has offset some of Forest Service\u2019s costs  associated with conducting the NEPA analysis and expedited the mine  plan review process, according to a Forest Service official.", "However, neither BLM nor the Forest Service has used all of the tools  available to address its resource limitations. Specifically, BLM has not  fully used its authority to establish fees to recover some costs associated  with conducting mine plan reviews, which could be used to address  resource needs. A 1996 opinion by Interior\u2019s Solicitor said that BLM has  authority to \u201crecover the reasonable processing cost of services that  provide a special benefit not shared by the general public to an  identifiable recipient and has an obligation to establish fees for all  services for which it has cost recovery authority.\u201d Moreover, Interior\u2019s  department-wide cost recovery guidance in its accounting handbook  states Interior should recover these costs. In 2005, Interior finalized a  rule that included a schedule of fees, or costs, associated with a wide  range of mineral extraction programs, including reviewing mine plans for  locatable minerals. This rule established fees for reviewing mine plans  that involve conducting an EIS, and the preamble to the rule stated that  BLM would later consider issuing a separate rule to propose fees to  recover costs associated with reviewing mine plans involving an EA.  However, as of December 2015, BLM has neither issued a separate rule  nor set a timeline for doing so because officials said they have not made  recovering costs for EAs a priority. Consequently, BLM relies on annual  appropriations to cover agency costs associated with reviewing mine  plans that require only an EA. By issuing a rule establishing fees  associated with reviewing mine plans that involve conducting an EA, BLM  may be able to cover some of its costs associated with conducting mine  plan reviews, including costs to hire and retain qualified staff, and  possibly expedite the time it takes to review hardrock mine plans.", "Similar to BLM, the Forest Service relies on annual appropriations for  conducting mine plan reviews and does not make use of its authority to  collect fees. Specifically, under the Independent Offices Appropriation  Act, 1952 (IOAA), the Forest Service has the authority to establish a fee  structure for mine plan processing activities associated with EISs or EAs,  but the agency does not have the authority to retain these fees like BLM  does. Further, the IOAA\u2019s implementing guidance\u2014Office of Management  and Budget Circular A-25\u2014notes that legislative proposals to permit fees  to be retained by the agency may be appropriate. However, as of  December 2015, Forest Service officials said they had not established a  fee structure or made a request to retain these fees because the agency  was unaware of these authorities. Without establishing fees for reviewing  mine plans and the authority to retain these fees, the Forest Service may  be missing opportunities to leverage additional revenue to bolster its  resources to review hardrock mine plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BLM and the Forest Service Took Some Steps to Address Five Key Challenges Affecting the Review Process, but the Remaining Challenges Are Not Necessarily Within the Agencies\u2019 Control", "paragraphs": ["BLM and Forest Service officials we interviewed said they took various  steps to address 5 of the other 11 key challenges we identified that have  affected the length of time to review the hardrock mine plans approved  from fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The remaining 6 challenges are not  necessarily within the agencies\u2019 control to affect.", "Agency officials told us they took some steps to help address the  following five key challenges:", "Changing mine plans: Officials in 14 BLM and 2 Forest Service  locations said operators changing mine plans that are already under  review has been a key challenge, adding a few weeks to 6 years to  the review process. For example, according to BLM officials,  operators have substantially increased the size or scope of the  proposed mine or relocated the mine boundaries, roads, and other  facilities after the mine plans had been submitted, and the agency had  started the review process. In one instance, the operator decided to  expand the mine from 5 to 18 acres after surveys conducted to inform  NEPA analyses for the mine plan had been completed. As a result,  these surveys had to be redone to incorporate the characteristics of  the additional acreage, which added approximately 6 months to the  review in this instance, according to BLM officials. Similarly, Forest  Service officials noted that changing mine plans can add up to 2  months to mine plan reviews, depending on whether the changes  require officials to revise completed analyses and reports, the  availability of Forest Service officials, and the number of other mine  plans that were awaiting review at the time of the change. To help  address this key challenge, for example, some BLM officials we spoke  to said they have worked with operators to identify a larger area of  land to include in their mine plan submission in the event they later  decide to expand their mining operations.", "Quality of contractor\u2019s work: Officials in 11 BLM and 2 Forest  Service locations said the quality of work performed by some mine  operators\u2019 contractors has been a key challenge and has added 1  month to 1 year to the review process. For example, some Forest  Service officials said the quality of work performed by contractors that  mine operators paid to help conduct work needed for NEPA analyses  of mine plans has been poor and resulted in all of the analysis  needing to be rewritten. In addition, some BLM officials said that  contractors hired by the operator to prepare information for a mine  plan of operation have submitted out-of-date information. For  example, one operator\u2019s contractor submitted information that was 20  years old and did not account for changes that had occurred to the  landscape, such as those caused by wildfires. To help address this  key challenge, some BLM officials told us that they have provided a  list of contractors with good reputations and an apparent  understanding of the mine permitting process for mine operations,  which helped improve the mine plan quality and expedite the review  process. Specifically, one BLM official said they do not have to ask  these contractors multiple times for additional information, which  reduces the amount of time they need to spend working with the  contractors to finalize their NEPA or cultural resource analyses.", "Quantity and quality of coordination and collaboration: Officials in  9 BLM and 2 Forest Service locations said coordination and  collaboration have been limited in both quantity and quality and has  resulted in adding from 2 months to 3 years to the review process.  BLM and Forest Service need to coordinate and collaborate with other  federal agencies, state agencies, and Native American tribes on  issues such as assessing impacts to water quality, wildlife, and  cultural resources. However, BLM and Forest Service officials said it  can be difficult to do. For example, Forest Service officials said a  federal agency delayed the review process for one mine plan because  the federal agency did not provide the necessary data in a timely  fashion. As a result, Forest Service officials had to redo some  analyses needed for the mine plan\u2019s EIS, which added time to the  review process. To help address this key challenge, some officials  said they have developed memorandums of agreement with state  agencies, are holding regular meetings with these state agencies, as  well as operators, and communicating and consulting with tribes. For  example, BLM developed an agreement in November 2003 with the  Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to, among other  things, foster federal state coordination and prevent unnecessary  administrative delay while managing public lands during mining and  exploration. According to BLM officials, this agreement has helped  reduce duplication of agency efforts and prioritize agency work related  to mine plan reviews.", "Balancing competing legal priorities: Officials in 4 BLM locations  and 1 Forest Service location said balancing competing legal priorities  has been a key challenge during the mine plan review process and  has added 1 to 2 months to the review process. For example, while  the General Mining Act of 1872 grants free and open access to  federal lands for hardrock mining, other laws direct BLM and the  Forest Service to protect the environment on the lands they manage.  Specifically, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires  BLM to prevent the \u201cunnecessary or undue degradation\u201d of public  lands and federal regulations require the Forest Service to regulate  activities to \u201cminimize adverse environmental impacts on National  Forest surface resources.\u201d As a result, these agencies have had to  balance the competing interests of providing access to lands for  mining with the need to protect the environment. For example, BLM  resource officials disagreed with BLM mining and minerals officials  about the environmental effects of a proposed mine on the water  quality in a salmon spawning area, and it took approximately 1 month  to resolve, according to a BLM official. In addition, a Forest Service  official said employees developing land and resource management  plans sometimes do not consult with employees who work in the  minerals program. As a result, this official stated that the land and  resource management plans do not always take into consideration the  requirements of the mining act, and the management plans need to  later be revised and amended to reflect both activities. Forest Service  officials told us that, to help address this key challenge, they began to  provide annual training in 2000 for district, forest, and regional  supervisory officials. According to these officials, this training covers  issues such as the mine plan review process and statutory obligations  to facilitate mining, and has helped educate employees on the  importance of balancing competing priorities for the land.", "Federal Register notice publication process: Officials in 4 BLM  locations and 1 Forest Service location said the agencies\u2019 processes  for posting Federal Register notices related to NEPA has been a key  challenge during the mine plan review process and has added 1  month to 1 year to the review process. For example, some BLM field  office staff said that BLM\u2019s process for posting Federal Register  notices calls for draft notices to be reviewed at many different levels of  the agency, but said the process is unclear about who specifically  needs to review the draft notices and how long the review will take.  To address this key challenge, BLM officials started using Interior\u2019s  new electronic document tracking system, developed by the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, in the summer of 2013. A BLM instruction  memorandum published in September 2014 directed that this system  be used for Federal Register notices. These officials said Interior\u2019s  new system expedites the submission and review process because it  automatically inputs dates and allows staff to electronically track their  edits and forward reports, and is available to all Interior officials for  use. Moreover, they said the system offers some capability to track  the status of notice submissions.", "The remaining six key challenges are not necessarily within the agencies\u2019  control to affect. These key challenges include the following:", "Mine site complexity: Officials in 13 BLM and 2 Forest Service  locations said the complexity of some mine sites has been a key  challenge during the mine plan review process and has added 1 week  to 10 years to the review process. For example, BLM officials said  mine plans that involve land where various cultural resources can be  found, such as dinosaur fossils or Native American artifacts, can be  challenging to review because of the need to ensure the resources  are preserved before the land is disturbed. Some Forest Service  officials said environmental complexities, such as the proximity of  threatened or endangered species, have made it challenging to  review mine plans because of the importance of ensuring these  species will not likely be affected by the operations. In one instance,  BLM officials said it took approximately 2 weeks to assess whether  raptor habitat would be affected by the mine site location and then to  develop a mitigation plan to address the potential effects. In contrast,  it took approximately 10 years for Forest Service to resolve an issue  related to a mine site located in a wilderness area that is habitat for  threatened and endangered species, such as the grizzly bear and bull  trout. As a result, an extensive analysis for the EIS had to be  completed, which added time to the process.", "Legal issues: Officials in 8 BLM and 3 Forest Service locations said  legal issues have been challenging and have added 1 month to 3  years to the review process. Both BLM and Forest Service officials  said that concerns regarding possible litigation or the implications of  case law have prompted them to conduct additional or more extensive  NEPA analyses during the mine plan review process. For example,  some Forest Service officials said that to help avoid potential legal  issues, they conducted additional analyses because of the presence  of threatened or endangered species.", "Complexity of public comments: Officials in 6 BLM and 2 Forest  Service locations said that the complexity of public comments has  been a key challenge that has added a few weeks to 6 months to the  mine plan review process. For example, some BLM officials said  addressing comments during the NEPA process regarding issues  such as the mine\u2019s potential impact on Native American resources or  on air quality can add from 2 weeks to 3 months.", "Amount of public comments: Officials in 4 BLM and 3 Forest  Service locations said that the number of public comments has been a  key challenge that has added 1 month to 1 year to the review process.  For example, some Forest Service officials said some mine plans  have received as many as 40,000 public comments during the NEPA  process on issues such as the mine\u2019s potential impact on wildlife,  public health, and traffic.", "Reclamation bond acquisition: Officials in 6 BLM locations said  acquiring reclamation bonds has been a key challenge and has added  2 weeks to 6 months to the review process. For example, BLM  officials said some operators have limited resources to dedicate to  reclamation. As a result, some operators have experienced difficulty in  getting bonds for reclamation, which has delayed mine plan reviews.", "Operator delay requests: Officials in 4 BLM locations and 1 Forest  Service location said it has been a key challenge when operators  request delays in processing mine plans that are already under review  and has added 1 month to 1.5 years to the review process. BLM  officials said that mine operators have requested delays because  demand\u2014and, subsequently prices\u2014for the minerals associated with  the proposed mine decreased to a point that operators considered it  too expensive to operate the mine."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since hardrock minerals play an important role in the U.S. economy, BLM  and the Forest Service have to balance the need to protect the  environment with the need to make federal lands accessible for mining.  These agencies rely on the mine plan review process to balance these  competing priorities. BLM and Forest Service officials we interviewed  reported experiencing numerous challenges affecting the length of time to  complete the mine plan review process and have taken some actions to  address certain challenges. However, BLM and Forest Service could take  additional actions to address the two most frequently cited challenges\u2014 the low quality of mine plans of operations and the limited allocation of  resources. Specifically, without taking further actions to improve the  quality of mine plan submissions by, for example, developing specific  guidance to encourage offices to hold pre-mine plan submittal meetings,  BLM and Forest Service offices may be missing opportunities to expedite  the review process. In addition, by not fully using their authority to charge  fees and, in the case of the Forest Service, by not requesting authority to  retain those fees, the agencies may be missing opportunities to  potentially bolster their resources to expedite the amount of time it takes  to review hardrock mine plans. Finally, because BLM does not have  codes that allow it to track newly proposed mines and mine expansions,  BLM does not have adequate information to manage and track the length  of time to complete the mine plan review process.

We applaud  BLM\u2019s commitment to review a range of options to address resource  challenges that may have led to increased permitting times. We continue  to believe, however, that assessing fees for the review of mine plans that  involve conducting environmental assessments is one step that BLM  should take to address such challenges. As we noted in the report, BLM  had this option under consideration since 2005, when it established fees  for reviewing mine plans that involve conducting an environmental impact  statement, and that the agency has an obligation to establish fees for all  services for which it has cost recovery authority.

We conducted  interviews with BLM and Forest Service officials familiar with these data  systems to learn how these data are generated and maintained. Based  on our analysis of these data, and comparisons to other publicly available  information from federal agencies, we determined that these data from  these databases were not sufficiently reliable to measure the time it took  these agencies to complete the mine plan review process.

We asked BLM and Forest  Service officials from the agencies\u2019 Washington, D.C., offices to verify the  accuracy and completeness of these data. We also compared these data  to other publicly available sources, such as published National  Environmental Policy Act documents. Based on this review, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of  determining the time frames for completing the mine plan review process.  Using these data, we summarized descriptive information about the mine  plans, such as mine location, number of acres of land disturbed, and the  commodity the operator intended to mine. We also calculated and  summarized the elapsed days between key milestones in the mine plan  review process and the number of approved mine plans that had not  begun operations. We also analyzed the extent to which the data systems  used by BLM and the Forest Service reflected practices consistent with  federal standards for internal control for tracking and recording events  and transactions.", "To examine any challenges that have affected the length of time for BLM  and the Forest Service to review the mine plans, and any actions officials  have taken to address these challenges, we identified a list of challenges  based on interviews with agency officials, industry representatives,  nongovernmental organizations, an academic institution, and a review of  nine studies and reports issued from 1997 through 2014 on the mine plan  review process and its associated challenges. We identified these studies  and reports with assistance from mining associations, industry  consultants, and federal agencies. We then categorized and refined this  list into 13 key challenges. From our list of mine plans approved from  fiscal years 2010 through 2014, we selected 19 BLM and 4 Forest  Service locations for additional interviews to ascertain the extent to which  these challenges affected the time it took to review mine plans of  operations. The Forest Service locations included the only 2 that were  part of our list of mine plans approved from fiscal years 2010 through  2014 and 2 additional locations where officials had conducted mine plan  reviews that were particularly difficult or complex, according to a senior  Forest Service official. We selected locations in each of the 12 western  states where hardrock mining occurs. At least one mine plan was  reviewed in each of these states in this time frame. We also selected  locations to ensure that the mine plans reviewed by the agency officials  varied in the length of time it took for the officials to complete their review.

In each of these  interviews, we used a standard set of questions that we developed to  discuss this list of challenges with officials who review mine plans. We  asked these officials to indicate whether they had experienced each of  the challenges and, if so, whether the challenge affected the length of  time necessary to complete the mine plan review process and the  approximate length of time each challenge added to the process. In  addition, we asked whether they experienced other challenges not  already identified, as well as the actions they had taken to address these  challenges.
