In view of concerns about voting systems and the important role EAC plays in certifying them, GAO was asked to determine whether EAC has (1) defined an effective approach to testing and certifying voting systems, (2) followed its defined approach, and (3) developed an effective mechanism to track problems with certified systems and use the results to improve its approach. To accomplish this, GAO compared EAC guidelines and procedures with applicable statutes, guidance, and best practices, and examined the extent to which they have been implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EAC has defined an approach to testing and certifying voting systems that follows a range of relevant practices and statutory requirements associated with a product certification program, including those published by U.S. and international standards organizations, and those reflected in HAVA. EAC, however, has yet to define its approach in sufficient detail to ensure that certification activities are performed thoroughly and consistently. This lack of definition also has caused voting system manufacturers and test laboratories to interpret program requirements differently, and the resultant need to reconcile these differences has contributed to delays in certifying systems that several states were intending to use in the 2008 elections. According to EAC officials, these definitional gaps can be attributed to the program's youth and the commission's limited resources being devoted to other priorities. Nevertheless, they said that they intend to address these gaps, but added that they do not yet have written plans for doing so. EAC has largely followed its defined approach for each of the dozen systems it is in the process of certifying, with one major exception. Specifically, it has not established an effective and efficient repository for certified versions of voting system software, or related procedures and tools, for states and local jurisdictions to use in verifying that their acquired voting systems are identical to what EAC has certified. Further, EAC officials told GAO that they do not have a documented plan or requirements for a permanent solution. As an interim solution, they stated that they will maintain copies of certified versions in file cabinets and mail copies of these versions upon their request by states and local jurisdictions. In GAO's view, this process puts states and local jurisdictions at increased risk of using a version of a system during an election that differs from the certified version. Under its voting system testing and certification program, EAC has broadly described an approach for tracking problems with certified voting systems and using this information to improve its certification program. While this approach is consistent with some aspects of relevant guidance, key elements are either missing or inadequately defined. According to EAC officials, while they intend to address some of these gaps, they do not have documented plans for doing so. In addition, even if EAC defines and implements an effective approach, it would not affect the vast majority of voting systems that are to be used in the 2008 elections. This is because the commission's approach only applies to those voting systems that it has certified, and it is unlikely that any voting systems will be certified in time to be used in the upcoming elections. Moreover, because most states do not currently require EAC certification for their voting systems, it is uncertain if this situation will change relative to future elections. As a result, states and other election jurisdictions are on their own to discover, disclose, and address any shared problems with these noncertified systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the 2000 and 2004 general elections, we issued a series of  reports and testified on virtually every aspect of our nation\u2019s election  system, including the many challenges and opportunities associated with  various types of voting systems.

Again, EAC officials said that these  determinations are to be based on each reviewer\u2019s judgment.", "The program manual states that test plans are to be reviewed for  adequacy. However, it does not define adequacy or how such reviews are  to be performed. This lack of detail is particularly problematic because  EAC officials told us that the VSS and VVSG contain many vague and  undefined requirements. According to these officials, reviewers have been  directed to ensure that VSTLs stress voting systems during testing, based  on what they believe are the most difficult and stringent conditions likely  to be encountered in an election environment that are permissible under  the standards.", "The program manual states that EAC technical experts will assess test  results reports for completeness, appropriateness, and adequacy.  However, it does not define appropriateness and adequacy or the  procedural steps for conducting the review.", "The program manual requires VSTLs to use all applicable test suites issued  by EAC when developing test plans. However, program officials stated that  they currently do not have defined test suites and NIST officials said that  they are focused on preparing test suites for the forthcoming version of  the VVSG and not the 2005 version. As a result, each laboratory develops  its own unique testing approach, which requires each to interpret what is  needed to test for compliance with the standards and increases the risk of  considerable variability in how testing is performed. To address this void,  EAC has tasked NIST with developing test suites for both the 2005 VVSG  and the yet-to-be-released update to these guidelines. Until then, EAC  officials acknowledge that they will be challenged to ensure that testing  conducted on different systems or at different VSTLs is consistent and  comparable.", "With respect to the second management control, the commission has not  defined the documentation requirements that would demonstrate that  procedural steps, evaluations, and related decision making have been  performed in a thorough, consistent, and verifiable manner. Specifically,  while the program manual requires the Program Director to maintain  documentation to demonstrate that procedures and evaluations were  effectively performed, EAC has yet to specify the nature or content of this  documentation. For example:    The program manual requires technical reviewers to assess test plans and  test reports prepared by laboratories and then to submit reports of their  findings to the Program Director. However, EAC does not require  documentation of how these reviews were performed beyond completion  of a recently developed checklist, and this checklist does not provide for  capturing how decisions were reached, including steps performed and  criteria applied. For example, the VVSG requires that systems permit  authorized access and prevent unauthorized access, and lists examples of  measures to accomplish this, such as computer-generated password keys  and controlled access security. While the checklist cites this requirement  and provides for the reviewer to indicate whether the test plan satisfies it,  it does not provide specific guidance on how to determine whether the  access control measures are adequate, and it does not provide for  documenting how the reviewer made such a decision.", "The program manual does not require supervisory review of work  conducted by EAC personnel. Moreover, it does not require that the  reviewers be identified.", "According to EAC officials, its approach does not yet include such details  because it is still new and evolving and because the commission\u2019s limited  resources have been devoted to other priorities. To address these gaps,  EAC officials stated that they intend to undertake a number of activities.  For example, the Program Director stated that in the near-term, the  technical reviewers will collaborate and share views on each test plan and  test report under review as a way to provide consistency, and they will use  a recently finalized checklist for test plan and test report reviews. In the  longer term, EAC intends to define more detailed procedures for each step  in its process. However, it has yet to establish documented plans,  including the level of resources needed to accomplish this. Until these  plans are developed and executed, EAC will be challenged to ensure that  its testing and certification activities are performed thoroughly and  consistently across different systems, manufacturers, and VSTLs.", "Moreover, this lack of program definition surrounding certification testing  and review requirements has already caused, and could continue to cause,  differences in how EAC reviewers, VSTLs, and manufacturers interpret the  requirements. For example, the program requires sufficient and adequate  testing, but it does not define what constitutes sufficient and adequate. As  a result, laboratory officials and manufacturer representatives told us that  EAC reviewers have interpreted these requirements more stringently than  they have, and that reconciling these different interpretations has already  caused delays in the approval of test plans, and they will likely prevent  EAC from certifying any systems in time for use in the upcoming 2008  elections. This is especially problematic for those states that have  statutory or other requirements to use federally certified systems and that  have a need to acquire or upgrade existing systems for these elections. In  this regard, 18 states reported to us that they were relying on EAC to  certify systems for use in the 2008 elections, but now will have to adopt  different strategies for meeting their states\u2019 respective EAC certification  requirements. For example, officials for several states said that they would  use the same system as in 2006, while officials for other states described  plans to either undertake upgrades to existing systems without federal  certification, or change state requirements to no longer require EAC  certification."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EAC Has Largely Followed Its Defined Certification Approach, but a Key System Verification Capability to Support States and Local Jurisdictions Is Not Yet in Place", "paragraphs": ["EAC has largely followed its defined certification approach for each of the  dozen voting systems that it is in the process of certifying, with one major  exception.

Specifically, as of May 2008, EAC had received, reviewed,  and approved 12 manufacturer registration applications, and these  approved manufacturers have collectively submitted certification  applications for 12 different systems, of which EAC has accepted 9. For  these 9 systems, manufacturers have submitted 7 test plans, of which EAC  has reviewed and approved 2 plans.

According to EAC\u2019s certification program  manual, final certification is conditional upon (1) testing laboratories  depositing certified voting system software into an EAC-designated  repository and (2) manufacturers creating and making available system  identification tools for states and local jurisdictions to use in verifying that  their respective systems\u2019 software configurations match that of the  software for the system that was certified and deposited into the  repository. However, EAC has yet to establish a designated repository or  procedures and review criteria for evaluating the manufacturer-provided  tools, and has not established plans or time frames for doing so.

Specifically, the certification program manual  states that final certification will be conditional upon, among other things,  the manufacturer and VSTL creating and documenting a trusted software  build, and the laboratory depositing the build in a designated repository.  In its 2005 VVSG, EAC designated NIST\u2019s National Software Reference  Library (NSRL) as its repository and required its use. However, program  officials stated that the commission does not intend to use the NSRL as its  designated repository because the library cannot perform all required  functions. While these officials added that they may use the NSRL for  portions of the certification program, they said it will not serve as EAC\u2019s  main repository.", "Nevertheless, the commission has not established plans to identify and  designate another repository, and has yet to define minimum requirements  (functional, performance, or interface) for what it requires in a repository  to efficiently support states and local jurisdictions. As an interim measure,  an EAC official stated that they will store the trusted builds on compact  disks and keep the disks in fireproof filing cabinets in their offices.  According to the official, this approach is consistent with established  program requirements because the program manual merely refers to the  use of a trusted archive or repository designated by EAC. Under this  measure, state and local election officials will have to request physical  copies of material from EAC and wait for the materials to be physically  packaged and delivered. This interim approach is problematic for several  reasons, including the demand for EAC resources to keep up with the  requests during a time when the Executive Director told us that a more  permanent repository solution has not been a commission focus because  its limited resources have been focused on other priorities.", "EAC has also not defined how it will ensure that manufacturers develop  and provide to states and local jurisdictions tools to verify their respective  systems\u2019 software against the related trusted software builds. According  to the program manual, final certification of a voting system is also  conditional upon manufacturers creating and making available to states  and local jurisdictions tools to compare their systems\u2019 software with the  trusted build in the repository. In doing so, the program manual states that  manufacturers shall develop and make available tools of their choice, and  that the manufacturer must submit a letter certifying the creation of the  tools and include a copy and description of the tools to EAC. The  commission may choose to review the tools. Further, the 2005 VVSG  provides some requirements for software verification tools, for example,  that the tools provide a method to comprehensively list all software files  that are installed on the voting system. However, EAC has yet to specify  exactly what needs to be done to ensure that manufacturers provide  effective and efficient system identification tools and processes, and it has  not developed plans for ensuring that this occurs.

Commission officials cited limited resources  and competing priorities as reasons for these gaps.", "In addition, EAC\u2019s problem tracking and resolution approach does not  extend to any of the voting systems that are likely to be used in the 2008  elections, and it is uncertain when, and to what extent, this situation will  change. This is because its defined scope only includes EAC-certified  systems; it does not include NASED-qualified systems or any other  systems to be used in elections. EAC officials stated that the reason for  this is because HAVA does not explicitly assign the commission  responsibility for systems other than those it certifies. This means that no  federal entity is currently responsible for tracking and facilitating the  resolution of problems found with the vast majority of voting systems that  are used across the country today and that could be used in the future, and  thus states and local jurisdictions must deal with problems with their  systems on their own."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EAC\u2019s Approach for Tracking and Resolving Problems with Certified Systems Partially Reflects Relevant Guidance", "paragraphs": ["According to published guidance, tracking and resolving problems with  certified products is important.

First, its  certification program includes provisions for withdrawing certification for  noncompliant voting systems. For example, the program manual describes  procedures for decertifying a noncompliant voting system if the  manufacturer does not take timely or sufficient action to correct instances  of noncompliance. According to these procedures, the decertification  decision cannot be made until the manufacturer is formally alerted to the  noncompliance issue and provided with an opportunity to correct the  issue (problem) or to submit additional information for consideration.  Also, a manufacturer can dispute the decision by requesting an appeal. The  procedures also state that upon decertification, the manufacturer cannot  represent the system as certified and the system may not be labeled with a  mark of certification. In addition, EAC is to remove the system from its list  of certified systems, alert state and local election officials to the system\u2019s  decertification via monthly newsletters and e-mail updates, and post all  correspondence regarding the decertification on its Web site.", "Second, EAC\u2019s certification program includes provisions for  postcertification oversight of voting systems and manufacturers.  Specifically, the program manual provides for reviewing and retesting  certified voting systems to ensure that they have not been modified, and  that they continue to comply with applicable standards and program  requirements. In addition, the program manual calls for periodic  inspections of manufacturers\u2019 facilities to evaluate their production  quality, internal test procedures, and overall compliance with program  requirements. However, the program manual states that reviewing and  retesting of certified systems is an optional step, and does not specify the  conditions under which this option is to be exercised. Further, while the  program manual provides for conducting periodic inspections of  manufacturers\u2019 facilities, it does not define, for example, who is to conduct  the inspections, what procedures and evaluation criteria are to be used in  conducting them, and how they are to be documented.", "Third, EAC\u2019s certification program includes provisions for investigating  reports of system defects. According to the program manual,  investigations of reports alleging defects with certified systems begin as  informal inquiries that can potentially become formal investigations.  Specifically, the Program Director is to conduct an informal inquiry in  which a determination is made regarding whether the reported defect  information is both credible and deserving of system decertification if  found to be credible. If both conditions are met, then a formal  investigation is to be conducted. Depending on the outcome,  decertification of the system could result. However, the program manual  does not call for assessing the scope or impact of any defects identified,  such as whether a defect is confined to an individual unit or whether it  applies to all such units. Further, the program manual does not include  procedures or criteria for determining the credibility of reported defects,  or any other aspect of the inquiry or investigation, such as how EAC will  gain access to systems once they are purchased and fielded by states and  local jurisdictions. This is particularly important because EAC does not  have regulatory authority over state election authorities, and thus, it  cannot compel their cooperation during an inquiry or investigation.", "Fourth, EAC\u2019s certification program does not address how it will verify  that manufacturers take required corrective actions to fix problems  identified with certified systems. Specifically, the program manual states  that the manufacturer is to provide EAC with a compliance plan describing  how it will address identified defects. However, the program manual does  not define an approach for evaluating the compliance plan and confirming  that a manufacturer actually implements the plan. According to EAC  officials, they see their role as certifying a system and informing states of  modifications. As a result, they do not intend to monitor how or whether  manufacturers implement changes to fielded systems. In their view, the  state ultimately decides if a system will be fielded.", "Fifth, EAC\u2019s certification program provides for using information  generated by its problem tracking and resolution activities to improve the  program. According to the program manual, information gathered during  quality monitoring activities will be used to, among other things, identify  improvements to the certification process and to inform the related  standards-setting process. Further, the program manual states that  information gathered from these activities will be used to inform relevant  stakeholders of issues associated with operating a voting system in a real- world environment and to share information with jurisdictions that use  similar systems. However, the program manual does not describe how  EAC will compile and analyze the information gathered to improve the  program, or how it will coordinate these functions with information  gathered in performing its HAVA-assigned clearinghouse function.", "EAC officials attributed the state of their problem tracking and resolution  approach to the newness of the certification program and the fact that the  commission\u2019s limited resources have been devoted to other priorities. In  addition, while these officials said that they intend to address some of  these gaps, they do not have defined plans or time frames for doing so. For  example, while EAC officials stated that they plan to develop procedures  for investigating voting system problems and for inspecting manufacturing  facilities, they said that it is the states\u2019 responsibility to ensure that  corrective actions are implemented on fielded systems. To illustrate their  resource challenges, these officials told us that three staff are assigned to  the testing and certification program and each is also supporting other  programs. In addition, they said that the commission\u2019s technical  reviewers are experts who, under Office of Personnel Management  regulation, work no more than one-half of the time of the year.", "Given that EAC has not yet certified a system, the impact of these  definitional limitations has yet to be realized.

Instead of tracking  and resolving problems with these systems, EAC anticipates that they will  eventually be replaced or upgraded with certified systems.

More specifically, while EAC has efforts under way  relative to the certification of 12 voting systems, as we have previously  described in this report, commission officials stated that it will be difficult  to field any system that EAC anticipates certifying before 2008 in time for  the 2008 elections. Thus, voting systems used in national elections will  likely be either those qualified under the now-discontinued NASED  program, or those not endorsed by any national entity. Moreover, this will  continue to be the case until states voluntarily begin to adopt EAC- certified systems, which is currently unclear and uncertain because only  18 states reported having requirements to use EAC-certified voting  systems. Restated, most states\u2019 voting systems will not be covered by  EAC\u2019s problem tracking and resolution efforts, and when and if they will is  not known. Moreover, manufacturers may or may not upgrade existing,  noncertified systems, and they may or may not seek EAC certification of  those systems. Thus, it is likely that many states, and their millions of  voters, will not use EAC-certified voting systems for the foreseeable  future.", "Nevertheless, EAC has initiated efforts under the auspices of its HAVA- assigned clearinghouse responsibility to receive information that is  volunteered by states and local jurisdictions on problems and experiences  with systems that it has not certified, and to post this information on the  commission\u2019s Web site to inform other states and jurisdictions about the  problems. In doing so, EAC\u2019s Web site states that the commission does not  review the information for quality and does not endorse the reports and  studies. Notwithstanding this clearinghouse activity, this means that no  national entity is currently responsible for tracking and facilitating the  resolution of problems found with the vast majority of voting systems that  are in use across the country. This in turn leaves state and local  jurisdictions on their own to discover, disclose, and address any shared  problems with systems.

EAC plays a pivotal role in testing and  certifying voting systems. To its credit, EAC has recently established and  begun implementing a voting system testing and certification program that  is to both improve the quality of voting systems in use across the country,  and help foster public confidence in the electoral process. While EAC has  made important progress in defining and executing its program, more can  be done. Specifically, key elements of its defined approach, such as the  extent to which certification activities are to be documented, are vague,  while other elements are wholly undefined\u2014such as threshold criteria for  making certification-related decisions. Moreover, a key element that is  defined\u2014namely, giving states and local jurisdictions an effective and  efficient means to access the certified version of a given voting system  software\u2014has yet to be implemented.

Such  situations ultimately detract from, and do not enhance, election integrity  and voter confidence. Moreover, by not having established an effective  means for states and local jurisdictions to verify that the systems each  acquires are the same as the EAC-certified version, EAC is increasing the  risk of noncertified versions ultimately getting used in an election.", "Beyond the state of EAC\u2019s efforts to define and follow an approach to  testing and certifying voting systems, including efforts to track and resolve  problems with certified systems and use this information to improve the  commission\u2019s testing and certification program, a void exists relative to  having a national focus on tracking and resolving problems with voting  systems that EAC has not certified, and thus has not been assigned explicit  responsibility or has the resources to address.

In addition, EAC stated that it  has found our review and report helpful in its efforts to fully implement  and improve this program. It also stated that it generally accepts our three  recommendations with little comment, adding that it will work hard to  implement them.

In response, we have modified the wording that we  used to clarify any misunderstanding as to our intent.", "With respect to our first recommendation for developing and  implementing plans for ensuring that voting system testing and  certification review activities are governed by detailed procedures,  criteria, and documentation requirements, EAC stated that it is committed  to having a program that is rigorous and thorough, and that its program  manual creates such a program. It also stated that it agrees with our  recommendation and that it will work to further the process in its manual  by implementing detailed procedures. In this regard, however, it took issue  with five aspects of our finding.", "With respect to our point that criteria and procedures have not been  adequately defined for reviewing the information in the manufacturer  registration application package, EAC stated that such criteria are not  necessary because the package does not require a determination of  sufficiency. We do not agree. According to section 2.4.2 of the program  manual, EAC is to review completed registration applications for  sufficiency. However, as our report states, the manual does not define  criteria as to what constitutes sufficiency and what this sufficiency review  should entail, and EAC officials stated this determination is left up to the  individual reviewer\u2019s judgment.", "Concerning our point that criteria and procedures have not been  adequately defined for reviewing the information in the system  certification application package, EAC stated that a technical review of the  package is not required. Rather, it said that the package simply requires a  determination that all necessary information is present, adding that it has a  checklist to assist a reviewer in determining this. We do not agree with this  comment for two reasons. First, our report does not state that the package  review is technical in nature, but rather is a review to determine a  package\u2019s completeness and accuracy. Second, the checklist does not  include any criteria upon which to base a completeness and accuracy  determination. As EAC\u2019s comments confirm, this is important because the  information in the package is to be used by technical reviewers as they  review test plans and test reports to ensure that the testing covers all  aspects of the voting system. For example, EAC requires certification  applications to include a functional diagram depicting how the  components for the voting system function and interact, as well as a  system overview that includes a description of the functional and physical  interfaces between components. Although the checklist provides for  determining whether these items are part of the application package, it  does not provide for checking them for completeness and consistency. We  have clarified this finding in our report by including this example.", "As to our point that EAC has not defined how technical reviewers are to  determine the adequacy of system test plans and reports, the commission  stated that our report does not take into account what it described as a  certification requirements traceability matrix that its technical reviewers  use to assess the completeness and adequacy of the plans and reports.  However, EAC also acknowledged in its comments that procedures have  yet to be established relative to the use of the matrix. Further, we  reviewed this matrix, which we refer to in our report as a checklist, and as  we state in our report, this checklist does not provide for capturing how  decisions were reached, including steps performed and criteria applied.  For example, the VVSG requires that systems permit authorized access  and prevent unauthorized access, and lists examples of measures to  accomplish this, such as computer-generated password keys and  controlled access security. While the checklist cites this requirement and  provides for the reviewer to indicate whether the test plan satisfies it, it  does not provide specific guidance on how to determine whether the  access control measures are adequate, and it does not provide for  documenting how the reviewer made such a decision. In response to  EAC\u2019s comments, we have added this access control example to clarify  our finding.", "With regard to our point that the program manual does not include defined  test suites, EAC commented on the purpose of these test suites and stated  that it would not be appropriate to include them in the manual because the  manual is not intended to define technical requirements for testing. We  agree that the program manual should not include actual test suites, and it  was not our intent to suggest that it should. Rather our point is that test  suites do not yet exist. Accordingly, we have modified our report to more  clearly reflect this. In addition, we acknowledge EAC\u2019s comment that NIST  is currently in the process of developing test suites, and that it recently  sent several test suites to the VSTLs and other stakeholders for review.  However, as we state in our report, NIST officials said that they are  focused on preparing test suites for the yet-to-be-released update to the  VVSG and not the 2005 version. Further, EAC has not yet established plans  or time frames for finalizing test suites for either versions of these  guidelines, and the program manual does not make reference to the  development of these test suites.", "In commenting on our point that differences in interpretation of program  requirements have resulted in test plan and report approval delays, EAC  stated that its interpretation process provides a means for VSTLs and  manufacturers to request clarification of the voting system standards that  are ambiguous. We agree with this statement. However, we also believe  that having the kind of defined procedures and established criteria that are  embodied in our recommendation will provide a common understanding  among EAC stakeholders around testing and certification expectations,  which should minimize the need to reconcile differences in interpretations  later in the process.", "With respect to our second recommendation for developing and  implementing plans for an accessible and available software repository for  certified versions of voting system software, as well as the related  manufacturer-provided procedures and tools to support stakeholders in  using this repository, EAC stated that it agrees that implementation of a  repository is needed. However, it stated that there is some  misunderstanding regarding the purpose of the repository and the creation  of software identification tools. Specifically, the commission stated that  the repository is intended for the commission\u2019s own use when conducting  investigations of fielded systems, while the manufacturer-provided system  identification tools are for use by state and local election officials to  confirm that their systems are the same as the one certified by EAC. In  addition, it described steps taken or under way to ensure that a repository  and identification tools are in place when needed. This includes \u201cplacing  the onus\u201d on system manufacturers to create verification tools,  investigating software storage options, and discussing with another  government agency and outside vendors the possibility of providing secure  storage for certified software.", "We agree with EAC that its repository serves as a tool for its internal use.  However, the repository is also to serve state and local election officials in  verifying that their respective systems are identical to the EAC-certified  versions of the systems. According to the 2005 VVSG software distribution  and setup validation requirements, the process for voting system  purchasers in verifying that the version of the software that they receive  from a manufacturer is the same as the version certified by EAC is to be  performed by comparing it with the reference information generated by  the designated repository. Further, commission officials told us that EAC\u2019s  repository needs to be accessible and easy to use by state and local  election officials. While we understand that the manufacturer-provided  system identification tools serve a separate function from the repository,  both tools together are required for state and local election officials to  verify their systems. We also acknowledge that the commission has  initiated steps relative to establishing a repository and identification tools.", "However, our point is that EAC does not have any plans or time frames for  accomplishing this. Further, while we agree that the manufacturers are  responsible for creating the identification tools, as we stated in our report,  EAC has not defined how it will evaluate the manufacturer-provided tools.  To avoid any misunderstanding as to these points, we have slightly  modified our finding and related recommendation.", "Concerning our third recommendation for developing and implementing  detailed procedures, review criteria, and documentation requirements for  tracking and resolving problems with certified voting systems and  applying lessons learned to improve the certification program, EAC stated  that the report does not correctly represent its role in confirming that  manufacturers actually correct anomalies in all fielded systems, and it  added that the commission does not have the authority or the human  capital to do so. Accordingly, EAC stated that it informs affected  jurisdictions of system changes, but that it is at the discretion of the states  and local jurisdictions, and beyond the scope of the commission, to  determine whether fixes are made to individual systems in the field.", "We agree that the states and local jurisdictions have the responsibility and  authority to determine whether they will implement EAC-approved fixes in  the systems that they own. However, as we state in our report, published  ISO guidance on tracking and resolving problems with certified products  recognizes the importance of the certification body\u2019s decision to require  manufacturers to take corrective actions when defects are discovered, and  to ensure that such actions are taken. Although this guidance  acknowledges the difficulty in ensuring corrective actions are  implemented on all affected units, it states that products should be  corrected \u201cto the maximum degree feasible.\u201d Given EAC\u2019s authority over  registered manufacturers, it can play a larger role in ensuring that  problems with fielded system are in fact resolved, while maintaining the  voluntary nature of its program, by monitoring the manufacturers\u2019 efforts  to fix systems for those jurisdictions that choose to implement such  corrections, and holding manufacturers accountable for doing so. To avoid  any confusion about this point, we have slightly modified our finding.", "As to our matter for congressional consideration to amend HAVA to give  EAC certain additional responsibilities relative to problem resolution on  voting systems not certified by EAC, the commission voiced several  concerns. Among other things, it stated that our proposal would \u201caffect a  sea change in the way that EAC operates its testing and certification\u201d  program, changing it from voluntary to mandatory. Further, it stated that it  would, in effect, place EAC in a position to act in a regulatory capacity  without having the specific authority to do so, as it would necessitate  making both the voluntary voting system guidelines and the testing and  certification program mandatory for all states. It also stated that it would  require EAC to have specific authority to compel manufacturers of these  noncertified voting systems to submit their systems for testing, and to  compel states and local jurisdictions to report and resolve any identified  system problems.", "We recognize that both the voting system guidelines and the testing and  certification program are voluntary, and that EAC does not have the  authority to compel manufacturers or states and local jurisdictions to  submit to its testing and certification program, or to force them to correct  any known problems or report future problems. We further acknowledge  that the wording of the matter for congressional consideration in our draft  report resulted in EAC interpreting accomplishment of it as requiring such  unintended measures. Therefore, we have modified it to clarify our intent  and to avoid any possible misunderstanding. In doing so, we have  emphasized our intent for EAC to continue to serve its existing role as a  facilitator and provider of resources and services to assist states and local  jurisdictions in understanding shared problems, as well as the voluntary  nature of both the system guidelines and the testing and certification  program. Further, we seek to capitalize on EAC\u2019s unique role as a national  coordination entity to address a potentially longstanding, situational  awareness void as it pertains to voting systems in use in our nation\u2019s  elections. As we state in our report, this void increases the chances of  states and local jurisdictions duplicating efforts to fix common system  problems, and of problems addressed by one state or local jurisdiction  being unknown to others. We believe that a key to overcoming this will be  strong central leadership, and that with the appropriate resources, EAC is  in the best position to serve this role.", "We are sending a copy of this report to the Ranking Member of the House  Committee on House Administration, the Chairman and Ranking Member  of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the Chairmen and  Ranking Members of the Subcommittees on Financial Services and  General Government, Senate and House Committees on Appropriations,  and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.

We obtained and reviewed relevant EAC policies and procedures  for testing, certifying, decertifying, and recertifying voting systems.  Specifically, we reviewed the EAC Certification Program Manual and other  EAC-provided documents. We interviewed EAC officials and their  technical reviewers, NIST officials, representatives from the industry trade  association for voting system manufacturers, representatives from the  voting system test laboratories, and the National Association of State  Election Directors\u2019 point-of-contact for qualified systems. We then  compared this body of evidence with the leading practices and related  guidance we had researched, as well as applicable legal requirements, to  determine whether EAC\u2019s program had been effectively defined. In  addition, for the third objective, we reviewed the contents and policy of  EAC\u2019s clearinghouse.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and reviewed actions and  artifacts from EAC\u2019s execution of its certification program to date. We  assessed this information against the policies, procedures, and standards  outlined in the EAC Certification Program Manual and the 2005 Voluntary  Voting System Guidelines, and after discussing and confirming our  findings with EAC officials, we determined whether EAC had followed its  defined approach.", "In addition, to determine the impact of federal certification time frames,  we included a question about EAC certification on a survey of officials  from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 4 territories. We also  contacted officials from states that indicated their intent to use EAC  certification for the 2008 elections to better understand how they plan to  address voting system certification in their state relative to EAC\u2019s  program. To develop our survey, we reviewed related previous and  ongoing GAO work, and developed a questionnaire in collaboration with  GAO\u2019s survey and subject matter experts. We conducted pretests in person  and by telephone with election officials from 5 states to refine and clarify  our questions. Our Web-based survey was conducted from December 2007  through April 2008. We received responses from 47 states, the District of  Columbia, and all 4 territories (a 95 percent response rate). Differences in  the interpretation of our questions among election officials, the sources of  information available to respondents, and the types of people who do not  respond may have introduced unwanted variability in the responses. We  examined the survey results and performed analyses to identify  inconsistencies and other indications of error, which were reviewed by an  independent analyst. We also contacted officials from those states whose  survey response indicated their intent to use EAC certification for the 2008  elections to identify their plans and approaches for state certification in  the event that federal certification could not be completed to meet their  election preparation schedules.", "We conducted this performance audit at EAC offices in Washington, D.C.,  from September 2007 to September 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.
