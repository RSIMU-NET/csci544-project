According to Postal Service officials, the Postal Service had not anticipated this growth and was unprepared to process and deliver the increased volume of mail.", "Complicating the situation were several factors that worked against the Postal Service. First, according to Postal officials, local processing and delivery units experienced staffing problems because more craft people than expected accepted a retirement incentive (buyout) of up to 6 months\u2019 salary and left the Service during the 1992 restructuring. Also, staffing ceilings were put into place in anticipation of more automation equipment. These events, according to Postal officials, left the delivery units with too few people to handle the increased volume of mail. Additionally, the processing units were operating with too many unskilled, temporary employees who had been hired to replace more costly career employees who retired in 1992. Training also became an issue when some new supervisors were placed in jobs where they were not familiar with the work of the employees they were supervising. After considerable attention was focused on these problems in the spring of 1994, the Postal Service took steps to hire new, permanent employees and strengthen training for supervisors and craft personnel.", "Second, to focus additional attention on customer service, separate lines of reporting authority were established for mail processing and mail delivery functions under the Executive Vice President/Chief Operating Officer during the 1992 restructuring. This realignment of responsibilities was done as part of the Postmaster General\u2019s broad strategy to make the Postal Service more competitive, accountable, and credible. This action left no single individual with the responsibility and authority to coordinate and integrate the mail processing and delivery functions at the operating levels of the organization. The primary focus of each of the function managers was to fulfill the responsibilities of his or her function. Working with the other function managers became a secondary concern. Consequently, because critical decisions affecting both mail processing and customer services could not be made by one individual at the operating level of the organization, coordination problems developed.", "In June 1994, the Postmaster General moved responsibility for processing and delivery down to the Area Vice President level, and on January 10, 1995, postal officials announced plans for establishing a position under the Mid-Atlantic Area Vice President that would be responsible for overseeing all processing and delivery functions in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and Baltimore area.", "Time slippages in the automation program was another factor that affected the Postal Service\u2019s ability to handle the increased volume of mail. More mail than planned had to be processed manually or on mechanical letter-sorting machines. The Postal Service had expected that by 1995 almost all letter mail would be barcoded by either the Postal Service or mailers and be processed on automated equipment. However, automation fell behind schedule in 1993-1994. The new projected date for barcoding all letter mail has slipped to the end of 1997.

Some of the more significant actions taken include (1) reducing the amount of mail handled by more than one processing facility in Northern Virginia, (2) processing more mail at local facilities rather than transporting it to distant processing and distribution centers, (3) working with the large mailers to get them to mail earlier in the day and give advance notice when mailing unusually large volumes, (4) taking the first steps to develop a system that can pinpoint causes of delayed mail, and (5) requiring greater adherence to established operating procedures. Additionally, a number of service improvement teams are continuing to examine mail handling processes in an effort to identify other areas needing improvement.", "Examples provided by local postal officials that most clearly illustrate problems affecting the local area are discussed below.", "Duplicative mail handling: Much mail sent to the Northern Virginia area was delayed because it was processed by both the Dulles and Merrifield facilities. Further delays also occurred because of the time lost transporting mail between the two facilities. Duplicative mail handling occurred because the Dulles and Merrifield facilities are jointly responsible for certain ZIP Code service areas and most facilities sending mail to Northern Virginia did not separate the mail between the two facilities. There is no easy way to split up the service areas between the two facilities geographically\u2014it would require realigning and changing some ZIP Codes. That option had not been vigorously pursued because of the adverse reaction from customers anticipated by the Service. However, the Postal Service recently began working with major feeders of overnight mail to work out an interim solution\u2014i.e., the feeder facilities are to sort mail more completely before sending it to the Merrifield and Dulles facilities. Additionally, the Postal Service, in commenting on a draft of this report, said that it will be installing a Remote Bar Coding System site at the Dulles processing and distribution center (P&DC) that, along with other processing changes, will virtually eliminate the need for duplicative handling of mail for some Northern Virginia ZIP Codes.", "Overnight service areas that are too large: Consistent overnight delivery service in some parts of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area is difficult to achieve because some service areas may be too large for the current collection, transportation, and delivery network. For example, mail from some of the outlying areas in the service area\u2014e.g., Leonardtown and California, Maryland\u2014does not arrive at the Southern Maryland processing facility until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. This severely compresses the amount of time available for processing the mail and getting it back out to the post offices in time for delivery the next day. To address this problem, the Postal Service plans to process mail from Leonardtown and California, in addition to other Southern Maryland areas, at a closer facility in Waldorf (Charles County), Maryland. Additionally, the Postal Service is installing more \u201clocal only\u201d collection boxes, which should reduce the amount of mail that has to be transported to distant processing and distribution centers.", "Mail arriving too late for timely processing: Large quantities of mail are frequently entered into the mail stream significantly past the times established for normal processing. This would not be a problem, however, were it not for the expectation that deliveries would be made the next day. Managers told us they have few options other than to accept late-arriving mail and then rush to meet dispatch times. They said that to do otherwise would upset the delicate balance between providing customer service and meeting established time schedules. To help establish a more orderly workflow, the Postal Service has been actively working with large mailers in the area to get them to mail earlier in the day and also to notify the Postal Service ahead of time when large mailings are expected to arrive.

He noted that in December 1993, in preparation for additional automated sorting systems, the Postal Service had put in place employee complement ceilings. As a result of this action, he said, delivery units struggled with unfilled vacancies, and the processing and distribution centers had to rely on a workforce with many unskilled, temporary employees.", "These problems were confirmed by local Washington, D.C., area postal officials.

Mechanized sorting on letter sorting machines, on the other hand, requires operators to memorize difficult sort schemes and key in ZIP Code information. This human intervention results in higher potential for mishandling mail, causing delays.

This action resulted in splitting accountability for processes critical to mail delivery service.", "The value of separating responsibility for the mail processing function (which takes place primarily at processing and distribution centers) from the mail delivery function (which takes place primarily at local post offices) has been controversial. The separation left no single manager with the responsibility and authority to coordinate and integrate the mail processing and delivery functions in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Each manager\u2019s primary focus became the fulfillment of his or her own individual responsibilities. Working with managers of other functions became secondary. Consequently, critical decisions affecting both mail processing and customer services in the Washington, D.C., area were not being made by one manager at the operating level of the organization.", "For example, when we visited one post office in Northern Virginia, local postal officials complained that too much unsorted and misrouted mail was routinely sent to local post offices in order to keep the Merrifield P&DC from having a backlog of unprocessed mail. On the day of our visit, these officials showed us a container of misrouted mail from Merrifield that included not only overnight First-Class Mail but also Priority Mail. The Postmaster noted that by the time this mail could be sent back to Merrifield to be correctly sorted, it would be at least 1 day late.

This is partly a result of the way ZIP Codes were first assigned within the 220 and 221 delivery service areas.", "In 1963, when the ZIP Code service areas were first established, the Dulles facility did not exist; therefore, Merrifield was responsible for all of 220 and 221. At that time, postal officials at Merrifield assigned Zip Codes using an alphabetic listing of all post offices in these two service areas. Because the assignments were made alphabetically, there was no clear geographic distinction between the 220 and 221 service areas. Subsequently, in 1992, when the Dulles facility became operational, there was no good way of isolating either the 220 or 221 service area for processing at Dulles. Therefore, both facilities assumed joint responsibility for processing mail addressed to 220 and 221. In 1991, however, a plan was approved at the headquarters staff level to restructure the ZIP Codes in these two service areas, but top management did not approve that plan because of concerns over reactions from postal customers about ZIP Code changes.", "Depending on the originating point and predetermined routing schedules, mail addressed to 220 or 221 is to go to either the Merrifield or Dulles centers for processing. The receiving center is to sort the mail to identify the mail that is to be delivered within its service area and then dispatch the remaining mail to the other center for further processing. Postal officials said this procedure results in excessive transportation between the two facilities and duplicative sorting, which can also translate into delayed mail. Postal officials were unable to say precisely how much mail was subjected to this duplicative processing but said it involved substantial quantities.", "As a partial solution to the problem of duplicative mail handling in the Northern Virginia area, the Postal Service has begun asking the primary feeders of overnight mail to Northern Virginia to sort that mail to a 5-digit level and transport it to the appropriate center in Northern Virginia for further processing. The Postal Service expects this change to reduce the duplicative handling of mail between the two centers, but it places more processing work on the other facilities.

The plant manager at Southern Maryland said mail from Leonardtown and California often does not arrive at the Southern Maryland center for processing until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. He said the post offices were unable to get the mail to him earlier in the day because the carriers were often making deliveries and picking up mail until late in the evening.

Consequently, postal management cannot track First-Class Mail that was delayed and gather related data to promptly determine when, where, and why it fell behind schedule.", "One floor supervisor at the Brentwood processing facility in Washington, D.C., explained the implications of this weakness. He said that any postal employee can examine a container of mail at any point in the processing and delivery cycle and determine whether that mail is on schedule. This is possible because each P&DC has an operating plan establishing \u201cwindows\u201d for receiving, processing, and dispatching mail. Therefore, a mail handler can examine the postmark on a mailpiece, compare it to the mail processing timetable (operating plan), and determine whether or not the mailpiece is delayed.
