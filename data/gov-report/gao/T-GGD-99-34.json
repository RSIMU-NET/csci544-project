The rapid growth of Internet commerce is also significantly transforming the U.S. securities industry. For example, in 1998, approximately 22 percent of all securities transactions were conducted over the Internet compared with virtually no such transactions in 1995.  According to industry observers, the Internet is popular among investors because it allows them to buy and sell securities from their personal computers, lower trading commissions, and gain ready access to market research.", "Unfortunately, the Internet also provides fraudulent operators with a new and efficient medium to defraud investors of millions of dollars. Fraudulent operators find the Internet attractive because they can instantly communicate with millions of potential victims\u2014via professionally looking websites, that appear to offer legitimate investment information, on-line newsletters, or e-mail\u2014at far lower costs than traditional means of communication, such as the telephone.  In addition, the Internet makes it easier for fraudulent operators to remain anonymous and commit crimes from nearly any location in the world and thereby evade U.S. regulatory and law enforcement authorities.", "According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials, as the Internet continues to expand rapidly, opportunities for securities frauds increase as well.  For example, the number of E-mail complaints submitted to SEC, many of which allege potential Internet frauds, soared from about 10 to 15 daily in 1997 to between 200 and 300 daily in early 1999. According to SEC, the types of frauds committed over the Internet are generally traditional securities frauds.  In one scheme, individuals who own a company\u2019s securities spread positive but false information about the company to increase investor interest and drive-up the price of the securities.  The individuals then sell their securities at a quick profit, while later investors face large losses when the price of the inflated securities declines. monitor the Internet for potential frauds and penalize violators of state securities laws.", "However, SEC and state regulatory programs to combat Internet securities fraud are new and face significant challenges that could limit their long- term effectiveness.  In particular, the potential exists that the rapid growth in reported Internet securities frauds could ultimately place a significant burden on the regulators\u2019 limited investigative staff resources and thereby limit the agencies\u2019 capacity to respond effectively to credible fraud allegations.  Moreover, the regulators face challenges in developing a coordinated approach to combating Internet fraud and educating a wide audience about the potential risks of Internet investing.", "Ms. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: We are pleased to be here today to discuss Internet securities fraud and regulatory efforts to combat this growing problem.  The Internet is a global network of computers that ties together an estimated 153 million users worldwide and is providing the basis for a rapid expansion in electronic commerce.  According to one industry research firm, total U.S. business trade on the Internet reached $43 billion in 1998 and is projected to soar to $1.3 trillion by 2003.  The rapid growth of the Internet is also significantly transforming the securities industry in the United States.  An industry study, reported that approximately 22 percent of all retail U.S. securities trades were conducted over the Internet in the first half of 1998, which was significant given that there was virtually no on-line trading in 1995.  The industry study projected that the total number of on-line brokerage accounts will nearly triple from about 5 million in 1998 to over 14 million in 2002.", "Securities industry observers and participants cite several benefits that the Internet provides to investors, which account for its growing popularity. In particular, the Internet permits investors to place buy and sell orders from the convenience of their personal computers and can lower trading commission fees charged by full-service brokers.  By accessing broker- dealer webpages, investors can also gain access to stock market research that previously was not readily accessible to the investing public. Moreover, the Internet also allows investors to obtain immediate access to price quotes on securities or mutual funds.", "Unfortunately, the Internet also provides several advantages to fraudulent operators who are using the new medium to defraud investors of millions of dollars.  First, the Internet provides fraudulent operators with the ability to communicate electronically with millions of potential victims at a far lower cost than traditional means of communication, such as the telephone or mass mailings.  Fraudulent operators can communicate with investors over the Internet through professionally designed webpages that may appear to offer legitimate investment information, on-line investor newsletters, chatrooms, or mass E-mailings (called \u201cspam\u201d).  Second, fraudulent operators can use technology available on the Internet that makes it easier to hide their identity and thereby evade regulatory authorities.  Third, fraudulent operators with Internet access can quickly initiate investment scams from virtually any location in the world thereby making it difficult for federal and state regulators to catch and prosecute violators or obtain compensation for victims.", "As you requested, my statement will provide information about the incidence and types of securities frauds perpetrated over the Internet, describe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiatives to combat provide information on the penalties that have been imposed on individuals found to have committed Internet securities frauds, present information from state securities regulators about state efforts to control Internet securities fraud, and identify potential challenges facing SEC and state regulatory initiatives in combating securities fraud over the Internet.", "In summary, our work to date indicates that:", "SEC and state regulatory officials generally agree that as the Internet continues to expand rapidly, opportunities for securities frauds are growing as well.   One rough indicator of the growth in Internet securities fraud is the number of public E-mail complaints that are submitted to SEC\u2019s Internet website.  The number of such E-mail complaints, many of which allege potential Internet securities frauds, soared from 10 to 15 daily in 1996 to between 200 and 300 daily in early 1999.", "According to SEC, the Internet provides a new medium to perpetrate traditional investor frauds, such as stock price manipulation schemes. However, some securities frauds appear unique to the Internet environment, such as the reported illegal copying of legitimate broker- dealer webpages for the purposes of defrauding unknowing investors.", "SEC has responded to the growing Internet fraud problem by, among other things, creating the Office of Internet Enforcement (OIE) to coordinate the agency\u2019s efforts to combat Internet fraud, providing training to SEC investigative staff on monitoring the Internet, and preparing guidance for SEC staff who are investigating potential Internet frauds.  In addition, SEC has established programs to educate investors about the risks associated with Internet securities frauds, such as posting relevant information on its website.", "Since 1995, SEC initiated a total of 66 enforcement actions against alleged perpetrators of Internet securities frauds.  As of February 1999, 32 of the 66 cases had largely been concluded, with violators generally required to (1) pay civil money penalties or (2) refrain from further violations of the securities laws.  However, in 2 of the 32 concluded cases, state or federal criminal enforcement authorities prosecuted violators and obtained criminal convictions or prison sentences for 7 individuals.", "Over the past several years, nearly half of all state regulatory agencies have established specific programs to combat Internet frauds that violate state securities laws.  Although many state agencies have initiated enforcement actions to prevent further violations of state law, officials from these agencies told us that in some cases violators may continue committing the fraudulent activity in other states.", "SEC and state regulatory agency programs to combat Internet securities fraud are new and face significant challenges that could limit their effectiveness in the long-term.  In particular, the potential exists that the rapid growth in reported Internet securities frauds could ultimately place a significant burden on the regulators\u2019 limited investigative staff resources and thereby limit the agencies\u2019 capacity to respond effectively to credible fraud allegations.  Moreover, the regulators face challenges in developing a coordinated approach to combating Internet fraud and educating a wide audience about the risks associated with Internet investing. Due to time constraints, we focused our analysis on SEC and state agency regulatory efforts to combat Internet securities fraud rather than other securities regulators that may also play a role, such as the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, we did meet with officials from these organizations to obtain a general understanding of their regulatory efforts.", "To meet our objectives for this work, we interviewed SEC officials from OIE, Division of Market Surveillance, Office of Investor Education, and the San Francisco District Office.  We also obtained information from SEC on the outcomes of the 66 Internet securities fraud cases and reviewed the data contained in a random sample of 100 complaints received by the SEC and referred to SEC regional and district offices and other federal agencies.  In addition, we met with officials from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the White Collar Crime Center, and the North American Association of Securities Administrators (NAASA) to discuss their roles in monitoring and combating Internet securities fraud.  Finally, we (1) surveyed officials from all 50 state securities regulatory agencies to obtain their views on Internet securities fraud and efforts to control this growing problem and (2) met with officials from three on-line broker- dealers to discuss securities fraud and related issues.  We did our work between October 1998 and March 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulators Report That Internet Securities Frauds Are Increasing", "paragraphs": ["There are no comprehensive statistics available on the incidence of securities frauds committed over the Internet.  However, SEC and other federal agency officials we contacted said that Internet securities fraud is an emerging problem, which will likely grow as the use of the Internet continues to expand worldwide.  The data available from state securities agencies also suggest that Internet securities fraud is increasing. According to SEC, the growing number of frauds committed over the Internet are types that are generally well-established in the securities industry.  For example, in one common scheme, an individual who owns a large number of shares spreads positive but materially false information about a company over the Internet.  This information drives up the company\u2019s stock price and the individual makes a profit from the sale of these stocks at the expense of other investors (commonly referred to as \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes).

According to SEC, the public submitted about 10 to15 complaints daily in 1996 via the E-mail system with the number rising to about 120 daily through September 1998.  After SEC publicly announced a crackdown on Internet securities fraud in October 1998, SEC officials said the number of daily E-mail complaints soared to 200 to 300 daily and has continued to run about this range in early 1999.  However, it is important to note that the volume of daily E-mail complaints submitted to SEC has several significant limitations as a measure of the extent of Internet securities fraud.  For example, investors who are unaware that they have been defrauded would not likely submit E- mail complaints to SEC.  In addition, SEC receives E-mail complaints that do not involve potential violations of the securities laws and some complaints may allege securities frauds that do not involve the Internet.", "Other organizations and state regulatory agencies have also reported a significant number of public complaints regarding potential securities fraud committed over the Internet.  NAASA\u2014the organization that represents state securities regulatory agencies\u2014received about 350 securities-related complaints involving the Internet over a 4-week period in October 1998, when NAASA first established an E-mail complaint system. Officials from securities regulatory agencies in 37 of the 50 states surveyed told us that they collectively received over 1,400 complaints related to potential Internet securities frauds last year.  Generally, states reported receiving no such complaints in 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Internet Provides a New Medium to Perpetrate Traditional Securities Frauds", "paragraphs": ["SEC officials told us that the Internet provides a new medium for perpetrating fraudulent schemes that are well-established violations in the securities industry.  Some of the fraudulent schemes are violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  For example, one commonly employed fraudulent scheme involves disseminating materially false information via spam, websites, on-line newsletters, or other means about small companies that have issued thinly traded securities.  The transmission of materially false information\u2014such as false statements about a company\u2019s financial condition\u2014over the Internet provides instant access to millions of potential victims at far lower costs than traditional means of perpetrating scams, such as the telephone or mass mailings.", "According to SEC officials, one reason fraudulent operators spread false information about companies and their securities is to increase investor purchases of the securities, thereby increasing share prices.  Frequently, the fraudulent operators already own a large number of these securities and are able to make quick profits by selling their securities as prices increase.  By contrast, investors who purchase securities on the basis of false information may experience significant and rapid losses when the perpetrators sell their large positions.  For example, in one case, SEC alleged that the defendants encouraged discussion about a company on Internet news groups and disseminated information that materially misrepresented the state of the company\u2019s technology, commercial viability, and existence of purchase orders for equipment.  SEC further alleged that while continuing this scheme the defendants sold the company\u2019s securities for more than $3 million.", "SEC identified fraudulent operators who frequently provide compensation to, for example, on-line newsletters in the form of securities or cash to further these schemes.  The newsletters publish the false information about companies or claim to provide \u201cobjective analysis\u201d about the promising prospects for the securities without disclosing the compensation provided to the newsletter in exchange for publishing this positive information, a practice known as \u201ctouting.\u201d  Touters often sell their shares in the company immediately following their recommendations, which is a deceptive practice commonly referred to as \u201cscalping.\u201d  In October 1998, SEC announced a nationwide crackdown on Internet touting, charging a total of 44 individuals or companies with engaging in the practice.  In February 1999, SEC continued its Internet fraud crackdown and charged another 13 individuals or companies.  We discuss SEC\u2019s enforcement activities in more detail later in this statement.", "The sale of unregistered securities on the Internet is a problem reported among the states we contacted.  In one case, Connecticut securities officials found that a prepaid cellular telephone company was advertising falsely over the Internet that it would sell limited liability partnership interests for a minimum price of $5,000.  Rather than using these funds to create a cellular telephone network in the Boston area as advertised, state regulators believed that the money may have been diverted to the company\u2019s owners.  Other state securities regulators have reported the illegal sale over the Internet of stocks in offshore gambling enterprises, time travel technology, Hollywood movie theme restaurants, and air- conditioning and helicopter production companies.  Financial losses suffered among victims of illegal securities sales reportedly ranged from $18,000 to over $100 million.", "Other Internet securities frauds identified by federal and state regulators include initial public offerings and prime bank note schemes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Internet Also Provides Opportunities for a New Type of Securities Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Although the Internet generally provides a new medium to commit traditional securities frauds, it has also provided opportunities for some new fraudulent schemes.

Information contained in the website\u2014such as the company\u2019s name, address, and telephone numbers\u2014were slightly altered or changed.  The company CEO told us that the perpetrator who committed this scheme used the copied website to dupe foreign investors into sending funds to addresses listed.  The company CEO also said that this scam went on for about 10 months, until the perpetrator moved on and copied another company\u2019s website and continued the scam.", "Similarly, a Washington state securities official told us that a web site of a legitimate broker-dealer located in Seattle was copied and used to defraud foreign investors.  The state official said that foreign investors were persuaded to purchase worthless stock certificates, and lost millions of dollars before the perpetrators decided to move on and copy another company\u2019s web site.

During calendar year 1998, OIE referred about 800 complaints to other SEC units, and to other federal regulatory and enforcement agencies.", "SEC\u2019s enforcement division and regional offices provide about 125 staff who work part-time on various Internet fraud-related activities.  For example, SEC staff may volunteer to spend about 1 to 2 hours a week identifying potential securities frauds.  Or, the SEC staff may work on Internet securities fraud investigations that were initiated on the basis of referrals made by OIE.  SEC staff also may obtain information on potential Internet securities frauds from sources other than OIE.

Rather, the SEC official said that investors should perform a number of independent steps to ensure the accuracy of information provided about a stock over the Internet.  These steps include reviewing financial information about the company that may be available from independent sources, determining whether the company is in fact developing a technology as advertised over the Internet, and contacting companies that are alleged to be in the process of signing contracts with the company in question.

In particular, the potential exists that the rapid growth in reported Internet securities frauds could ultimately place a significant burden on the regulators\u2019 limited investigative staff resources and thereby limit the agencies\u2019 ability to respond effectively to credible fraud allegations.  Another ongoing challenge is coordinating oversight among international, federal, and state securities regulators so that fraudulent operators are deterred from taking advantage of the fact that Internet frauds can be initiated from virtually anywhere in the world.  A final challenge involves educating the investing public about the risks associated with Internet securities frauds.  Since regulatory resources are limited, preventing investors from falling for Internet securities frauds in the first place may be the best way to contain the problem."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Rapid Growth of Reported Internet Securities Frauds Poses Challenges to Limited Regulatory Investigative Resources", "paragraphs": ["The rapid expansion of the Internet and the growth of securities-related activities over the past several years pose potential challenges to SEC and state regulatory agencies to control securities fraud on the Internet. According to SEC\u2019s OIE Chief, the rapid expansion in E-mail complaints from 10 to 15 daily in 1996 to 200 to 300 complaints daily in early 1999 suggests that the agency may ultimately reach a point where it cannot respond to all credible allegations of Internet securities fraud.  Given its present staffing levels, SEC officials said that the agency already tends to focus investigations on certain high-profile cases, including Internet fraud cases.  We also note that over the past several years a significant number of SEC attorneys who are responsible for investigating Internet and other securities fraud cases have left the agency for higher-paying jobs in the private sector.  For example, SEC reports that between 1996 and 1998 SEC\u2019s New York office lost 54 percent of its 137 enforcement staff and the San Francisco office lost about 40 percent of its 25 enforcement staff.", "State regulatory officials we contacted said that their agencies have few staff allocated to investigate Internet fraud cases.  For example, many state officials said that their agencies have no more than five staff to investigate and enforce all relevant state securities laws, so finding the time to adequately monitor the Internet to detect potential frauds can be difficult. Further, officials from some other state agencies said that specific programs to monitor Internet fraud have not been established in their organizations due to limited staff.", "Given that the Internet has millions of web-sites and the regulators\u2019 belief that a large number of these sites, on-line newsletters and spams include schemes intended to defraud investors, SEC and state regulators may also face challenges in obtaining the technical capacity to comprehensively monitor the Internet and detect potential securities frauds.  According to state regulatory officials, their staff mainly surf the Internet using commercial search engines and key word searches to detect potential frauds, which is a method that an official from the National White Collar Crime Center said is labor intensive and inherently inefficient.  The official also said regulators should develop customized search engines to detect potential Internet frauds that could relieve staff of the labor-intensive search activities and thereby enhance regulatory efficiency.  SEC\u2019s OIE Chief told us that use of customized search engines can help facilitate the detection of Internet securities frauds, but such devices are no substitute for the judgement of experienced, investigative staff trained in methods to identify potentially fraudulent activities.  Further, the OIE Chief said that developing such customized search engines could place demands on a regulator\u2019s limited financial resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Face Challenges in Maintaining a Coordinated Approach to Combating Internet Securities Fraud", "paragraphs": ["The global nature of the Internet increases the regulatory challenges of combating Internet securities fraud because the Internet for the most part does not recognize jurisdictional boundaries.  Now, a fraudulent operator from anywhere in the world could solicit U.S. investors linked to the Internet.  Even in the United States, fraudulent operators located in one state can use the Internet to defraud residents of other states, even though another state has taken action directing the operator to cease and desist. Jurisdictional issues are challenging because close coordination and cooperation among international, federal, and state securities regulators is required to prosecute violators and hopefully, deter additional Internet frauds.", "The regulatory challenges associated with investigating overseas Internet securities fraud cases include obtaining evidence, convincing other governments to prosecute foreign entities and individuals, and ensuring restitution for victims.  A 1997 report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), argued that securities regulators need to establish well-defined mechanisms for cooperating with their foreign counterparts to respond to these challenges and deter Internet frauds.  For example, IOSCO recommended that securities regulators develop policies and procedures to ensure the timely exchange of information about ongoing investigations of Internet securities fraud.  IOSCO also stated that coordination should include sharing information about (1) Internet surveillance techniques, (2) questionable transactions that may represent potential Internet frauds, and (3) successful approaches to prosecuting Internet securities fraud cases.", "State securities regulatory agencies face similar challenges in developing a coordinated approach to Internet fraud investigations and enforcement. As pointed out earlier, state enforcement actions may have limited success because Internet securities frauds may be committed from out-of-state locations.  Challenges facing states include working with other regulatory agencies to combat fraudulent schemes that operate across states, ensuring sufficient monitoring of the Internet by other jurisdictions, and obtaining necessary evidence to initiate enforcement action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Face Challenges in Educating the Investing Public on the Risks Associated with Internet Securities Frauds", "paragraphs": ["According to SEC, investor education is a critical defense against Internet securities frauds given the fact that regulatory resources to combat the problem are limited.  If investors are adequately informed about the risks associated with potential Internet securities frauds, then they will be less likely to fall victim to sophisticated scams.  The investor education challenges facing regulatory agencies include identifying schemes or mechanisms that require further investor awareness and widely disseminating information about the risks associated with Internet in a timely and effective manner.  While SEC has taken steps to educate the public that investment decisions should not be made solely on the basis of information received over the Internet, ensuring that such warnings reach a wide audience is a difficult challenge.  SEC\u2019s investor education initiatives to date\u2014such as posting information on the SEC website and producing pamphlets\u2014are relatively low cost and have a limited ability to reach a wide audience.  For example, not all investors may be aware that SEC has posted investor education information on its website.  Reaching a large audience with relevant investor information often involves conducting large media campaigns that could be expensive and may take a long time to produce results.  SEC\u2019s capacity to educate investors and disseminate widely relevant information about the potential risks of Internet securities frauds may be limited.  According to SEC, the agency\u2019s budget and staff resources directed to investor education have remained relatively stable over the past several years, so the agency\u2019s capacity to initiate large-scale media campaigns is limited.", "In summary, Ms. Chairman we commend you for holding this hearing and thank you for inviting us to testify on our preliminary observations on Internet securities fraud and regulatory efforts to combat this growing problem.
