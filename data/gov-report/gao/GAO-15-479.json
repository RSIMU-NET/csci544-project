A key intervention in four of these countries is developing new reading instruction materials in mother-tongue languages\u2014in some instances, multiple languages. In Ethiopia, for example, USAID's reading program developed new student textbooks and teacher's guides for each of eight grades and seven languages and involved teams of local teachers, language experts, and story writers, among others. The complexity of these interventions in Ethiopia, Malawi, the Philippines, and Uganda increased the time before they could be introduced in classrooms. As a result, some targeted student populations are not expected to benefit from improved reading instruction until late 2015 or 2016, too late to be measured to contribute to USAID's strategic goal of 100 million students with improved reading skills by the end of 2015. In addition, the missions were monitoring their reading programs and planned to conduct program evaluations consistent with USAID guidance.", "USAID is currently unable to estimate progress toward the education strategy's reading goal because of four factors. First, because it took some missions longer to implement reading programs than USAID estimated, only about two-thirds of missions are expected to have data to estimate progress toward the goal by the end of 2015. Second, only a small number of missions provided USAID the complete data and supporting information that it needs to aggregate and analyze reading assessment results. Agency officials attributed the lack of complete data and information to an absence of timely guidance. In 2014, USAID issued updated reporting guidance. Third, USAID has not selected a methodology for calculating percentages of assessed children demonstrating improved reading skills, and extrapolating the results to estimate the total numbers of children with improved reading skills. Along with incomplete data and information, other factors contributed to a delay in identifying a methodology\u2014for example, USAID did not ask its contractor to examine the methodology proposed in 2012 and explore alternatives until 2014.

According  to the second contractor, once USAID selects a methodology, the  contractor can calculate the percentages of assessed children who  demonstrate improved reading skills. The contractor will then extrapolate  these percentages to the populations of children exposed to the programs  to estimate total numbers of children with improved reading skills.", "Threshold methodology. The threshold methodology calculates the  percentages of improved readers on the basis of changes in the  proportion of children who improve from below a threshold level of  reading in a baseline assessment to a level at or above that threshold  in an endline assessment. For example, different threshold levels of  reading are created using the average numbers of words read  correctly per minute and numbers of reading comprehension  questions answered correctly for the sample of assessed children at  baseline. The percentage of improved readers is then calculated on  the basis of the differences between the proportions of children at  each of these threshold levels at baseline and at endline.", "Gain score methodology. The gain score methodology ranks  assessment results for a sample of children assessed at baseline and  a sample assessed at endline and matches results for individuals in  each sample to calculate percentages with improved reading skills.  For example, assessment results for the child reading the 10th fewest  words correctly per minute at baseline are matched with results for the  child reading the 10th fewest words correctly at endline. The  percentages of children with improved reading skills are calculated on  the basis of the numbers of matched pairs whose reading skills  increased by a given minimum\u2014for instance, who read an additional  1, 5, or 10 words correctly per minute.", "The USAID contractor staff used assessment data from eight USAID  programs to compare percentages of improved readers that they  calculated using the two methodologies and various minimum reading  levels. According to the contractor\u2019s analysis, using the two  methodologies to analyze the same assessment results produced  different estimates of the percentages of children demonstrating improved  reading skills. Specifically, the contractor found that the gain score  methodology consistently produced higher estimates of improved readers  than did the threshold methodology. According to the contractor, the  discrepancy in the estimates from the two methodologies occurs because  the threshold methodology only counts children whose reading improves  across a threshold level. The threshold methodology does not count  children who demonstrate some level of improved reading, but whose  reading skills remain below or above a threshold level.", "The USAID contractor has also reviewed possible procedures for  extrapolating the percentages of samples of assessed children  demonstrating reading improvements to all children exposed to the  reading interventions.

However, in part, because of the time required for  missions to design and implement programs and assess children\u2019s  reading skills, USAID\u2019s contractor has limited access to reading  assessment data. USAID officials acknowledged that the education  strategy\u2019s time frames were unrealistic. Moreover, USAID has not yet  selected and documented a methodology\u2014including reporting information  on the sampling designs, sample sizes, and modes of data collection\u2014for  estimating total numbers of children whose reading skills have improved.  Until it selects and documents a methodology for calculating the  percentages of assessed children demonstrating improved reading skills,  and extrapolating the results to estimate the total numbers of children with  improved reading skills, USAID cannot monitor and reliably report  estimates of the results of its efforts to improve reading skills of 100  million children.", "Furthermore, unless it selects and documents a methodology and sets  targets for measuring progress toward a reading goal in any future  education strategy, USAID will be limited in its ability to assess progress  toward that goal in comparison with planned performance.

We selected the three African  countries because this region received more than 50 percent of USAID\u2019s  allocation for basic education assistance in fiscal year 2013 and was  identified in the education strategy as a priority region for investment of  resources. In addition, we selected the five countries because the USAID  missions in these countries had primary grade reading programs under  way and had conducted at least baseline reading assessments.

We  also visited schools, where we observed classroom reading lessons that  used instructional materials developed through USAID\u2019s programs and  met with local teachers, education officials, and community organizations  to discuss program interventions. In Ethiopia, we observed local teams of  teachers, story writers, editors, and typists in the process of developing  reading curriculums in seven mother-tongue languages for grades 5  through 8.

For  example, in each country, assessor and supervisor reliability scores were  calculated during training and those assessors and supervisors with low  scores were either retrained or not allowed to collect data. Also, sampling  designs appropriately considered analytical goals, such as expected  precision of subpopulation estimates, and the geographical distribution of  schools and the population of students.
