CIPP allows interested  servicemembers to take a sabbatical of up to 3 years in order to meet  personal or professional needs, such as pursuing higher education or  caring for ailing parents or young children, and then return to active duty  with no adverse career effect. CIPP was initially authorized to accept  participants beginning January 1, 2009, with no servicemembers to be  released from active duty under the program after December 31, 2012.  After subsequent extensions the program is currently authorized until  December 31, 2019.

Also, we reviewed Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD(P&R))  guidance provided to the services, as well as service-specific CIPP  implementation guidance. In addition, we interviewed OUSD(P&R)  officials and CIPP program managers for each of the four services\u2014 including the Navy\u2019s Military Personnel Plans and Policies office; the Air  Force\u2019s Military Force Management Policy office; the Army\u2019s Military  Personnel Management Directorate within the Deputy Chief of Staff Army  G1 office, and Human Resources Command; and the Marine Corps\u2019  Manpower & Reserve Affairs office. We compared the documentation and  information obtained against key features of program evaluation plans  developed by GAO and private professional auditing and evaluation  organizations. The key features in the public and private standards  include establishing well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives and  standards for determining pilot-program performance. To identify what  factors, if any, have affected CIPP participation, we reviewed statutory  and service-specific guidance to identify eligibility criteria for participating  in CIPP, and we discussed with CIPP officials the extent to which these  criteria and other factors affect participation. In addition, we collected and  reviewed CIPP applicant data by gender, servicemember rank, and  reason for and length of requested sabbatical, as well as data indicating  the reasons why applicants were disapproved for the program. We  interviewed service officials responsible for maintaining CIPP participation  data to determine the data collection and internal control processes used  to ensure data accuracy. Based on these conversations and our review of  available documentation, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this review.", "To review the Navy\u2019s reported experience with CIPP as a tool for aiding  retention of servicemembers by providing career flexibility, we reviewed  the Navy\u2019s efforts to implement the program from 2009 to the present. We  reviewed Navy policy and procedures for implementing CIPP as well as  reports provided to Congress on the implementation and participation of  Navy personnel in the program, along with preliminary data on the  program\u2019s effect on retention. In addition, we interviewed Navy  headquarters officials and officials responsible for implementing CIPP in  four of the Navy\u2019s servicemember communities\u2014Surface Warfare Officer,  Aviation Officer, Submarine Officer, and Enlisted personnel. To  understand the extent to which CIPP has provided flexibility in the  personal and professional needs of servicemembers, we collected non- generalizable data through an email questionnaire sent to 33 Navy CIPP  participants who had completed sabbaticals as of June 2015.

In addition, DOD provides  participants and their dependents with a paid relocation within the  United States. For example, if servicemembers are taking a sabbatical  to attend school, DOD will pay for them to move to the location of their  educational program. At the end of the servicemember\u2019s sabbatical,  DOD will pay the costs to relocate the servicemember to his or her  next assignment.", "The NDAA for fiscal year 2015 kept these NDAA fiscal year 2009  guidelines and extended the program, allowing for servicemembers to  start sabbaticals through December 31, 2019, returning to active duty no  later than December 31, 2022.

However, the Army and Marine Corps were below  authorized limits, with 9 servicemembers approved from the Army and 2  from the Marine Corps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service Officials Have Identified Factors That May Affect Participation", "paragraphs": ["Service officials identified four factors that may affect participation in  CIPP\u2014statutory requirements, service-specific limitations, military culture,  and financial constraints.", "Statutory Requirements\u2014According to the CIPP authorizing statute,  servicemembers are not eligible to participate in the program during  the period of their initial active duty service agreement or if they are  currently receiving a critical skills retention bonus. These eligibility  criteria reduce the population eligible to apply for CIPP. For example,  according to Navy officials, as of July 2015, almost 134,000 Navy  servicemembers were ineligible to participate in CIPP because they  were in their initial active duty service agreement period. According to  a DOD budget analysis document, the initial service agreement for a  Navy sailor typically occurs from 18 to 33 years of age, when  professional goals compete most strongly with personal goals such as  family planning. For example, one participant who responded to our  questionnaire stated that she used CIPP after completing her initial  service obligation to start her family. However, she would have  preferred to take a sabbatical during her initial service obligation  period when she was younger.", "According to a DOD budget analysis document, for the Navy,  retention at a servicemember\u2019s first career reenlistment point is the  most difficult to achieve. However, if servicemembers elected to  participate in CIPP during their first service obligation period, they in  effect would be electing retention during this critical timeframe.  According to Navy officials, if these servicemembers were able to  participate in CIPP, the CIPP-obligated service requirement would  extend each servicemember\u2019s existing period of obligated service,  which could enhance retention.", "Another statutory requirement caps the annual number of participants  at 40 (20 officers and 20 enlisted) servicemembers per service. An  Army official and some Navy officials were of the opinion that the  limitations on the number of participants may reduce participation,  stating that servicemembers may be hesitant to apply since so few  people were selected annually. Proposed language in the fiscal year  2016 NDAA, if enacted, would repeal the prohibition on participation in  CIPP by servicemembers who are in their initial obligated service  period or who are receiving a critical military skills retention bonus,  and it would eliminate program participation caps.", "Service-specific limitations\u2014Each military service has established  selection processes and eligibility requirements that supplement the  statutory requirements established by the NDAA for fiscal year 2009.  For example, the Air Force rates applicants in various categories\u2014 such as job performance, leadership, experience, job responsibility,  and education. As a result, according to Air Force officials, the most  competitive applicants were prioritized for participation in CIPP, and  less competitive applicants were disapproved for participation in the  program. Further, service-specific guidance includes limitations on  participation by servicemembers in certain career fields, such as Army  medical personnel and some officers in the Navy Chaplain Corps and  Judge Advocate General\u2019s (JAG) Corps, as well as certain enlisted  nuclear personnel. According to Navy and Air Force officials,  additional career fields that require sustained proficiency (such as  operating weapons systems or piloting aircraft), while not restricted  from participation in CIPP, may have restrictions on breaks in service.  For example, Navy officials stated that officers in the submarine  community must receive a waiver to go longer than 3 years without a  sea tour, and if officers exceed 5 years without a sea tour they can no  longer work in the submarine community\u2014this could occur if an officer  took a 3-year sabbatical followed by a 3-year shore tour. According to  Navy officials, if individuals in these communities participate in CIPP,  measures are taken to ensure that they do not exceed timeframes  that would result in the loss of their ability to serve in their community.  Additionally, Navy and Air Force officials stated that pilots who do not  have a minimum number of flight hours within a certain time period  are no longer certified to operate their aircraft, and are required to  complete additional training to be recertified. A Navy official stated  that pilots are not disqualified from their position; however, additional  training further extends the officer\u2019s time out of operational service,  which may affect the officer\u2019s promotion potential.", "Military culture\u2014Officials from each service also stated that  participation may be influenced by military culture, and that  servicemembers have the perception that a break in service may have  a negative effect on upward advancement. Specifically, officials from  all the services stated that servicemembers may not trust assurances  as to how a break in service would be viewed by promotion boards.  For example, one participant was concerned that \u201ca break in service  would be viewed as taking an off-ramp, an easy path, taking   out of the fast lane,\u201d but upon returning from sabbatical has been  reassured by knowledge of other participants who have returned from  their sabbaticals and received promotions. Another participant  reported being \u201ctold explicitly by my chain of command [before  entering the program] that my career would suffer\u201d; and another  reported that upon returning from sabbatical the servicemember  would \u201cmeet people, sadly even some senior leaders, who are not  familiar with the program and assume I have decided to prioritize  family over career or assume I do not want to  competitive for  advancement.\u201d CIPP authorizing language includes provisions  designed to mitigate any potential negative effect of a sabbatical on  career advancement, but according to Army and Navy officials, until  more CIPP participants return from sabbaticals and demonstrate  career advancement, servicemembers may be hesitant to participate.", "Financial constraints\u2014The salary that servicemembers receive  during the sabbatical period is equivalent to approximately 2 days of  pay per month. Additionally, according to DOD policy, service  members may not receive special or incentive pay or bonus payments  while on sabbatical. Officials from the Army and the Navy stated that  participation in CIPP likely will remain limited because  servicemembers need financial resources to support themselves and  their families during the sabbatical. One of the CIPP participants who  responded to our questionnaire emphasized the need to have another  source of income while participating. Another participant reported the  opinion that CIPP \u201cgives a  options that are not  available in any other program. However, the deal is not that great for  the member\u2014mainly because of the monetary hit. Since a member is  coming back, I think it is possible to allow a person to receive some  pay while participating in CIPP.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Established a Plan for Evaluating Whether CIPP Is an Effective Means to Retain Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["In February 2009, OUSD(P&R) issued a directive-type memorandum that  authorized\u2014but did not require\u2014the Secretary of each military  department to implement CIPP.

Specifically, the memorandum stated that the  services should \u201chave the appropriate oversight, analytical rigor, and  proper evaluation methodologies\u201d to evaluate the pilot. In September  2015, OUSD(P&R) reissued the memorandum and, among other things,  included a requirement for each service to report to OUSD(P&R) annually  on the status and effectiveness of the program. This report is to include  information on the demographics of CIPP applicants, criteria used for  selecting applicants, an assessment of the effectiveness of the program,  and recommendations for legislative or administrative actions for the  modification or continuation of the CIPP.

Additionally, DOD officials stated that CIPP  should be made available permanently; however, without an evaluation of  the program, the basis for DOD\u2019s proposed changes to the program is  unclear.", "We have identified key features that should be included in pilot program  evaluation plans, and along with private professional auditing and  evaluation organizations, we have found that a well-developed and  documented evaluation plan can help ensure that agency evaluations  generate performance information needed to make effective program and  policy decisions. Well-developed evaluation plans include key features  such as: well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;  criteria or standards for determining pilot-program performance; clearly articulated methodology, including sound sampling methods,  determination of appropriate sample size for the evaluation design,  and a strategy for comparing the pilot results with other efforts; a clear plan that details the type and source of data necessary to  evaluate the pilot, methods for data collection, and the timing and  frequency of data collection; and a detailed data-analysis plan to track the program\u2019s performance and  evaluate the final results of the project.", "Although the services are required to evaluate the effectiveness of CIPP,  currently they do not have any plans for evaluating the program.

Prior to the establishment of  the June 2016 OUSD(P&R) reporting requirement, officials from all four  services raised concerns about their ability to evaluate the effectiveness  of the program so soon after implementation. Specifically, Marine Corps  and Army officials stated that it is too early to determine the program\u2019s  effect on retention, and that it can take several years after a participant  starts a sabbatical to determine whether the program contributed to  retention. Marine Corps officials stated that if a participant took the  maximum 3-year sabbatical followed by a 6-year obligated service period,  it could take up to 9 years to determine whether the individual would  decide to stay in the armed services beyond his or her period of obligated  service. As of July 2015, of the 133 program participants, 5 have  completed the obligated service period. Putting plans in place for how the  pilot will be evaluated can guide the services on the data they need to  collect as the pilot progresses, and can better position them to assess the  pilot\u2019s performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Navy Officials Stated That CIPP Has Provided an Option to Respond to Personal Needs of Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["According to Navy officials, CIPP has provided an option for the Navy to  respond to the personal needs of servicemembers, and they believe the  program has helped to retain servicemembers who otherwise might have  left the military. Additionally, a DOD budget analysis document states that  the Navy will retain a servicemember for a longer time period by using a  combination of monetary and non-monetary incentives than would have  been possible using only a single incentive. According to this document,  in the Navy\u2019s experience, financial incentives alone have not been  adequate to retain certain categories of servicemembers, such as  nuclear-trained surface warfare officers and senior nuclear-trained  enlisted sailors serving on submarines and aircraft carriers. Navy CIPP  participants have come from a range of career fields, including aviators,  engineers, medical personnel, nuclear-trained surface warfare officers,  and others.", "Navy officials stated that they are not using CIPP to address any specific  critical skills, but that a servicemember\u2019s occupation is given  consideration during the CIPP approval process.

For example,  according to a Navy CIPP document, a Petty Officer Second Class was  identified by the JAG Corps as a servicemember who displayed the  aptitude, work ethic, and talent needed to serve as an attorney. This  individual was encouraged to take a sabbatical to complete her degree,  earn a Juris Doctorate, and apply for a commission in the JAG Corps  upon return from the sabbatical. After a 36-month sabbatical this  servicemember earned a commission in the JAG Corps and became an  attorney in the Navy.", "In addition, officials stated that a career sabbatical may help to address  the work-life balance that cannot be achieved through other human- capital programs. For example, one participant who responded to our  questionnaire reported: \u201c believe  provides a suitable option for  work/life balance that helps offset goals/issues that cannot be addressed  while on active duty and gives sailors an option besides getting out  entirely.\u201d In particular, officials stated that they are concerned that the  Navy\u2019s recurring sea-tour requirement may result in the loss of  servicemembers with short-term personal needs or skill sets that are in  demand in the private sector. For example, another respondent reported:  \u201c is a great option for sailors who need to take a break from the  arduous duty and demands of the Navy. Additionally, it can give sailors  who are thinking about leaving the Navy the experience of what it is like  to be in the civilian sector.\u201d", "The Navy collects information from participants, both when they start their  sabbatical and when they return, about the extent to which CIPP was a  factor in the participants\u2019 choice to stay in the Navy; whether participants  intend to make the Navy their career; whether participants would  recommend CIPP to other servicemembers\u2019 and whether CIPP has  negatively affected their career. Also, a Navy CIPP document provided  examples of participants who fared well with their career milestones  following their return to active duty. For example, according to CIPP  program managers, one officer was selected for promotion following  sabbatical, and two other officers were selected for administrative  screening boards upon their return. Our questionnaire asked CIPP  participants if since returning to active duty, they have been told or  otherwise experienced something specific that indicated CIPP  participation might affect their career advancement. The responses were  mixed. We received examples expressing the view that use of a  sabbatical for educational purposes was positive because the education  received while on sabbatical was beneficial for career advancement.
