However, these metrics do not provide decision makers with a complete representation of performance across the entire global distribution pipeline. DOD's definitions of its metrics and guidance for using them do not address cost, although DOD officials stated that cost is included in metrics used to assess other aspects of the supply chain, and the Marine Corps has not established a customer wait time metric. Further, although joint doctrine has set efficient and effective distribution \u201cfrom the factory to the foxhole\u201d as a priority, these metrics do not always include performance for the final destination. Unless DOD's guidance is revised to ensure the three distribution performance metrics include cost information for decision making and the Marine Corps establishes a customer wait time metric, and DOD incorporates metric performance to the final destination, it will be difficult for DOD to achieve a comprehensive view of the performance of its entire global distribution pipeline.", "DOD may not have sufficiently reliable data to accurately determine the extent to which it has met the standards it has established for distribution performance, because it has not developed policy for requiring regular comprehensive assessments to be conducted of its distribution data-collection and reporting processes. Several DOD organizations indicated that they had not conducted this type of review that would be consistent with standards for internal control in the federal government. Specifically, the Air Force indicated that it had not conducted a risk assessment of its data, a part of assessing data reliability. Officials GAO spoke with from U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), the services, and other DOD components described a number of potential inaccuracies, such as delivery dates recorded after deliveries were actually made, in the data TRANSCOM uses to evaluate distribution performance. Without a policy requiring regular comprehensive data-reliability assessments, DOD lacks reasonable assurance that organizations will conduct such assessments and that data will be sufficiently reliable to effectively measure DOD's performance in distribution.", "Although DOD has taken several actions to address gaps in its distribution performance, including conducting performance reviews, and holding workshops to assess problems and develop solutions, these efforts focus on specific areas of distribution, and DOD has not developed a comprehensive corrective action plan for the entire distribution pipeline that identifies the scope and root causes of capability gaps and other problems, solutions, and actions to be taken. In July 2011, GAO recommended DOD develop such a corrective action plan. DOD did not concur, citing several ongoing efforts.

Furthermore, DOD policy requires that all organizations in the supply  chain recognize and emphasize the importance of time in accomplishing  their respective functions. Accordingly, each of the three DOD metrics  measures time expressed in days. All three performance metrics begin  with the submission of a customer order and end with the receipt of the  ordered materiel by the support supply activity that ordered it. For  example, logistics response time measures the entire processing time of  the customer order through each of the 12 subsegments in the  distribution system, from the date the order is submitted to the date the  customer posts the materiel received to the record of inventory at the  supply support activity. Logistics response time is the broadest of the  three metrics, and DOD has identified it as a key performance measure to  monitor the effectiveness of the supply chain. In contrast, customer wait  time measures the processing time for a subset of customer orders\u2014 specifically, customer orders from organizational maintenance units. If  an organizational maintenance unit\u2019s order cannot be fulfilled by the local  retail supply system, the unit will then place a new request with the  wholesale supply system. Similar to logistics response time, customer  wait time measures the total elapsed time between the submission and  the receipt of an order. Time-definite delivery measures the entire  processing time of an order and determines whether the distribution  system is capable of delivering an order to the customer within a given  period.", "In general, we found that each of the three metrics is used to assess  performance in terms of time, such as the maximum number of days to  complete an order (customer wait time) or the likelihood that a delivery  will be received within that number of days (time-definite delivery). DOD  does not measure against a standard for logistics response time as,  according to DOD, decision makers examine the data on logistics  response time to determine whether the average number of days it takes  to process orders is increasing or decreasing. DOD has established  customer wait time standards for the Air Force, Army, and Navy (see  table 2); however, the Marine Corps has not established a service-wide  customer wait time standard, as discussed later in the report.", "Standards for time-definite delivery vary according to the mode of  transportation used to deliver the shipments and the geographic  destination.

Similarly, DOD  publicly reports the performance of the services against their customer  wait time standards on an annual basis. DOD could help ensure cost is  considered as part of its overall evaluation of distribution performance if it  were able to identify and report the corresponding costs for distribution for  the preceding period when reviewing time-definitely delivery compliance  or when reporting customer wait time performance.

These controls call for comparisons and assessments relating different  sets of data to one another and state that a variety of control activities can  be used in information processing, including edit checks of data.  Moreover, internal control activities need to be clearly documented, and  the documentation should be readily available for examination. Further,  controls should be aimed at validating the propriety and integrity of  performance measures.", "The questionnaires consisted of 24 questions regarding the timeliness, completeness,  and accuracy of the data used by TRANSCOM and the military services to measure  DOD\u2019s performance against established time-definite delivery and customer wait time  standards. responding to our data-reliability questionnaire, indicated that it had not  conducted a risk assessment of its data. Questionnaire responses to the  same questions from the Navy indicated that it had conducted a risk  assessment, but the Army did not answer whether it had conducted a risk  assessment of its data.", "In our past work, we identified several issues that indicate DOD\u2019s  distribution data may not be sufficiently reliable for measuring  performance against its standards. For example, in our 2011 report on  materiel distribution in Afghanistan, with some deliveries into Afghanistan that had missing delivery dates,  which limited the usefulness of DOD\u2019s distribution metrics. Specifically,  we found that 42 percent of unit surface shipments and 19 percent of  sustainment surface shipments with required delivery dates in 2008  through 2010 did not have a documented delivery date in the database.  DOD concurred with our recommendation to develop an ongoing,  systematic approach to identify the reasons why delivery dates for  delivered surface shipments are not documented and implement  corrective actions to improve the documentation of delivered surface  shipments, and to develop an ongoing, systematic approach to  investigate cases of undelivered surface shipments to determine their  status and update the database with the most-current information.  However, DOD did not provide any details as to how and when it would  implement our recommendation, and based on the results of our current  data-reliability questionnaires, it is not clear whether DOD has addressed  these prior issues.", "GAO-12-138.", "DOD. For example, in questionnaire responses provided to us by the  Army, officials stated that there are no controls separate from their data  collection system to ensure accuracy and that errors sometimes occur,  such as data indicating negative customer wait times (times of less than 0  days). The Navy and Air Force responded that they did have controls  separate from their data-collection systems.", "In addition, officials we spoke with from TRANSCOM, the services, and  several other DOD components told us of a number of potential  inaccuracies in the data TRANSCOM uses to evaluate distribution  performance. DOD officials said that in some cases units in combat zones  delay entering records of new deliveries because personnel responsible  for this task have other, higher-priority duties. Specifically, on forward  operating bases, DOD officials stated that the priority was to complete the  mission rather than completing paperwork as soon as a delivery is made.  In these cases, the delivery data may be inaccurate because the  recorded delivery date may be after the actual delivery was made.  However, DOD officials said that delays in logging deliveries also occur in  noncombat areas. Sometimes the logging of deliveries is delayed  because the personnel responsible for this task are not present at the  time of the deliveries. For example, an employee who teleworks or takes  leave on a Friday may not log a delivery made on that Friday until the  following Monday. As a result, the recording of the delivery date is  delayed by 3 days. Such a delay would have the effect of adding 3 days  to the logistics response time and time-definite delivery times recorded for  that delivery. Additionally, DOD officials stated that some DOD personnel  responsible for logging deliveries wait until several deliveries have been  received and log them all at once rather than as they arrive. For example,  DOD officials stated that some may set aside a time every week to log  deliveries for that week, so that deliveries from earlier in the week are  logged later than they actually were received. Setting aside time every  week is a reasonable approach; however, in doing so, it is important that  the actual date of delivery be captured and collected to ensure accuracy  of the data to aid in assessing the performance of the delivery system.", "Moreover, we identified several concerns with regard to the data used to  measure customer wait time. For example, in 2007, the DOD Inspector  General reported that DOD officials lacked uniform results for measuring  customer wait times because of differences in how the services measured  and reported data. As previously mentioned, in the questionnaire  responses provided to us by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, each service  lacked at least some of the documentation that would be needed to  provide assurance that internal controls were met. Notably, none of the  services indicated, as a part of assessing data reliability, that they had  documentation to support that they had conducted tests or evaluations of  their data systems to collect and report customer wait time.", "Because DOD does not conduct and document regular comprehensive  data-reliability assessments, the extent to which these or other data  issues might affect the reliability of DOD distribution performance data is  uncertain. Further, without data reliability assessments, it will be difficult  for DOD to fully identify and correct any data gaps by taking appropriate  actions to ensure that data supporting its distribution performance metrics  are sufficiently reliable. In questionnaire responses, TRANSCOM stated  that it relies on the systems that feed data to TRANSCOM to have its own  data-quality processes in place. Therefore, TRANSCOM officials told us  that one reason they do not assess the reliability of distribution data is  that they have no authority to evaluate and address issues with respect to  the military services\u2019 systems and processes. DOD officials also  acknowledged this lack of authority, but stated that the Office of the  Secretary of Defense did have the necessary authority. However, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense has not developed and enforced any  policies to require data-reliability assessments to be conducted by DOD  organizations involved in the collection and reporting of distribution  performance data.

Specifically, as discussed in the report, logistics response time is  monitored by the DASD SCI and time-definite delivery is monitored by  TRANSCOM. Furthermore, according to the draft Supply Chain Metrics  Guide used to evaluate DLA's Distribution Effectiveness initiative, the two  metrics have different definitions, business values, goals, and  computations. Since these two measures are separate, cost  considerations should be included in both time-definite delivery and  logistics response time.

DOD stated that this standard is published in Marine Corps  Order 4400.16H, Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System.  As of February 2015, the order does not state a set standard but  estimates 15 days as the amount of time for delivery within the  continental United States of an item that a unit requires for immediate use  and without which the unit could not perform its mission.
