These projects adhere to the Board's core strategy of identifying a target audience and tailoring each broadcast product to market circumstances and audience needs. The Board's plan lacks measurable program objectives designed to gauge the success of its new approach to broadcasting, detailed implementation strategies, resource needs, and project time frames. A number of key effectiveness measures could provide a starting point for developing measurable program objectives and related performance goals and indicators under the Board's annual performance plan. These measures include audience size in specific markets, audience awareness, broadcaster credibility, and whether the Voice of America (VOA) effectively presents information about U.S. thought, institutions, and policies to target audiences. The Board has identified a number of market and internal challenges--such as technological innovation and better coordination of its seven separate broadcast entities--that must be addressed to make U.S. international broadcasting more competitive. It has also developed a number of solutions to address these challenges. However, the Board has not addressed how many language services it can carry effectively (with the number rising nearly 20 percent over the past 10 years) and what level of overlap and duplication in VOA and surrogate broadcast services would be appropriate under its new approach to broadcasting.

To fulfill this latter role, the BBG seeks input  from the Department of State and the larger public diplomacy community  in formulating its broadcast plans and making annual decisions on the  deletion and addition of language services. The Secretary of State serves as  a member of the Board, further strengthening coordination efforts. Within  the BBG, VOA, Radio/TV Marti, and WorldNet Television, are organized as  federal entities, while Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free  Asia operate as independent, nonprofit corporations and are funded by  Board grants.

Program reviews are  in-depth assessments of performance conducted by a team of management,  audience research experts, technical staff, and language service staff. The  comparative review of language services represents an intensive 4-month  review by the Board designed to evaluate the need for adding or deleting  language services and strategically reallocating funds to the language  services on the basis of priority and impact. This year, the Board asked  eight language services to prepare individual performance plans that  capture key elements of the Board\u2019s new strategic approach to  broadcasting, including the need to identify a target audience and establish  specific audience goals.

For example, Board members  and senior planners said they encountered significant difficulties  attempting to work with VOA officials to launch Radio Sawa and there are  now plans to constitute Radio Sawa as a separate grantee organization.  While this move is understandable under the circumstances, it also  contributes to the further \u201cbalkanization\u201d of U.S. international  broadcasting.", "The second program objective consists of realigning the BBG\u2019s  organizational structure. This objective highlights the need to reinforce the  Board\u2019s role as CEO and to reaffirm the IBB\u2019s role as central provider of  transmission and local placement services. The plan notes that by law the  Board is the head of the agency with a host of nondelegable responsibilities  including taking the lead role in shaping the BBG\u2019s overall strategic  direction, setting expectations and standards, and creating the context for  innovation and change. As it consolidates its role as the collective CEO for  U.S. international broadcasting, the Board will seek to create better and  stronger linkages among entities, uniting them in a common purpose and  program. At the same time, the Board plans to assume the role of helping  the broadcasting organizations develop radio formats to package and  better present the broadcasters\u2019 content. According to the plan, this  becomes a major responsibility, as professional formatting is vital to the  BBG\u2019s competitiveness and effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Does Not Discuss Several Organizational Options", "paragraphs": ["We found significant support among BBG staff and outside experts we  interviewed and surveyed for a select number of solutions not included in  the Board\u2019s plan.

Trying to do too much at the same time fractures  this focus, extends the span of control beyond management capabilities,  and siphons off precious resources. The Board has determined that current  efforts to support its broadcast languages are \u201cunsustainable\u201d with current  resources given its desire to increase impact in high priority markets.  Currently, the Board broadcasts in 66 languages, through 97 language  services (resulting from a 55 percent overlap between VOA and surrogate  language services) to more than 125 markets worldwide. The plan notes, \u201cit  is a daunting challenge to obtain the impact the Board desires across all its  language services given what is essential to spend in high priority services.\u201d", "Despite this recognition, the plan fails to answer such questions as, when is  it appropriate to broadcast VOA and surrogate programming in the same  language, and what level of duplication in roles and target audiences  should be allowed between VOA and surrogate broadcasters. These types  of questions have been raised before. For example, in our September 1996  review of options for addressing possible budget reductions at the U.S.  Information Agency, we concluded that any substantial reduction in  funding for U.S. international broadcasting would require major changes in  the number of language services and broadcast hours. Our report noted  that the BBG planned to extensively review its language services to  determine their continued need and effectiveness. Our September 2000  report on U.S. international broadcasting noted that the Board concluded it  was essential to revisit the issue of broadcast overlap between VOA and the  surrogate services in light of evolving foreign policy, geopolitical, and  budget realities in the new century. Finally, the Board considered the  issue of role and target audience duplication among VOA and surrogate  broadcasts in a July 2000 language service analysis, which sought to  identify where broadcast services shared similar roles (that is, to supply  international/regional news, local news, information on American policies  and perspectives, etc.) and the same target audiences (that is, elites, mass,  youth, women, and diaspora). This analysis confirmed that surrogate  broadcasters, consistent with their mission, carry substantially more local  content than VOA. Likewise, the analysis confirmed that VOA alone  provides news and information on what the Board labeled the \u201cAmerican  political perspective.\u201d However, the Board\u2019s analysis also revealed that a  significant degree of overlap existed in other content areas (such as  \u201cpolitical/democracy building\u201d) and in target audiences between VOA and  the surrogates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing the Number of Language Services and Broadcast Overlap Has Broad Support", "paragraphs": ["Our survey of senior program managers revealed that the majority  supported significantly reducing the total number of language services and  the overlap in services between VOA and the surrogate broadcasters.  Eighteen of 24 respondents said that too many language services are  offered, and when asked how many countries should have more than one  U.S. international broadcaster providing service in the same language, 23 of  28 respondents said this should occur in only a few countries or no  countries at all. Finally, when we asked respondents what impact a  significant reduction in language services (for the purpose of  reprogramming funds to higher priority services) would have, 18 of 28  respondents said that this would have a generally positive to highly positive  impact.", "The BBG\u2019s annual language service review process addresses the need to  delete or add languages. The process prioritizes individual language  services based on such factors as U.S. strategic interests, political freedom,  and press freedom data. Such assessments have been used in an attempt to  shift the focus of U.S. international broadcasting away from central and  eastern Europe to allow greater emphasis on Russia and Eurasia; central  and South Asia; China and east Asia; Africa; and selected countries in our  hemisphere such as Colombia, Cuba, and Haiti. This system has been used  to re-deploy resources within the BBG. For example, the Board has  reallocated more than $9 million through the elimination or reduction of  language services since its first language service review in January 2000. In  total, the Board has eliminated 3 language services and reduced the scope-of-operations of another 25 services since January 2000. In terms of  the total number of language services, the Board had 91 language services  when it concluded its first language service review and 97 language  services at the conclusion of this year\u2019s review.   Congress has contributed  to this situation by authorizing additional language services over the years.

Early initiatives such as Radio Sawa, Radio Free Afghanistan,  and Radio Farda represent the first wave of projects incorporating, to  varying degrees, the market-driven techniques on which the Board\u2019s new  approach to broadcasting are based. Effective implementation of the  Board\u2019s new approach to broadcasting rests, in part, on a rigorous plan that  reflects the Board\u2019s best strategic thinking on a host of critical issues.  However, the Board\u2019s plan lacks measurable program objectives, detailed  implementation strategies, resource needs, and project time frames. We  identified a number of key areas that could provide a starting point for  developing multiyear program objectives that focus on the Board\u2019s actual  effectiveness. These measures include audience size by language service,  audience awareness, broadcaster credibility, and whether VOA effectively  presents information about U.S. thought, institutions, and policies to target  audiences. Implementation of these and other program objectives could be  tracked through a related set of performance goals and indicators in the  Board\u2019s annual performance plan. The Board has identified a number of  market and internal challenges and proposed solutions to address them. If  the Board falters in its efforts to correct some significant organizational  challenges, a number of alternative solutions do exist. Finally, the Board  needs to evaluate how many language services it can effectively carry and  what level of overlap and duplication in VOA and surrogate broadcast  services is appropriate.
