The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is transitioning claims administration to 19 new entities known as Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) and plans to complete the process ahead of October 1, 2011, the date required by law. In 2005, GAO reported that CMS's plan to accelerate the transition could create challenges and was based on estimated costs and savings that were uncertain. In this report GAO examined (1) how CMS has implemented Medicare contracting reform; (2) how CMS assessed the performance of the MACs and what the results of its assessments have been; and (3) what CMS's costs and savings have been for Medicare contracting reform. GAO selected a sample of 6 transitions to review from among the 10 MAC contracts awarded as of June 2008, based on factors such as geographic diversity, volume of claims workload, and transition complexity. GAO analyzed CMS documents related to the MAC transitions, including performance assessments for 3 of the 6 MACs in the sample that had results available for three types of reviews as of March 2009, and interviewed CMS officials, contractors, and provider groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS took numerous steps to facilitate the complex implementation of Medicare contracting reform, but certain decisions led to challenges during the six MAC transitions we reviewed, such as payment delays to providers. For example, CMS's accelerated implementation schedule overlapped with other Medicare initiatives that affected claims processing, such as requiring that providers re-enroll in order to be paid, which resulted in claims payment delays. In addition, despite regular workload monitoring of the former contractors during the MAC transitions, CMS gave the MACs inaccurate workload estimates. For example, one MAC originally planned on receiving 15,000 appeals cases but actually inherited 46,500 cases, which led to processing backlogs and delayed payments to providers. However, CMS also incorporated lessons learned and made midcourse adjustments to address some of these challenges. CMS has assessed the MACs using a program it developed, and in the reviews we examined the MACs did not meet all standards and metrics. CMS's assessment program includes an initial review of each MAC's internal controls and two subsequent reviews to assess performance. One of these reviews compares a MAC's performance to standards in accordance with its contract and the other provides an incentive award fee if the MAC meets selected metrics that are designed to reflect high performance. Results available as of March 2009 from the assessments of three of the six MACs in GAO's sample show that the three MACs improved their performance over time but did not meet all metrics. For example, while the three MACs consistently met or partially met a metric that assesses contract management, they did not meet some beneficiary and provider service metrics. In addition, because they did not meet all incentive metrics, they did not receive full award fees. CMS's total costs and savings to date for Medicare contracting reform are uncertain because CMS does not track and provide information on all related costs and savings. The agency provided information on costs associated with contracts, which totaled a little over $300 million for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. It also provided information on some internal agency costs for conducting contracting reform, but did not track others, such as agency staff salaries. Although CMS expected contracting reform to generate substantial savings from reduced spending on administrative functions and savings to the Medicare trust funds due to improved claims review to detect payments that should not be made, as of April 2009, CMS was unable to provide information on total savings. CMSprovided some information on savings due to reductions in operational spending, but the extent to which these savings were attributable to contracting reform is uncertain. CMS did not track or provide information on savings to the Medicare trust funds due to reduced improper payments related to contracting reform activities. CMS reviewed a draft of this report and generally agreed with GAO's findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the enactment of Medicare in 1965, claims administration  contractors have played a vital role in the program. The program was  designed so that the federal government could contract with health  insurers or similar companies experienced in handling physician and  hospital claims to pay Medicare claims. These Medicare claims  administration contractors process and pay claims, handle the first-level  appeals of denied claims, and serve as providers\u2019 primary contact with  Medicare. In addition, they answer complex inquiries from beneficiaries  related to Medicare claims-processing or coverage rules. In fiscal year  2008, these contractors processed almost 1.2 billion fee-for-service claims  and issued about $310 billion in payments for Medicare health services.", "Medicare claims administration contracting prior to 2003 had unique  features in statute that differed from most other federal contracting.  Before 2003, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that  administers the Medicare program\u2014awarded Medicare claims  administration contracts to entities now referred to as legacy contractors  that were not selected through a competitive process. The agency\u2019s  authority to terminate these contracts also was limited. Beginning in the  1980s, HHS asked Congress for changes in authority regarding the  selection of claims administration contractors. HHS cited several reasons  for such reform, including providing the agency with greater flexibility to  administer the program, promoting competition, improving services to  beneficiaries and providers, achieving cost savings, and increasing CMS\u2019s  ability to reward Medicare contractors that performed well.", "In 2003, Congress included such reform in the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Specifically, the  MMA repealed limitations on the types of contractors CMS could use and  required CMS to use competitive procedures to select new contracting  entities to process medical claims, provide incentives for them to provide  quality service, develop performance standards including standards for  customer satisfaction, and comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), except where inconsistent with specific MMA provisions. The  MMA also required CMS to complete implementation of the reform by  October 2011 and to recompete the contracts at least once every 5 years.  Additionally, the MMA required the Secretary of HHS to submit an  implementation plan report on contracting reform to Congress in 2004 and  an interim report on the reform\u2019s progress in October 2008.", "CMS is in the process of implementing MMA contracting reform  requirements by transferring all claims administration tasks from the 51  legacy contractors to 19 new entities known as Medicare Administrative  Contractors (MAC). Specifically, 15 MACs will process both Part A and  Part B Medicare claims (A/B MAC), and 4 MACs will process durable  medical equipment (DME) claims (DME MAC). (Apps. I and II provide  maps of the MAC contract regions, known as jurisdictions.) The agency  chose to implement the MAC transition in three cycles: the Start-Up Cycle,  including all 4 DME MACs and 1 A/B MAC, and Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, each  consisting of 7 A/B MACs. As of September 2009, CMS had fully  implemented 9 A/B MACs and 4 DME MACs. The contracts for the  remaining 6 A/B MACs were awarded, but the awards were protested.  CMS is taking corrective actions on these remaining awards.", "CMS initially anticipated that it could complete the claims administration  transfer from legacy contractors to MACs by July 2009, before the   October 1, 2011, MMA deadline. In August 2005, we highlighted CMS\u2019s  accelerated timeline as a concern because it did not leave time for  adjustments to be made for unforeseen obstacles, such as bid protests by  unsuccessful offerers, which generally halt implementation until they are  resolved. In that report, we indicated that the accelerated implementation  schedule and other risks such as the volume and complexity of anticipated  claims-processing workload transitions, and the potential for contractor  withdrawals, had the potential to disrupt claims administration services,  possibly resulting in delayed or improper payments to providers.  Although CMS did not agree with our 2005 recommendation to extend its  MAC implementation schedule to allow more time for planning and  midcourse adjustments, the agency did acknowledge it needed to develop  certain critical areas in its plan to help it manage the transition. In our  2005 report, we also questioned the likelihood of CMS\u2019s achieving the  predicted cost savings that it had used as one rationale for the accelerated  timeline.", "You asked us to evaluate and report on Medicare contracting reform  efforts. We examined (1) how CMS has implemented Medicare contracting  reform, (2) how CMS assessed the performance of the MACs and what the  results of its assessments have been, and (3) what CMS\u2019s costs and savings  have been for Medicare contracting reform.", "To determine how CMS has implemented Medicare contracting reform,  and specifically how it has implemented the MAC program, we examined  CMS and MAC documents and conducted interviews with CMS officials. In  particular, we selected 6 MAC jurisdictions from among the 10 where a  final contract award had been made by June 2008, analyzed documents  from the implementation of the MMA provisions in each jurisdiction, and  interviewed CMS staff responsible for coordinating MAC contract awards  and transition from legacy contractors to the MACs. Our sample was  designed to ensure diversity in geographic region, claims workload,  complexity of transition, bid protest experience, and CMS\u2019s assessment of  a jurisdiction\u2019s risk for fraud. In addition, for the 6 jurisdictions we  selected, we interviewed incoming MACs and certain legacy contractors.  We also interviewed health care provider associations located in the  jurisdictions covered by 2 of the 6 MACs to understand how CMS  implemented Medicare contracting reform. Finally, we analyzed  documents and conducted interviews to understand what lessons CMS  may have learned that may help inform future award cycles.", "To determine how CMS has assessed the performance of the MACs and to  determine the results of its assessments, we reviewed sections of the FAR  related to performance-based contracting and cost-plus-award-fee  contracts, the type of contract CMS is using for the MACs. We also  analyzed CMS documents to understand the agency\u2019s performance  assessment process for the MACs. In addition, we interviewed officials in  CMS\u2019s Medicare Contractor Management Group responsible for MACs and  legacy contractor oversight to understand the agency\u2019s performance  assessment framework and activities. To report on CMS\u2019s assessments of  the MACs, we analyzed performance results for the three MACs in our  sample that had completed all components of their performance  assessment reviews by March 2009.", "To determine what CMS\u2019s costs and savings have been for Medicare  contracting reform, we reviewed and analyzed relevant documents,  including CMS\u2019s budget and estimates of potential costs and savings. We  also interviewed CMS officials responsible for development and oversight  of contracting reform budgets and estimates of potential costs and savings  to understand CMS\u2019s process for tracking and reporting the financial  status of contracting reform.

Congress limited the type of  contractors CMS could use for claims administration activities when  Medicare was enacted in 1965, in part because providers were concerned  that the program would give the government too much control over health  care. To increase providers\u2019 acceptance of the new program and to  assuage their concerns, Congress required that health insurers that already  served as payers of health care services to physicians and hospitals  become the Medicare claims administration contractors. Specifically, prior  to 2003, CMS was required by law to select the first type of claims  administration contractor, fiscal intermediaries\u2014contractors that paid  Part A and Part B claims for institutions such as hospitals\u2014from among  companies that were nominated by health care provider associations.  Medicare law further required CMS to select the other type of contractor,  carriers\u2014contractors that paid the majority of Part B claims, such as for  services provided by physicians and other providers\u2014from among health  insurers or similar companies.", "During this period, Medicare claims administration contracts were  typically renewed every year, and CMS could not terminate the contracts  unless the contractors were first provided with an opportunity for a public  hearing. The contractors themselves could terminate their contracts and  have their termination costs reimbursed by CMS irrespective of which  party terminated the contract. In addition, the claims administration  contractors were paid on the basis of their allowable costs, generally  without financial incentives to encourage superior performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Contracting following Enactment of MMA", "paragraphs": ["The MMA requirement that CMS follow competitive procedures and the  FAR in awarding contracts to MACs\u2014except where MMA provisions  explicitly differed\u2014introduced key differences in how the agency would  have to conduct its MAC contracting compared to how it had conducted  its legacy contracting prior to 2003. Notably, under the FAR,  agencies are generally required to conduct full and open competition  for contracts and are permitted to contract with any qualified entity for  any authorized purpose, with some exceptions;  agencies are permitted to terminate contracts either for the  government\u2019s convenience or if they determine that the contractor is in  default; and  agencies are permitted to include financial incentives to contractors  for meeting or exceeding performance goals.", "The MMA provided more specificity on certain aspects of CMS\u2019s Medicare  claims administration contracting processes. For example, CMS is to  conduct a competition for MACs at least every 5 years,    develop performance requirements and measurement standards for  set forth the performance requirements in the MAC contracts,  ensure the performance requirements and standards are used to  evaluate MAC performance and are consistent with the MACs\u2019  statement of work (SOW), and    develop a measurement standard for provider and beneficiary  satisfaction.", "CMS selected a contract type for the MACs that allows it to provide  incentives tied to service and efficiency of operations. CMS opted to  establish MAC contracts as cost-plus-award-fee contracts, a type of cost- reimbursement contract that allows an agency to provide financial  incentives to contractors if they achieve performance goals. A MAC may  earn an incentive, known as an award fee, based on performance, in  addition to reimbursement for allowable costs and a base fee for the  contract, which is fixed at the inception of the contract.", "The FAR provides additional guidance for performance-based contracts.  If such a contract is used, the FAR requires that the agency establish  methods that enable it to assess work performance against measurable  performance standards. In addition, the FAR requires that the agency  conduct performance evaluations and inform contractors about their  performance and the areas in which improvement is expected.

In the legacy contracting environment,  different contractors handled Part A and Part B claims in the majority of  states, and multiple contractors were responsible for regions in which they  processed claims across several\u2014sometimes noncontiguous\u2014states. In  its 2005 report to Congress, CMS called the varying legacy contractors that  processed Part A and Part B claims \u201ca patchwork of responsibility and  service,\u201d a problem it hoped to solve with consolidation. Whereas in the  legacy environment, a single state might have been served by multiple  contractors handling Part A and B claims in their separate regions, in the  MAC environment, CMS established MAC jurisdictions, which were based  on contiguous state boundaries, such that a single A/B MAC handled all  Part A and B claims\u2014other than DME claims\u2014in its jurisdiction.

CMS also assigned responsibility to the MACs for  consolidating computerized claims edits (used during processing to  determine whether to accept, adjust, or reject a claim) that may have  differed among the multiple legacy contractors into one consistent set of  edits for each newly consolidated MAC jurisdiction.

Medicare contracting reform represents  the largest transition of claims administration workload since the  inception of the Medicare program and was more complex than smaller- scale transitions CMS conducted in the past with legacy contractors.  These earlier transitions were often \u201cturnkey\u201d operations, with incoming  contractors retaining outgoing contractors\u2019 staff and equipment.  Furthermore, past transitions did not involve the transfer of as many  Medicare Part A and B claims or the significant reconfiguration of the  associated functional contractors and jurisdictions.", "This was also the first time that CMS awarded claims administration  contracts under requirements for full and open competition. The agency  faced the challenge of selecting contractors able to carry out complex  activities critical to Medicare administration using procedures consistent  with the FAR. In doing so, the agency decided to emphasize past  experience and past performance with similar work of organizations that  sought to become MACs. For the initial competition for 19 MAC  contracts, only three of the organizations seeking contracts lacked  Medicare experience. All awards as of September 2009 were made to  organizations with previous Medicare experience.", "Recognizing its challenge to manage the complex transitions, CMS took  steps to facilitate implementation activities in a number of areas, including  developing an integrated implementation schedule, developing training,  hiring support staff, documenting lessons learned, and making midcourse  adjustments. In particular:  CMS established a \u201ccross-component\u201d team to facilitate  communication across the agency and developed an integrated  implementation schedule. CMS reported that this team developed  integrated schedule for the MAC implementation and other major  Medicare initiatives, monitored implementation of cross-cutting initiatives,  and identified effects that cut across initiatives. For example, CMS  provided us with an integrated timeline the agency had developed that  detailed important dates for each of these initiatives. This technical team  was responsible for providing weekly updates to the directors of their  respective components, who would then elevate issues as needed to CMS\u2019s  executive leadership.", "CMS developed training and manuals for agency staff, MACs, and  legacy contractors. CMS held training classes to define the roles and  responsibilities of contract administration staff, such as contracting  officers and project officers, involved in the award and management of  MAC contracts. The agency published a contract administration manual  for staff with guidance on processing MAC deliverables and cost reports.  In addition, CMS developed educational materials for MACs and legacy  contractors, including handbooks that outlined CMS\u2019s policies on issues,  such as required meetings and deliverables, and interaction with  functional contractors.", "CMS hired an Implementation Support Contractor to assist in A/B  MAC implementation. CMS contracted with Chickasaw Nation  Industries (CNI) to conduct various tasks such as monitoring  implementation status, performing risk assessments, reviewing the  completeness and timeliness of the MACs\u2019 status reports and meeting  minutes, and bringing issues and suggestions to CMS regarding the  implementation.", "CMS required the MACs to provide detailed plans and reports to  facilitate implementation in each jurisdiction and to submit  reports of lessons learned. CMS required that each A/B MAC submit a  Jurisdiction Implementation Project Plan to detail overall transition plans  and a Segment Implementation Project Plan to delineate transition work  more specifically for each part of the transition, and that each DME MAC  submit an Implementation Project Plan. The MACs were required to  update these plans on a biweekly basis during the transition, including  details of how each MAC would accomplish the requirements in their  SOWs and the time frames for taking these steps. The agency also required  that the MACs and CNI submit reports of lessons learned to provide  insight on how to improve future transitions, and it requested that legacy  contractors submit such reports.", "Documenting lessons learned helped some aspects of later  implementations. For example, lessons learned documents provided to  CMS revealed challenges associated with transferring records from legacy  contractors to the MACs. Two contractors we interviewed noted that they  had to sort through over 100,000 boxes of paper files, as either a legacy  contractor or the incoming MAC. One of these contractors reported that  these files spanned multiple jurisdictions and estimated that it would cost  $11 million to sort and move these records, which they described as  unlikely to ever be needed. CMS told us that based on lessons learned  documents they recognized a need to begin planning for file transfer as  soon as possible. CMS began suggesting that the MACs bring a file transfer  plan to their first meeting with the outgoing contractor, and the outgoing  contractor bring descriptions of its current files, organization and volume,  and file search and retrieval methods.", "CMS made midcourse corrections to facilitate its response to bid  protests. As of July 2009, CMS reported that bid protests had been filed in  11 of the 19 jurisdictions and as of September 2009, 6 jurisdictions still had  final award decisions pending. Bid protests delayed implementation of 3 of  the 6 MAC jurisdictions that we reviewed. CMS indicated that responding  to bid protests was very time consuming for staff. As CMS gained  experience with MAC-related bid protests, the agency told us that it made  changes to better respond to them. For example, because CMS initially  assigned the same staff to work on procurements for several jurisdictions  at a time, when a bid protest occurred in one jurisdiction, CMS shifted  staff resources to manage the protest, ultimately delaying award decisions  for other jurisdictions not under bid protest. In response, CMS established  separate jurisdiction-based review panels, which allowed other staff to  continue their work in jurisdictions that were not involved in bid protests.  In addition, CMS identified a need to improve its management of MAC- related proposal evaluation documents. The agency has since hired an  outside contractor that provided a tool to assist with managing the  agency\u2019s documentation of proposal assessments in Cycles 1 and 2 to help  the agency respond more quickly should a bid protest occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain CMS Decisions Have Led to Challenges during the Implementation of Medicare Contracting Reform", "paragraphs": ["While MACs we interviewed generally described CMS\u2019s facilitation steps  as helpful, we identified certain agency decisions that led to challenges for  the implementation of Medicare contracting reform. Some of these  decisions, for example, caused delays in payments to providers. CMS  sometimes, but not always, used lessons learned from MACs and legacy  contractors to make midcourse adjustments to decisions that initially led  to challenges. The decisions we identified include the following:  CMS underestimated the number of appeals and provider call  volumes, and the legacy contractors did not reduce their appeals  workloads to target levels before the MAC transitions. Three of the  six MACs we interviewed and CMS reported that some legacy contractors  turned over a larger-than-expected appeals workload, resulting in delays  in resolving appeals and, in some cases, higher customer service call  volumes than CMS estimated. (See table 1.) CMS required all legacy  contractors to set workload processing goals to reduce the number of  appeals transferred to the MACs during the transition, and to submit  weekly and monthly workload reports. CMS reviewed these reports to  check whether the legacy contractors were meeting their workload  processing goals. Despite regular workload monitoring during the MAC  transitions, CMS underestimated the appeals and provider call volumes. As  a result, three MACs we interviewed and CMS reported large appeals  workload backlogs for several months, leading to delays in resolving  appeals, which in some cases led to more calls from providers with  unresolved appeals. CMS officials reported that, in some cases, they  required the MACs to take corrective actions, such as hiring additional  staff, which two contractors noted were most often temporary staff. The  agency also reported having revised workload estimates for subsequent  MAC transitions.", "According to CMS staff, concern that legacy contractors might terminate  their contracts prior to the MAC transition and cause claims payment  disruptions contributed to a decision by the agency to pay incentive  bonuses to 15 legacy contractors, which as of July 2009 were worth a  total of about $5 million. However, CMS officials reported that, as of July  2009, payment of these bonuses was not contingent upon legacy  contractors meeting specific workload reduction metrics and therefore  was not used as a mechanism to ensure that legacy contractors reduced  their workloads to specified levels prior to the MAC transition. For  example, a bonus was given to a legacy contractor in a jurisdiction we  reviewed in which the new MAC reported inheriting larger-than-expected  numbers of appeals from the legacy contractors.", "The concurrent implementation of the MAC transition with other  Medicare initiatives caused payment delays and other operational  challenges. CMS reported that it accelerated MAC implementation to  prevent potential disruptions in claims processing if legacy contractors  that were not awarded MAC contracts terminated their operations  prematurely. We first noted concerns about CMS\u2019s accelerated schedule in  our 2005 report, including that CMS had not integrated the planning and  scheduling of MAC implementations with other initiatives. CMS did not  agree with our 2005 recommendation to extend its MAC implementation  schedule to allow more time for planning and midcourse adjustments.  Instead, CMS reported to us that it had established a team that developed  integrated schedules for the MAC implementation and other major  Medicare initiatives across the agency. (See fig. 3.) Overlapping initiatives  that posed particular challenges for the MAC transition included the  establishment of a new standard unique provider identification number,  the National Provider Identifier (NPI), which providers had to use to be  paid; CMS\u2019s establishment of Enterprise Data Centers (EDC) to house  Medicare claims-processing software systems beginning in March 2006;  and CMS\u2019s implementation of the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger  Accounting System (HIGLAS), a new CMS financial management system  designed to incorporate information from contractor and agency financial  ial  transactions, including claims payment, beginning in May 2005.  transactions, including claims payment, beginning in May 2005.", "EDCs (3/2006\u20137/2009) EDCs (3/2006\u20137/2009)", "MAC mandated deadline (October 2011)", "CMS Action: Implement HIGLAS,  CMS Action: Implement HIGLAS,  CMS\u2019s new financial management CMS\u2019s new financial management  and accounting system designed to  and accounting system designed to  incorporate information from incorporate information from  contractor and agency financial contractor and agency financial  transactions including claims transactions including claims  payment. payment.", "CMS Action: Implement  CMS Action: Implement NPI program, which assigns  NPI program, which assigns a unique identification number that  a unique identification number that  is required for claims payment to  is required for claims payment to health care providers. health care providers.", "CMS Action: Consolidate and  CMS Action: Consolidate and  transition the EDC, which are  transition the EDC, which are data centers that house Medicare  data centers that house Medicare  claims processing software claims processing software  systems, reducing the total  systems, reducing the total  number from more than 20 number from more than 20  different facilities to 2. different facilities to 2.", "HIGLAS is a major CMS initiative to modernize Medicare\u2019s accounting and financial  management systems by creating a single, integrated financial accounting system to be  used by CMS and all Medicare contractors. CMS began planning the transition to HIGLAS  in 2001 to satisfy the objectives of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act and  the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, but implementation was delayed  until the MAC implementation began in 2005.", "In particular, the concurrent MAC and NPI implementations led to  provider enrollment workload backlogs and, subsequently, claims  payment and processing challenges, as providers were not paid until  provider enrollment applications were processed. According to CMS, three  of the six MACs we studied inherited a backlog of unprocessed provider  enrollment applications from the legacy contractors (see table 2), which  led to claims payment delays. CMS officials told us they were aware that  the mandated deadline for legacy contractors and MACs to enroll  providers in the NPI program overlapped with the MAC transition  schedule in five jurisdictions, but acknowledged that they did not initially  understand the full effect that the overlap with the NPI implementation  would have on the MAC transitions.", "To a lesser extent, CMS reported other MAC operational challenges  implementing the EDCs and HIGLAS in conjunction with the MACs.  According to CMS officials, implementing the EDCs in conjunction with  the MACs was challenging, in part because each legacy contractor had  unique claims-processing system features that either had to be  consolidated in the broader MAC jurisdictions or discontinued. For  example, a legacy contractor may have configured its claims-processing  system with 150 to 200 unique computer applications, each with  specialized functions. CMS reported establishing a workgroup that was  responsible for reviewing these unique claims-processing system  applications and determining whether or not the application would be  transferred to the EDC for use by the new MAC.", "CMS officials said implementing HIGLAS in conjunction with the MACs  was most problematic in MAC jurisdictions where some legacy  contractors had transitioned to HIGLAS prior to the MAC transition and  others had not. For example, in one case a MAC had to maintain two  financial management systems temporarily until the entire jurisdiction was  converted to HIGLAS. CMS\u2019s HIGLAS timeline initially required legacy  contractors to convert data into HIGLAS format just before cutover to the  MAC. In response to these and other challenges, officials reported that  the agency is now implementing HIGLAS on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction  basis after the transition to each MAC is complete.", "Prior to the MAC transition, CMS did not adequately monitor  legacy contractors\u2019 implementation of mandated claims-payment  policy changes, generating unanticipated work for the MACs and  causing provider relations challenges. In four of the six MAC  jurisdictions we studied, CMS or the MAC told us that the MACs  discovered and corrected claims-processing errors made by legacy  contractors, which, in some cases, had generated improper payments to  providers and added additional work for the MACs in order to make the  corrections themselves during the transition. These errors were largely  due to legacy contractors not properly implementing certain CMS payment  policies and revealed that CMS had not routinely checked to ensure that  legacy contractors were making changes required by CMS to pay claims  correctly. Although discovering and correcting these errors eventually led  to more accurate Medicare payment, the errors generated unanticipated  work for the MACs and caused provider relations challenges. For example,  CMS reported that a legacy contractor had made improper payments to  providers for scheduled, nonemergency ambulance transportation, a  service covered by Medicare only under limited circumstances, which was  discovered by the MAC. The MAC corrected the error, stopping improper  payments to providers. A MAC in another jurisdiction told us that a legacy  contractor had paid claims that should not have been paid for decades  because it had not fully implemented requirements for certain edits related  to rented equipment maintenance and service. In another example from  the same jurisdiction, CMS reported that the MAC discovered the legacy  contractor\u2019s system was ineffective in ensuring that a provider had  submitted documents required for payment. The HHS Office of Inspector  General estimated that, because of this claims-processing error, Medicare  paid approximately $127 million to providers who had not submitted the  required documentation in 2006. Although CMS officials told us the  agency monitored the legacy contractors through periodic reviews of  contractor edits, it did not discover or correct these particular errors;  instead, the MACs did.", "CMS allowed local Medicare coverage policy to be consolidated to  a stricter standard in a region and did not require MACs to make  this change clear, causing payment denials providers did not  anticipate. Originally, CMS instructed MACs to select the \u201cleast  restrictive\u201d local coverage determination already in place in the  jurisdiction. CMS later changed its guidance to advise MACs to implement  the \u201cmost clinically appropriate\u201d local coverage determination in place in  the jurisdiction, because a legacy contractor may not have had a policy in  place for some topics. This led some providers to face more restrictive  coverage determinations than they had prior to the MAC transition. For  example, one provider group we interviewed reported that the incoming  MAC instituted documentation criteria for treating a type of skin lesion  that had not been required by the legacy contractor. Two of the three  provider groups we interviewed reported that there was a lack of clear  communication about this change in guidance, which caused confusion  once the local coverage determinations were finalized and claims were  rejected. In addition, in two jurisdictions we studied where the MACs  invited providers to comment on more than 100 draft policies, two  provider groups we interviewed said draft policies would be clearer if they  identified which areas were changes from old policies, and one provider  group said physicians\u2019 time constraints made it difficult to review such  large volumes of information.", "CMS did not initially require Joint Operating Agreements (JOA)  between MACs and all functional contractors, resulting in  communication challenges between MACs and some key functional  contractors. Initially, CMS did not require JOAs\u2014agreements that  establish roles and responsibilities\u2014between MACs and all related  contractors. CMS officials noted that in considering JOA requirements, the  agency determined whether a JOA was appropriate for each particular  MAC relationship. Specifically, CMS initially did not require JOAs between  MACs and the EDCs, but did require JOAs between MACs and certain  other contractors, such as the Beneficiary Contact Center, which runs the  1-800-MEDICARE help line for beneficiaries. One MAC we interviewed  noted that it was unsuccessful in communicating directly with the EDC in  its jurisdiction because there was no JOA in place. Instead, it had to direct  all communication to CMS officials, who would then contact the EDC on  behalf of the MAC. CMS made a midcourse correction to address this  inefficiency, and required JOAs between MACs and all functional  contractors (including EDCs) in implemented jurisdictions.

However, a written justification for the waiver must be documented. (See  app. V for additional information on the QASP review.)", "Award Fee Plan Review: The Award Fee Plan is CMS\u2019s method for  providing financial incentives to MACs based on their performance. CMS  creates an Award Fee Plan for each MAC annually, for review periods that  have ranged from 6 to 12 months. For each MAC Award Fee Plan, CMS  develops incentive metrics. CMS officials explained that MAC award-fee  incentive metrics are generally designed to be more challenging than the  standards outlined in the statement of work in order to provide incentives  for the MACs to exceed those standards. For example, the claims- processing timeliness metric states that the MAC will process 97 percent  of clean claims within statutorily specified time frames, a level that is set  higher than the standard in the statement of work, which states that the  MAC must process 95 percent of clean claims in these time frames. CMS  assigns a value to, or weights, each metric to determine what percentage  of the award fee can be earned by the MAC for that metric. (See app. VI for  a listing of the weights assigned to each incentive metric for the three  MACs we studied.)", "CMS uses the Award Fee Plan review to assess a MAC\u2019s performance  against each metric to determine the amount of the award fee earned for  that metric. If a MAC does not meet some of its incentive metrics, it may  still receive an award fee for other metrics that it meets or partially  meets. For example, if CMS assigned a value of 8 percent to the claims- processing timeliness metric, and this was the only metric the MAC met,  then the MAC would receive 8 percent of the total award fee. According to  CMS, agency officials can change incentive metrics every review period,  depending on which aspects of the MAC\u2019s performance need to be  emphasized during that period. For example, CMS officials stated that one  MAC may not initially have a provider enrollment incentive metric in its  Award Fee Plan, but agency officials can incorporate it in a subsequent  review period if they want the MAC to improve in this area. In  determining the award fee, CMS also considers overall contract  performance, such as the QASP results and other CMS monitoring  activities. (See apps.

We also interviewed  CMS officials responsible for development and oversight of contra reform budgets and estimates of potential costs and savings to understand CMS\u2019s process for tracking and reporting the financial status of  contracting reform. Further, we reviewed criteria for good governance  practices to determine the importance of complete information on the  costs of federal programs and activities for the effective management of  government operations and for assisting Congress and internal and  external users in assessing the operating performance and stewardsh program activities. To assess the reliability of CMS-reported internal an external cost data for contracting reform and CMS-reported spending d ata  for selected Medicare operational activities, we conducted interviews withosts and savings for Medicare contracting reform,  knowledgeable agency officials and reviewed for reasonableness the assumptions associated with the collection and compilation of the costs  and savings data.
