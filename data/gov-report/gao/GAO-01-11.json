State  selected 10 projects that it believed should be built first. State envisions a  10- to 15-year program costing $15 billion or more for construction projects  in more than 180 locations around the world where the existing facilities  may be vulnerable. Planning and implementing this program will be a  massive and difficult undertaking, requiring that State, other U.S. agencies,  and the Congress work together to determine facility needs, priorities, and  funding levels.

To provide adequate  security, State has determined that it needs to replace most existing  facilities that do not meet these standards. Although the Department of  State has made substantial security enhancements at U.S. embassies and  consulates, including acquiring adjacent properties to increase setback,  building concrete barriers, and installing electronic cameras and sensors,  these enhancements cannot bring most existing facilities in line with the  desired setback and related blast protection requirements because the  facilities are on small pieces of land. Larger building sites, which are  expensive and frequently hard to acquire in urban areas, are typically  needed to construct new facilities with sufficient setback to protect against  attacks.", "After the Africa bombings, the administration established two  Accountability Review Boards, pursuant to the Omnibus Diplomatic  Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (P. L. 99-399, 22 U.S.C. 4831, et seq.,  as amended), to review the circumstances surrounding the bombings and  State\u2019s vulnerability to terrorist threats. In January 1999, the boards made  recommendations on responding to terrorist threats, strengthening  security standards and procedures, determining the size and composition  of U.S. missions, and providing funding for safe buildings and security  programs in the future.

In this time period, the Office also managed the  completion of the construction of more than 20 new embassy and  consulate facilities, most of which were authorized and funded under the  Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (commonly  called the \u201cInman Program\u201d).", "In fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, State received a total of about $1.1 billion to build new, secure embassies and consulates.

In addition to the existing embassy in Brasilia, Brazil, State  proposed to spend about $200 million to build two new consulates\u2014one in  Rio de Janeiro to accommodate about 145 personnel and one in S\u00e3o Paulo  to accommodate 97 staff. The congressional concerns are consistent with  overseas staffing issues identified in our prior work. For several years, we  have encouraged the executive branch to rethink its overseas presence  with a view to right-sizing posts and conducting regional operations where  feasible. Because the Congress has not approved State\u2019s proposal for the  Rio de Janeiro project, State has notified the Congress of its intent to  reprogram $22.8 million from the fiscal year 1999 supplemental  appropriation for this project to partially fund the project in Abu Dhabi,  United Arab Emirates.

State proposed building a facility with a 65-foot  setback, which is 35 feet less than required by State\u2019s current security  standards. The Secretary of State granted a waiver from the security  standards based on State\u2019s plan to design the building to meet blast  standards at the lesser distance. According to State, potential blast effects  on the planned facility would be mitigated by strengthened construction  methods and techniques, providing equal security performance to that of a  standard blast-resistant building with a 100-foot setback, thus providing the  same level of protection. State indicated that the alternative sites it had  identified that would meet the setback requirements did not have a secure  title due to uncertainties regarding land ownership in Luanda.

State also indicated  that construction schedules will depend on the level of funding provided by  the Congress.

These plans  usually cover 5-, 6-, or 10-year periods and are updated either annually or  biennially.

It said that  these priority bands, combined with the information it provides the  Congress on projects to be executed in the current fiscal year and the  semiannual reports on these projects, constituted a sound approach to  program decision-making and accountability. State said that development  of a capital plan along the lines that we recommend would be of no value  because it would be prone to guesswork, would be impractical given  uncertain future funding levels and project costs, and would be resource  intensive. State also emphasized that sustained long-term funding was  needed for its program, and criticized our report for not adequately  addressing this need and the interrelationships between program planning  and funding.

State  believes it should wait until it knows how much funding it is likely to  receive before preparing a long-term plan consistent with our  recommendation. In contrast, we believe that State should prepare a long-term plan with project cost estimates and schedules for at least a 5-year period, to assist decisionmakers in deciding program scope and  funding. We also believe that the information that State has provided the  Congress is not sufficient to guide judgments regarding long-term program  funding and direction because it does not clearly indicate the order that  projects will be done, their estimated costs, or when the projects will be  completed. Our report noted that leading organizations use long-term  capital plans to define capital asset decisions, promote informed choices  about resource needs, and provide decisionmakers with an overall sense of  projects\u2019 merits and funding needs. Information on the scope and  composition of the overall program envisioned by State would encourage  dialogue with congressional committees regarding funding levels and  program expectations over the life of this long-term program. Without a  long-term capital plan that includes such information, it will be difficult for  State and congressional decisionmakers to accurately judge how much the  program will cost; when it can be reasonably expected to be completed;  and how key factors, such as funding and changes in the size of overseas  posts, may affect program implementation. A long-term capital plan would  also improve the accountability and transparency of decisions made by  State, other agencies, and the Congress that affect this important program.", "State\u2019s comments indicate that it has interpreted our recommendation as  requiring the development of detailed plans that accurately predict the  exact space requirements, precise cost, and construction schedule of each  of more than 180 projects over the life of this program. This was not our  intention. Our recommendation was intended to provide decisionmakers  with better information on the potential long-term costs and schedules for  this effort to enable them to weigh the merits of individual projects and  make related funding decisions. We believe it is reasonable for State to  prepare a detailed plan over a 5-year or longer period. As noted in our  report, leading organizations not only rank projects by priority, but they  also provide more detailed cost estimates and other information in plans  covering 5-, 6-, or 10-year periods. State already has the foundation to adopt  this best practice. We share State\u2019s view that precision in planning  estimates becomes less practical and important for the later years of the  overall program.

Seismic concerns, and the costs of large sites in urban areas, further  contribute to the high costs of new embassies and consulates.

The basic premise of our report is that State can do a better job of  planning its capital construction program to help decisionmakers make  more informed decisions about the program in the long term. Our  report acknowledges that State has ranked more than 180 projects for  potential replacement. However, as noted in our report, leading  organizations not only rank capital projects by priority, but they also  provide more detailed cost estimates and other information in plans  covering 5-, 6-, or 10-year periods. State has the foundation to adopt this  best practice, which we believe would be useful to the Department,  other agencies operating overseas, and the Congress for decision- making and other purposes. 2. We believe that the planning information that State has provided the  Congress is not sufficient to guide judgments regarding long-term  program funding, accountability, and direction. Our report noted that  leading organizations use long-term capital plans to define capital asset  decisions, promote informed choices about resource needs, and  provide decisionmakers with an overall sense of projects\u2019 merits and  funding needs. Information on the scope and composition of the  program envisioned by State, including the estimated cost and schedule  of planned projects, would encourage dialogue with congressional  committees regarding funding levels and program expectations over  the life of this program. Without a long-term capital plan that includes  such information, it will be difficult for State and congressional  decisionmakers to accurately judge how much the program will cost;  when it can be reasonably expected to be completed; and how key  factors, such as funding and changes in the size of overseas posts, may  affect program implementation. A long-term capital plan would also  improve the accountability and transparency of decisions made by  State, other agencies, and the Congress that affect this important  program.  3. We disagree with State\u2019s view that implementing our recommendation  would involve too much guesswork because of uncertainties regarding  funding and future projects\u2019 exact scope and estimated costs. A  long-term plan is typically based on assumptions about the future and  estimates that are imprecise and subject to change. Once prepared, a  plan can be adjusted to reflect changes and refinement of estimates in  projects\u2019 scope, cost, and implementation schedule, and to adjust to  funding decisions and other factors. State has many years of experience  in estimating construction schedules and costs and has already begun  several studies that would provide valuable inputs to such a plan. 4. We agree that sustained funding will be needed for State to make  substantial progress in replacing its vulnerable embassies and  consulates, and we have modified the report\u2019s conclusion to recognize  this. However, we do not agree with State\u2019s view that it should wait  until it knows how much funding it is likely to receive before preparing  a long-term plan consistent with our recommendation. Our report title  reflects the message of the report that better planning will enhance  program decision-making. Regarding funding, our report describes  State\u2019s requests for funding and the appropriations it has received in  detail, including State\u2019s request for $3.35 billion in advance  appropriations for fiscal years 2002-05 that was rejected.", "5.", "In appendix I, we describe the concerns expressed by the Senate  Appropriations Committee in September 2000 that State was  accumulating large, unfunded construction requirements.

Rather,  the report expressed the view that land acquisition, site preparation,  and building design are relatively inexpensive, allowing the Department  to pursue a large number of projects at a very modest up front cost, and  that this had led to the accumulation of large, unfunded construction  requirements. 7. State\u2019s comments indicate that it has interpreted our recommendation  as requiring the development of detailed plans that accurately predict  the exact space requirements, precise cost, and construction schedule  of each of more than 180 projects over the life of this program. This was  not our intention. We have modified our recommendation, calling for  State to prepare a long-term plan that covers at least 5 years and to  provide notional estimates of the overall program\u2019s cost and duration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Lynn Moore, Jesus Martinez, and  Rona Mendelsohn made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
