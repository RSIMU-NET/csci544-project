Although both cutters on average have met their minimum mission capable targets over the long term, increased depot maintenance has more recently reduced each cutter's rates below targets. The FRC's rate is lower, in part, because of a series of unanticipated drydock periods to correct issues covered by its 12-month warranty. The NSC's lower rate is primarily because of anticipated 2-year maintenance and system upgrade periods performed on each newly delivered NSC. Both cutters have experienced problems with the diesel engines, which caused lost operational days and hindered operations while underway.", "The Coast Guard's 154-foot Fast Response Cutter and 418-foot National Security Cutter", "The Coast Guard has initiated design changes on the FRC and NSC, but some of the NSC's changes to address maintenance problems will not be installed until after each cutter is delivered. While the Coast Guard plans at least $17 million on FRC design changes, officials estimate the warranty has helped avoid $77 million for repaired systems. This includes about $52 million to replace 20 diesel engines that have degraded FRC operations since first discovered in July 2013. Design changes on the NSCs are expected to cost the Coast Guard at least $260 million. In order to maintain production schedules, several changes will be completed after delivery of each NSC, including the ninth NSC, which has not yet begun construction. Thus, systems with known deficiencies are being installed, only to be replaced later. Officials stated this approach is more cost effective; however, the Coast Guard did not document its cost analyses, in accordance with GAO cost estimating best practices. Without such documentation, the Coast Guard cannot demonstrate that it is making cost-effective decisions.", "Since 2010, depot maintenance expenditures for the FRC and NSC have been $106.6 million less than the Coast Guard estimated.

Additionally the NSCs are scheduled for patrols lasting roughly 2  to 3 months in duration as opposed to the FRCs, which are scheduled for  patrols lasting about 5 to 7 days, making it much more likely that the  NSCs will be conducting missions in a partially mission capable status at  some point during their lengthy patrol. The size of the NSC allows for  additional capabilities to be available during patrols. For example, the  NSC is equipped with three cutter boats, and known failures with the  dual-point davit crane launch system frequently render at least one of the  three cutter boats inoperable, causing the NSC to become not fully  mission capable. Instead, the NSC becomes partially mission capable as  it is able to conduct operations with the remaining two cutter boats."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Anticipated Post Delivery Depot-Level Maintenance Is Reducing the NSC\u2019s Mission Capable Rates", "paragraphs": ["While the cumulative average monthly mission capable rate for the NSC  is above the target since November 2013, when we eliminated prior years  and analyzed the NSC\u2019s cumulative average monthly mission capable  rate over a more recent time period\u2014October 2015 to September 2016\u2014 we found that the NSC\u2019s average mission capable rate was 37.2 percent,  which is below its minimum target of the range of 49 percent.

While both the FRC\u2019s and NSC\u2019s  inability to meet its mission capable target rate is attributable to the  increase in depot-level maintenance, the cause differs. Unlike the FRC\u2019s  mission capable rates, which are influenced by the warranty repair  drydock periods, the NSCs mission capable rates are influenced by the  roughly 2-year post-delivery period called the post shakedown availability,  which is scheduled for each newly delivered NSC. During this time the  cutters will undergo depot-level maintenance and other activities to bring  the cutter to full operational capability. Further, whereas the FRC\u2019s  warranty repair drydock periods were unanticipated, the NSC\u2019s  shakedown periods were planned during the acquisition phase.", "During this shakedown period, the NSC will be rendered not mission  capable due to depot-level maintenance for a majority of its time. For  example, from January 2015 until September 2016, the NSC Hamilton  spent 70.9 percent of its time in depot-level maintenance, and the NSC  James spent 82.6 percent of its time in depot-level maintenance from  September 2015 to September 2016. With only five NSCs in operation as  of September 2016, having two cutters spend the majority of their time  not mission capable due to depot-level maintenance is having a negative  effect on the overall fleet\u2019s mission capable rates. This will continue as  the Coast Guard introduces new NSCs into the fleet and the last cutter  completes its 2-year post shakedown period\u2014scheduled for 2022 as the  ninth cutter is scheduled for delivery in 2020. While the first three NSCs  achieved their mission capable rate targets on average from January  2014 to September 2016, it is uncertain if the overall fleet mission  capable rate will increase once all NSCs complete their post shakedown  availabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equipment Failures and Difficulties with Obtaining Spare Parts Have Marginal Effect on NSC Mission Capable Rates", "paragraphs": ["The average time spent correcting equipment failures or waiting for  supplies has been below the Coast Guard\u2019s target of no more than 12  percent since November 2013.

In the last year of this time frame, the average not  mission capable rate due to maintenance (equipment failures) was 2.8  percent. The Coast Guard keeps this metric low by using its RCM  analysis and by arranging for the NSC\u2019s drydock periods to conduct  preventative maintenance based on equipment failure risk. This enables  the cutter to receive maintenance that potentially avoids equipment  failures while conducting missions. According to the Coast Guard, this is  accomplished by performing the drydock in such a way that equipment  systems not believed to be in need of repair are included as optional  items in the depot maintenance contract. These optional items can be  exercised as needed at a previously negotiated fixed price.", "The NSC fleet has met the industry standard of less than 5 percent for not  mission capable rates due to supply.

These systems include  the cutter boat launch and recovery system and the reliability of the ship  service diesel generator and the main diesel engine. Unlike the FRC\u2019s  warranty, the Coast Guard is required to pay a portion of the cost for  equipment problems corrected under the NSC\u2019s guaranty. Nearly all of  these lost operational days resulted from the NSCs operating in a partially  mission capable status due to the equipment problems. The cutter boat  launch and recovery system, which includes the gantry crane and dual  point davit, have rendered the fleet in a partially mission capable status  for 278 days from 2014 to 2016. Across the fleet, overheating bearings  in the ship service diesel generator have resulted in the crew\u2019s inability to  use one or more of the generators. According to the Coast Guard policy,  the NSC requires at least two (one specific generator and either of the  remaining two) of its three generators to be operational in order to  conduct missions. The cost to repair this issue is substantial, with each  bearing costing roughly $100,000 to resolve.", "In addition, the NSCs continue to experience failures associated with the  main diesel engines. The main diesel engines used by the NSCs are  manufactured by MTU, the same manufacturer responsible for the main  diesel engines employed on the FRCs, and have been problematic since  the NSC fleet became operational. As we found in January 2016, the  engines overheat in waters above 74 degrees Fahrenheit, which  constitutes a portion of the NSC\u2019s operating area given that they are  intended to be deployed worldwide. This can cause the cutters to  operate 2 to 4 knots below their top speed of 28 knots, which could hinder  the cutter in successfully conducting operations. The NSC\u2019s inability to  achieve top speed in warm waters has inhibited the cutters\u2019 ability to  complete their regularly scheduled full power trials, which are periodic  tests of the propulsion plant operated at maximum rated power.

From 2012 to 2015, the  operational NSCs conducted 7 full power trials out of 14 total possible  tests. Of those 7 tests, 4 were considered successful. In order for a full  power trial to be considered successful, the cutter must complete the trial  requirements, which include testing at a specific engine speed and  minimum water depth, while not exceeding design pressures,  temperature, and other operating parameters. Performance issues or  equipment failures with the propulsion system were listed as the most  frequent cause for not conducting the full power trial or for unsuccessful  tests.", "We previously recommended in January 2016 that the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) conduct an acquisition review board once the  Coast Guard concludes a root cause analysis on both the main diesel  engines and the generators. DHS concurred with this recommendation  and plans to hold an acquisition review board no later than December  2017. In an attempt to resolve the continued propulsion plant problems,  DHS issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum to the Coast Guard in  April 2016 directing, among other actions, that the Coast Guard conduct a  propulsion study to develop a permanent solution to the main diesel  engine failures by December 2017. The Coast Guard has a propulsion  study underway with MTU America, Inc. that is on track to meet the  Acquisition Decision Memorandum\u2019s deadline according to program  officials.", "Pending the completion of the propulsion study and identification of  corrective actions, the Coast Guard issued an engineering advisory to the  NSCs in January 2016 in an effort to ensure the main diesel engine  service life expectations are met, improve the engine\u2019s operational  reliability, maximize the engine\u2019s performance, and minimize the engine\u2019s  maintenance costs. This advisory provides actionable steps the NSC  crews can take while underway to achieve the aforementioned goals,  such as to ensure the quality of the lubricating oil used and monitored  regularly, to use harbor mode\u2014which only engages one of the two diesel  engines when operating below 10 knots\u2014and to minimize engine idle  time, to name a few. The Coast Guard is also in the process of  developing prototype components to address issues with the main diesel  engine in advance of the completion of the propulsion study.", "Similar to the FRC, the Coast Guard also solicits feedback annually from  each NSC\u2019s crew in an engineering report to identify trends in equipment  systems that are hindering the cutters while underway.

The top three equipment  problems that occurred most frequently in the NSC\u2019s engineering reports  from 2012 to 2015 are the Auxiliary Seawater System (ASW), the  propulsion plant reliability, and the stern doors/gantry crane. For example,  issues with the ASW included piping failures, ill-fitting valves, and  corrosion.

According to program officials,  the structural enhancements were identified early in the production of the  FRCs during a review of the standards that were used to build the cutter,  which resulted in the Coast Guard increasing the strength of the hull by  installing extra supports to ensure its safety. These enhancements were  retrofitted on the first seven FRCs and were then included in production  beginning with the eighth FRC. The rudder replacement is intended to  reduce fuel consumption, reduce paint failures, and lengthen the part\u2019s  lifespan, which will reduce sustainment costs.

This  problem was first reported in the cutter\u2019s Initial Operational Test and  Evaluation report in July 2013. The Navy\u2019s Commander of Operational  Test and Evaluation Force, which serves as the Coast Guard\u2019s  independent test agent, found multiple problems with the main diesel  engines that resulted in 275 lost operational hours during the test event.

Additionally, the problems  with the diesel engines have varied widely, making it difficult and time- consuming for MTU and the Coast Guard to identify a definitive root  cause that could solve the issues fleet-wide. Most issues have required  fleet-wide retrofits, which can reduce the cutters\u2019 mission capable rates  due to the increased depot maintenance work required to install  corrections. According to Coast Guard officials, the FRC contracting team  holds monthly meetings with MTU to review the corrective actions and  hold this manufacturer accountable. The program estimates that 60  percent of the current problems have been resolved with retrofits  complete.

This involves cutting  into large sections of the hull in order to add reinforcing metal so that the  first two NSCs are more likely to meet their full 30-year service life. This  design change was incorporated into production on the third NSC. The  original estimate of $38 million for this work was established in January  2014, and the Coast Guard awarded the contract in February 2016. The  current contract value of over $70 million represents a cost increase of  about 86 percent from the original estimate. According to NSC program  officials, the large cost increase is due to a better understanding of the  work that would be required to complete this effort, such as the costs  associated with getting the cutter into a drydock, removing sensitive  equipment, and the technical complexity of the task. They also stated that  the contractor factored risk into its bid for completing this technically  difficult work. In order to complete this work, the Coast Guard will place  the first two NCSs in a not mission capable due to depot maintenance  status for at least 11 months each to correct structural deficiencies. The  Coast Guard plans to conduct additional design changes, such as the  gantry crane and single-point davit replacements, during this period as  well to save money.", "In order to minimize the cost increase for some of these design changes  and to adhere to their production schedule, the Coast Guard plans to  maintain the original equipment during production for all NSCs and then  later conduct retrofits after accepting delivery of the cutters.

Given that the  program has been aware of these three design changes for many years,  the Coast Guard had an opportunity to install the design changes during  production instead of during the post delivery period.", "According to Coast Guard officials, one hindrance to installing systems  during production is that the shipyard would likely want to revalidate any  engineering work on the design change that was conducted by Coast  Guard officials since the shipyard is responsible for delivering a ship that  meets the specifications of the contract.

First, DHS stated that cost  estimating best practices are most applicable to new acquisitions. We  disagreed, stating that our cost estimating guide is intended to be  applicable to programs and assets in all stages of their life cycles,  including maintenance and support. Updating standard support levels  periodically would lower the Coast Guard\u2019s budgetary risk by using actual  data to better inform future depot maintenance estimates. Second, DHS  described how sustainment and maintenance costs can be uncertain and  challenging to estimate, which the Coast Guard mitigates through  centralized management of its depot-level maintenance funds for all  assets. We again disagreed, stating that best practices can help ensure  that cost estimates are comprehensive and accurate, which can help  ensure that funds will be available when needed. Third, DHS explained  that given the fiscal environment, the Coast Guard would focus on  improvements that do not require additional resources. We stated that a  well-documented cost estimating process and the use of accurate  historical data should enable the Coast Guard to operate more efficiently.", "By not updating the standard support levels with information on actual  expenditures, the Coast Guard does not know what the actual depot-level  maintenance needs are of its assets. GAO best practices state that  programs should be monitored continuously for their cost effectiveness by  comparing planned and actual performance against the approved  baseline. Effective program and cost control requires ongoing revisions  to the cost estimate, budget, and projected estimates at completion.  Further, a competent cost estimate is the key foundation of a sound  budget. Not updating the estimated costs with actual expenditures could  lead to ineffective planning by those responsible for conducting depot- level maintenance. Coast Guard officials stated that they do not update  their depot maintenance estimates with actual expenditures because  doing so would cause individual budget line items to constantly change.  Nonetheless, by not reviewing and updating the standard support levels  for the FRC and NSC, the Coast Guard cannot accurately know what the  actual depot maintenance needs are for each asset class.

The FRC and NSC both have met their mission capable target  rates over the long term, and there are factors that explain the recent  declines below their respective target ranges. While Coast Guard officials  have stated that these factors are temporary, it is too soon to tell whether  the FRC\u2019s and NSC\u2019s mission capable rates will meet their target ranges  once these temporary periods are complete. Further, while maintaining  production schedules for the NSC is important, this should not be the  overriding factor when considering when to implement design changes.

Visibility into decisions on how and when to  implement planned design changes on the NSCs\u2014including those not yet  constructed\u2014is currently limited because the Coast Guard\u2019s guidance  does not require programs to perform and document cost analyses that  support the cost and timing of when the changes should be incorporated.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s estimates for depot-level maintenance costs are out of  step with actual spending. The difference in estimated and actual depot  maintenance costs realized from the FRC and NSC fleets since 2012 and  2010, respectively, indicates that standard support levels should be  reviewed and updated to more closely reflect the actual expenditures. Not  having an updated assessment of depot maintenance costs for each  asset limits the information decision makers have to determine future  budget needs, and limits transparency into which of the Coast Guard\u2019s  many surface assets, such as aging legacy assets that require additional  maintenance funding, are benefitting from any differences between depot- level maintenance estimates and actual costs. A more thorough  accounting for both the potential costs of design changes and the actual  costs of keeping these cutters in service could improve information used  by decision makers on how to spend scarce taxpayer dollars in support of  a modern, capable Coast Guard surface fleet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the Coast Guard makes effective use of its resources,  specifically regarding its budget, we recommend the Secretary of DHS  direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to take the following two  actions:", "Update the Joint Surface Engineering Change Process Guide to  require a documented cost analysis to provide decision makers  adequate data to make informed decisions regarding the expected  costs and when it is most cost effective to install design changes.", "Periodically update standard support levels to account for actual  expenditures so that the Coast Guard follows best practices and to  provide decision makers an understanding of the actual depot-level  maintenance funds required for Coast Guard assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.

We  reviewed this data from when each cutter class first began to use the  metric (March 2012 for the FRC and November 2013 for the NSC) to  September 2016. We also assessed the reliability of the data from the  EAL system to determine the extent to which we could use the data to  support our findings and found that it was reliable for our purposes. We  gathered data on the Coast Guard top operational degraders (lost  operational days) from 2014 to 2016 and reviewed the FRC\u2019s and NSC\u2019s  engineering reports from 2012 to 2015 to determine the top equipment  issues the cutters experienced from the perspective of the cutter  captains. We also reviewed the Patrol Boat Product Line\u2019s response to  the FRC\u2019s engineering reports and the Long Range Enforcer Product  Line\u2019s response to the NSC\u2019s engineering reports to see how the Coast  Guard planned to remedy the issues the cutters were experiencing. We  interviewed officials with the Coast Guard Office of Naval Engineering;  the Surface Forces Logistics Center in Baltimore, MD; the Long Range  Enforcer Product Line in Alameda, CA; and the Patrol Boat Product Line  in Norfolk, VA. We also toured the NSC Stratton while it was in drydock at  Mare Island Drydock in Vallejo, CA; Coast Guard Base Miami Beach to  view FRC maintenance; and the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, MD to  understand the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to conduct drydocks and to  understand how it plans for, stocks, and ships spare parts to cutters in the  deployed locations.
