According to senior Department of Defense (DOD) test officials, the NIE objective to test and evaluate network components together in a combined event is sound, as is the opportunity to reduce overall test and evaluation costs by combining test events. Further, the NIEs offer the opportunity for a more comprehensive evaluation of the broader network instead of piecemeal evaluation of individual network components. However, the Army is not taking full advantage of the potential knowledge that could be gained from the NIEs, and some resulting Army decisions are at odds with knowledge accumulated during the NIEs. For example, despite poor results in developmental testing, the Army moved forward to operational testing for several systems during the NIEs and they demonstrated similarly poor results. Yet the Army plans to buy and field several of these systems. Doing so increases the risk of poor performance in the field and the need to correct and modify deployed equipment. On the other hand, the Army has evaluated many emerging network capabilities--with generally favorable results--but has bought very few of them, in large part because it did not have a strategy to buy these promising technologies. Army officials have stated that the success of network modernization depends heavily on industry involvement but, with few purchases, it is unclear whether industry will remain interested. Finally, the Army has not yet developed metrics to determine how network performance has improved over time, as GAO recommended in an earlier report.", "The Army has several actions under way or planned to enhance the NIE process and has further opportunities to collaborate with the test community. The Army has identified issues in the NIE process and its network modernization strategy that were causing inefficiencies or less-than-optimal results and has begun implementing actions to mitigate some of those issues. For example, the Army has begun performing technology evaluations, and integration of vendor systems in a lab environment to weed out immature systems before they get to the NIE. The Army has also developed a strategy and has an acquisition plan to address requirements, funding, and competition issues that will help enable it to buy emerging capabilities rapidly. However, the Army will need to validate the new strategy and plan and provide results to industry, which could help to manage industry expectations about how many of and how quickly it can buy these capabilities. DOD has started to identify and evaluate network metrics and to re-focus NIEs to gather additional data and insights. Taking these actions will ultimately allow the periodic review and evaluation of the actual effectiveness of network capabilities and the likely effectiveness of proposed investments. The test community has worked closely with the Army on the NIEs but has also voiced various concerns about the NIEs including their being a schedule-driven event. Tension between the acquisition and test communities has been long-standing. Additional opportunities exist for Army leadership and the test community to work together to further improve NIE execution and results and to reduce tensions between the two communities. A good starting point for the Army would be to take a fresh look at the test community observations and recommendations from previous NIEs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve outcomes for the Army\u0092s network modernization strategy, GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the Army to (1) require successful developmental testing before moving to operational testing at an NIE, (2) correct issues identified during testing at NIEs prior to buying and fielding systems, (3) provide results to industry on Army\u0092s efforts to rapidly acquire emerging capabilities, and (4) pursue additional opportunities for collaboration with the test community on the NIEs.

To achieve this goal, the Army is implementing a new agile process,  which would take advantage of emerging networking solutions to keep  better pace with technology development and deploy selected systems to  the field much faster than previously possible.

A capability set is a suite of network components,  associated equipment, and software that provides an integrated network  capability. A requirement is an established need justifying the allocation  of resources to achieve a capability to accomplish military objectives.  Instead of developing an ultimate capability and buying enough to cover  the entire force, the Army plans to buy only what is currently available,  feasible, and needed for units preparing to deploy. Every year, the Army  will integrate another capability set that reflects changes or advances in  technology since the previous set. To support this approach, the Army is  implementing a new agile process that identifies capability gaps and  solicits solutions from industry and government to evaluate during the  NIEs.", "NIEs are a significant investment. Since 2011, the Army has conducted  five of them, and has projected the cumulative cost of the events at $791  million. The Army conducts NIEs twice a year. Each NIE typically  involves around 3,800 soldiers and 1,000 vehicles, and up to 12,000  square kilometers of territory, and approximately 6 weeks in duration.

This operational testing is subject to review and is conducted with the  production or production-like system in realistic operational  environments, with users that are representative of those expected to  operate, maintain, and support the system when fielded or deployed.", "SUEs are provided by either industry or the government. They are  either (1) developing capabilities with sufficient technology,  integration, and manufacturing maturity levels to warrant NIE  participation; or (2) emerging capabilities that are seen as next  generation war-fighting technologies that have the potential to fill a  known gap or improve current capabilities. SUEs are not subject to  formal test readiness reviews, nor the same level of testing as the  SUTs. SUEs are operationally demonstrated and receive a qualitative  user evaluation, but are not operationally tested and are not the  subject of a formal test report (as SUTs are).", "Aside from their role in the agile process, NIEs also provide the Army with  opportunities for integration, training, and evaluation that leads to  doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education,  personnel, and facilities recommendations; and the refinement of tactics,  techniques, and procedures related to the systems tested.", "The Army believes that traditional test and evaluation processes  frequently result in fielding outdated technologies and expects to improve  on those processes through the NIEs. The Army\u2019s test community  members, including the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) and the  Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), conduct the testing during  the NIEs. The BMC is a headquarters organization within the Training and  Doctrine Command. It has an attached operational 3,800-soldier brigade  combat team dedicated to testing during the NIEs. BMC soldiers use  systems during the NIE in simulated combat scenarios for testing and  evaluation purposes, resulting in qualitative evaluations based on their  observations. The BMC also recommends whether to field, continue  developing, or stop developing each solution and to improve the  integration of capabilities into deploying brigades.

DOD,  under its Defense Acquisition System, requires the integration of test and  evaluation throughout the defense acquisition process to provide  essential information to decision makers; assess attainment of technical  performance parameters; and determine whether systems are  operationally effective, suitable, survivable, and safe for intended use.  Testers generally characterize test and evaluation activities as either  developmental or operational. Developmental testing is a generic term  encompassing modeling and simulation and engineering type tests that  are used to verify that design risks are minimized, that safety of the  system is certified, that achievement of system technical performance is  substantiated, and that readiness for operational test and evaluation is  certified. The intent of developmental testing is to demonstrate the  maturity of a design and to discover and fix design and performance  problems before a system enters production.", "Operational testing is a field test of a system or item under realistic  operational conditions with users who represent those expected to  operate and maintain the system when it is fielded or deployed. Specific  operational tests include limited user tests, initial operational tests, and  customer tests.

According to the DOT&E, system  development best practices dictate that a system should not proceed to  operational testing until it has completed developmental testing and  corrected any identified problems. To address these problems, the Army  has taken steps to implement design changes and schedule additional  testing to verify performance after it has implemented those changes.  However, in doing so, the Army faces the risk of making system design  changes during the production phase or fielding systems with less than  required performance or reliability.", "Two of these SUTs performed poorly during developmental testing.  Developmental testers, through their Assessment of Operational Test  Readiness reports, recommended that the Manpack Radio and the  Rifleman Radio not proceed into operational testing. Despite these  recommendations, the Army proceeded with initial operational testing for  these systems during NIEs while reclassifying the participation of other  systems as either limited user tests or customer tests. The outcomes  were predictably poor, according to DOT&E. See table 1 for operational  test results from ATEC and DOT&E reports.", "In its 2012 annual report, DOT&E pointed out that proceeding to  operational testing only confirmed the deficiencies identified in  developmental testing. For example, the WIN-T Increment 2 system\u2019s  reliability was troublesome enough in a limited user test to warrant a  reduction in the reliability requirement. However, WIN-T Increment 2 was  unable to meet the reduced requirement. The Rifleman Radio also  demonstrated poor reliability during developmental testing in 2011 and  even worse reliability in operational testing due to the enhanced stress of  an operational environment. The DOT&E stated in its 2012 annual report  that, according to system development best practices, the Army should  not proceed to an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation with a system  until it has completed developmental testing and the program has  corrected any identified problems. Otherwise, the Army may conduct  costly operational tests that simply confirm developmental testing  conclusions about poor system performance and reliability rather than  taking action to fix system shortfalls. Further, DOT&E\u2019s 2012 annual  report was critical of the Army\u2019s NIE schedule-driven approach, which  elevates meeting a schedule above adequately preparing a system to  achieve success in operational testing. An event-driven approach,  conversely, would allow systems to participate in a test event after the  systems have satisfied certain criteria. Under the Army\u2019s schedule-driven  approach, the NIEs are held twice a year and SUTs must align their  operational testing to coincide with the next available NIE. An event  driven-approach\u2014versus a schedule-driven approach\u2014is the preferred  method of test scheduling.

As a  result, the Army will likely have to work with a system that is less reliable  than originally envisioned, and develop a new life-cycle cost estimate that  reflects the added costs associated with the increased contractor support  to keep this less reliable system operating. In addition, ATEC officials  state that the negative impact of an individual system falling short of its  reliability target is magnified in the capability set. This approach can result  in fielded systems that do not provide adequate utility for soldiers and  require costly and time-consuming modification in theater as well as  additional testing.

Participation in later phases of the  agile process, and ultimately the participation in a NIE can cost the  contractor an estimated million dollars, depending on the system the  Army is evaluating. Because of the limited number of successfully  demonstrated SUEs that the Army has purchased to date, and the cost  associated with industry participation, there is concern that industry may  lose interest.

The Army  found that the processes for translating capability gaps into requirements,  identifying specific funding, and completing a competitive procurement  can be very time consuming and challenging.", "The Army is now developing a strategy to address these barriers. After  the NIE, if the Army decides to buy and field a SUE, the Army plans to  align that capability with a suitable existing requirement within an ongoing  program of record. The selected program manager would then identify  buying options for the capability, including the feasibility of using an  existing contract, and would determine whether (1) funding is available,  (2) the Army should identify the capability as an unfunded requirement, or  (3) the Army needs an above-threshold reprogramming action. The  program manager would also determine if the Army can buy and field the  capability in the capability set or identify what capability is achievable.  Army officials plan to implement this new strategy in the coming months.", "In cases where the Army cannot align the successful SUE with an  existing program of record, it could develop a new requirement for the  system. Army officials have indicated that in a small number of cases, the  Army could utilize a directed requirement. The Army generally develops  and approves directed requirements to fill urgent needs that the Army  believes should be fielded as soon as possible. This allows for essentially  bypassing the regular requirements processes, which require additional  time to complete.", "In addition to this strategy, the Army has developed a new NIE acquisition  plan that features an alternative means to buy successful SUEs rapidly.", "Under this new plan, the Army is using a combined sources sought notice  and a request for proposals approach to better shape requirements and  allow for buying SUEs in less time than under normal acquisition  processes. With two NIEs per year, the Army will continue to use a  sources sought notice to solicit government and industry solutions to  broadly defined capability gaps and will assess those solutions during a  NIE. Then, the Army will use lessons learned and soldier feedback from  the first NIE to validate and refine the requirement and issue a request for  proposal for participation in a future NIE. Using a request for proposal  differs from using sources sought notices because the request for  proposals approach culminates in the award of indefinite-delivery,  indefinite-quantity contracts for industry SUEs to participate in a future  NIE. Using an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract allows the  Army to place production orders for industry SUEs following the NIE. The  Army released the first request for proposals supporting a NIE on  December 20, 2012, to solicit vehicle tactical routers for NIE 14.1. Vehicle  tactical routers would allow users and systems located nearby to access  networks securely.", "For SUEs that already have a defined requirement, the Army plans to  issue a request for proposals for participation in one NIE, without using a  sources sought notice first. However, Army officials concede that a  defined requirement is not usually available prior to the NIE. In those  cases, the Army plans to continue issuing sources sought notices for  industry proposed solutions that the Army will evaluate during a NIE, as a  precursor to issuance of a request for proposals in the future.", "The Army expects to comply with current DOD acquisition policy when it  decides to buy systems that proceed through the agile process. However,  the Army may propose changes to existing policy and processes that  inhibit realization of the full benefits of the agile process.", "As the Army implements this strategy over the coming months, it will be  important to gather information on how well the strategy works and how  rapidly the Army can procure and field a SUE after its successful  demonstration during an NIE. At the same time, the Army will be in a  better position to determine how much of its constrained budget it can  devote to the procurement of SUEs. As recommended under internal  control standards, it will be important for the Army to establish specific  measures and indicators to monitor its performance and validate the  propriety and integrity of those performance measures and indicators.This type of information\u2014on how many SUEs the Army can buy and how  rapidly\u2014would be helpful for industry as it makes decisions on its future  participation in the NIE process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Begun to Define Network Outcome-based Performance Metrics", "paragraphs": ["In our initial report on the Army\u2019s tactical network, we concluded that it will  also be important for the Army to assess the cost effectiveness of   Moreover, to  individual initiatives before and during implementation.facilitate oversight, we concluded that it is important for the Army and  DOD to develop metrics to assess the actual contributions of the initial  capability set the Army will field in fiscal year 2013 and use the results to  inform future investments.", "According to a key DOD oversight official reporting on Army networks to  the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics,  DOD has started work to define quantifiable outcome-based performance  measures for the Army tactical network. In addition, both DOD and Army  officials indicated they are planning to develop a preferred end-to-end  performance projection for the Army tactical communications network and  intend to quantify the performance needed in terms of voice, data, and so  forth, and by network tier, sector, and subnet. Officials plan to define  levels of performance for benign and conflict environments and the  waveforms and radios soldiers will need for each tier as well as their  specific performance characteristics. Although this effort is in its early  stages, this DOD oversight official stated that it is expected that the NIE  will generate data on performance of the network as a whole, which could  then be compared to the expected performance demand.", "Separately, the Army is also beginning to prepare qualitative  assessments of the progress the Army is making in filling capability gaps  related to mission command essential capabilities. For example, ATEC  has prepared an integrated network assessment after each NIE, which  characterizes the level of capability achieved against the mission  command essential capabilities. In addition, the Army has prepared a  limited assessment of how capability set 13 will meet mission command  essential capabilities.", "Once the performance measures are in place and the Army evaluates the  delivered capabilities against those measures, the Army will have the  tools to evaluate the progress it is making and make any necessary  adjustments to its investment strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Additional Collaboration between Army and Test Community", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s network strategy features a variety of different approaches to  testing and evaluation to accommodate the rapid pace of technology  change and to reduce the cost and time of acquisition. The Army has  worked closely with the test community to plan, conduct, and evaluate the  NIEs. Also, as mentioned earlier, the test community has taken a number  of actions to reduce the costs of planning and executing the NIEs. At the  same time, the test community has been meeting its responsibility to  objectively report on the tests and the results. However, test results for  several network systems at the NIEs that did not meet operational and  other requirements will result in added time and expense to address  identified issues. An inherent value of testing is pointing out key  performance, reliability, and other issues that need to be addressed as  soon and as economically as possible, but not after fielding. DOT&E has  stated that the schedule-driven nature of the NIEs contribute to systems  moving to testing before they have met certain criteria.", "Tension between the acquisition and testing communities has been long- standing. In that regard, the Defense Acquisition Executive recently  chartered an independent team to assess concerns that the test  community\u2019 approach to testing drives undue requirements, excessive  cost, and added schedule into programs and results in a state of tension  between program offices and the testing community.", "One area the Defense Acquisition Executive assessment identified for  improvement was the relationship and interaction among the testing,  requirements, and program management communities. In that regard, the  memorandum reporting the results called attention to four specific issues  those communities need to address the need for closer coordination and cooperation among the  requirements, acquisition, and testing communities; need for well-defined testable requirements; alignment of acquisition strategies and test plans; and need to manage the tension between the communities.", "Concurrently, a systematic review of recent programs by DOT&E and  DT&E examined the extent to which testing increases costs and delays  programs. The results of both efforts indicated that testing and test  requirements by themselves do not generally cause major program  delays or increase costs. In addition, the Defense Acquisition Executive  found no significant evidence that the testing community typically drives  unplanned requirements.", "Further, according to the DOT&E fiscal year 2012 annual report, three  specific areas exist where increased test community interactions could  result in improved test outcomes, which can result in systems with  needed and useful combat capability being delivered to our forces more  quickly. These include developing mission-oriented metrics to evaluate each system within  the context within which it will operate; leveraging test and evaluation knowledge in setting requirements; and evaluating the multiple conditions in which the system is likely to be  operated.", "Additional opportunities exist for leadership of the Army and the test  community to work together to further improve NIE execution and results.  A good starting point would be for the Army to consider addressing the  test community observations and recommendations from previous NIEs.  Those included the schedule driven nature of NIEs, the lack of well- defined network requirements, and the lack of realistic battlefield  maintenance and logistical support operations for SUTs during the NIEs.  The Army is not required to and has not directly responded to the test  community about its NIE observations and recommendations.  Nevertheless, per internal control standards, managers are to, among  other things, promptly evaluate findings from audits and other reviews,  including those showing deficiencies and recommendations reported by  auditors and others who evaluate agencies\u2019 operations. In doing so, the  Army may not only improve NIE execution and results but also reduce the  tensions with the test community."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Within a sizable investment of an estimated $3 billion per year to  modernize its tactical network, the Army is investing over $150 million per  NIE to help ensure that those planned development and procurement  investments result in the expeditious delivery of increased capabilities to  the warfighter.", "The main product of the NIEs is knowledge. The Army has not  consistently recognized, accepted, and acted upon the knowledge gained  from the NIEs. On the one hand, the Army\u2019s fielding decisions to date  seem driven by a pre-determined schedule rather than operational test  results. Fielding individual systems that have done poorly during  operational tests carries risk of less than optimal performance with the  potential of costly fixes after fielding and increased operating and  sustainment costs. Moreover, performance and reliability issues of  individual systems could be magnified when these systems become part  of an integrated network. On the other hand, even with a new strategy for  procurement of emerging capabilities to fill capability gaps, the Army may  still face an expectation gap with industry. The current constrained budget  environment and the level of funding already allocated to ongoing network  acquisition programs, may leave little funding to procure new networking  technologies. Until it has clearly demonstrated the means to rapidly buy  and field emerging capabilities and provided this information to industry,  the Army may need to manage industry expectations of how many new  networking systems it can buy and how rapidly.", "The Army has implemented some lessons learned from planning and  executing the NIEs. However, as part of a knowledge-based approach to  its broader network modernization strategy, the Army should also be open  to consideration of observations from all sources to improve process  efficiency and achieve improved outcomes. We believe that the Army can  and should collaborate more extensively with the test community on a  variety of issues that could improve NIE outcomes. For example, as part  of its responsibility to objectively conduct tests and report on their results,  the test community has provided reports, observations, and  recommendations before and following NIEs.

In both cases, DOD states that processes are already in  place to address these issues and that the recommendations as written  take flexibility away from the Department. We disagree. Our findings  indicate that DOD is not using its current processes effectively to evaluate  a system\u2019s readiness to begin operational testing. While there may be  instances where the Army uses operational testing to obtain feedback on  system performance, DOD\u2019s system development best practices dictate  that a system should not proceed to operational testing until it has  completed developmental testing and corrected any identified problems.", "The NIEs are a good forum for the Army to generate knowledge on its  tactical network.  However, NIEs are a large investment and DOD and the  Army should strive to optimize their return on that investment.  Approving  network systems for operational testing at the NIEs after having poor  developmental test results may not be the best use of NIE resources  because of the strong correlation between poor developmental test  results and poor operational test results. Moreover, it is much more cost  effective to address performance and reliability issues as early as  possible in the system development cycle and well in advance of the  production and fielding phases.  As we note in the report, DOD and the  Army have been pursuing a schedule-based strategy for network  modernization rather than the preferred event-based strategy where  participation in a test event occurs after a system has satisfied certain  criteria.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Army provide results to  industry on how many successfully demonstrated systems under  evaluation have been procured to date and how long it has taken for the  procurements.  However, DOD did not offer specific steps it would take to  provide this information or a proposed timeframe.  Because of the  importance of continued industry participation in the development of the  Army network, we think that it is important for industry to have a clear  picture of the Army\u2019s success in rapidly buying and fielded emerging  technologies.  Finally, DOD concurred with our recommendation that the  Army collaborate with all network stakeholder organizations to identify  and correct issues that may result in improved network outcomes,  including addressing the observations and recommendations of the test  community related to the NIEs.  DOD states that a collaborative  environment with all stakeholders will assist in identifying and correcting  issues and that the forum for doing so is the semiannual Network  Synchronization Working Group.
