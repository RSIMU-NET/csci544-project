This concern was prompted mainly by two cases in which employers invested a large portion of the 401(k) plan assets in their companys\u2019 securities or real property.Subsequent business reversals then forced the employers into bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation. In one case, employees lost their jobs and almost all their pension benefits because the value of the employer\u2019s securities decreased significantly. The other case, involving real property, is still in bankruptcy liquidation, and the final effect on pension benefits is unknown.", "Concerns about the loss of jobs and retirement benefits prompted your office to ask us to (1) provide information on the extent to which 401(k) plan assets are invested in employer securities and real property, (2) examine the protection and any possible problems associated with the recent amendments to title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and (3) identify alternate mechanisms that might safeguard the retirement benefits of participants in 401(k) plans in which the employer decides how to invest assets.", "To determine the extent to which the assets of 401(k) plans were invested in employer securities and real property, we analyzed the Form 5500 database maintained by the Department of Labor\u2019s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA). Under ERISA, employers have to file a Form 5500 annually to report certain financial, participant, and actuarial data for each of their pension plans. We analyzed data for plan year 1993,which was the most recent year for which final plan-specific data were available for our review. To examine the protections provided by and any possible problems associated with the recent amendments to ERISA, we discussed the amendments with officials of the Departments of Labor and the Treasury developed a model to measure the extent of protection offered by a 10-percent limitation on the use of employee contributions to purchase employer securities and real property, and examined Form 5500 data. To determine what alternate mechanisms could be considered to safeguard plan participants in employer-directed 401(k) plans, we identified strategies that already are authorized by federal law and identified mechanisms that experts suggested. We performed our review in Washington, D.C., from November 1996 through September 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In a defined benefit plan, the employer determines the employee\u2019s retirement benefit amount using specific formulas that consider factors such as age at retirement, years of service, and salary levels. Employers are responsible for ensuring that sufficient funds are available to pay promised benefits. The amount an employer must contribute to a defined benefit plan varies from year to year depending on changes in factors such as workforce demographics or investment earnings. Employees covered by a defined benefit plan are also protected by a federal plan termination insurance program administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).", "In a defined contribution plan (also known as an individual account plan), the employer establishes an individual account for each eligible employee and generally promises to make a specified contribution to that account each year. Employee contributions are sometimes allowed or required. Each defined contribution plan specifies whether the plan participants, the employer, or both will make decisions about how the funds in the accounts are invested. Regardless of who makes the investment decisions in a defined contribution plan, the employer is not responsible for ensuring that a specified amount is available upon an employee\u2019s retirement. An employee\u2019s retirement benefit from such a plan depends on the total employer and employee contributions to the account as well as the investment returns that have accumulated in the account by the time the employee retires. In a defined contribution plan, the employee assumes the risk for the investments.", "Defined contribution plans include thrift savings plans, profit-sharing plans, and ESOPs. Such plans that allow employees to choose to contribute a portion of their pre-tax compensation to the plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code are generally referred to as 401(k) plans. Investment income earned on a 401(k) plan accumulates tax free until an individual withdraws the funds.", "Table 1 shows the number of plans, plan assets, and plan participants for 1993 for single-employer defined benefit and defined contribution plans.", "ERISA imposes certain requirements and restrictions on those who manage and administer private pension plans. These fiduciary rules apply to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans and require, among other things, that plans diversify their investments and, more specifically, invest no more than 10 percent of total plan assets in employer securities and real property. Currently, ERISA exempts 401(k) plans from the diversification requirement and the 10-percent limitation rule. Accordingly, 401(k) plans can invest in employer securities and real property generally without restriction. (See app. II for more details on federal fiduciary rules on investment of plan assets.)", "In August 1997, the Congress amended title I of ERISA to protect plan participants in 401(k) plans that require that employee contributions be invested in employer securities and real property. Section 1524 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which takes effect in 1999, will extend the ERISA 10-percent limitation rule on investments in employer securities and real property to that portion of these 401(k) plans consisting of employee contributions and the earnings thereon unless they meet one of three exemptions. A 401(k) plan is exempt if the fair market value of the assets of all the defined contribution plans the employer maintains is no more than 10 percent of the fair market value of the assets of all the employer\u2019s pension plans. A 401(k) plan is also exempt if it requires that not more than 1 percent of an employee\u2019s compensation be invested in employer securities and real property.

In this regard, 109 plans with 10,000 or more participants owned over $34 billion (nearly 65 percent) of the $53 billion of employer securities and real property owned by all 401(k) plans. These large plans also covered most of the participants in 401(k) plans that owned any employer securities or real property. Plans with more than 10,000 participants covered 57 percent of participants.

(See fig. 1.)", "Employer real property investments represented only $381 million (less than 1 percent) of the $53 billion in employer securities and real property owned by 401(k) plans. Eleven large 401(k) plans owned employer real property in 1993. Individual plan holdings ranged from a low of about $4,000 to approximately $340 million; however, two plans owned 96 percent of the employer real property. These two plans collectively owned about $365 million of employer real property, with separate holdings of $340 million and $25 million. For these two plans, employer real property represented 56 and 87 percent of their plan assets, respectively. For the other nine plans, employer real property generally represented 15 percent or less of total plan assets.", "One possible reason for the relatively low number of 401(k) plans that owned employer securities and real property is that many plans may not allow such investments. Periodically, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducts a survey of private nonfarm establishments with 100 or more workers and develops information on the types of investments that pension plans may make. BLS estimates that 49 percent of employees in thrift savings plans (which BLS officials said are a proxy for 401(k) plans) were in plans in 1993 that permitted ownership of employer securities.Another reason may be that many employers sponsoring 401(k) plans are too small to issue their own company securities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most 401(k) Plan Participants Directed Investment of Their Own Contributions", "paragraphs": ["Important to the issue of the need for protections for 401(k) plan investments are the number of 401(k) plans that are employer directed and the number of participants in those plans. In an employer-directed plan, the employer\u2014rather than the plan participant\u2014decides how to invest participant contributions as well as the company\u2019s own matching contributions, if any. In a participant-directed plan, the participant determines how to invest his or her contributions and may also determine how to invest the employer\u2019s matching contributions. Information on employer-directed plans is important because it indicates the maximum number of individuals with no control over the investment decisions affecting their 401(k) plan assets. These individuals may be vulnerable to their employers\u2019 investing significant amounts of their 401(k) plan assets in employer securities or real property.", "Form 5500 filings for 1993 indicate that about 35 percent of the 159,196 401(k) plans were employer directed.

In total, these plans had 1.4 million participants and $12.3 billion invested in employer securities and real property.", "About the same proportion of participant-directed plans invested in employer securities and real property. In total, 1,693 of 103,785 participant-directed plans (1.6 percent) owned this type of asset.

For the latest year for which data are available, fewer than 2,500 of the nearly 160,000 401(k) plans that filed Form 5500s reported that they owned employer securities and real property. In addition, most participants in 401(k) plans that owned employer securities and real property had participant-directed 401(k) plans that PWBA identified as supplemental to other pension plans the employer offered.", "Nonetheless, 756 401(k) plans had 1.4 million participants in 1993 in which the employer directed the investment of all plan assets. Participants in employer-directed 401(k) plans will always be somewhat vulnerable to investment decisions over which they have no control. However, beginning in 1999, the recently enacted section 1524 provisions in title I will prevent employer-directed plans that have more than 10 percent of employee contributions invested in employer securities and real property from investing more employee contributions in assets of this type.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter.

After subsequent discussions with the chairman\u2019s office, we agreed to address the following questions: (1) To what extent are 401(k) pension plan assets invested in employer securities and real property? (2) What potential problems may be associated with implementing and enforcing the title I amendments? and (3) What mechanisms could safeguard the retirement benefits of participants in employer-directed 401(k) plans that invest in employer securities and real property?", "To determine the extent to which the assets of single-employer defined benefit and defined contribution plans were invested in employer securities and real property, we analyzed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 5500 computerized database maintained by the Department of Labor\u2019s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA). Under ERISA, all private employers are required to annually report certain financial, participant, and actuarial data for each of their defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Our data analysis was limited to the most recent plan year (plan year 1993) for which final plan-specific data were available.", "The data we developed differ from that produced by PWBA and published in its Abstract of 1993 Form 5500 Annual Reports. Although PWBA\u2019s data are based on analyses of all large plans with 100 participants or more combined with a representative sample of 5 percent of small plan (fewer than 100 participants) filers, our report data are based on the analyses of data submitted by each large and small pension plan contained in the databases that PWBA provided for our review. In addition, we worked extensively with IRS to identify all known 401(k) plans in the Form 5500 database.", "We did not independently verify the accuracy of the research databases because IRS and PWBA check the data for accuracy and consistency. Importantly, the data we analyzed were accurate only to the extent that employers exercised appropriate care in completing their annual Form 5500 reports.", "To examine the protections provided by and any potential problems associated with the recent amendments to ERISA, we discussed the amendments with officials of the Departments of Labor and Treasury. We also developed a model to show the amount of employee contributions that could be invested in employer securities and real property assuming a 10-percent limitation on such investments and various changes in the value of employer securities and other investments. Finally, we determined whether available Form 5500 data were adequate to implement and enforce the new amendments.", "To determine what rules and other mechanisms could be considered to better protect plan participants in employer-directed 401(k) plans, we identified alternative strategies already authorized by federal law. In addition, we identified or learned about mechanisms suggested by experts that could be considered to protect pension plan assets\u2014and ultimately future retirement benefits\u2014of plan participants and their families. The organizations with whom we discussed these strategies are the American Association of Retired Persons; 401(k) Association; Profit Sharing/401(k) Council; ERISA Industry Committee; Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; Investment Company Institute; Employee Benefit Research Institute; and Financial Executives Institute as well as officials from the Department of the Treasury, IRS, and PWBA.

Under this broad general requirement, ERISA requires a fiduciary to observe the following rules:", "The \u201cexclusive purpose\u201d rule. The fiduciary must have an individual loyalty to participants and beneficiaries to provide benefits and defray reasonable expenses in administering the plan.", "The \u201cprudent man\u201d rule. The fiduciary must act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the prevailing circumstances that a prudent person, acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters, would use in the same sort of situation.", "The \u201cdiversification\u201d rule.

A fiduciary is barred from engaging in such transactions if he or she knows or should know that ERISA prohibits them. The types of transactions prohibited by ERISA are those involving an inherent conflict of interest between the plan and people associated with the plan (\u201cparties-in-interest\u201d).", "For example, ERISA prohibits fiduciaries from allowing a plan to engage in a transaction for selling or leasing any property; lending money or extending credit; furnishing goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party-in-interest; or transferring any plan assets to a party-in-interest. ERISA also prohibits fiduciaries from dealing with a plan\u2019s assets for their own personal interest and involving the plan in transactions with parties whose interests are adverse to the plan\u2019s participants or beneficiaries.", "Finally, ERISA has a rule that places a 10-percent limitation (10-percent limitation rule) on acquiring and holding qualified employer securities and qualified employer real property. The 10-percent limitation rule states that a plan may not acquire any qualified employer securities or real property if immediately after the acquisition the aggregate fair market value of such assets exceeds 10 percent of the fair market value of the plan\u2019s total assets.

Accordingly, fiduciary rules do not require defined contribution plans to diversify plan assets.
