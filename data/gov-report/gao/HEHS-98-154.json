By 1995, nearly three-quarters of those who received coverage through private, employer-based plans were enrolled in some form of managed care rather than in traditional fee-for-service plans. Many believe that, given this change, the protections under ERISA for those who have disputes over health care benefits should be reexamined.", "You expressed concern about how people enrolled in employer-based managed care plans are compensated when they are improperly denied health care benefits or when they experience negligent medical care\u2014medical malpractice\u2014and the role that ERISA plays.

We also reviewed law review articles and health, business, and other articles we found in professional journals and other publications. Collectively, these articles discussed ERISA, its remedies, and the implications for employers, plan participants, managed care plans, and health care providers. The bibliography at the end of this report lists the studies and the articles. In addition, we interviewed representatives of selected employer, consumer, managed health care plan, and health care provider groups, and the Department of Labor (DOL). In our study, we describe ERISA\u2019s effect on the remedies available for improper benefit denials and medical malpractice claims.

After several highly visible pension plan failures and abuses in the 1960s and early 1970s, the Congress enacted ERISA in 1974. Although it was established primarily as a pension law, ERISA also regulates welfare benefits\u2014including health care benefits\u2014that participants and their beneficiaries receive through employers.", "ERISA lays out the framework within which employer-based health benefit plans must operate. ERISA requires plans to (1) designate a named fiduciary to administer a plan in the sole interest of the participants, (2) provide pertinent documents and plan-related information to participants, and (3) file annual reports with DOL\u2014the federal agency responsible for overseeing ERISA\u2019s implementation. However, ERISA\u2019s regulatory requirements for employer-based health care plans are not nearly as comprehensive as are those for pension plans. ERISA\u2019s requirements do not focus solely on health care but apply to a variety of employer-based welfare benefit plans. Also, ERISA provides no financial or solvency standards to which employer-based health benefit plans must adhere.", "By enacting ERISA, the Congress created a federally administered regulatory scheme that applies, with some exceptions, to all employer-based pension and welfare benefit plans, including employer-based health plans. The Congress included a section in ERISA that states that ERISA supersedes, or preempts, all state laws that \u201crelate to\u201d an employee benefit plan. According to employer groups, this \u201cpreemption\u201d provision helps eliminate problems for multistate employers who could face conflicting and burdensome state statutes and regulations when they provide health benefits in more than one state.", "Because the states have traditionally been granted the power to regulate the business of insurance, the Congress \u201csaved\u201d insurance laws from ERISA\u2019s preemption provision. That is, ERISA cannot supersede a state insurance law. However, an employer-based health plan cannot be deemed to be a health insurer for the purposes of being regulated by state insurance laws under this \u201csavings\u201d clause.", "Employers who choose to provide health care benefits can do so in different ways. An employer can self-fund the coverage\u2014that is, assume the financial risk associated with health insurance. Because self-funded plans are not considered to be an insurance product, they are exempt from state insurance laws and are therefore regulated solely through ERISA. Alternatively, an employer can purchase a health insurance product directly from an established health insurer. State laws regulating health insurers are saved from preemption. Consequently, the states can regulate the insurance product that the ERISA plan purchases. For example, an insurance product purchased by an employer would have to cover all state-mandated health care benefits, but all those benefits would not have to be covered in a self-funded plan. Similarly, such a product would be subject to state law requirements for grievance and appeal procedures.", "The distinction between self-funded and purchased health plans does not apply to the remedies available under ERISA for benefit claims disputes under employee benefit plans. With respect to these remedies, ERISA does not distinguish between the disputed benefit\u2019s being provided through an employer-purchased plan or a self-funded plan. As the Supreme Court has found, ERISA preempts state law claims for compensatory damages that result from benefit denials because the state laws governing such claims \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans. Furthermore, under its preemption clause, ERISA may or may not supersede state tort laws that govern the kinds and amounts of compensation that may be available for health-care-related injuries.", "Most workers and their families in the private sector receive their health insurance coverage through employers. According to DOL statistics, about 125 million people receive health insurance through about 2.5 million employer-based health care plans covered by ERISA. While the exact number of people who receive health care through self-funded employer-based plans is unknown, several studies have estimated that approximately 40 percent of insured people are enrolled in self-funded plans, plans that are free from state insurance regulation.", "During the past decade, the number of people enrolled in employer-based managed health care plans has continued to increase. About 29 percent of those who received health insurance through an employer-based plan were enrolled in some type of managed care in 1988, according to KPMG Peat Marwick. Figure 1 shows that a far greater percentage of people who received health insurance through an employer in 1995 were enrolled in managed care plans than in fee-for-service, even compared with just 2 years earlier.

In the 1980s, employers in the private sector, who shoulder much of the health care costs, were becoming particularly attuned to the alarming speed at which these costs were rising. As cost growth continued at double-digit rates, employers began to search for more economical ways of providing health care benefits while maintaining or improving the quality of care. In their search, many employers began to turn away from traditional fee-for-service health care and look to managed care\u2014which, among other things, selectively contracts with providers and manages the use of services.

Health insurance became increasingly expensive, partly because participants had virtually an unlimited choice of health care providers with few controls on service use or costs. Traditional fee-for-service insurers paid the bills for covered services and typically did not become involved in medical treatment decisions. These insurers played primarily a financial role and left medical decision-making to physicians and hospitals. Under a traditional fee-for-service health insurance plan, (1) the attending physician usually decided when medical services were necessary, (2) the patient received the services, and (3) the insurer either paid or did not pay, depending on an independent retrospective review of the claim. Therefore, benefit disputes usually focused on whether the insurer would pay, not on whether services would be provided.", "Generally, managed health care attempts to contain costs by addressing both the price and quantity of health care services. Managed care plans attempt to ensure that services provided to plan enrollees are necessary, delivered efficiently, and priced appropriately. Managed care covers a broad spectrum of health care delivery arrangements and financing. Types of managed care plans include health maintenance organizations (HMO), preferred provider organizations (PPO), and point of service (POS) plans.HMOs\u2014the oldest form of managed care\u2014operate under several different models. For example, staff model HMOs employ health care providers directly and often serve only enrolled HMO patients at facilities owned by the HMOs.

Prospective UR adds a layer of review to the decision-making between attending physicians and their patients. In managing patient care, most managed care plans have adopted prospective UR procedures. Prospective UR determines whether the attending physician\u2019s proposed course of medical treatment and proposed service location are necessary based on clinical criteria.", "Managed care plans often assume the administrative function of making benefit determinations\u2014that is, determining whether a specific treatment or procedure is covered by the employer\u2019s plan. Plans may assume this function when employers contract with HMOs and other types of managed care to provide health care services for ERISA participants or when the plans administer employer-based ERISA self-funded plans.", "Prospective UR procedures vary among managed care plans. Plans differ in the services requiring prior authorization, the type of personnel making decisions, and the criteria used to determine medical necessity.Plan-based medical personnel such as physicians or nurses may be involved at different stages of the process and may exercise independent clinical judgment rather than relying exclusively on plan-specified criteria. However, they exercise this judgment for the purpose of determining plan coverage for the service in question. Such decisions are made independently from the decisions made by a patient\u2019s attending physician. (The attending physician and plan officials may discuss the plan\u2019s benefit coverage decision.) Figure 2 shows that compared with traditional fee-for-service care, the coverage decisions at managed care plans for some services are often made through a prospective UR process\u2014before the patient receives health care services.", "Ultimately, the health plan decides whether a particular service is covered based on the review conducted by its agents. A health plan\u2019s decision to deny coverage does not preclude the attending physician from providing treatment\u2014if the patient can obtain other funding to pay for it. Nonetheless, it may be that for financial or other reasons, the patient may not obtain the recommended service.

For example, the regulations contain no provisions for expedited appeals. Furthermore, there is no provision for an independent review of the plan participant\u2019s appeal.

Patients commonly expect that the medical care they receive is of reasonable quality. ERISA\u2019s preemption of the liability of health plans may remove a powerful incentive to provide high-quality service. An amendment to make it easier to hold managed care plans liable for injuries could cause plans to take more actions to avoid injuries, and the number of adverse outcomes could decrease.

The findings of a study conducted at New York hospitals and reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1991 showed that the number of negligent adverse outcomes was eight times the number of tort claims filed. Thus, as shown by this study, many individuals who are injured by medical negligence may not file a claim. Some contend that even when patients bring malpractice suits, the current liability system for resolving such claims is inefficient and ineffective. Many agree that in the current system, claims take a long time to be resolved, legal costs are high, and settlements and awards are unpredictable.

The appellate court concluded that complete preemption did not apply because the plaintiff\u2019s claims focused only on the quality of benefits received; the plaintiff was not alleging that benefits were withheld nor seeking either to enforce rights under the terms of the plan or to have the right to future benefits clarified.", "The court found a significant distinction between this case and Corcoran, the case discussed previously in which ERISA was held to preempt a malpractice claim based on the UR provider\u2019s determination\u2014contrary to the opinion of the plaintiff\u2019s physician\u2014that the plaintiff did not need hospitalization during her pregnancy. This court said that the UR provider in Corcoran, \u201cunlike the HMOs here, did not provide, arrange for, or supervise the doctors who provided the actual medical treatment for plan participants.\u201d", "Another recent appellate decision, this one from the Seventh Circuit, concluded that ERISA does not preempt a claim that the administrator of an employee health benefits plan is liable under state law for medical malpractice by a physician who is an agent of the plan. The plaintiff in Rice v. Panchal was treated by a preferred provider furnished by his health plan. He brought suit in state court against the doctor for malpractice and against the health plan on an agency theory: The health plan, the plaintiff claimed, was responsible for the medical malpractice by its preferred provider. On a motion by the health plan, the case was removed to federal district court under the doctrine of complete preemption.", "The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found in Panchal that there was no complete preemption of the claim against the health plan. The court acknowledged that complete preemption would be required if the plaintiff\u2019s state law claim could not be resolved without an interpretation of the contract\u2014the ERISA plan\u2014governed by federal law. In Panchal, the court said that resolving the question of whether the health plan is liable for the medical malpractice of the provider under state agency law does not require construing the ERISA plan; the issues, in this view, were whether the doctor was in fact an agent, whether he was authorized to act for the principal, and whether the injury would not have occurred but for the victim\u2019s reliance on the agency. Answering these questions does not involve the interpretation of the ERISA plan. (In the state proceeding, the plan would be free to raise ERISA preemption under section 514 as a defense.)", "ERISA has generally been found to preempt medical negligence claims where a managed care provider has acted merely as a payer for claims with respect to a health plan. In Butler v. Wu, the plaintiff brought a medical negligence claim against a physician and an HMO. The physician was neither an agent nor an employee of the HMO; he provided services to HMO members as an independent contractor. The HMO did not provide medical treatment itself.", "The district court granted the HMO\u2019s motion to dismiss the case against the HMO, based on ERISA preemption of state law claims. The court held that ERISA preempts state-law negligence claims against HMOs \u201cwhere, as in this case, the HMO is fulfilling a role closer to that of a traditional insurer than that of a direct provider of health care services.\u201d The court, examining the evolution of the health care industry, noted that the distinction between arranging and paying for health care services and providing such services directly may not always be so clear, and it reserved judgment concerning whether preemption would apply if it found that an HMO was directly providing medical care."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": ["Angelo, Susan. \u201cChoice Curbs, Doctor Links Fuel Managed Care Risks.\u201d National Underwriter (Property/Casualty/Employee Benefits), Vol. 98,  No. 44 (1994), pp. 10 and 36.", "Atkins, G.
