Managers' responses suggest that although some agencies are clearly showing signs of becoming high-performing organizations, others are not. The survey provides important information that agency leadership can use to build higher-performing organizations throughout government. GAO will continue to work with senior leadership in the individual agencies to help address the issues raised by their managers in responding to the survey. Congress has a vital role to play as well. As part of its confirmation, oversight, authorization, and appropriation responsibilities, Congress could use the information from GAO's survey, as well as information from agencies' performance plans and reports and GAO's January 2001 Performance and Accountability Series and High-Risk Series, to emphasize performance-based management and to underscore Congress' commitment to addressing long-standing challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the past decade, Congress has sought to encourage a greater focus  on results and improve federal management by enacting a results-oriented  statutory framework with the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 (GPRA) as its centerpiece.  Performance-based management, as  envisioned by GPRA, requires transforming organizational cultures to  improve decisionmaking, maximize performance, and assure  accountability.  This transformation is not an easy one and requires  investments of time and resources as well as sustained leadership  commitment and attention.  In that regard, our January 2001 Performance  and Accountability Series and High-Risk Series described the major  management challenges and program risks at major agencies.  Addressing  these challenges is central to agencies\u2019 effectively, efficiently, and  economically accomplishing their missions and achieving better results for  the benefit of the American people.", "At your request, in calendar year 2000, we surveyed a statistically  representative sample of managers and supervisors across the federal  government on their experiences with and perceptions about performance  and management issues as a follow-up to a survey we did in 1996-97 (1997  survey), when governmentwide implementation of GPRA was about to  begin.  In October 2000, as one part of our response to your request, we  reported to you on selected governmentwide results of our 2000 survey with comparisons to governmentwide results of our 1997 survey.  On the  basis of those results, we reported that managers\u2019 experiences and  perceptions as reflected in our 2000 survey indicated some positive  changes since our 1997 survey, but there were still many areas where such  changes had not occurred.", "In contrast to the sample for our 1997 survey, the sample for the 2000  survey allowed for individual agency analyses.

Our sample  included both Senior Executive Service (SES) and non-SES managers and  supervisors in General Schedule (GS), General Management (GM), or  equivalent schedules, at levels comparable to GS/GM-13 through career  SES.  Our overall response rate was about 70 percent of the resulting  eligible sample, ranging from 59 percent to 82 percent at the 28 agencies.", "The survey results are generalizable to the 28 departments and agencies.

An expanded description of the scope and methodology for  our 2000 survey is included in appendix I.  We conducted our work between  January 1999 and March 2001 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "It is important to keep in mind that the survey data included in this report  represent managers\u2019 views at a certain point in time.

On an individual agency basis, there  are no agencies that stand out as notable at the top of the range for  providing positive recognition to employees for helping the agency  accomplish its strategic goals.  The percentage of managers responding to a  great or very great extent at the 28 agencies ranged from 12 percent at FAA  to 52 percent at GSA.  Even at the top of the range, the percentage of  managers who reported that employees received such positive recognition  barely exceeded 50 percent at GSA and SBA.

(See fig. 2.)", "Governmentwide, few managers (31 percent) reported in 2000 that  employees in their agencies received positive recognition to a great or very  great extent for helping their agencies accomplish their strategic goals.   This was not a statistically significant change from the 26 percent reporting  this extent of positive recognition in 1997.  Because effective incentive  programs can help federal agencies maximize the results they achieve by  both reinforcing personal accountability for high performance and  motivating and rewarding employees, the results of our survey suggest that  in most cases agencies are missing opportunities to positively affect  program results through more widespread use of effective positive  recognition techniques."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accountability for Results and Necessary Decisionmaking Authority to Achieve Them", "paragraphs": ["Agencies need to create organizational cultures that involve employees and  empower them to improve operational and program performance while  ensuring accountability and fairness for those employees.

At only one agency\u2014OPM\u2014was the percentage of  managers reporting that they had the decisionmaking authority they  needed above 50 percent.  In fact, at 10 of the 28 agencies, only one-third or  less of managers responded that they had such decisionmaking authority.   (See fig. 4.)", "The differences reflected in managers\u2019 responses to our questions on  authority and accountability suggest that many agencies can better balance  accountability for results with the authority needed to help achieve agency  goals.  For managers at 27 agencies, the percentage reporting that they  were held accountable for results exceeded the percentage reporting that  they had the authority they needed.  At 16 of these 27 agencies, the  percentage by which being held accountable exceeded having the authority  needed was more than 20 percent.  At only one agency\u2014the Forest  Service\u2014were the percentages approximately equal.  However, they were  not very high, with the percentage of Forest Service managers responding  positively at 41 percent for authority and at 40 percent for accountability.", "Governmentwide, the differences between the level of accountability and  the level of authority managers perceived was great in both our 1997 and  2000 surveys.  In 2000, 63 percent of federal managers overall reported that  they were held accountable for program results but only 36 percent  reported that they had the decisionmaking authority they needed to help  their agencies accomplish their strategic goals.  These percentages were  not statistically significantly different than those from our 1997 survey,  when 55 percent of managers reported such accountability for results while  31 percent reported such decisionmaking authority,  We recently reported that several agencies have begun to use results- oriented performance agreements for their senior political and career  executives to define accountability for specific goals, monitor progress  during the year, and then contribute to performance evaluations.  Although  each agency developed and implemented agreements that reflected its  specific organizational priorities, structure, and culture, we identified  common emerging benefits from each agency\u2019s use of performance  agreements.  For example, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)  decentralized its management structure from 4 regions to 22 Veterans  Integrated Service Networks (VISN).  VHA gave each VISN substantial  operational autonomy and established performance goals in the  agreements to hold network and medical center directors accountable for  achieving performance improvements.

The sample was drawn from the March 1999 Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF)\u2014the most  recent version of the CPDF available when we began drawing our sample\u2014 using file designators indicating performance of managerial and  supervisory functions.", "The questionnaire was designed to obtain the observations and perceptions  of respondents on such results-oriented management topics as the  presence, use, and usefulness of performance measures; hindrances to  measuring and using performance information; agency climate;  information technology; program evaluation; and various aspects of the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA).  Most of the  items on the questionnaire were closed-ended\u2014that is, depending on the  particular item, respondents could choose one of two or more response  categories or rating the strength of their perception on a 5-point extent  scale ranging from \u201cto no extent\u201d to \u201cto a very great extent.\u201d  In most cases,  respondents also had an option of choosing the response category \u201cno  basis to judge/not applicable.\u201d", "About half of the items on the questionnaire were contained in a previous  survey that was conducted between November 1996 and January 1997 as  part of the work we did in response to a GPRA requirement that we report  on implementation of the act.  This previous survey, although done with a  smaller sample size of 1,300 managers, covered the same agencies as the  2000 survey, which was sent out between January and August, 2000.   Individuals who did not respond to the initial questionnaire were sent up to  two follow-up questionnaires.  In some cases, we contacted individuals by  telephone and faxed the questionnaire to them to expedite completion of  the survey.", "The current survey was designed to update and further elaborate on the  results of the previous survey.  Similar to the previous survey, the sample  was stratified by whether the manager or supervisor was Senior Executive  Service (SES) or non-SES.  The management levels covered General  Schedule (GS), General Management (GM), or equivalent schedules at  levels comparable to GS/GM-13 through career SES or equivalent levels of  executive service.  Stratification was also done by the 24 CFO Act agencies,  with an additional breakout of 4 selected agencies from their  departments\u2014Forest Service, Health Care Financing Administration,  Federal Aviation Administration, and Internal Revenue Service.  These four  agencies were selected on the basis of our previous work identifying them  as facing significant managerial challenges.", "The sample was also stratified to include special pay plans at some  agencies to improve our coverage of managers and supervisors working at  those agencies.  For example, Senior Foreign Service executives from the  State Department and the Agency for International Development were  included in the sample.  We included these special pay plan strata to ensure  at least a 90-percent coverage of all managers and supervisors at or  comparable to the GS/GM-13 through career SES level at the 28  departments and agencies we surveyed.  Finally, we added additional strata  to include a group of respondents who answered the previous survey and  who still worked in the same agency at the same management level at the  time of the 2000 survey.", "During the course of the survey, we deleted 212 persons from our sample  who had either retired, separated, died, or otherwise left the agency or had  some other reason that excluded them from the population of interest.  We  received useable questionnaires from 2,510 sample respondents, or about  70 percent of the remaining eligible sample.  The response rate across the  28 agencies ranged from 59 percent to 82 percent.", "We took several steps to check the quality of our survey data.  We reviewed  and edited the completed questionnaires, made internal consistency  checks on selected items, and checked the accuracy of data entry on a  sample of surveys.  We also followed up on a sample of nonrespondents to  assess whether their views differed from the views of those who returned  the survey.  We randomly selected a subsample of 136 persons across all  strata from that group of individuals who had not returned a completed  questionnaire a month or more after the last of 3 attempts were made to  elicit their participation in our survey.  We received 67 useable surveys  from this group.  In addition, there were 41 individuals who, when  contacted by telephone, refused to participate in the survey but were  willing to answer 3 key questions from the survey.  We included their  answers to the three questions in our analysis of nonrespondents on those  three questions.  We analyzed the responses of these groups on selected  items compared with the responses received from all other respondents.   Our analyses of selected items did not show a sufficient or consistent  degree of difference between survey nonrespondents and respondents,  and, thus, we included the responses of our subsample with all other  responses.", "Except where noted, percentages are based on all respondents returning  useable questionnaires.  The survey results are generalizable to the 28  departments and agencies we surveyed.  All reported percentages are  estimates that are based on the sample and are subject to some sampling  error as well as nonsampling error. In general, percentage estimates in this  report for the entire sample have confidence intervals ranging from about  \u00b12 to \u00b17 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence interval.  In other  words, if all CFO Act agency managers and supervisors in our population  had been surveyed, the chances are 95 out of 100 that the result obtained  would not differ from our sample estimate in the more extreme cases by  more than \u00b17 percent.  In the appendixes of this report comparing each  agency to the rest of government, confidence intervals for the reported  agency percentages and the rest of government percentages range from \u00b12  to \u00b116 percentage points.", "Because a complex sample design was used and different types of  statistical analyses are being done, the magnitude of sampling error will  vary across the particular groups or items being compared due to  differences in the underlying sample sizes and associated variances.   Consequently, in some instances, a difference of a certain magnitude may  be statistically significant.  In other instances, depending on the nature of  the comparison being made, a difference of equal or even greater  magnitude may not achieve statistical significance.  We note when  differences are significant at the .05 probability level between 1997 and  2000 governmentwide data throughout the report and between an agency\u2019s  data and data for the rest of government in appendices II through XXIX.
