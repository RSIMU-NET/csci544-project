To help meet the increased demand for these types of CBP services, since 2013, CBP has entered into public-private partnerships under RSP and DAP. The RSP allows partners to reimburse CBP for providing services that exceed CBP's normal operations, such as paying overtime for CBP personnel that provide services at ports of entry outside normal business hours. The DAP enables partners to donate property or provide funding for port of entry infrastructure improvements.", "The Cross-Border Trade Enhancement Act of 2016 included a provision for GAO to review the RSP and DAP.

For example, RSP applications undergo an initial review by CBP officials at the affected ports of entry before they are scored by an expert panel of CBP officials at headquarters. The panel evaluates RSP applications against seven criteria, such as impact on CBP operations. Similarly, DAP proposals are evaluated by CBP officials against seven operational and six technical criteria, such as real estate implications. Further, if the proposal involves real estate controlled by the General Services Administration (GSA), CBP and GSA officials collaborate on DAP selection decisions and project implementation. To administer the RSP and DAP, CBP has documented policies and procedures, such as standard operating procedures and implementation frameworks. For example, CBP uses a standard procedure to guide the process for RSP partners to request services and to provide reimbursement. For DAP projects, CBP, GSA (if applicable), and partners follow an implementation framework that includes a project planning and design phase.", "The number of public-private partnerships is increasing, and partnerships provide a variety of additional services and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry. From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, CBP selected over 100 partners for RSP agreements that could impact 112 ports of entry and other CBP-staffed locations, and the total number of RSP partnerships doubled from fiscal year 2016 to 2017. According to CBP, since partners began requesting reimbursable services in 2014, CBP has provided its partners nearly 370,000 officer overtime hours of services, which led to over $45 million in reimbursed funds. As a result, CBP inspected an additional 8 million travelers and over 1 million personal and commercial vehicles at ports of entry. Similar to the RSP, the number of DAP partnerships more than doubled from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and totals 16 projects that impact 13 ports of entry as of November 2017. The donations include improvements, such as the installation of new inspection booths and equipment and removal of traffic medians, and are intended to support over $150 million in infrastructure improvements.", "CBP uses various processes to monitor and evaluate its partnerships, but could benefit from establishing an evaluation plan to assess overall program performance. For example, CBP conducts regular audits of RSP records to help ensure that CBP bills and collects funds from its partners accurately, and uses guidance, such as the DAP Implementation Roadmap, to identify and monitor project milestones and tasks. However, as of November 2017, CBP had not developed an evaluation plan\u2014which could include, among other things, measurable objectives, performance criteria, and data collection plans\u2014to assess the overall performance of the RSP and DAP, consistent with Office of Management and Budget guidance and leading practices.

Within the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), CBP is the lead federal agency charged with a dual mission of  keeping terrorists and their weapons, criminals and their contraband, and  inadmissible aliens out of the country while facilitating the flow of  legitimate international travel and trade through the nation\u2019s POEs.  CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations is responsible for enforcing passenger  and cargo processing activities related to security, trade, immigration, and  agricultural inspection at the nation\u2019s POEs. In April 2016, the CBP  Human Resources Management Assistant Commissioner and Office of  Field Operations Deputy Assistant Commissioner testified before  Congress that the agency continues to face significant challenges in  meeting its staffing goals due to hiring and retention challenges;  meanwhile, the amount of international travel and trade to the United  States continues to increase. For example, from fiscal years 2014 to  2016, the number of international travelers entering the United States  increased about 4 percent, and the number of cargo containers entering  the country increased about 6 percent. Further, in 2015, CBP conducted  a study on its POEs that identified the need for $5 billion to meet its  infrastructure and technology requirements.", "Since 2013, CBP has entered into public-private partnerships with  stakeholders, such as port authorities or local municipalities that own or  manage the ports or private companies that conduct business through the  ports, under its Reimbursable Services Program (RSP) to cover CBP\u2019s  cost of providing certain services at POEs.

Some of this implementation variation  is documented in locally negotiated MOUs. For example, CBP\u2019s partner at  Miami International Airport in Florida relies on CBP to schedule RSP  overtime daily based on CBP expertise. CBP officials at the airport  developed their own software templates to plan, track, and manage CBP  officers for RSP overtime for a given amount of available overtime funding. At the Pharr land POE in Texas, CBP staff at the POE submit  recommended RSP overtime request proposals to the partner based on  local conditions, including staffing, and the partner decides whether to  submit a formal request to CBP. In all of these instances, RSP partners  and CBP Field Office and POE officials expressed satisfaction with their  more customized administration processes.", "CBP and its partners also noted some challenges to implementing RSP  and DAP agreements, but partners generally agreed that the program  benefits outweighed the challenges. For example, some DAP partners we  met with mentioned that navigating GSA requirements was difficult and  sometimes caused delays. GSA officials we met with noted that they are  educating partners on GSA building standards and the GSA approvals  process for donations, among other things, to help partners manage their  timelines and expectations. GSA officials noted that they are working with  CBP and partner officials to manage and learn from these early  implementation challenges.", "CBP, GSA, and DAP partners also acknowledged a lack of clarity about  which entity or entities are responsible for the long-term operations and  maintenance costs of DAP infrastructure projects, although CBP has  taken steps to address this issue. GSA pricing procedures dictate that  once a POE receives an improvement, it charges the customer (CBP) for  the additional operating costs, such as utilities. CBP officials  acknowledged that the long term sustainability of donations, specifically  the costs of operations, maintenance, and technology for infrastructure- based donations, needs to be addressed, and officials reported taking  initial steps. For example, once CBP and its partner complete the  planning of a project and GSA has calculated the project\u2019s estimated  operating expenses, the AFP office begins working with the CBP Office of  Facilities & Asset Management to budget for such costs with the goal of  reaching a mutually acceptable partnership for donations that will have  long-term sustainability.", "CBP officials noted that the agency cannot commit to funding that is not  guaranteed for the future. To mitigate budget uncertainty, CBP now  includes language in its MOU and Donations Acceptance Agreement  templates stating that upon project completion, the partner will be  responsible for all costs and expenses related to the operations and  maintenance of the donation until the federal government has the  available funding and resources to cover such costs. According to AFP  officials, CBP also makes efforts to educate its DAP partners on the  budgeting process and associated timeframes with project completion.", "CBP officials noted that the majority of projects are in the early stages of  development, and it will be years before the projects are complete.

In addition, all MOUs allow partners to submit ad-hoc requests  that partners make for services in advance. Most of these MOUs also  allow partners to make urgent requests for immediate services.", "In examining the MOUs, we found that 44 of the 54 MOUs, or 81 percent,  indicate that CBP and its partner meet at least quarterly to discuss how  the partnership is going. Further, CBP and some of its partners meet  more often. For example, CBP and its partners agreed to meet monthly in  accordance with 23 MOUs, while CBP and its partners agreed to meet  weekly according to 3 MOUs. All partners we interviewed that have  utilized their RSP agreements reported that maintaining strong  communication between CBP and the partner is important to  implementing the RSP agreements at the POEs. Appendix I has  additional information about each of the 54 current MOUs.", "Tables 6 and 7 provide the amount that partners reimbursed CBP for  overtime services, the total number of overtime hours that CBP officers  worked for each fiscal year from 2014 through 2017, and the total number  of travelers and vehicles that CBP officers inspected during RSP partner  requests for services from fiscal years 2014 through 2017 respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DAP Partnerships Provide for Infrastructure Improvements at POEs", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the RSP, the number of DAP partnerships more than doubled in  fiscal year 2017. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, CBP selected seven DAP  proposals. In fiscal year 2017, CBP selected 9 DAP proposals.  Combined, these 16 DAP projects affect 13 POEs.", "The donations that partners will provide CBP and GSA, as applicable,  include a variety of POE improvements such as the installation of new  inspection booths and equipment, removal of traffic medians, and new  cold inspection facilities, as well as smaller items such as a high-capacity  perforating machine, which reduces document processing time and  allows CBP officers to focus on more critical operational duties, among  other donations. According to CBP, these 16 donation proposals  combined are intended to support over $150 million in infrastructure  improvements at U.S. POEs. CBP also expects a variety of benefits from  these donations, including support for local and regional trade industries  and tourism, reductions in border wait times, and increased border  security and officer safety, among others. Table 8 provides information on  the scope and status of DAP projects that CBP and GSA have selected  since CBP established the DAP in fiscal year 2015.", "As noted in the table above, CBP has fully accepted six donations,  including the donation of a high capacity perforating machine to facilitate  the processing of titles and other documents at the Freeport Sea POE in  fiscal year 2016, the removal of traffic medians at the Ysleta Land POE,  and recurring luggage donations in fiscal year 2017. Figure 9 is a photo of  the high capacity perforating machine that CBP accepted at the Port of  Freeport Sea POE from its partner Red Hook Terminals in 2016.", "As mentioned above, once CBP selects an application for a new donation  partnership, CBP, GSA, if applicable, and partner officials negotiate the  terms of a MOU, which outlines intentions of the partnerships for projects  that require coordinated planning and development. CBP currently has  MOUs for 9 of its 16 DAP projects. The MOUs contain a variety of project- specific information, including the scope of the project, a list of documents  that CBP and GSA may request to determine whether the project is ready  for execution, and details on donor warranty and continuing financial  responsibility after CBP and GSA accepts the donation. As mentioned  previously, CBP classifies donations under the DAP into two categories:  small-scale donations, which are reviewed on an expedited basis, and  large-scale donations. For example, the Salvation Army\u2019s recurring  donation of six to nine pieces of luggage per year to support Office of  Field Operations canine training activities is a small-scale donation.  Large-scale donations are donations with an estimated value of $5 million  or more and are moderate to significant in size, scope, and complexity.  For example, the City of Laredo\u2019s donation for construction of four  additional commercial vehicle lanes and booths, roadways and  infrastructure, and exit booths and related technologies is a large-scale  donation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP Uses Various Processes to Monitor and Evaluate Its Partnerships, but Could Benefit from Establishing an Evaluation Plan to Assess Overall Program Performance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CBP Has Various Processes to Monitor and Evaluate the Implementation and Benefits of Its Public- Private Partnership Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "RSP Audits, Metric Reports, and Partner Satisfaction Surveys", "paragraphs": ["Given that partner requests for RSP services are predominately for the  purposes of CBP officer overtime, CBP primarily monitors the RSP  through audits. Specifically, CBP conducts regular audits using  information from its Service Request Portal, its overtime management  system, and its internal accounting system to ensure partners  appropriately reimburse CBP for the overtime services officers provide  under the RSP. Figure 10 describes how and when CBP uses these tools  to conduct audits as part of the RSP request, fulfillment, and billing  processes.", "As noted previously, CBP officers who work RSP overtime enter  information from the Service Request Portal, such as the partner code  and POE code, into CBP\u2019s overtime management system for the actual  hours that the officer worked to complete the request. At the end of every  shift, CBP supervisors review and approve the information entered into  the overtime management system, which contains the information needed  for CBP to bill its RSP partner for the services that it performed, such as  the number of hours each CBP officer worked to fulfill RSP requests and  the salary and benefits information for those officers. POE supervisors  then update the Service Request Portal records so that they reflect what  CBP officers actually worked. On Mondays, AFP officials and CBP POE  supervisors conduct concurrent audits of weekly overtime management  system reports and reconcile these data with the information from the  Service Request Portal to ensure that CBP will bill the partner  appropriately. At the end of two pay period cycles, or every 28 days,  officials at CBP\u2019s National Finance Center review the payroll and benefits  information that was uploaded from the overtime management system  into CBP\u2019s financial management system to confirm that it matches the  appropriate partner code. This ensures that the correct partner is billed for  the reimbursable services that CBP provided.", "Generally, CBP and partner officials we met with did not have any  problems with the billing and payment process, and CBP officials noted  that any discrepancies in the billing information between the Service  Request Portal, the overtime management system, or the financial  accounting system, such as the partner code or the number of hours that  CBP officers worked, are usually identified and corrected during the  weekly audits. Further, in October 2017, we received a demonstration of  how partners and CBP manage requests for services in the Service  Request Portal, how CBP officers and supervisors at the POEs enter and  review overtime information, and how CBP runs reports in its financial  accounting system during the audit process. In addition, we conducted a  test of the data from the overtime management system and the billing  information from the financial accounting system for a selection of  partners across eight pay periods from fiscal years 2014 through 2017 to  determine if CBP billed its partners appropriately. Specifically, for each of  the eight selected pay periods, we randomly selected one RSP partner  from the universe of partners who used RSP services during the period.  We then compared the number of RSP overtime hours logged in CBP\u2019s  overtime management system for the selected partners and pay periods  with the number of hours on the corresponding partner bills. In all eight  cases, the amount of RSP overtime hours logged by CBP officials  matched the overtime hours billed to the partners. Our observations,  review of applicable documentation, and testing provided reasonable  assurance that CBP is being appropriately reimbursed by partners for the  services that it provided under the RSP.", "To evaluate the benefits of RSP services, the AFP office develops metrics  reports on the services that CBP performed while fulfilling RSP requests  throughout the billing cycle that it provides its partners. These metrics  reports include data, such as the number of overtime hours CBP officers  worked, the number of travelers CBP processed, the number of  containers CBP inspected, and the average wait times CBP recorded  during RSP overtime services, among other data. According to AFP  officials, this information about the impact of reimbursable services helps  partners make informed decisions when assessing their future requests.  The AFP office works with partners to ensure that the information CBP  provides in these reports is useful and will provide additional data upon  the partners\u2019 request, as applicable.", "CBP also conducts annual RSP partner satisfaction surveys to obtain  feedback and evaluate overall satisfaction with program implementation.  In 2015 and 2016, RSP partners expressed high levels of satisfaction  about the level of services CBP provided, the request and fulfilment  process, the billing and payment process, the monthly and annual metrics  reports that CBP provides its partners, and the program\u2019s ability to meet  partner goals. Additionally, partners generally responded that the program  allowed them to achieve their goals, which primarily focused on reducing  wait times and increasing their own customer satisfaction levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Monitoring and Evaluation of DAP Implementation and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["CBP has guidance that it follows to monitor and evaluate the  implementation of DAP projects, and CBP and its partners use tools such  as implementation roadmaps and other policy documents, such as  standard operating procedures, to administer and monitor the progress of  DAP projects at the POEs. For example, CBP develops project roadmaps  for all donation projects in close collaboration with its partner, GSA (as  applicable), and other entities involved in the project, and shares them  with project participants. The roadmap identifies a variety of project  milestones and tasks, such as drafting the MOU and completing the  technical requirements package, among other things. The roadmap also  tracks the number of days that CBP expects will be required to complete  each task, which helps CBP to ensure that all stakeholders meet project  milestones.", "CBP also monitors overall DAP implementation by collecting quantitative  data on the efficiency of DAP processes to inform program and process  improvements. For example, from 2015 to 2016, CBP consolidated  certain elements of its application evaluation process to reduce the  number of days it takes to evaluate and approve applications from an  average of 144 days to 75 days for large-scale donations. Similarly, from  2015 to 2016, CBP determined that it could gain efficiencies by  establishing a separate application evaluation and approval process for  small-scale donation applications to better accommodate small-scale  donations, and delegated approval and acceptance authority to the Office  of Field Operations Executive Assistant Commissioner. This new  process expedited the proposal evaluation timeline for small-scale  donations from approximately 27 days to 14 days. In addition, GSA  implemented a similar delegation authority for approval and acceptance  of small-scale donations in fiscal year 2017, which decreased GSA\u2019s  application evaluation process from approximately 57 days to 25 days  from fiscal year 2016 to 2017.", "In addition to monitoring the implementation of the overall program and  the progress of specific DAP projects, CBP works with its partners to  evaluate the benefits of each project. Specifically, during the planning and  development phase of a donation, AFP officials coordinate with local CBP  officials and DAP partners to develop a plan for identifying, measuring,  and reporting on the local benefits to be derived from accepted donations  upon project completion. CBP has completed its evaluation of the benefits  of one completed small-scale project. For example, CBP estimated that  the donated perforating machine at the Freeport Sea POE will save CBP  166 officer hours and approximately $7,450 in salary and maintenance  costs per year. For large-scale projects, CBP is working with its partners  to develop these evaluation plans, but it is too early for CBP to evaluate  the benefits given that most of these projects are in the early planning  and development phases. CBP shares its findings on benefits with its  partners to help them assess their return on investment and so that they  can share that information with their own local stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Is Taking Steps to Plan for the Expansion of Its RSP and DAP, but Could Benefit from Establishing an Evaluation Plan to Assess Overall Program Performance", "paragraphs": ["CBP is taking steps to monitor the existing use and impacts of RSP and  DAP and to plan for further expansion of these programs. For example, in  addition to the monthly metrics reports that CBP provides its RSP  partners, AFP officials told us that they monitor the fulfillment rates of  formal partner requests for RSP services. The current fulfillment rate  across all of CBP\u2019s RSP agreements is over 99 percent. In addition, as  noted previously, AFP officials coordinate with local CBP officials and  DAP partners to develop a plan for identifying, measuring, and reporting  on the local benefits to be derived from accepted donations upon project  completion. Furthermore, with regard to planning for future program  expansion, CBP has taken steps to plan for the additional oversight  activities that it expects at the headquarters level as the RSP expands.  For example, CBP is hiring new staff members and contractors for the  AFP office, as well as reimbursing the Office of Finance for one staff  position and embedding one staff member in the Budget Office to help  complete the increased number of financial transactions and audits. In  addition, the AFP office is considering the future impact of DAP projects  on staffing and other resources at the affected POEs, and is working with  Field Office, POE, and partner officials to identify and budget for  anticipated operational needs, with assistance from CBP\u2019s Workload  Staffing Model and Planning, Program Analysis and Evaluation offices.", "These efforts to monitor and evaluate the impacts of the programs and  plan for further expansion are positive steps that should help position  CBP to manage anticipated increases in the number of agreements going  forward. Furthermore, prior to Sections 481 and 482 authorities, in  accordance with the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee  accompanying the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act,  2013, CBP submitted semiannual reports to Congress on its Section 560 partnerships for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. CBP included  information in these reports on the benefits of RSP services. For  example, CBP compared baseline traveler and vehicle volume and wait  times at participating POEs from previous years to the traveler and  vehicle volume and wait times during time periods when CBP provided  reimbursable services.", "Subsequently, in accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2014, CBP developed an evaluation plan with objectives, criteria,  evaluation methodologies, and data collection plans to be used to  evaluate RSP and DAP performance on an annual and aggregated  basis. However, the provision requiring that an evaluation plan be  established for the section 559 pilot program was repealed by the Cross- Border Trade Enhancement Act of 2016. This Act requires that CBP  report to Congress annually to identify the activities undertaken and the  agreements entered into under the RSP and DAP but does not require  that CBP develop or report on an evaluation plan for these programs.  As of November 2017, CBP had not decided whether it will use a  performance evaluation plan going forward. However, in December 2017,  AFP officials acknowledged that such a plan\u2014that examines RSP and  DAP performance at the programmatic level\u2014could benefit program  management and augment evaluation activities already conducted by the  AFP office. We reviewed draft versions of CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2017 reports  to Congress on new Section 481 fee agreements and new Section 482  donation agreements. Both reports detailed how CBP responded to  changes in legislative authorities for the RSP and DAP and listed its fiscal  year 2017 selections for public-private partnership agreements, but did  not include an evaluation plan or identify measures for tracking program  performance going forward.", "Further, while the AFP office tracks the fulfillment rates of requests for  RSP services and is working with its partners and other CBP components  to monitor and plan for program expansion, CBP could benefit from a  more robust assessment of possible impacts of staffing challenges on  program expansion. As mentioned above, as of fiscal year 2017, CBP  has an overall staffing shortage of 2,516 officers, according to CBP\u2019s  Workload Staffing Model analysis, and CBP officer hiring remains an  agency-wide challenge. We identified some staffing challenges that could  affect CBP\u2019s management and implementation of its RSP and DAP  programs, which roughly doubled in the number of agreements from fiscal  year 2016 to 2017. As of November 2017, public-private partnership  agreements were in place at approximately one-third of all U.S. POEs.  With the removal of the limit on the number of air agreements that CBP  can enter each year, some POEs have or are anticipated by CBP to have  more than one RSP agreement in place. According to AFP officials, if  there are multiple RSP partnerships at the same POE, CBP will try to  accommodate all partner requests. Generally, the AFP office expects the  POEs to handle requests on a first-come, first-serve basis. As the number  of RSP partners increase across POEs, requests for services are likely to  also increase, according to CBP officials. While it is too soon for CBP to  assess the extent to which fulfillment rates may change over time, if at all,  with the expansion of the program, officials noted that RSP agreements  do not guarantee that CBP will be able provide all services that partners  request, and that RSP services are above and beyond what CBP would  normally provide. According to CBP, the recent increase in the mandated  cap on officer overtime pay from $35,000 to $45,000 has allowed CBP  officers to work more RSP overtime. Nevertheless, it is unclear how  CBP will evaluate and address any increase in RSP agreements that may  outpace the staff available to fulfill service requests.", "As noted previously, new authorities for the RSP also allow CBP to enter  into agreements that allow partners to reimburse CBP for up to five  additional officers, above the number assigned at the time the agreement  was reached, at small airports. In fiscal year 2017, CBP selected four  partners for this type of reimbursable services agreement. For its  agreement with the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, CBP relocated  three officers from the Boston-Logan International Airport, one of the  busiest U.S. international airports, to T.F. Green State International  Airport, which inspects less than 100,000 international travelers annually.  AFP officials noted that, in accordance with legislation, the Port Director  overseeing the port of origin for the CBP officer(s) added to small airports  must determine that the movement of the officer(s) from one POE to  another in fulfilling RSP agreements for additional CBP officers does not  permanently affect operations at any other POE, including the POE that  the officer(s) depart. However, CBP has not planned for how individual  POEs or the agency more broadly would make these determinations or  how CBP would evaluate any longer term impacts on overall CBP officer  staffing resulting from the movement of officers among POEs.", "Office of Management and Budget guidance for making program  expansion decisions indicates that agencies should evaluate cost- effectiveness in a manner that presents facts and supporting details  among competing alternatives, including relative costs, benefits, and  performance tradeoffs. Further, in September 2016 we developed a list  of leading practices for evaluation based on the American Evaluation  Association\u2019s An Evaluation Roadmap for a More Effective Government,  including development of an evaluation plan or agenda, a description of  methods and data sources in evaluation reports, procedures for assuring  evaluation quality, and tracking the use of evaluation findings in  management or reforms, among others. CBP is taking steps to monitor  its RSP and DAP and plan for program expansion. However, given its  staffing challenges, CBP could benefit from developing and implementing  an evaluation plan for assessing overall RSP and DAP performance.  Such a plan could further integrate evaluation activities into program  management and could better position CBP to assess relative costs,  benefits, and performance trade-offs as CBP expands its RSP and DAP,  and consider the extent to which any future program changes may be  needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The amount of legitimate travel and trade entering through the nation\u2019s  POEs continues to increase each year.

However, given CBP\u2019s officer hiring  and retention challenges and its finite resources for addressing  infrastructure needs at POEs, CBP\u2019s ability to monitor and evaluate the  implementation of its public-private partnership programs is essential to  ensuring that CBP leaders have the information that they need to make  program decisions and identify and respond to challenges as the  programs expand. As CBP continues to expand its public-private  partnership programs, evaluating the RSP and DAP at the program level  could better position CBP leaders to assess the relative costs, benefits,  and performance trade-offs of continuing to expand the programs.
