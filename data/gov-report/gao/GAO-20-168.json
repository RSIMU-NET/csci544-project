Specifically, SBA's current Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan lacks an in-depth discussion of risks (including extended power and communications outages) that could affect its disaster response. SBA's disaster response includes deploying staff to and establishing centers in disaster areas to accept loan applications. The aftermath of the 2017 hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, and Maria) illustrates how the risks affected SBA's disaster loan operations. For example, because of widespread power outages (particularly in Puerto Rico), loan applicants often could not submit applications electronically and SBA often could not call or e-mail applicants. As a result, SBA may not be adequately prepared to respond to challenges that arise during its disaster response efforts.", "Changes SBA made to the loan application process since 2005 (such as implementing electronic applications) improved timeliness. For the 2017 hurricanes, SBA processed more than 90 percent of all loan applications (including those quickly declined or withdrawn) within its 45-day goal, averaging less than 18 days for each hurricane. Overall, about 49 percent of applications submitted after the 2017 hurricanes were approved (see figure). Applicants and others with whom GAO spoke noted some application challenges, including frequent changes to SBA contact staff and having to resend documents. According to SBA officials, staff changes resulted from turnover, among other reasons. Many applicants in Puerto Rico also encountered translation challenges during interactions with SBA.", "SBA has no plans to evaluate its Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program, a loan guarantee program that began in October 2017 and is set to expire on September 30, 2020, and is intended to offer small businesses quicker funding after disasters. As of September 2019, SBA had received 93 applications, but most of them were incomplete and SBA had guaranteed only two loans. The Office of Capital Access, which manages the pilot, had not sought feedback from lenders on why so few loans had been made. Without evaluating program design and implementation, SBA's ability to make an informed decision on the program's future, including assessing potential demand for bridge loans, is limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to SBA, including that it more comprehensively document risks and plans to mitigate these risks and evaluate the implementation of the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program.

Additionally, 11 applicants reported that follow-up requests  from SBA for additional documentation delayed processing, added  confusion, or led some to withdraw their applications.", "According to the results of a 2018 customer satisfaction survey  conducted for SBA, the satisfaction of business loan applicants with  the disaster loan application process had decreased by 9 percentage  points since the previous survey in 2017.

Although more documentation is requested for business loans than for  home loans, the officials believe the information requested from  business applicants is similar to information requested from  individuals applying for a loan at a commercial bank. In response to  previous recommendations we made, SBA recently has taken steps to  streamline the application process by improving accessibility and  consistency of loan-related information and requirements in paper and  electronic resources. For example, SBA added a list of frequently  asked questions to its Disaster Loan Application Portal with a list of  documents required to file an application. The paper applications for  both home and business loans list potential additional documents that  SBA may request as well as when they may be required.", "Officials from all three SBDCs in Puerto Rico told us that applicants in  Puerto Rico particularly had difficulty accessing tax documentation in  a timely manner. SBA has an automated process to request and  obtain tax transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service for final  approval of loans. However, in Puerto Rico SBA must use a manual  process with the Departamento de Hacienda (Puerto Rican taxing  authority). Further delays occurred due to widespread physical  damage to infrastructure, including the Departamento de Hacienda.  As a result, SBA permitted applicants in Puerto Rico to postpone  submitting tax documentation until later in the application process.  Instead of submitting tax documentation during the loan decision  process, SBA allowed applicants to submit such documentation  during conditional commitment (the point at which SBA\u2019s  recommendation for loan approval is contingent on the applicant  submitting additional required documents). In addition, ODA co- located loan officers with staff from the commitments department to  facilitate prompt access to the tax transcripts they were awaiting from  the Departamento de Hacienda.", "Meeting flood insurance requirements. Officials from two Florida  entities told us many of the small businesses with which they worked  had problems submitting insurance documentation as part of their  application. Officials from one SBDC in Puerto Rico told us they had a  client who was unable to obtain flood insurance. By law, SBA requires  borrowers whose damaged or collateral property is located in a  special flood hazard area to obtain and maintain appropriate flood  insurance for the term of the loan.", "Delays also occurred as a result of miscommunication between SBA  and loan applicants about flood insurance requirements, according to  an applicant we interviewed. That business owner told us that when  he submitted a disaster loan application for physical and economic  injury damages, SBA informed him the insurance requirements  applied only to the physical damage portion of the loan. However,  SBA later told the individual that insurance coverage was necessary  for the entire loan, not just physical damages.", "Frequent changes in loan officers or case managers. More than  two-thirds (17 of 24) of the business owners we interviewed and  officials at four of the nine SBDCs told us they (or their clients) worked  with more than one case manager or loan officer during the loan  application process. Two small business owners said they had  interacted with as many as nine. These changes led to the applicants  having to repeat or resubmit information. In addition, they  sometimes received different answers to questions when a new loan  officer or case manager was assigned.", "SBA officials told us that SBA does not track the extent to which  applicants work with multiple loan officers and case managers but that  applicants should generally have only one of each. According to SBA  officials, one loan officer is typically assigned to an application until a  loan decision is made. Once a loan is approved, one case manager is  assigned until the loan is fully disbursed. However, according to  SBA officials, an applicant may interact with more than one loan  officer and case manager for reasons such as staff turnover and staff  downsizing. In addition, whenever an applicant requests  reconsideration of a declined application, the application is to be  assigned to a new loan officer for processing. According to SBA  officials, a newly assigned loan officer or case manager should be  able to use DCMS to access an applicant\u2019s loan file, including records  of past communication between prior loan officers and the applicant,  loss verification reports, and previously submitted documents. When  an applicant electronically submits a document through the web  portal, ODA scans and uploads it into DCMS (typically in 24\u201348  hours), at which point it is viewable in DCMS. The officials explained  that document storage methods in DCMS are uniform, which should  minimize the possibility of documents being improperly stored.", "Poor customer service and translation issues. Five of the  applicants (of 24) and officials from four entities we interviewed said  disaster loan applicants perceived a lack of SBA responsiveness after  submitting their applications. Staff from two of the entities attributed  this lack of responsiveness to SBA having an inadequate amount of  staff to handle the number of applications. SBA officials indicated that  Processing and Disbursement Center staff strive to contact each  applicant within 3 days of assigning a loan officer and within 5 days of  assigning a case manager. They also stated the center should contact  each applicant at least every 30 days using whatever available forms  of communication, including mail, email, and telephone. But two  applicants told us they only heard from their case manager after the  applicant initiated the contact. Nine applicants also stated that when  they did talk to their loan officer or case manager that person was not  very helpful. For example, officials from one SBDC told us they talked  to some loan officers on behalf of their clients and those loan officers  were not able to clarify what documentation their clients needed to  provide to SBA to complete their applications.", "One Puerto Rican applicant and officials from all three Puerto Rican  SBDCs told us that applicants in Puerto Rico faced translation issues.  They believed SBA had insufficient staff who spoke Spanish, which  made it difficult to communicate with applicants regarding status  updates and requests for additional documentation. The SBA OIG  reported that SBA officials estimated that some disaster survivors  waited more than 45 minutes for an interpreter or experienced  dropped calls. In addition, officials from one Puerto Rican SBDC told  us SBA only would accept official responses in English and believed  that many applicants were denied in part because the documents with  applicants\u2019 personal and financial information were in Spanish. The  SBDC officials were told only an SBA translator could translate official  documentation between SBA and applicants from English to Spanish.  According to SBA officials, they tried to hire as many Spanish- speaking staff as possible and relied on a contractor to provide  interpretation services during telephone communications with  applicants. But the volume of calls was higher than anticipated,  resulting in long wait times and many lost telephone connections.  Following Hurricane Maria, SBA replaced the contractor with three  new language service providers, which SBA used during its response  to Hurricanes Florence and Michael in 2018.", "Disbursement delays. Eight business disaster loan applicants and  officials from three SBDCs told us that applicants experienced delays  receiving disbursements after their initial disbursement. Although  applicants said they received initial disbursements within expected  time frames, subsequent disbursements took longer than anticipated.  For example, three small business owners told us it took more than a  year from the time they applied to receive their full loan disbursement,  and two others had to contact their federal representative to help get  their disbursements because of delays. SBA data show that after the  2017 hurricanes it took, on average, about 141 days after applying for  a loan for businesses to receive their full disbursement, including an  average of 63 days from closing to final disbursement.", "Similarly, business respondents to the 2018 customer satisfaction  survey conducted for SBA expressed concerns about the timeliness of  disbursements following loan closing. The lowest-rated aspect of the  loan closing process was \u201ctimeliness of receiving loan funds after the  closing was complete.\u201d As a result, the firm that conducted the survey  recommended that SBA examine data on the timing of loan  disbursements over the past several years, determine whether the  timing had changed significantly, determine the root causes of any  notable changes, and develop plans to address any root causes.", "SBA guidance requires approved borrowers to arrange for and obtain  all loan funds within 6 months from the date of the loan authorization  and agreement. However, SBA may extend the time frame on a case- by-case basis for ongoing projects. According to SBA officials, there  are no timeliness goals for subsequent disbursements because the  time frame for receiving further disbursements is contingent on the  borrower\u2019s ability to meet insurance requirements, secure a contractor  to repair damages, and submit receipts to SBA. SBA also has  improved features within the web portal so that borrowers can now  use direct deposit to receive disbursements and commence repairs  more quickly.

SBA officials  said they were initially unaware of loan closing requirements unique to  Puerto Rico, which led to processing delays. They told us that  secured loans must be signed by a notary, who in Puerto Rico must  be a Puerto Rican-licensed attorney. As a result, SBA had to hire  additional locally licensed attorneys and devote resources toward  training attorneys and other staff involved in processing and closing  loans in Puerto Rico, a process hampered by the previously  discussed hiring challenges for the 2017 hurricanes.

SBA officials do not currently plan to evaluate the program or  determine why so few loans have been issued. SBA officials explained  that the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program\u2019s performance during the  2019 hurricane season would determine whether SBA would continue or  terminate the program after its pilot period. When SBA announced the  pilot, SBA stated it planned to evaluate the program using three principal  measures: (1) the number of small businesses served, (2) the percentage  of loans made that were paid off or down using lower fixed-rate disaster  loans versus those held to term, and (3) the default rate on Express  Bridge Loans compared to regular SBA Express loans of similar size in  the 7(a) portfolio. SBA officials told us they were not planning to conduct  an evaluation because only two loans had been made, which the officials  believe is not a large enough sample size to conduct a meaningful  evaluation of the program.", "Although SBA has guaranteed only two loans issued under the Express  Bridge Loan Pilot Program, the program received 93 applications.

However, SBA sought feedback from lenders on  prior efforts to develop a bridge loan program. SBA officials told us that  lenders commented on a prior proposal for a bridge loan pilot (the  Immediate Disaster Assistance Program) and indicated that private  lenders were not interested in participating in such a pilot because they  considered disaster relief to be a governmental responsibility.  Additionally, SBA officials told us during our previous work looking at the  Immediate Disaster Assistance Program that they performed initial  outreach to lenders\u2014such as those who participated in SBA\u2019s Gulf  Opportunity Pilot Loan Program in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita\u2014to obtain their reaction to and interest in the program.", "The current pilot provides a similar opportunity to obtain feedback from  lenders on loan terms that could affect their willingness to participate in  this or a potentially redesigned program.

Additional  feedback, such as from lenders, could help SBA determine if design  changes are warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interviews with Affected Small Business Owners and Use of Florida\u2019s Bridge Loan Program Indicate Demand for Bridge Financing", "paragraphs": ["The very low level of loans guaranteed under SBA\u2019s bridge loan pilot  contrasts with the desire for such loans indicated by our interviewees and  the experience of the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan  program. We interviewed small business owners and those who work  with small businesses. Almost two-thirds of all the entities (16 of 26) we  interviewed and six small business owners told us that businesses  needed immediate financial support after a disaster (for example, to help  remove debris, make repairs, and replace inventory). Although many  businesses ultimately receive insurance payments to help cover losses,  the payments may not be received for several months. Representatives  from one municipality told us a lot of people, including the city itself, still  were awaiting their insurance payments more than a year after the  disaster. To help fund their immediate recovery, small business owners  with whom we talked often relied on their own savings, credit cards, or  other sources of credit. However, these financing sources typically have  interest rates higher than those offered by the Express Bridge Loan Pilot  Program. In addition, it can take applicants approved for SBA Disaster  Loans months to receive funds\u2014time that could determine whether a  business remains in operation.", "Florida\u2019s Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan program provides small  business owners with interim disaster financing, similar to the Express  Bridge Loan Pilot Program, but some structural differences exist (see  table 2 for a comparison of principal terms and features). In particular, the  Florida program uses public funds rather than being funded by financial  institutions. Officials of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity,  which administers the program in partnership with the Florida SBDC  Network and a third-party fiscal administrator, told us the Florida program  is not focused on generating a return on investment. Rather, the  program is focused on helping small businesses bridge the gap between  the time their businesses incur damages and the time they secure other  financial resources. Although SBA officials told us that the State of  Florida\u2019s program is not a valid comparison to SBA\u2019s Express Bridge  Loan Pilot Program because the loans for SBA\u2019s program are made by  private, for-profit lenders, the Florida program demonstrates demand for  bridge financing for small business owners.", "Officials from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity stated that  when the Governor\u2019s office activates the Florida Small Business  Emergency Bridge Loan program, the department uses various outreach  media, including social media, public-private partners, and state  emergency response to disseminate information about the program. The  program\u2019s fiscal administrator and the Florida SBDC Network also  circulate information about the program, including by providing hyperlinks  to the loan application on their websites. Finally, the program has been in  place since 1992, which likely contributed to word-of-mouth about the  program.", "According to officials of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity,  following Hurricane Irma the program received 1,167 applications, of  which 883 were approved, totaling $35 million in disaster bridge financing.  Following Hurricane Michael, the program received 742 applications, of  which 590 were approved, totaling $34.3 million in disaster bridge  financing.", "Florida Department of Economic Opportunity officials attributed the wide  utilization of the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan to  expedited access to funding and favorable terms. For example, the  program offers survivors a zero percent interest rate for the term of the  loan, which is generally 1 year. Given the difference in loan terms  between Florida\u2019s program and SBA\u2019s pilot program, the demand for  SBA\u2019s higher-interest loans may not equal the demand for Florida\u2019s loans.  However, in disaster areas in which there is no state bridge loan program,  SBA\u2019s pilot program could meet at least some of the need for bridge  financing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, SBA faced  difficulties in delivering its disaster loans due to the magnitude of the  storms and resulting infrastructure damage, especially in Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nevertheless, SBA accepted about 340,000  applications and approved about 141,000 of them, making more than $7  billion in loans to help business owners, homeowners, renters, and  nonprofits recover.", "However, the planning documents and guidance to the field that SBA  used to guide its response to the 2017 hurricanes did not identify risks  and focus on risk assessments or include detailed instructions on how to  prepare disaster-specific action plans. And after the 2017 hurricanes, the  documents and guidance, including for outreach on disaster loans, has  not incorporated lessons learned\u2014particularly as they related to region- specific risks that could hamper the operations of the Disaster Loan  Program. By identifying risks and enhancing guidance on actions plans  and outreach efforts, SBA can better design its plans for and  implementation of disaster response efforts and help ensure staff are  adequately prepared to conduct operations in situations such as those  encountered in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. SBA also has not  established metrics to measure the success of its outreach efforts. By  establishing metrics, such as including questions when surveying disaster  loan applicants on their perception of SBA\u2019s outreach efforts, SBA would  be better able to determine how well its outreach efforts have informed  disaster survivors about the Disaster Loan Program and make  adjustments to improve the effectiveness of such efforts.", "SBA also can improve its Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program, which  offers small businesses the opportunity to quickly receive funding after  disasters. The success of a Florida program offering a similar product and  our own work suggest considerable demand for bridge loans. SBA has no  plans to evaluate the program because it has issued so few loans. While  SBA does not have the information needed to conduct a loan  performance evaluation, it has the opportunity to conduct an evaluation of  the pilot program\u2019s design and implementation. Such an evaluation could  help determine why so few loans were issued, what role program design  and internal and external outreach may have played, and what, if any,  changes to the pilot might be warranted. By evaluating the Express  Bridge Loan Pilot Program, including obtaining lender feedback, OCA will  be able to make an informed decision about the program\u2019s future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to SBA:  The Associate Administrator for the Office of Disaster Assistance should  identify and document risks associated with its disaster response and  plans to mitigate these risks in its disaster planning documentation.

(Recommendation 2)", "The Associate Administrator for the Office of Disaster Assistance should  update its outreach plan to include information on region-specific risks or  challenges, such as those encountered after the 2017 hurricanes.  (Recommendation 3)", "The Associate Administrator for the Office of Disaster Assistance should  establish metrics to measure the success of its outreach efforts during the  response to a disaster. (Recommendation 4)", "The Associate Administrator for the Office of Capital Access should  evaluate the implementation of the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program to  determine why so few loans have been made and if any design changes  may be warranted before the end of the pilot. Such an evaluation could  include assessing SBA\u2019s outreach efforts and seeking feedback from  lenders. (Recommendation 5)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SBA for review and comment. In  written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III, SBA stated that  overall it agreed with the report\u2019s recommendations and provided  comments, as summarized below.", "SBA described actions it planned to take to address the first four  recommendations, which if implemented as planned would address them.", "For the first recommendation to identify and document risks\u2014and  plans to mitigate those risks\u2014in its disaster planning documents, SBA  noted that ODA would work with SBA\u2019s Office of Continuous  Operations and Risk Management, which updates and publishes the  annual Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan, to identify and  document known risks associated with SBA\u2019s disaster response and  implement a risk-informed approach to its direct response and  recovery operations. SBA expected that its fiscal year 2021 plan  would include this information.", "For the second recommendation to identify the key elements of a  disaster action plan and provide related guidance to staff, SBA agreed  and noted that ODA would develop the key elements of and templates  for a disaster action plan, provide guidance to Field Operations  Centers, and coordinate with the Office of Continuous Operations and  Risk Management on including the information in appendixes to the  Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan.", "For the third recommendation to update its outreach plan to include  information on region-specific risks or challenges, SBA agreed and  stated that ODA would update its outreach plan to include risks and  challenges experienced during the 2017 hurricane season.", "For the fourth recommendation to establish metrics to measure its  disaster outreach efforts, SBA agreed and noted that it would explore  potential new metrics to measure the effectiveness of its outreach  efforts, such as adding a question about the efforts to the annual  American Customer Satisfaction Index survey.", "For the fifth recommendation to evaluate the implementation of the  Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program to determine why so few loans have  been made and if any design changes may be warranted before the end  of the pilot (which could include assessing SBA\u2019s outreach efforts and  seeking feedback from lenders), SBA described some actions it planned  to take in response to the recommendation that would partially address it.  The agency also commented on some of our findings, which we discuss  below. We maintain our recommendation.", "In its comments, SBA noted it would seek feedback from SBA  Express Lenders during the upcoming spring National Association of  Government Guaranteed Lenders conference on their interest and  participation in the pilot. SBA also noted that it would provide ODA  with information and a set of frequently asked questions about the  pilot program that ODA could distribute to small business owners at  Business Recovery Centers. Although beginning to seek lender  feedback and improving its internal outreach are good first steps, SBA  would still need to conduct an evaluation to determine if any design  changes were warranted to fully address the recommendation.", "SBA stated it did not currently have adequate data to evaluate the  effectiveness of the program because only two loans had been  funded. It also noted that while there were more than 90 incomplete  applications for the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program, the agency  had concluded that there were not sufficient data to suggest the  applications were actual attempts to originate loans and that lenders  likely started the loans in error. In the draft report, we acknowledged  only two loans had been issued and included SBA\u2019s views about why  other applications were not completed. As we note in the report, in the  absence of loan data an evaluation instead could focus on the pilot\u2019s  design and implementation, and include feedback from lenders.  Therefore, we maintain that SBA can and should evaluate the pilot  program.", "SBA noted it previously sought feedback from lenders on the  Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (a prior proposal for a bridge  loan program) and at that time, there was very little lender interest in  the program. The draft report included this information and noted that  the current pilot provides a similar opportunity to solicit lender  feedback, including on loan terms. In response to this, SBA stated  that making significant changes to the size and guarantee on the pilot  loans based on lender feedback would affect the subsidy for the  program. However, SBA will not know how lenders feel about the  current pilot or what types of changes they might recommend until it  seeks lender feedback. Lenders could call for changes to the program  that were minor but still would improve their willingness to participate.  In addition, if lender feedback suggested that the program would not  work without significant changes and additional subsidy, such  information could inform future actions to address borrower demand  for bridge loans.", "SBA also stated that it did not believe our comparison of the Express  Bridge Loan Pilot Program to the Florida Small Business Emergency  Bridge Loan was appropriate. SBA stated the Florida program  provides direct loans in contrast to SBA\u2019s limited guarantee to lenders,    and had been in existence since 1992 and was well known (versus a  2017 program start and less knowledge about SBA\u2019s program). We  highlighted both differences in the draft report. SBA also stated the  Florida program has a larger pool of eligible applicants because it is  not limited to Presidentially declared disasters or delivered only by  certain lenders, as is the case with the SBA program. However, we  note that the SBA program is available nationwide and the Florida  program is limited to the state. In summary, SBA stated in its  comments that the characteristics of the Florida program contributed  to the demand for the program. We acknowledged this in the draft  report, stating that given the differences between the programs, the  demand for SBA\u2019s loans may not be equivalent to the demand for  Florida\u2019s loans. Despite the program differences, we continue to  believe that including a discussion of the Florida Small Business  Emergency Bridge Loan program in the report was appropriate  because its use indicates demand for bridge financing. In disaster  areas in other states with no state bridge loan program, SBA\u2019s pilot  program, with changes determined to be appropriate, could meet at  least some of the demand for bridge financing identified by people we  interviewed.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the  appropriate congressional committees and the Administrator of SBA.

We focused our review on  Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014the states and  territories most directly affected by the 2017 hurricanes.", "For all of our objectives, we visited two areas each in Florida, Texas, and  the U.S. Virgin Islands, and three areas in Puerto Rico. We selected  these areas based on the high numbers of approved homeowner and  business disaster loans, high population, geographic diversity, presence  of a Small Business Development Center (SBDC), and presence of an  SBA district office. To help ensure geographic diversity, we selected  locations from different metropolitan statistical areas in each state and  Puerto Rico. In each location, we conducted a group interview with small  business owners who applied for a disaster loan with SBA to learn about  their experiences applying for a loan and working with SBA while their  loan was processed and funds disbursed, and their need for bridge  financing. These small businesses were recruited by representatives of  the local SBDC and were selected to represent a range of outcomes  (approved, denied, and withdrawn applications). Overall, we interviewed  24 small business owners across the nine areas we visited.", "In addition to small business owners, we met with officials from the SBDC  and the local SBA district office responsible for each of the areas we  visited. We also met with officials from seven local governments that  oversaw eight of the areas we visited\u2014either from a mayor\u2019s office or  economic development office. Lastly, we interviewed officials from six  chambers of commerce or business associations, one in every area  except one. While the results of these interviews are not generalizable to  all areas affected by the 2017 hurricanes, they provided insight into the  experiences of small businesses and local communities with the SBA  Disaster Loan Program. In addition to the site visit interviews, we  interviewed officials from SBA\u2019s Office of Disaster Assistance, including  officials from both Field Operations Centers and the Processing and  Disbursement Center, to discuss the Disaster Loan Program and SBA\u2019s  response to the 2017 hurricanes.", "For our analysis of open-ended responses from these interviews, we  used a software program designed for analyzing qualitative information.  For each open-ended response, we coded, organized, and analyzed  responses under a number of relevant themes. Specifically, team  members independently reviewed a segment of the interview transcripts  to code the responses to identify themes. Once each analyst had  completed coding his or her respective sections, the documents were  merged into a master file that was reviewed by the engagement\u2019s  methodologist. Possible alternative categorizations of the material were  discussed and resolved jointly. This code-based method constituted our  primary approach to validating the results of our analysis. All  categorizations were sourced to the original interviews through the use of  the qualitative analysis software.", "To evaluate SBA\u2019s planning for and initial response to the 2017  hurricanes, we reviewed SBA planning documents in effect for the  hurricanes\u2014SBA\u2019s 2017 Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan and  its 2014 Disaster Playbook\u2014as well as the targeted action plans SBA  created for each of the hurricanes and summaries of exercises SBA  conducted. We also reviewed the Office of Disaster Assistance\u2019s after- action report following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; SBA\u2019s 2017  and 2018 Staffing Strategies; models SBA used to guide its response;  and reports issued by the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG). We  used these sources to identify challenges SBA faced planning for and  responding to the 2017 hurricanes, including those it faced responding to  Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and with its  hiring.", "We reviewed SBA data on hiring and compared SBA\u2019s staffing modeling  efforts to the actual staff activated after the 2017 hurricanes. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  discussing SBA\u2019s staffing after the 2017 hurricanes by interviewing  knowledgeable officials about the data. We compared SBA\u2019s planning  efforts against federal internal control standards for identifying, analyzing,  and responding to risks, and against Federal Emergency Management  Agency guidance on disaster planning. To examine SBA outreach on  disaster loans after the 2017 hurricanes, we reviewed marketing and  outreach plans from 2012 and 2018 and a sample of outreach materials  SBA used during its response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. We  compared SBA\u2019s outreach efforts against federal internal control  standards for internal communication and against key consumer  education practices.", "To evaluate SBA\u2019s loan application and review process, we reviewed  prior GAO and SBA OIG reports on SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program to help  identify changes SBA made since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We also  analyzed summary data from SBA\u2019s Disaster Credit Management System  for applications submitted between August 31, 2017, and September 24,  2018. The August date corresponds to the date SBA received the first  applications from the 2017 hurricanes and the September date to the  one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the last of the three 2017  hurricanes. SBA completed processing more than 99 percent of the  applications for each hurricane during the period covered by our data.  Because the hurricanes occurred in quick succession and SBA treated  them as one event, we compared the combined data for the 2017  hurricanes to those from Hurricane Sandy and the combined data for  Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which SBA also treated as one  event. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for describing  characteristics associated with SBA\u2019s processing of applications by  reviewing related documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency  officials, and reviewing related internal controls. We used the results from  our thematic qualitative analysis and interviews with SBA officials to identify challenges associated with applying for or processing applications  following the 2017 hurricanes.", "To evaluate SBA\u2019s implementation of the Express Bridge Loan Pilot  Program, we reviewed Federal Register notices and a program guide  SBA published about the program. We interviewed SBA officials from its  Office of Capital Access about their implementation of the program, and  officials from three lenders to discuss their perspectives on and  awareness of the program. We selected one lender because it had  made loans under the pilot program, another because it had begun the  most applications for the program, and the third because it was a 7(a)  lender located in a state affected by Hurricane Florence or Michael. We  chose those hurricanes because they occurred about 1 year after SBA  began its pilot (in September and October 2018, respectively), allowing  time for SBA to fully launch the pilot.
