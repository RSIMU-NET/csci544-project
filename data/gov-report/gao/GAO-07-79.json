Despite the Joint Commission's control over JCR, the two organizations have taken steps designed to protect facility-specific information. In 1987, the organizations created a firewall--policies designed to establish a barrier between the organizations to prevent improper sharing of this information. For example, the firewall is intended to prevent JCR from sharing the names of hospital clients with the Joint Commission. Beginning in 2003, both organizations began taking steps intended to strengthen this firewall, such as enhancing monitoring of compliance. Ensuring the independence of the Joint Commission's accreditation process is vitally important. To prevent the improper sharing of facility-specific information, it would be prudent for the Joint Commission and JCR to continue to assess the firewall and other related mechanisms.

The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare  Organizations (Joint Commission), a nonprofit corporation, has developed  its own accreditation standards that are intended to meet or exceed  Medicare\u2019s conditions of participation. Hospitals accredited by the Joint  Commission are, in general, deemed to meet most of the conditions to be  eligible for Medicare payment.

All but  one of the Joint Commission\u2019s founding members continued to serve on its  Board of Commissioners as of October 2006, including the American  Hospital Association and the American College of Surgeons. The  standards established by the Joint Commission address a facility\u2019s level of  performance in areas such as patient rights, patient treatment, and  infection control. To determine whether a facility is in compliance with  those standards, the Joint Commission conducts on-site evaluations of  facilities, called accreditation surveys. The Joint Commission recognizes a  facility\u2019s compliance with its standards by issuing a certificate of  accreditation, which is valid for a 3-year period. In 2004, the Joint  Commission implemented a new accreditation process in an effort to  encourage hospitals to focus on continuous quality improvement, rather  than survey preparation. Previously, facilities were told in advance when  Joint Commission surveyors would conduct their evaluations. As a part of  the new process, the Joint Commission began conducting unannounced  surveys. The Joint Commission employs over 900 staff members,  including approximately 200 hospital surveyors from a range of  disciplines\u2014such as physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators\u2014who  conduct the accreditation surveys. In 2005, the Joint Commission  accredited approximately 4,300 hospitals.", "The Joint Commission established JCR to provide consultative technical  assistance to health care organizations seeking Joint Commission  accreditation. (See fig. 1.) JCR is governed by a Board of Directors and  employs approximately 180 staff members, including consultants located  throughout the country. In 2000, the Joint Commission expanded JCR\u2019s  role beyond consulting to include all educational services, such as  seminars and audio conferences, which the Joint Commission previously  provided. (See app. II for a timeline of key developments in the Joint  Commission and JCR relationship.) JCR also became the official publisher  of the Joint Commission\u2019s accreditation manuals and support materials.  JCR offers consulting services either independently to health care facilities  or through a subscription-based service called the Continuous Service  Readiness (CSR) program, which is typically offered in partnership with  state hospital associations. The CSR program provides ongoing technical  assistance and education to subscribers through a variety of means,  including meetings, e-mails, telephone calls, and conferences.", "In 2004, we reported that CMS\u2019s oversight of the Joint Commission  hospital accreditation process is limited. Although it conducts on-site  validation surveys of a sample of Joint Commission-accredited hospitals,  the agency cannot restrict or remove the Joint Commission\u2019s accreditation  authority if it detects problems. CMS reported that the agency and the  Joint Commission engage in ongoing dialogue to identify potential hospital  accreditation performance issues. In addition, CMS provides an annual  report of its findings to Congress. Unlike the Joint Commission, JCR is not  subject to any oversight by CMS.", "When developing policies regarding its relationship with JCR, the Joint  Commission has been affected by the increased focus in both the public  and private sectors on governance issues. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002, passed in response to corporate and accounting scandals, required  publicly traded companies to follow new governance standards, including  those designed to ensure auditors\u2019 independence from their clients. Even  though most provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are not applicable to  nonprofit organizations, activities that have occurred in the wake of the  act have affected nonprofits. For example, several state legislatures are  considering legislation that applies standards similar to the Sarbanes- Oxley requirements to nonprofit organizations. In addition, some nonprofit  organizations, such as the Joint Commission, have voluntarily adopted  policies and altered governance practices based upon the act.", "Organizations in the public and private sectors have also begun to institute  compliance programs and those that provide accreditation or  certification services have developed standards to ensure the  independence of these services. Compliance programs for health care  organizations\u2014such as hospitals, home health agencies, and medical  supply companies\u2014have used provisions of the federal Sentencing  Guidelines, developed in 1991, as a program model. These guidelines lay  out two common principles of adequate compliance programs\u2014to prevent  and detect criminal conduct, and to promote an organizational culture of  ethics and compliance with the law. In 1998, the HHS Office of Inspector  General developed a model compliance program for hospitals. Regarding  independence standards, organizations that provide accreditation or  certification, or recognize accreditation bodies, have begun to impose  certain criteria to demonstrate independence. For example, the  Department of Education developed criteria for educational accrediting  bodies that are designed to ensure that those organizations granting  accreditation are not improperly influenced by related trade or  membership associations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Joint Commission Has a Close Relationship with JCR through Their Governance Structure and Operations", "paragraphs": ["The mission statements of the Joint Commission and JCR both share the  same phrase of seeking \u201cto continuously improve the safety and quality of  care.\u201d While each organization differs in the activities it engages in to  achieve that mission, they maintain a close relationship through both their  governance structure and operations.

In 2003, the Joint Commission undertook a major review of  the structural, operational, and legal aspects of its relationship with JCR in  an effort to address any real or perceived conflict-of-interest issues. This  review led to the restructuring of JCR through revisions to JCR\u2019s bylaws,  which govern the internal affairs of the organization, and resulted in  changes to the composition of JCR\u2019s board and the appointment of board  officers. In particular, after the restructuring the Joint Commission no  longer retained a majority on the JCR board through board members who  served on the boards of both organizations. However, through changes to  JCR\u2019s bylaws, the Joint Commission maintained control over JCR by  reserving powers that would otherwise have been exercised by JCR.", "The 2003 restructuring of JCR allowed the Joint Commission to effectively  maintain control over JCR by implementing a change in the \u201ccorporate  membership\u201d of JCR. Similar to for-profit entities that may have  stockholders, nonprofit corporations may have corporate members who,  in general, are responsible for major organizational decisions, such as  electing the corporation\u2019s board. If a nonprofit corporation does not have  any members, the corporation\u2019s board of directors holds decision-making  authority.

When the Joint Commission became the sole member of JCR, its  reserved powers included those previously held and a number of  additional powers, as shown in table 1. A practicing attorney with  expertise in transactions involving nonprofit health care organizations and  who has served as external counsel for the Joint Commission considers  this structure necessary to enable the parent to protect itself from the  possibility of the affiliate acting against the parent\u2019s interests. However, an  article published in a law journal cautions that this structure allows the  parent to make decisions solely in its own interest without considering the  impact on the affiliate.", "As part of the 2003 restructuring, the Joint Commission took steps to  reduce the proportion of persons serving on the JCR board who also  served as board members on the Joint Commission board. Prior to the  2003 restructuring, JCR\u2019s board had 13 directors with a majority\u20147  directors\u2014from the Joint Commission, including the President of the Joint  Commission as an ex officio director with voting rights. The other 6  directors were from outside the Joint Commission, and included the CEO  of JCR as an ex officio director with voting rights. After the 2003  restructuring, directors from the Joint Commission no longer comprised  the majority of members on JCR\u2019s board. There are 17 directors on JCR\u2019s  board, consisting of 7 Joint Commission directors\u2014including the  President of the Joint Commission as an ex officio director with voting  rights\u2014and 9 external directors who cannot be, either concurrently or  within the prior 3 years, Joint Commission commissioners or employees.  The President/CEO of JCR also serves on the JCR board, serving as a  voting ex officio director. (See fig. 2.)", "Directors we interviewed who serve on both the Joint Commission and  JCR boards said that serving on the two boards has not been problematic  because both organizations share the same mission. However, they also  recognized the potential for overlapping board members to be faced with  competing organizational interests if differences between the Joint  Commission and JCR arise. These directors noted that, if competing  organizational interests were to occur, the Joint Commission\u2019s reserve  powers would dictate the final decision.", "The restructuring also affected the appointment of JCR officers. Prior to  the restructuring, the President and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of  the Joint Commission also served in those same positions for JCR. The  CEO of JCR was appointed by, and reported to, the President of the Joint  Commission, and could only appoint other JCR officers after consulting  with the Joint Commission\u2019s President. Changes to JCR\u2019s bylaws through  the 2003 restructuring removed the requirement that the Joint  Commission\u2019s President and CFO serve in those positions for JCR. Rather,  the Joint Commission appoints and has the power to remove the  President/CEO of JCR. The President/CEO of JCR also now has the  authority to appoint officers, such as the CFO, without consulting with the  Joint Commission\u2019s President. In addition, the Joint Commission, rather  than JCR\u2019s board, now appoints the vice chairman of JCR\u2019s board.", "One other noteworthy change as a result of the 2003 restructuring dealt  with the role of two Joint Commission board committees in relation to  JCR and the creation of a new JCR board committee. The Joint  Commission created a Governance Committee, which has a number of  responsibilities involving JCR, such as nominating JCR board directors  and certain officers. This committee also has oversight responsibility for  JCR governance issues and JCR conflict-of-interest policies, and reviews  the bylaws and other documents of JCR. Further, the Joint Commission  expanded the responsibilities of an existing committee\u2014the Finance and  Audit Committee\u2014to include reviews of annual financial audits and other  matters related to oversight of the firewall between the Joint Commission  and JCR.

JCR pays for these  services through a management fee. The methodology used to determine  the appropriate allocation of expenses varies by department. For some  departments, the allocation is based upon JCR\u2019s percentage of total  revenues, whereas in other departments, the estimate is made using the  amount of time spent doing work on behalf of JCR. Departments also vary  in whether they include overhead costs in the allocation.", "Along with support services, the Joint Commission also provides  management services to JCR through its General Counsel and Compliance  Officer. For example, all JCR materials, including the publications it  produces on behalf of the Joint Commission and materials produced for its  own purposes, must be reviewed and approved by the Joint Commission\u2019s  General Counsel prior to issuance. The Compliance Officer, a position  created by the Joint Commission in 2005, oversees compliance duties for  both the Joint Commission and JCR. Among other duties, the Compliance  Officer is responsible for implementing, providing training on, and  monitoring compliance with the firewall policies. The Compliance Officer  reports directly to the President of the Joint Commission and  President/CEO of JCR, the Joint Commission\u2019s Governance Committee,  JCR\u2019s Firewall Oversight Committee, and may also report to the full  boards of both organizations.

Joint Commission and  JCR staff are also prohibited from suggesting that the use of JCR  consulting services is necessary for, or will influence, Joint Commission  accreditation decisions. In addition, staff and board members of both  organizations are required to sign an annual statement signifying that they  have read, and agree to comply with, the firewall policies. Of the 25 staff  members we spoke with from the Joint Commission and JCR, all but 1  reported signing the required annual compliance statement and all but 4\u2014 2 from the Joint Commission and 2 from JCR\u2014were aware that the  firewall policy required them to sign this statement on an annual basis.", "While both organizations\u2019 firewall policies share similar requirements,  each has certain provisions that focus specifically on the services offered  by its own organization. For example, the Joint Commission\u2019s firewall  policy stipulates that Joint Commission staff will not seek or solicit  information on whether or not a facility has used JCR consulting services.  The Joint Commission policy also provides guidance on how Joint  Commission staff should respond to requests for consulting services. For  example, if a facility asks Joint Commission surveyors for advice on these  services, they are required to direct the facility to an appropriate senior  staff member in the Joint Commission\u2019s central office. That senior staff  member can provide limited information on JCR, including its services and  the reason for its creation. JCR\u2019s firewall policy limits, among other things,  the language JCR can use to promote its services.

JCR  formalized protocols for its consultants in the field, which provide specific  guidance related to their interaction with the Joint Commission staff. For  example, if Joint Commission staff members arrive at a facility to conduct  a survey when a JCR consultant is on site, the JCR consultant must leave  the facility immediately. In 2003, JCR also developed a policy\u2014referred to  as the \u201cscope limitations policy\u201d\u2014which is designed to clarify what  services can be provided to Joint Commission-accredited facilities. The  policy specifically prohibits JCR from providing certain consulting  services to facilities after they have undergone a Joint Commission survey,  including helping facilities challenge the Joint Commission\u2019s accreditation  decisions or findings, resolving Joint Commission deficiency findings, or  preparing facilities that have been denied Joint Commission accreditation  for future surveys.", "In 2004, the Joint Commission developed an additional policy reiterating  the importance of the firewall for those Joint Commission employees\u2014 information technology and planning and financial affairs staff\u2014who,  through the service agreement between the two organizations, need, and  are able, to access JCR financial or operational information. In addition  to the firewall compliance statement all Joint Commission staff are  required to sign, these particular staff members are required to sign a  separate compliance statement associated with this specific policy. Also in  2004, JCR approved a formal firewall policy related to JCR marketing  materials in an effort to ensure that JCR marketing materials contain no  implication that purchasing its products or services will impact the Joint  Commission accreditation process. Because JCR markets some products  that it develops on the Joint Commission\u2019s behalf\u2014publications and  educational services\u2014as well as its consulting services, the marketing  policy clarifies the language and logos that can be used on marketing  materials for these different products. For example, while marketing  materials for the Joint Commission accreditation manuals published by  JCR can only carry the Joint Commission logo, JCR\u2019s marketing materials  promoting its consulting services carry only the JCR logo.", "In 2006, the Joint Commission and JCR published posters, which are  displayed in Joint Commission and JCR meeting rooms, to govern  meetings that involve staff from both organizations.

The posters also  state that, if facility-specific information must be discussed for business  purposes by staff from one organization, the staff from the other  organization must leave the meeting. There are a number of occasions  when Joint Commission and JCR staff interact during which these  guidelines may be applicable.

The Joint Commission conducted an internal review in  2002, which was presented to the Joint Commission and JCR boards in  2003. The 2004 and 2005 firewall policies for both organizations called for  an annual audit of the policy by the Joint Commission\u2019s Office of Legal  Affairs, but these audits were not conducted. According to senior Joint  Commission staff, the Joint Commission determined that its legal  department could not conduct a sufficient audit and that instead, the  audits should be conducted by an external body with experience in this  area. In 2005, the Joint Commission and JCR hired a consulting firm to  conduct the first external review of the organizations\u2019 firewall policies and  related guidance. Following this review, in 2006, the requirement for an  annual audit by the Office of Legal affairs was deleted and was replaced  with a requirement for an annual review, the results of which are  presented to the appropriate committees of each board.

In its report,  the consulting firm stated that the implementation of the firewall policies  \u201crepresented a reasonable effort to prevent any behavior that could result  in a breach of the integrity of the accreditation process.\u201d However,  because no guidelines or standards exist for this kind of review, the  consulting firm did not certify that the firewall and related policies  protected the integrity of the accreditation process.", "The external review did identify some minor violations of the firewall\u2014 defined as violations that resulted from the staff\u2019s failure to completely  follow operational procedures required by the policies, but which are not  considered to potentially breach the integrity of the accreditation process.  For example, at the time of the 2005 review, JCR publications and  education staff housed in the Joint Commission offices had access to a  Joint Commission shared network folder on a computer drive. While this  shared folder could not be accessed by JCR consulting staff and Joint  Commission surveyors used a separate network, the consulting firm  recommended eliminating JCR staff access. The Joint Commission and  JCR agreed with this and other recommendations made, and report taking  steps to address the issues, including eliminating JCR\u2019s access to Joint  Commission computer systems.", "In addition to this external review, the Joint Commission reported that,  throughout the year, the Compliance Officer monitors concerns and  questions related to the firewall and related policies. Based on this  analysis, the organizations review the policies to determine what, if any,  changes need to be made to improve their clarity. In 2006, the Compliance  Officer developed a list of commonly asked questions and answers, which  was approved by the senior management of both organizations and  released to staff.", "According to the Compliance Officer, when minor firewall violations are  identified, each instance is reviewed to determine if it had any impact on  the accreditation decision process and if it was due to a lack of  understanding of the policies or was an intentional violation. She will then  either provide clarification, counseling, or, if necessary, initiate  disciplinary action, including possible dismissal, through the human  resources department. As of July, 2006, no Joint Commission or JCR staff  had been terminated as a result of violating the firewall policies. However,  a senior staff member at the Joint Commission reported that staff have  been terminated for violating the Joint Commission\u2019s conflict-of-interest  policies.
