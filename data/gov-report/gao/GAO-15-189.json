While promoting greater consistency, the  new system was also designed to enhance clarity, transferability, and  equity in the development of performance requirements, the delivery of  feedback, the development of ratings, and the link to compensation. OPM  stressed that a major improvement of the new system included dealing  with the wide disparity in distribution of ratings by agency through the  provision of clear, descriptive performance standards and rating score  ranges that establish mid-level ratings as the norm and top-level ratings  as truly exceptional.

For example, we  reported that fiscal year 2007 SES ratings were concentrated at the top  two levels. As part of making meaningful distinctions in performance,  OPM has emphasized to agencies through its certification guidance that  its regulations prohibit forced distribution of performance ratings and that  agencies must avoid policies or practices that would lead to forced  distributions or even the appearance of it. We recommended that OPM  strengthen communication with agencies and executives regarding the  importance of using a range of rating levels when assessing performance  while avoiding the use of forced distributions.

Figure 3  shows the average SES performance awards by rating level for the 24  CFO Act agencies for fiscal years 2010 through 2013. Since 2010,  agencies have made smaller distinctions in performance award amounts  between senior executives rated at different levels of performance. For  example, for fiscal year 2010, the average performance award for an  executive with a rating of 5 was $4,991 more than the average award for  an executive with a rating of 4.

To the extent that employees with such  high ratings do not receive a monetary award, the perception that rewards  are not directly linked to performance is reinforced.

Figure 4 shows  the percentage of SES receiving a performance award by rating for fiscal  years 2010 through 2013.", "To help assess how agencies are meeting the certification requirement to  make distinctions in pay based on performance, OPM uses Pearson  correlation coefficients as a metric to analyze the strength of the  relationship between executives\u2019 pay adjustments and performance  awards and their ratings. Correlation coefficients measure the linear  association between SES performance pay and senior executives\u2019  ratings, and the value of the coefficient will be lower if the actual  relationship between the two is not a straight line. For this reason,  differences between years or agencies in the value of the correlation  coefficient may not be meaningful. To meet the certification guidelines for  pay differentiation, agencies are generally expected to have a correlation  coefficient of 0.5 or greater; if the correlation coefficient is lower than 0.5,  the guidelines state that an agency\u2019s SES appraisal system can still  receive full certification if pay and awards data show the system makes  distinctions in pay. OPM reported that fiscal year 2013 correlations of  SES ratings and performance pay ranged from .19 to .99 for the 24 CFO  Act agencies: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had the  lowest coefficient and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had the  highest. Although correlation coefficients are useful for measuring the  strength of the linear relationship between ratings and performance pay,  they do not measure whether there are meaningful distinctions in pay  based on performance. For example, if an agency makes small  distinctions in pay across different rating levels (such as 5 percent of  salary for executives rated 4 and 5.05 percent of salary for executives  rated 5), the value of the correlation coefficient may be high, even though  the difference in pay between rating levels is not meaningful."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Departments\u2019 SES Performance Management Systems Are Becoming Standardized, but Disparities in Rating Distributions and Pay Remain for Fiscal Year 2013", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Departments\u2019 SES Performance Systems Used or Were Converting to the New SES System", "paragraphs": ["According to a 2012 OPM document on the new SES performance  appraisal system, with a different SES system in each agency,  inconsistency among the executive branch agencies was a problem  because of different definitions for rating levels across government, a mix  of four- and five-level rating systems, and variable application of rating  levels in evaluating SES\u2014which led to a disparity in the ratings  distribution across government.

However, OPM\u2019s guidelines also  state that if an agency\u2019s modal rating level is \u201coutstanding,\u201d the appraisal  system can still be certified if accompanied with a full, acceptable  justification. Nonetheless, the continued concentration of senior  executives at the top two rating levels indicates that this principle is not  being met across government.", "While making meaningful distinctions in SES performance continues to be  a challenge for many agencies, some others have made progress. For  example, our 2008 report noted that according to a DOD official, DOD  was communicating the message that the SES performance-based pay  system recalibrates performance appraisals as a way to help change the  culture and to make meaningful distinctions in performance, with a \u201cfully  successful\u201d or equivalent rating as a high standard as well as a valued  and quality rating. According to DOD, levels above \u201cfully successful\u201d  require extraordinary results. Of the five selected departments that we  examined in fiscal year 2013, DOD had the lowest percentage of senior  executives receiving the highest rating\u2014almost 31 percent.", "According to OPM officials, in 2015 OPM plans to convene a cross- agency working group that is to revisit the SES certification process. As  part of this effort, it will be important for OPM and the working group to  consider whether\u2014given the continued high SES performance ratings\u2014 the new system is contributing to making meaningful distinctions in  performance ratings and awards, and if not, what refinements are  needed. The goal of having a uniform system would appear compromised  if an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating in one agency does not have the same meaning  in another agency. Some options might include revisiting and perhaps  eliminating the guideline that allows OPM to certify agencies\u2019  performance management systems with an SES modal rating of  \u201coutstanding,\u201d so long as the agency provides acceptable justification.  This guideline could serve to work against encouraging agencies to make  meaningful distinctions in SES performance. Alternatively, enhancing the  transparency of OPM\u2019s approval of agencies\u2019 justification for a modal  rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d could shed light on whether the individual agency\u2019s  high ratings seem justified. These justifications are not on OPM\u2019s website  and OPM does not report them to Congress, nor does the Chief Human  Capital Officers Council review them for any consistency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Understandably, it could take more time for OPM\u2019s 2012 efforts to  standardize SES performance management to fully materialize. However,  data for fiscal year 2013 (both government-wide as well as at our case  study departments) showed that a large majority of SES employees are  still receiving one of the top two ratings. Coupled with evidence of overlap  in performance awards across rating levels, this indicates that the link  between performance ratings and awards is not being consistently  applied.", "By convening a cross-agency working group to review the SES  certification process, OPM is in a position to evaluate whether the new  SES appraisal system actually helps agencies use SES compensation  and performance awards in ways that are cost effective and lead to  increased employee performance and organizational results.

DOD, Energy, DOJ, and Treasury responded saying they did not have  comments on the report. HHS did not respond to our request for  comments.", "In its written comments, OPM generally agreed with the information in the  report but did not agree with our recommendation. In disagreeing with our  recommendation to consider not certifying agencies with modal ratings of  \u201coutstanding,\u201d OPM expressed concerns that imposing such a criterion  would lead to arbitrary manipulation of the final ratings rather than an  appropriate comparison of performance to standards. OPM asserted that  this situation would be ripe for forced distribution of the ratings, which is  explicitly prohibited by regulation. OPM also stated that the more  appropriate action is to continue emphasizing the importance of setting  appropriate, rigorous performance requirements and standards that  logically support meaningful distinctions in performance.", "As recognized in our report, OPM\u2019s regulations contemplate that it is  possible to apply standards that make meaningful performance  distinctions and to use a range of ratings while avoiding the use of forced  distributions. As we also note, since our 2008 report on SES performance  management systems\u2014continuing through the career SES performance  ratings for fiscal year 2013\u2014questions persist about the extent to which  meaningful distinctions based on relative SES performance are being  made. Although OPM has emphasized that an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating  represents a level of rare, high-quality performance, it appears from  examining fiscal year 2013 SES ratings data that some agencies are not  appropriately applying these performance standards to their SES ratings.  This undercuts one of the primary purposes for establishing the new SES  appraisal system, which includes increasing equity in ratings across  agencies and their link to compensation. Certifying agencies that are not  adhering to the agreed-upon performance standards provides little  incentive to those agencies that are adhering to the standards and could  lead to ratings that are more skewed toward \u201coutstanding.\u201d As recently as  2008, OPM agreed on the importance of communicating to agencies the  value of using a range of rating levels and transforming their cultures to  those in which a \u201cfully successful\u201d rating is valued and rewarded.", "OPM also did not support the second part of our recommendation  regarding three suggestions for increasing transparency for those  agencies that are certified with a modal rating of \u201coutstanding.\u201d Although  we suggested that OPM report high rating justifications to Congress  through its Annual Performance Report, we understand that this may not  be the most appropriate vehicle to use; another avenue of reporting to  Congress would certainly be acceptable, and we have adjusted the text  accordingly. In addition, by suggesting that the Chief Human Capital  Officers Council have input on agencies\u2019 justifications for high ratings, we  were in no way suggesting that this Council role impact OPM\u2019s ultimate  authority over the regulation and oversight of the SES performance  appraisal system (including certification of agencies\u2019 systems). We  maintain, however, that\u2014as an alternative action to more direct  enforcement of the performance standards\u2014transparency regarding  OPM\u2019s approval of justification for a modal rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d could  shed light on whether the individual agency\u2019s high ratings seem justified.

We also interviewed officials at  OPM and reviewed applicable reports from non-governmental  organizations, such as the Senior Executive Association. We reviewed  data from OPM on agency performance rating levels, as well as the  number and amount of SES performance awards. We defined our  universe of analysis as career senior executives who received ratings.  We also excluded SES employees (where identifiable) from agency  Inspector General Offices because their inclusion in the data was  inconsistent. We reviewed OPM\u2019s SES data for reasonableness and the  presence of any obvious or potential errors in accuracy and  completeness, and OPM officials confirmed the correctness of the data.  On the basis of these procedures, we believe the data are sufficiently  reliable for use in the analyses presented in this report.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed data from OPM on the amount  of SES performance awards given to career SES within the 24 Chief  Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies and other variables since fiscal  year 2010 (the year prior to the limitation of performance award policies)  through fiscal year 2013.

We reviewed these  departments\u2019 SES performance appraisal systems and their most recent  certification documentation submitted to OPM. We also examined  whether individual SES performance metrics were linked to agency  performance and whether performance awards were tied to outcomes by  looking at examples of individual SES performance appraisals.
