The Department of State (State) has taken steps to improve its detection of passport applicants using identifying information of deceased or incarcerated individuals. In addition, State modified its process for identifying applicants with active warrants, and has expanded measures to verify SSNs in real time. GAO referred, and State is reviewing, matches from this analysis. The following summarizes GAO's findings:", "Deceased individuals. As shown in the figure, GAO identified at least 1 case of potential fraud in the sample of 15 cases, as well as likely data errors. State reviewed the cases referred by GAO, and indicated fraud could likely be ruled out in 9 of the 15 cases; State plans to further review 6 cases.", "State prisoners. GAO found 7 cases of potential fraud among the sample of 14 state prisoner cases. State noted fraud could likely be ruled out in 10 of the 14 cases, and intends to conduct additional reviews of 4 cases.", "Federal prisoners. None of the 15 cases in this sample had fraud indicators, since all individuals were not actually in prison when applying for passports.", "Individuals with active warrants.

In addition, according to the  Department of State (State), passport and visa fraud are often committed  in connection with crimes such as international terrorism, drug trafficking,  organized crime, alien smuggling, money laundering, pedophilia, and  murder. As a result, even a few instances of passport fraud can have far- reaching effects. A passport is an official government document that  conveys certain benefits, such as certifying an individual\u2019s identity,  permitting a citizen to travel abroad, proving citizenship, assisting with  loan applications, and fulfilling other needs not related to international  travel.

In 2005 and 2007, we  reported on weaknesses in State\u2019s information sharing with other federal  agencies, such as the Social Security Administration (SSA), as well as  opportunities to improve the agency\u2019s oversight of passport acceptance  facilities. In 2010, we tested State\u2019s passport issuance procedures by  using counterfeit documents and the identities of fictitious or deceased  individuals, inducing State to issue five genuine U.S. passports. State  identified two of our seven applications as fraudulent during its  adjudication process; however, we were able to obtain passports using  counterfeit documents in three cases. We have made several  recommendations beginning in 2005 designed to help reduce passport  fraud, including that State improve information sharing with other federal  agencies, improve execution of passport fraud-detection efforts, and  strengthen internal controls at its passport-acceptance facilities. State  generally concurred with our recommendations and has taken steps to  address them.", "You asked that we assess potential fraud in State\u2019s passport program.

We conducted this  matching on the basis of common data elements including Social Security  number (SSN), name, and date of birth. We also analyzed the passport  data to identify issuances to applicants who provided an invalid SSN,  which was defined as an SSN that had not been assigned at the time of  the passport application, or had a high risk of misuse. From each of  these five populations, we selected nongeneralizable samples for further  review. In addition, from a population of 13,470 passport issuances to  applicants who used the SSN, but not the name, of a deceased individual,  we selected a generalizable stratified random sample of 140 passport  issuances, including 70 passport issuances from both fiscal years 2009  and 2010.

Applicants submit documents, such as a birth certificate or  driver\u2019s license, to passport acceptance agents to provide evidence of  citizenship, or noncitizen nationality, and proof of identity. The acceptance  agents are to watch the applicant sign the application, review submitted  documents for completeness, and check for application inconsistencies.  For example, acceptance agents are to assess whether photographs and  descriptions in the identification documents match the applicant. If an  acceptance agent suspects that an applicant has submitted fraudulent  information or exhibits nervous behavior, the acceptance agent is  instructed to accept the application and complete a checklist indicating  the reason for suspected fraud. The agents are to then send the  application, checklist, and photocopy of the identification to State\u2019s Fraud  Prevention Manager (FPM). Acceptance agents are not State employees;  however, State provides training, as well as detailed guidance that  governs their work. State also conducts periodic inspections and audits of  acceptance facilities to ensure compliance with regulations and policies.", "According to State officials, the most common way to renew a passport is  by mail. An individual with a passport issued during the previous 15 years  may renew it by submitting a mail-in application, along with the previously  issued passport, a recent photograph, and documentation of a name  change, if applicable. Applications submitted by mail or at an acceptance  facility are sent to a Department of the Treasury contracted lockbox  service provider for data entry and payment processing. The lockbox  service provider converts handwritten or typed text into electronic data  and deposits passport fees paid by the applicant. Once the lockbox data  entry and payment are complete, the electronic data and paper passport  application are sent to passport-issuing facilities around the United States  for adjudication.", "Applicants who demonstrate a need for in-person expedited service for  either a first-time issuance or a renewal may submit their applications  directly to a passport-issuing facility.

Depending on the results of the  adjudication, passport specialists may approve or deny the passport  issuance, conduct additional checks, request more information from the  applicant, or forward the application for additional review by their  supervisor, the FPM, or by offices in Passport Headquarters. Once a  passport has been issued, the application is scanned and archived.  Passports issued to individuals 16 years or older are generally valid for 10  years.", "Several federal statutes and regulations either require or permit State to  withhold a passport from an applicant in certain situations. For example,  State must withhold passports from individuals who are in default on  certain U.S. loans, who are in arrears of child support in an amount  determined by statute, or who are imprisoned, on parole, or on  supervised release as a result of certain types of violations of the  Controlled Substances Act, Bank Secrecy Act, and some state-level drug  laws. Likewise, State may choose to refuse a passport to applicants  who are the subject of an outstanding local, state, or federal warrant of  arrest for a felony, or the subject of probation conditions or criminal court  orders that forbid the applicant from leaving the country and the violation  of which could result in the issuance of a federal arrest warrant.", "During the adjudication process, passport specialists are to review  applications and results of checks against various databases to detect  fraud and suspicious activity, and for other purposes. Application data are  entered into TDIS, State\u2019s electronic processing system. TDIS  automatically checks applicants\u2019 names against a number of sources,  including SSA\u2019s death records and a database of warrants. For example,  TDIS automatically checks key identifying information of all passport  applicants against SSA\u2019s full death file, as well as a database of felony  warrants for certain crimes. Passport specialists are to compare the  application to the information in TDIS to make sure it was entered  properly and to identify missing information.", "Passport specialists are also to review the results of automatic checks  during a process State refers to as \u201cthe front-end\u201d process of adjudication.  For instance, during this process, passport specialists are to determine  whether an applicant currently holds a passport, has a history of lost or  stolen passports, or has already submitted a passport application.  According to State officials, such checks are intended to facilitate the  identification of suspicious activity and prevent multiple passport  issuances to the same person. Passport specialists also are to consider  the results from facial recognition technology which is used to help  prevent the issuance of passports to individuals using false identities and  people who should be denied passports for other legal reasons, such as  terrorists in the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) terrorist   In addition, passport specialists may employ commercial  database.databases and other tools during the adjudication process to assist in  confirming an applicant\u2019s identity or citizenship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Controls for Detecting Potentially Fraudulent and High-Risk Issuances", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSN Verification and Data Checks for Deceased Individuals", "paragraphs": ["In April 2007, State and SSA signed an information-exchange agreement  that allows State to query SSA\u2019s records for verifying applicants\u2019 identities  and identifying deceased individuals.

We also analyzed the passport data to identify issuances to  applicants who provided an invalid SSN, which was defined as an SSN  that had not been assigned at the time of the passport application, or had  a high risk of misuse. Because our review focused on passport issuances  with certain fraud indicators, we did not review other types of passport  fraud, such as identity theft involving individuals who were not deceased  or imprisoned. Similarly, since we focused on high-risk issuances  involving applicants with active warrants, we did not match the passport  data against all databases with individuals at risk of misusing a passport,  such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center  data. We only reviewed data with passport issuances, therefore we did  not examine passport applications that were rejected or abandoned by  the applicant. In addition, our unit of analysis was passport issuances,  instead of passport holders. Some individuals in our sample may have  been issued multiple passports.", "In addition, we examined policies, guidance, including the Foreign Affairs  Manual, and other materials provided to passport specialists. We  reviewed changes to State\u2019s controls since fiscal years 2009 and 2010  with respect to preventing certain fraudulent or high-risk passport  issuances.

We concluded  that all but four of these databases were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. Through data tests and interviews, we concluded  that state prisoner data from Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, and  Pennsylvania were not sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

We included only those individuals who  died more than 120 days before the passport was issued to ensure that  our matches did not include legitimate applicants who died shortly after  submitting an application. We further divided these passport applications  into two groups on the basis of whether the name in the passport file  matched the name in the corresponding death file record.", "From 13,470 passport records with names that did not match the  corresponding record in the full death file, we selected a stratified random  sample that consisted of 140 passport issuances, evenly divided between  fiscal years 2009 and 2010.

The  results of this sample are not generalizable to the entire population of  applicants using the SSN and name of a deceased person.", "To identify individuals incarcerated at the time of passport issuance, we  matched State passport data to a database of federal prisoners provided  by the BOP and prisoner databases from Alabama, Arizona, California,  Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia.  Federal prisoner data included individuals incarcerated during fiscal years  2009 and 2010. State prisoner data included individuals incarcerated as  of the date the state provided data to us, which ranged from May to  November 2011. We identified records for which the passport applicant\u2019s  SSN, name, and date of birth matched that of a person who was  incarcerated on the date of passport issuance. State prisoner data from  Florida, New York, and Texas did not contain dates of birth. For these  states, we matched passport data to state prison data by SSN and name  only. From our matches, we randomly selected 15 federal prisoners and  up to 2 prisoners incarcerated in each of the states for additional analysis.  If a state had two or fewer valid matches, we selected all matches from  that state, for a total of 14 cases from eight different states. Three states  did not have any matches. We obtained documentation from BOP and  prison officials from the eight states to confirm that the selected  individuals were incarcerated on the dates of passport application and  issuance. The results of these samples are not generalizable to the entire  population of applicants using the name, SSN, or date of birth of an  incarcerated person.

We identified records for which the passport  applicant\u2019s SSN, name (or alias), and date of birth matched that of an  individual with an open warrant on the date of passport issuance. From  this population, we randomly selected 15 warrants for crimes other than  misdemeanors and traffic violations for additional analysis.

For all 15 cases,  the warrant issuance dates, as well as the names and fugitive unique  identifiers, in the hard-copy documentation matched the information in the  warrant data we used to match with the passport database. In addition,  for 12 cases, at least one date of birth and SSN noted in the hard-copy  documentation matched the warrant data used for our matching analysis.  The dates of birth and SSNs in the documentation for 3 of the 15  individuals were redacted, and therefore the match was based on name  and unique identifier only.

However, in some cases, our matches may include applicants  who were not deceased, incarcerated, or the subject of an active warrant.  This can occur when a passport applicant has an SSN, name, and date of  birth that are similar to an individual listed in one of the other databases  or when the applicant is listed in the other database erroneously. In  addition, our matches may be understated because we may not have  detected applicants whose identifying information in the passport data  differed slightly from their identifying information in other databases.
