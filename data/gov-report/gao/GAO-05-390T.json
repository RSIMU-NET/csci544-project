Since the F/A-22 program began in 1986, new threats emerged and mission requirements changed; to keep the F/A-22 viable, the Air Force has planned for large investments in new capabilities. Significant delays and cost increases have affected affordability, reducing planned deliveries from 750 F/A-22 aircraft to fewer than 180. The recent budget decision to terminate procurement of the F/A-22 after fiscal year 2008 and the prospect of additional funding cuts also have significant implications for the program's viability and modernization efforts. JSF's original business case, established when the program began in 1996, is unexecutable. The cost estimate to develop the aircraft has increased 80 percent, operational capability has been pushed out 2 years, and expected acquisition quantities have been cut by 535 aircraft. The JSF program is approaching key investment decisions that will greatly influence the efficiency of the remaining funding--over 90 percent of the $245 billion estimated total program costs. This sizable investment greatly raises the stakes to meet future promises. While DOD has been working to resolve early design and performance problems, continuing program uncertainties suggest DOD could use more time to gain knowledge before it commits to a new business case and moves forward. To reduce the risk of further cost and schedule growth, any new business case must include an acquisition strategy that adopts an evolutionary, knowledge-based approach to product development. Currently, the JSF program plans to make key production decisions before critical knowledge is captured. Taken together, the status and problems in these two programs have broader implications for the DOD tactical fixed wing aircraft modernization program, raising questions as to whether its overarching goals to reduce average aircraft age and ownership costs while maintaining the force structure are now achievable. The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review provides an opportunity for DOD to assess needs and plans and to weigh options for accomplishing its tactical aircraft goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing on the status of two of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) major  tactical aircraft fighter programs, the F/A-22 and the F-35, also known as  the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).

Supporters cite its advanced features\u2014stealth, supercruise  speed, maneuverability, and integrated avionics\u2014as integral to the Air  Force\u2019s Global Strike initiative and for maintaining air superiority over  potential future adversaries for years to come. Critics, on the other hand,  argue that the Soviet threat it was originally designed to counter no longer  exists and that its remaining budget dollars could better be invested in  enhancing current air assets and acquiring new and more transformational  capabilities that will allow it to meet evolving threats. The debate  continues as a December 2004 budget decision by the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) reduced F/A-22 funding and the number of  aircraft to be acquired. A full-rate production decision is scheduled to  occur in March 2005, but the Air Force already has 98 aircraft on contract.", "The JSF program is the DOD\u2019s most costly aircraft acquisition program.  The program\u2019s goals are to develop and field more than 2,400 stealthy  strike fighter aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps and  potentially several hundred more aircraft for U.S. allies. International  participation in the development of this system is a vital part of the  acquisition strategy. The JSF is intended to provide greater capability and  to replace DOD\u2019s aging fighter and attack aircraft. DOD estimates that the  total cost to develop and procure its fleet of aircraft will reach $245 billion,  with total costs to maintain and operate the JSF adding another $344  billion over its life cycle. Since the program began in November 1996, it  has experienced technical challenges that have resulted in significant cost  increases and schedule overruns. During most of 2004, the program  worked to understand and define current development risks in order to  prepare more accurate cost and delivery estimates to support  development and production investment decisions planned over the next 2  years.", "A key to successful acquisition programs is the development of a business  case that should match requirements with resources\u2014proven  technologies, sufficient engineering capabilities, time, and funding\u2014-when  undertaking a new product development. First, the user\u2019s needs must be  accurately defined, alternative approaches to satisfying these needs must  be properly analyzed, and quantities needed for the chosen system must be  well understood. The developed product must be producible at a cost that  matches the users\u2019 expectations and budgetary resources. Finally, the  developer must have the resources to design and deliver the product with  the features that the customer wants and to deliver it when it is needed.

According to the Air Force, the  current production cost cap is $37.3 billion. Affordability concerns have, in  part, led to the steady decrease in procurement quantities. Two major  reviews of defense force structure and acquisition plans\u2014the 1993  Bottom-Up Review and the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)\u2014 significantly reduced F/A-22 quantities.

Figure 1 illustrates the  downward trend in procurement quantities and the upward trend in  acquisition unit costs.", "In arguing for reversal of the December 2004 budget decision to stop  procurement of the F/A-22 in 2008, Air Force officials note that the  decision obviates production economies and efficiencies that it expected  to achieve through a multiyear procurement contract that was to begin in  fiscal year 2008. Officials also stated that cutting production quantities  from the final years of the program limit expected savings in annual unit  procurement costs. As with many DOD acquisitions, Air Force program  officials had assumed in future budgets that the costs for buying F/A-22s  would decrease as a result of manufacturing efficiencies, reduced fixed  costs, productivity projects, and more economical buying quantities. For  example, the average recurring cost for the F/A-22 in 2003 was about $178  million, while the average flyaway unit costs for future annual buys were  projected to decrease to $127 million, $111 million, and $108 million in  fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively.", "The F/A-22 program changes have also resulted in schedule delays for  completing development testing, operational testing, and, consequently,  the full-rate production decision. That decision is currently planned for  later this month but could slip again given the unsettled environment.  Before full-rate production can start, the Office of the Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation must report to the Congress and defense  leadership on the results of the recently completed initial operational test  and evaluation. In addition, the F/A-22 program must demonstrate it  satisfies criteria established by the Defense Acquisition Board in  November 2004, which include delivering a fully resourced plan for follow- on testing to correct deficiencies identified in initial operational testing  and evaluation, achieving design stability of the avionics software,  demonstrating mature manufacturing processes, and validating technical  order data.", "Final reports detailing the results from initial operational testing and  evaluation were not available for our review, but Air Force test officials  told us that testing showed the F/A-22 was \u201coverwhelmingly effective\u201d as  an air superiority fighter and that its supporting systems were \u201cpotentially  suitable\u201d pending the correction of identified deficiencies. Operational  testing of the limited ground attack capability in the current design was  not conducted but is scheduled during follow-on testing planned to start in  July 2005. Air Force officials believe that test results support making the  full-rate production decision planned in late March 2005. They also believe  that deficiencies identified in aircraft reliability and maintainability  (including maintaining low observable characteristics) and in the  integrated diagnostic systems are readily correctible and the aircraft  should meet the needs of the warfighter by the scheduled initial  operational capability date in December 2005.

However, over the 19 years that the aircraft has  been in development, the projected Cold War threats never materialized  and new threats emerged, changing tactical fighter requirements and  operational war plans. The Air Force now plans to implement a Global  Strike concept of operations by developing a robust air-to-ground attack  capability to allow the aircraft to counter a greater variety of targets, such  as surface-to-air missiles systems, that pose a significant threat to U.S.  aircraft. It also plans to equip most of the F/A-22 fleet with improved  capabilities to satisfy expanded warfighter requirements and to take on  new missions, including intelligence data gathering and the suppression of  enemy air defenses and interdiction.", "To implement its Global Strike concept, the Air Force established a time- phased modernization program. Table 1 shows how the Air Force intends  to integrate new capabilities incrementally.", "In March 2003, OSD\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG) estimated  that the Air Force would need $11.7 billion for the planned modernization  programs through fiscal year 2018.

The Air  Force will continue to manage blocks 20 and 30 as part of the F/A-22  acquisition program. To manage block 40 efforts, OSD has directed the Air  Force to establish a separate modernization program. Future  modernization costs beyond 2011 have not been fully definitized and are  subject to change. The modernization program manager projected annual  funding of $700 to $750 million would be needed for the currently planned  modernization program after 2011.", "The December 2004 budget decision places much of the modernization  program in doubt, particularly the latter stages. This is because that  decision terminated F/A-22 procurement after fiscal year 2008 and many of  these new and advanced capabilities had been planned for aircraft that  now will not be bought. Therefore, if the budget cut is sustained, the  current modernization program will be obsolete and the funding for  advanced capabilities planned to be incorporated after fiscal year 2008  would be available for other uses.", "The budget decision causes a ripple effect on other resource plans tied to  the modernization. For example, it brings into question the need for (1)  upgrades to the computer architecture and processors estimated to cost  between $400 million and $500 million; (2) upgrades to government  laboratory and test range infrastructure like software avionics integration  labs, flying test beds, and test ranges estimated to cost about $1.8 billion;  and (3) changes in other activities supporting modernization  enhancements in the production line, retrofit of aircraft, and establishing  depot maintenance support estimated at more than $1.6 billion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New JSF Business Case and Acquisition Strategy Is Critical for Program Success", "paragraphs": ["Unlike the F/A-22 program, which is near the end of development, the JSF  program is approaching key investment decisions that will greatly  influence the efficiency of the remaining funding\u2014-over 90 percent of the  $245 billion estimated total program costs\u2014-and determine the risk DOD  is willing to accept.

Development costs  were originally estimated at roughly $25 billion. By the 2001 system  development decision, these costs increased almost $10 billion, and by  2004, costs increased an additional $10 billion, pushing total development  cost estimates to nearly $45 billion. Current estimates for the program  acquisition unit cost are about $100 million, a 23 percent increase since  2001. Ongoing OSD cost reviews could result in further increases to the  estimated program cost. At the same time, procurement quantities have  been reduced by 535 aircraft and the delivery of operational aircraft has  been delayed.

For example, DOD has been working over the past year to restructure the  JSF program to accommodate changes in the aircraft\u2019s design; until this  restructuring is completed, it will be difficult to accurately estimate  program costs. The need for design changes largely resulted from the  increased weight of the short takeoff and vertical landing variant and the  impact it was having on key performance parameters. The other JSF  variants\u2019 designs were affected as well. The program plans to have a more  comprehensive cost estimate in the spring of 2005. However, a detailed  assessment has not been conducted to determine the impact that the  restructured program will have on meeting performance specifications.  Until the detailed design efforts are complete\u2014after the critical design  review in February 2006\u2014the program will have difficulty assessing the  impact of the design changes on performance. While the program office  anticipates that recent design changes will allow the aircraft to meet key  performance parameters, it will not know with certainty if the weight  problems have been resolved until after the plane is manufactured and  weighed in mid-2007.", "Program officials are also examining ways to reduce program  requirements while keeping cost and schedules constant. Design and  software teams have found greater complexity and less efficiency as they  develop the 17 million lines of software needed for the system. Program  analysis indicated that some aircraft capabilities will have to be deferred  to stay within cost and schedule constraints. As a result, the program  office is working with the warfighters to determine what capabilities could  be deferred to later in the development program or to follow-on  development efforts while still meeting the warfighter\u2019s basic needs. It  may be some time before DOD knows when and what capabilities it will  be able to deliver. The content and schedule of the planned 7-year, 10,000- hour flight test program is also being examined. According to the program  office, the test program was already considered aggressive, and recent  program changes have only increased the risks of completing it on time.", "Finally, uncertainty about the number and mix of variants the services  plan to purchase will also affect JSF\u2019s acquisition plans. While the Air  Force has announced its intention to acquire the short takeoff and vertical  landing variant, it has yet to announce when or how many it expects to  buy or how this purchase will affect the quantity of the conventional  takeoff and landing variant it plans to buy. The number and mix of JSF  variants that the Navy and Marine Corps intend to purchase\u2014and their  related procurement costs\u2014also remain undetermined. Foreign partners  have expressed intent to buy about 700 aircraft between 2012 and 2015,  but no formal agreements have been signed at this time. The upcoming  2005 Quadrennial Defense Review\u2014an examination of U.S. defense  needs\u2014could also affect the procurement quantities and schedule. In  developing a reliable business case, knowing the quantities to be  purchased is equally as important as other elements. Without knowing  types and quantities the program manager cannot accurately estimate  costs or plan for production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timely Capture of Product Knowledge Needed to Support Future Business Decisions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, DOD has revised its weapons acquisition policy to support  an evolutionary, knowledge-based strategy based on best practices\u2014key  to executing a future business case and making more informed business  decisions. With an evolutionary acquisition approach, new products are  developed in increments based on available resources. Design elements  that are not currently achievable are planned for and managed as separate  acquisitions in future generations of the product with separate milestones,  costs, and schedules. While JSF\u2019s acquisition strategy calls for initially  delivering a small number of aircraft with limited capabilities, the program  has committed to deliver the full capability by the end of system  development and demonstration in 2013 within an established cost and  schedule for a single increment, contrary to an evolutionary approach.", "In addition, JSF\u2019s planned approach will not capture adequate knowledge  about technologies, design, and manufacturing processes for investment  decisions at key investment junctures. Our past work has shown that to  ensure successful program outcomes, a high level of demonstrated  knowledge must be attained at three key junctures for each increment in  the program. Table 2 compares best practice and JSF knowledge  expectations at each critical point.", "As shown in table 2, the JSF program will lack critical production  knowledge when it plans to enter low-rate initial production in 2007. The  department has included about $152.4 million in its fiscal year 2006 budget  request to begin long lead funding for low-rate initial production. This  production decision is critical and knowledge required to be captured by  Knowledge Point 3 in our best practice model should be achieved before it  is made. If production begins without knowledge that the design is mature,  critical manufacturing processes are under control, and reliability is  demonstrated, costly changes to the design and manufacturing processes  can occur, driving up costs and delaying delivery of the needed capability  to the warfighter. The size of the potential risk is illustrated in the  production ramp-up and investments planned after this decision is made.  Between 2007 (the start of low-rate production) and 2013 (the scheduled  start of full-rate production) DOD plans to buy nearly 500 JSF aircraft\u201420  percent of its planned total buys\u2014at a cost of roughly $50 billion. The  program expects to increase low-rate production from 5 aircraft a year to  143 aircraft a year, significantly increasing the financial investment after  production begins. Between 2007 and 2009, the program plans to increase  low-rate production spending from about $100 million a month to over  $500 million a month, and before development has ended and an  integrated aircraft has undergone operational evaluations, DOD expects to  spend nearly $1 billion a month.", "To achieve its production rate, the program will invest significantly in  tooling, facilities, and personnel.

The reduced fleet size  may require the Air Force to consider the F/A-22 as a low-density/high- demand asset, which would require changes in these expected  management and employment strategies. It also has implications for  related resources and plans, including military personnel requirements,  numbers of operating locations, support equipment, spare parts, and  logistical support mechanisms.", "Other factors will come to play in the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review.

DOD is also conducting a set of joint capability reviews to  ensure acquisition decisions are based on providing integrated capabilities  rather than focused on individual weapons systems. The study results,  although still months away, could further affect the future of the F/A-22  and JSF programs including the F/A-22\u2019s modernization plan. In these  analyses, the new tactical aircraft will also have to compete for funding,  priority, and mission assignments with operational systems, such as the F- 15 and F/A-18, and other future systems, such as the Joint Unmanned  Combat Air Systems.", "The upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review provides an opportunity for  DOD to assess tactical fixed wing aircraft modernization plans and weigh  options for accomplishing its specific as well as overarching tactical  aircraft goals. It is critical that their investment be well managed and  balanced against DOD\u2019s other priorities. Through the review, DOD can  seek answers to overall investment strategy questions:    What is the role of tactical aircraft in relation to other defense capabilities?", "Will planned investments in tactical aircraft allow DOD to achieve these  capabilities and overall transformational goals?", "Where disconnects exist between goals and expected investment  outcomes, what are the impacts and how will DOD compensate to  minimize future security and investment risks?", "If DOD fails to answer these questions and continues with its current  modernization strategy, it will likely arrive in the future with needs similar  to those that exist today but with fewer options and resources to resolve  those needs. As DOD evaluates its tactical aircraft investment alternatives,  knowledge at the program level is needed to understand how the F/A-22  and JSF can help achieve overall tactical aircraft modernization goals.  More specific questions need to be answered for these programs including:  Is the F/A-22 the most cost-effective alternative to fill gaps in ground  attack and intelligence gathering requirements?", "How many F/A-22s are needed and affordable to carry out the aircraft\u2019s  original mission, air superiority, and new ground attack and intelligence  gathering missions?", "If requirements for the new F/A-22 capabilities are legitimate and not  solvable by other means, does the Air Force have the resources (mature  technologies, design knowledge, time, and money) to begin investments in  a new development program for the F/A-22 enhancements?", "What is the immediate need for JSF aircraft?

Does the  acquisition plan satisfy this need?", "Does the program have the required knowledge about needed quantities  and capabilities and resources (mature technologies, design knowledge,  time, and money) to develop a reliable business case at this time?", "Does DOD have the right acquisition strategy to develop and produce a  JSF that will maximize its return on the more than $220 billion investment  that remains in this program?", "While the JSF program started off with a higher-risk approach by starting  system development with immature technologies, now is the time to  implement an evolutionary and knowledge-based acquisition strategy to  manage the system development phase and stabilize the design before  making large investments in tooling, labor, and facilities to test and  manufacture the aircraft. The JSF is relatively early in its system  development and demonstration phase and has an opportunity to learn  from the F/A-22 program experience. It must take the time needed now to  gather knowledge needed to resolve key issues that could ultimately result  in additional cost increases, delays, and performance problems.", "Our F/A-22 and JSF reports planned to be issued on March 15, 2005, will  include recommendations that DOD answer some of these questions  before significant additional investments are made.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our prepared statement. We would be happy  to respond to any questions that you or other members of the  Subcommittee may have. If you have future questions about our work on  the F/A-22 or JSF, please call Allen Li at (202) 512-4841.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
