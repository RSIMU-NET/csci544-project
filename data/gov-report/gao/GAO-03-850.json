A decline in revenues to the trust fund has led the Superfund program to rely increasingly on appropriations from the general fund. In EPA's fiscal year 2004 budget request for the Superfund program, the general fund appropriation would make up about 80 percent of the program's total appropriation. At the end of fiscal year 2002, the NPL had 1,233 sites in various stages of cleanup. EPA considers many factors in selecting from the sites that are eligible to be listed, the most prominent of which are the availability of alternative federal or state programs that could be used to clean up the site, the status of responsible parties associated with the sites, and the cost and complexity of the cleanup required. As the Superfund program continues to add sites to the NPL and funding sources shift toward general fund appropriations, the effect of EPA's actions to address future program challenges remains uncertain. Because Superfund lacks indicators to fully measure the outcomes of the program's cleanup efforts, EPA has asked an advisory council to develop criteria by which to measure the program's progress. However, it is unclear whether the advisory council will reach consensus on its recommendations, and its findings are not expected until December 2003, at the earliest. Performance indicators could help EPA and the Congress make the difficult funding, policy, and program decisions that the current budget environment demands."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that one in four  Americans lives within 4 miles of a hazardous waste site. Congress  established the Superfund program in 1980 to address the threats that these  sites pose to human health and the environment. Among the hazardous  waste sites that the Superfund program addresses are manufacturing  facilities where hazardous waste has been spilled or disposed of on site,  waste disposal facilities where soil or groundwater has been contaminated,  or sites where toxic materials have been disposed of improperly and  abandoned. EPA, which administers the Superfund program, has identified  44,000 potentially hazardous waste sites and continues to discover about  500 additional sites each year. EPA places the nation\u2019s most seriously  contaminated sites, which typically are expensive and can take many years  to cleanup, on its National Priorities List (NPL). At the end of fiscal year  2002, there were 1,233 sites on the NPL.", "The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act (CERCLA) of 1980 established the Superfund program to clean up  highly contaminated hazardous waste sites. CERCLA authorizes EPA to  compel the parties responsible for the contamination to clean up the sites;  allows EPA to pay for cleanups, then seek reimbursement from the  responsible parties; and establishes a trust fund to help EPA pay for  cleanups and related program activities. The law also authorizes states to  participate in the cleanup process, provides for public participation in the  cleanup decisions, and provides that responsible parties are liable for  damage to injured natural resources. In addition, the law establishes a  process for cleaning up hazardous waste at federal facilities, although the  Superfund trust fund is generally not available to fund these federal  cleanups, which are funded from federal agency appropriations.", "States and responsible parties play a significant role in the cleanup of  hazardous waste sites. Most states have established their own programs to  clean up hazardous waste sites independently of the federal Superfund  program. However many of these state programs have limited capacity to  address costly and complex sites that do not have responsible parties to  pay for the cleanup. Within the Superfund program, states may enter into  agreements with EPA to perform certain program actions, such as initial  site assessments; EPA also consults with states on cleanup decisions  throughout the cleanup process. Parties responsible for the contamination,  such as current or former owners or operators of a site or the generators  and transporters of the hazardous substances, often pay for and sometimes  even perform the cleanup under agreements with EPA or the state. In some  cases, parties responsible for the contamination cannot be identified or do  not have sufficient resources to perform the cleanup.", "To fund the Superfund program, CERCLA established a trust fund that can  be used to conduct removal and remedial actions, to administer and  manage the program, and to identify and oversee responsible parties. Until  1995, the trust fund was financed primarily by a tax on crude oil and certain  chemicals and an environmental tax on corporations. The authority for  these taxes expired in December 1995 and has not been reauthorized;  however, the trust fund continues to receive revenue from interest accrued  on the unexpended invested balance, recoveries of cleanup costs from  responsible parties, and collections of fines and penalties. The trust fund  has also received revenue from annual general fund appropriations that,  along with its other revenues, have been used to fund the Superfund  program\u2019s operations. As the general fund appropriations grow, the debate  continues on whether to reinstate the taxes to support the Superfund  program.", "As agreed with your office, we examined (1) the current status of the  Superfund program, (2) the factors guiding EPA\u2019s selection of sites to be  placed on the NPL, and (3) the program\u2019s future outlook. To address these  objectives, we discussed the Superfund program with officials in EPA  headquarters, the 10 EPA regions, 10 states, associations that represent  states, industry groups, and environmental groups. To assess the  program\u2019s status, we reviewed the status of the 1,560 hazardous waste sites  that have been proposed and/or listed on the NPL since the beginning of the  program, program funding and expenditure data, and EPA\u2019s use of human  capital resources to administer the Superfund program. In this report, we  present all program funding and expenditure data in constant 2002 dollars.  In our review of cleanup actions, we focused on remedial actions, which  are generally costly and can take a long time to complete. To assess the  NPL listing process, we evaluated EPA\u2019s minimum eligibility criteria,  policies, guidance, and recent practices; we also assessed the extent of  EPA\u2019s coordination with states. We analyzed available data on state  hazardous waste cleanup programs, focusing on the coordination between  federal and state programs to address current and future Superfund sites.  To assess the program\u2019s future fiscal outlook, we examined the effect of the  expiration of the taxing authority for the trust fund, identified and reviewed  estimates of future funding requirements and workload projections, and  examined EPA\u2019s current efforts to address future program needs.

Sites are discovered by various parties,  including citizens, state agencies, and EPA regional offices. Once  discovered, sites are entered into the Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System, EPA\u2019s  computerized inventory of potential hazardous substance release sites.  EPA then evaluates the potential for a release of hazardous substances  from the site to determine and implement the appropriate response to the  threats posed by the releases of hazardous substances.", "The Superfund program addresses two basic types of cleanups: (1)  remedial actions\u2014generally long-term cleanup actions at NPL sites\u2014and  (2) removal actions\u2014generally cleanups needed to mitigate more  immediate threats at both NPL and non-NPL sites. Remedial actions are  generally designed to provide a permanent remedy and thus can take a  considerable amount of time and money, depending on the nature of the  contamination. EPA\u2019s regulations provide that a site must be on the NPL to  receive Superfund trust fund financing for the remedial action. Cleanups at  NPL sites progress through several steps: investigation and study, remedy  selection and design, and the remedial action. Often the construction of  cleanup remedies also requires subsequent operation and maintenance  activities to ensure that the remedy continues to protect human health and  the environment. In addition, the Superfund program conducts removal  actions, which are usually short-term cleanups for sites that pose  immediate threats to human health or the environment. Examples of  removal actions include excavating contaminated soil, erecting a security  fence, stabilizing a dike or impoundment, or taking abandoned drums to a  proper disposal facility to prevent the release of hazardous substances into  the environment. Typically, removals are limited to a 1-year effort and $2  million in expenditures. While EPA expended an average of about $220  million on removal actions in each of the past 10 fiscal years\u2014in constant  2002 dollars\u2014it generally spent at least twice this amount on remedial  actions, which constitute the largest portion of annual Superfund program  expenditures.", "The NPL is EPA\u2019s list of the nation\u2019s most contaminated sites. EPA regions  use a ranking system to assess the potential of sites to pose a threat to  human health or the environment, then choose from the sites that qualify  for the NPL which sites to submit to EPA headquarters for proposal to the  NPL. Once approved by the EPA Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste  and Emergency Response, the sites are proposed for listing in the Federal  Register. After a comment period, most proposed sites are finalized on the  NPL. A majority of sites on the NPL at the end of fiscal year 2002 were  manufacturing or waste management sites, while other types of sites listed  included recycling, mining, and contaminated sediment sites.", "The first stages of the remedial process are the remedial investigation and  feasibility study phases, during which the site is investigated further and  remedial options are studied. The culmination of these initial phases is a  record of decision, which identifies EPA\u2019s selected remedy for addressing  the site\u2019s contamination. The selected remedy is then designed in the  remedial design phase and implemented in the remedial action phase,  when actual cleanup of the site begins. When physical construction of all  cleanup actions is complete, all immediate threats have been addressed,  and all long-term threats are under control, a site is generally deemed to be  \u201cconstruction complete.\u201d Most sites then enter into the operation and  maintenance phase, when the responsible party or the state ensures that  the remedy continues to be protective of human health and the  environment. Eventually, when EPA and the state determine that no further  remedial activities at the site are appropriate, EPA deletes the site from the  NPL.", "The Superfund program has over 3,000 full time equivalent staff (FTE).

In such cases, the responsible party pays for all or part of the  cleanup. According to EPA, responsible party involvement in the program  remains strong, and the total value of responsible party commitments since  the inception of the program exceeds $20 billion. The actual dollar amount  that responsible parties expend for site cleanups is unknown because the  parties are not required to publicly report either the cleanup or any related  transaction costs they incur. However, EPA tracks the participant\u2014EPA,  the responsible party, a federal agency, or in some limited cases, the state\u2014 leading a cleanup action at a site and indicates whether the participant is  providing a majority of the funding for the action. For example, if a  remedial action is identified as a Superfund lead action, EPA uses annual  Superfund appropriations to conduct the work and pay for the remedial  action.

State  cleanup programs serve as an alternative to the Superfund program and are  the approach preferred by most of the state officials that we interviewed,  many of whom believed state cleanups are faster. However, state cleanup  programs generally present a feasible alternative only when a viable and  cooperative responsible party has been identified to fund and perform the  cleanup. According to EPA regional officials, at least 42 of the 54 sites  proposed to the NPL in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 either did not have a  viable and cooperative responsible party or were too costly or complex for  states to address."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Uses Its Hazard Ranking System as the Principal Mechanism for Listing Sites", "paragraphs": ["EPA uses the Hazard Ranking System as its principal mechanism for  determining the eligibility of sites for placement on the NPL, accounting for  1,506 of the 1,560 sites that were proposed or finalized on the NPL through  fiscal year 2002. The ranking system is a numerically based screening  system that uses information from initial, limited investigations to assess  the relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the  environment. Using a structured analysis approach to scoring sites, the  ranking system assigns numerical values to factors that relate to risk-based  conditions at the site. The factors considered are grouped into three  categories: (1) the likelihood that a site has released or has the potential to  release hazardous substances into the environment; (2) the characteristics  of the waste; and (3) the people or sensitive environments affected by the  release. The site inspection provides the data necessary to score the site  according to the Hazard Ranking System. Sites that score at least 28.5 on  the ranking system are eligible for listing on the NPL. Because the ranking  system scores are based on initial, limited investigations, they are only used  to determine the eligibility of sites for listing on the NPL. Scores are not  used to prioritize among sites that qualify for the NPL and do not determine  priority in funding cleanup actions. More detailed studies, following the  listing, are needed to determine the extent of the contamination and the  appropriate response for particular sites.", "Hazardous waste sites can also qualify for the NPL by means of state or  territorial designation or by meeting a set of three criteria. Each state and  U.S. territory is permitted a one-time opportunity to designate a site for  placement on the NPL. Through fiscal year 2002, 37 states and four  territories had designated sites for addition to the NPL. A site may also be  added to the NPL when it meets three criteria: (1) the Department of Health  and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  has issued a health advisory that recommends individuals leave the area of  the site, (2) EPA determines the site poses a significant threat to public  health, and (3) EPA anticipates that using its remedial authority will be  more cost-effective than using its removal authority.

EPA regions consider many  factors before deciding to submit a site to EPA headquarters for proposal to  the NPL. EPA and state officials told us that they consider a variety of  additional factors, the most common of which are determinations of  whether (1) other federal or state programs are available to cleanup the  site, (2) a viable responsible party has been identified to clean up the site,  and (3) the cost or complexity of the cleanup effort is likely to require  federal assistance through the Superfund program.", "Many of the EPA regional and state officials we interviewed considered the  NPL a \u201clast resort\u201d for sites that cannot be addressed under other state or  federal programs. Officials of one EPA region told us, for example, that  programs other than Superfund are covering about 98 percent of the  hazardous waste sites discovered in that region. In response to this report,  EPA headquarters officials stated that the NPL is one of a number of  options for cleaning up sites and that the regions should evaluate all  reasonable options and select the one that best meets the objectives for the  site. EPA defers NPL listing for sites that can be cleaned up under other  federal programs or authorities. For example,   The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Subtitle C,  which regulates hazardous waste management. Under this program,  EPA requires RCRA-regulated facilities to investigate and clean up  releases of hazardous waste to the environment; and  EPA\u2019s Brownfields program, which is designed to assist in the  assessment and cleanup of abandoned, idled, or underused industrial  and commercial facilities where expansion of redevelopment is  complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.", "Two EPA policies also defer NPL listing for sites that can be cleaned up  under state programs. EPA\u2019s state deferral policy establishes formal  agreements between EPA and states through which EPA defers  consideration of NPL listing of sites, while the state compels and oversees  responsible parties\u2019 response actions. Under this policy, response actions  should be substantially similar to a response required under CERCLA.  EPA\u2019s voluntary cleanup program policy establishes agreements with states  that, for sites that are cleaned up under state programs, EPA will generally  assume that state activities are sufficient and the agency will not take  separate removal or remedial action at sites in the state program. Both of  these policies allow states to handle the cleanup of sites that may  otherwise be proposed to the NPL. Hazardous waste cleanup officials in 6  of the 10 states that we interviewed indicated a preference for cleaning up  hazardous waste sites under their state programs.", "EPA has also established the Superfund alternative sites policy within the  Superfund program that provides a framework for the agency to suspend  the NPL listing process for sites that might otherwise be listed on the NPL.  This policy gives the responsible parties an opportunity to enter into an  agreement that commits them to clean up the site in the same manner as if  it were listed on the NPL. Because less time is spent on the site-listing  process, according to EPA, this policy helps to expedite the process of  entering into settlements with responsible parties and the eventual  cleanup.", "In addition to performing cleanups under their own state programs, states  play an important role in the cleanup of hazardous waste sites through their  agreements with EPA. Many states are involved in the early phases of the  cleanup process, such as preliminary assessment and site investigation.  Many of these states have entered into cooperative agreements with EPA to  perform this work. Appropriations laws for fiscal years 1995 and 1996  required the concurrence of the governor of the applicable state before  EPA could propose a site for inclusion on the NPL. Although no longer  required by appropriations language, as a matter of policy, EPA continues  to request state support on the listing of sites onto the NPL. According to  EPA, since 1995 EPA has proposed 203 sites to the NPL; among them, only  one site was proposed over state opposition.", "EPA regional officials stated that the lack of cooperation by the party  responsible for a site was a factor in 36 of the 54 sites proposed to the NPL  in the last 2 fiscal years. The burden on states of funding the cleanup effort  when they are unable to obtain responsible party cooperation often drives  state support for listing such sites on the NPL. In some cases, site cleanup  responsibility cannot be assigned to a specific party because the party is no  longer in existence or is unable to pay. Cleaning up such \u201corphan\u201d sites  would require government funding; these cleanups may be too expensive  for states to perform. In other cases, responsible parties may have been  identified, but they are uncooperative or unwilling to fund the cleanup.  While all states have some form of enforcement authority to compel  responsible parties to fund cleanups, EPA\u2019s enforcement powers are  sometimes more compelling or applicable to the situation. For example,  officials in several states stated that they had experienced difficulty when  pursuing enforcement actions at sites with numerous responsible parties.  Some sites, such as hazardous waste dumps, may have hundreds or even  thousands of responsible parties because CERCLA defines responsible  parties as the generators and transporters of hazardous waste, in addition  to the owners and operators of the site.", "Officials in most of the regions and states pointed to the strength of EPA\u2019s  enforcement powers to compel responsible parties to cooperate with state  authorities. Several officials told us that they had used the threat of NPL  listing to persuade responsible parties to cooperate earlier in the process.  EPA\u2019s enforcement powers include the ability to seek financial penalties  against responsible parties for noncompliance, the ability to issue formal  orders to the responsible parties to perform cleanups, and the liability  scheme by which EPA can force one responsible party to fund the entire  cleanup at a site, even if it is unclear how much of the contamination it  caused. EPA\u2019s enforcement powers are sometimes referred to as a \u201cgorilla  in the closet\u201d\u2014states can threaten to unleash the EPA \u201cgorilla\u201d on  recalcitrant responsible parties. A few states pointed to the value of  maintaining strong EPA enforcement powers because they encourage  responsible parties to cooperate with states.", "Officials in many of the regions told us that the complexity and cost of sites  were factors that helped them determine whether sites should be  submitted to EPA headquarters for proposal to the NPL. Of the 54 sites  proposed in the last 2 fiscal years, regional officials described 25 percent of  them as either complex or costly, or both. Officials in one region described  a site where contamination had leaked about 500 feet out into a major river  and spread through approximately 15 feet of sediment, making cleanup of  the site complex. According to a recent study, while 48 states and Puerto  Rico have funds that can be used for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites,  31 of the 41 states that provided data had relatively small fund balances  (under $25 million), making it difficult for states to clean up expensive  sites. In addition, the study found that states\u2019 cleanup fund balances have  been declining since 1990. Without adequate funding to cleanup the more  expensive sites, state cleanup programs generally present a feasible  alternative to NPL listing only when a viable and cooperative responsible  party has been identified to fund or perform the cleanup."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Superfund Program Faces Numerous Future Fiscal Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The need for federal cleanup funds to address sites without alternative  funding sources may grow in coming years, even as EPA predicts the  program\u2019s historical source of funding will be depleted at the end of fiscal  year 2003.

The number of sites whose cleanup cannot be  funded by responsible parties or states could increase because an increase  in bankruptcies would lead to more sites without viable responsible parties  and states face budget problems that will curtail their already limited  ability to pay for cleanups at sites that lack viable responsible parties.  Without responsible parties to fund remediation costs at hazardous waste  sites and with states\u2019 capacity curtailed, federal funding would likely be  sought to perform any cleanup that EPA proposed to do. However, EPA  officials expect that the balance of the Superfund trust fund available for  future appropriations will be depleted at the end of fiscal year 2003. EPA  has recently asked an advisory council for guidance on several issues  affecting the Superfund program\u2019s future.

Responsible parties and EPA lead most  actions at NPL sites. According to EPA, responsible parties have funded  about 70 percent of the remedial actions begun at sites other than federal  facilities in the last 3 fiscal years. Officials in 7 of the 10 EPA regions,  however, have either observed an increase in the number of sites without  viable responsible parties, or expect such an increase in the future.  Officials in one region, for example, told us that the proportion of  responsible party-led remedial actions in their region had decreased over  the last 10 years, from about 70 percent to about 50 percent currently.  Officials in all regions pointed out factors that could lead to an increase in  sites in the coming years whose cleanup cannot be funded by responsible  parties or states, including (1) the states\u2019 preference to work directly with  viable responsible parties, which leaves fewer sites with viable responsible  parties eligible for proposal to the NPL; (2) an increase in sites that lack  viable responsible parties due to bankruptcies; and (3) fiscal constraints on  states\u2019 capacity to clean up sites on their own. For example, officials in one  region mentioned that difficult economic times would likely contribute to  an increase in bankrupt facilities at the same time that states are  experiencing budget shortfalls. Without responsible parties to fund  remediation costs at hazardous waste sites and with states\u2019 capacity  curtailed, any cleanup at these sites would have to be funded with federal  funds.", "The states\u2019 preference to work directly with responsible parties makes sites  with viable and cooperative responsible parties less likely to be listed on  the NPL, increasing the potential need for federal funds if any of the  remaining sites that are added to the NPL are to be cleaned up, since these  sites may lack viable responsible parties. When Congress enacted the  federal Superfund program in 1980 at least 21 states did not have cleanup  statutes that provided them with enforcement authorities. As of 2001, all  states had laws that provide them with some form of enforcement  authority, and 48 states had statutory authority for conducting voluntary  cleanup programs, according to a study by the Environmental Law  Institute\u2014an environmental research group. Officials in most of the 10  states we contacted agreed that they preferred to work with viable and  cooperative responsible parties under their state program, rather than turn  the sites over to the EPA for NPL listing. They provided a variety of reasons  for not supporting a site\u2019s listing on the NPL, including the state\u2019s ability to  perform the cleanup faster, community or political opposition to listing,  and a belief that the federal process leads to more expensive cleanups. For  example, one state\u2019s officials believed the state could perform a site\u2019s  cleanup more quickly than EPA because, in their opinion, EPA spent too  much time in the inspection and design phases. Although states may  sometimes need EPA\u2019s enforcement capacity to compel responsible parties  to clean up sites, states prefer working with responsible parties under their  own authority whenever the parties are available, viable, and cooperative.  As a result, some sites that would have been led by the responsible party  under the Superfund program are addressed using state enforcement. This  has the potential to increase cleanup costs to the Superfund program for  any of the remaining sites that are added to the NPL, since these sites may  not have viable responsible parties.", "The reported increase in sites without viable responsible parties could, if  EPA proposes to address the cleanup of these sites, lead to EPA requesting  an increased appropriation because states cannot handle many of these  orphan sites on their own. Officials in 8 of the 10 EPA regions told us that  they expect more responsible parties to declare bankruptcy in the future.  Officials in one region, for example, believed that more of the small,  marginal industries might go bankrupt because of difficult economic times.  States, however, cannot pay to clean up more expensive orphan sites on  their own. According to the recent study by the Environmental Law  Institute, 48 states have established cleanup funds or provided a  mechanism for the state agency to pay for one or more types of cleanup  activities at non-NPL sites. Among the most common sources for these  state cleanup funds are appropriations from the legislature, fees charged  for hazardous waste or other activities, taxes, and cost recoveries.  However, most of the states that have funds to pay for orphan sites can  only afford to clean up sites with lower cleanup costs. Only 13 of the states  with cleanup funds spent more than $10 million on cleanups in fiscal year  2000, according to the report. Even in a state that was among those that  spent the most on cleanups in fiscal year 2000, the state usually funds the  cleanup at sites where the overall cleanup costs less than $5 million,  leaving sites that cost over $10 million to federal authorities, according to  state officials.", "The potential for current state budget shortfalls to affect states\u2019 capacity to  clean up orphan sites is another factor that could result in EPA increasing  its request for federal cleanup funds, if EPA proposes to address the clean  up of these sites. The National Governor\u2019s Association estimated in  February 2003 that states\u2019 budget shortfalls were mounting\u2014$30 billion for  2003 and about $82 billion in 2004. Officials in 6 of the 10 EPA regions  agreed that states in their region faced fiscal problems and anticipated that  shortfalls could cause problems with states\u2019 future cleanup capabilities.  According to the National Governor\u2019s Association, states must reduce  spending or increase taxes to offset these shortfalls in the short run. Any  reductions in the budgets of state cleanup programs might decrease the  states\u2019 ability to fund further cleanups, raising the question of whether  federal funds would be provided for any potential cleanup of affected  orphan sites. Officials in one region, for example, suspected the region  might be asked to fund cleanup at more sites as a result of state financial  problems because two of its states were implementing across-the-board  percentage cuts to all state programs, including their cleanup programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Officials Expect The Program\u2019s Primary Funding Source To Be Depleted by the End of Fiscal Year 2003, Increasing the Need for Alternative Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["At the same time that many EPA regional officials expect the need for  federal cleanup funds to address sites without alternative funding sources  to grow, the balance of the Superfund trust fund available for future  appropriations\u2014historically the program\u2019s principal source of funding\u2014is  nearly exhausted. In previous years, funds remained in this balance to carry  over into the next year. However, the balance has fallen consistently since  fiscal year 1996. According to EPA officials, unless EPA receives additional  funds from revenue sources such as cost recoveries, the balance of the  trust fund available for future appropriations will be negative at the end of  fiscal year 2003, as shown in table 4.", "If the balance of the trust fund available for future appropriations dwindles  as EPA projects, no funds would be left to carry over into fiscal year 2004.  Annual revenues from sources other than general fund appropriations,  such as cost recoveries and interest, will be insufficient to cover cleanup  costs in fiscal year 2004. To offset this decline in funds, EPA is seeking a 73  percent increase in its fiscal year 2004 budget request for general  revenues\u2014from $632 million in fiscal year 2003 to $1.1 billion.

Specifically, Congress wanted researchers to examine the costs of cleaning  up sites already on the NPL, cleaning up sites that would be added to the  NPL through fiscal year 2009, conducting removal actions, performing 5- year reviews, implementing long-term response actions, and the various  activities associated with administering the program. In its 2001 report,  Resources for the Future estimated the future costs of implementing the  program under then-current law. Researchers estimated that annual  program costs would most likely remain above the fiscal year 1999 level  until fiscal year 2006, and would decrease 14 percent by fiscal year 2009.  Resources for the Future concluded that the Superfund program would  cost about $15 billion over the 10 years ending in fiscal year 2009,  according to the authors\u2019 best estimate of the likely future cost of the  program under then-current law and policies, and would likely not  experience a dramatic decrease in its annual costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Is Taking Steps to Address Program Challenges", "paragraphs": ["EPA has taken steps to address several uncertainties surrounding the  program\u2019s future viability. EPA has asked the National Advisory Council for  Environmental Policy and Technology to set up a subcommittee to  address several Superfund programwide issues, including some that will  affect the program\u2019s future. EPA charged the subcommittee, first convened  in June 2002, with addressing questions related to the role of the NPL, the  role of Superfund at so-called \u201cmega sites,\u201d and measurements of program  progress. According to the subcommittee\u2019s charge, the overall intent of this  effort is to assist in identifying the future direction of the Superfund  program in the context of other federal and state waste- and site-cleanup  programs. EPA officials have stated that the results of the subcommittee\u2019s  work will be important in setting the future course of the program. The  subcommittee is scheduled to report its findings to the full advisory council  for its consideration in December 2003, before issuing the report to EPA.  While the subcommittee\u2019s findings are still uncertain, some of its members  and EPA officials have stated that the subcommittee may not reach a  consensus on specific recommendations, in which case it would present a  discussion of the different opinions of subcommittee members.", "EPA underscored the limitations of its current means of measuring  program performance when it asked the National Advisory Council for  Environmental Policy and Technology subcommittee to address measures  of the Superfund program\u2019s progress. Since 1995, EPA has used  construction completions as the program\u2019s key measure of progress for  sites on the NPL. As EPA pointed out to the subcommittee, however,  construction completions suffer from several shortcomings. Construction  completions neither measure nor characterize the impacts of cleanup  efforts on human health and the environment. In addition, construction  completions do not correlate as milestones for non-NPL cleanups or with  efforts at other hazardous waste cleanups. EPA implemented two new  environmental indicators in fiscal year 2003 to measure human exposures  under control and migration of contaminated ground water under control  at NPL sites. However, EPA acknowledges that there are still few cross- program metrics to capture comprehensive program outcomes. As EPA  states, this shortcoming prevents the agency from communicating the  outcomes of its work at hazardous waste sites to the public, Congress,  states, and the regulated community.", "In 2002, EPA implemented a new process related to the addition of sites to  the NPL designed to maintain a stable level of costs to the program by  considering the costs, risk, urgency, and other aspects of new NPL listings.  EPA\u2019s new process provided an additional layer of review to select among  sites submitted for proposal to the NPL by EPA regions. As part of this  process, EPA officials used two criteria\u2014risk and urgency\u2014to divide the  30 sites submitted for proposal by regions into five tiers. EPA also, for the  first time at this stage in the listing process, considered the costs to clean  up the sites and the timing of those costs, according to EPA officials.  Officials used the regions\u2019 estimates of site costs to evaluate the overall  costs of listing different groups of sites, with an understanding that these  preliminary estimates are highly uncertain. In addition, EPA considered  information on state, tribal, community, and congressional delegation  support for listing the site; whether cleanup of the site was likely to be  federally funded or funded by the responsible party; and whether any  environmental justice or tribal issues were associated with the site. EPA  staff also considered enforcement concerns in deciding which sites to  recommend to the Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency  Response for proposal. Whereas EPA approved almost all sites that the  regions submitted for proposed placement on the NPL in the past, the April  30, 2003, proposed rule included only 14 of the 30 sites submitted.  According to EPA, this new process was at least in part a response to  concerns that EPA was listing sites without foreseeable funding to start the  cleanup. EPA officials also told us that the program has carried a backlog  of unfunded construction projects since fiscal year 2001. The process used  to select this round of proposals has not yet been formalized and thus is  subject to change before the next round of proposals expected in  September 2003, according to EPA.", "In 2002, EPA had also issued a draft directive to consider, among other  things, the costs of sites before listing them, but decided not to formalize  this guidance. Representatives of the Association of State and Territorial  Solid Waste Management Officials objected to EPA\u2019s draft directive stating  their belief that, if warranted, sites should be listed on the NPL regardless  of the program\u2019s available funding. They further noted that listing only  those sites that could be funded gave the false impression that all necessary  site cleanups were under way. Although the process that EPA used in the  most recent round of listings was driven by the same concerns as the draft  directive, an EPA official told us that the process was not necessarily an  outgrowth of the draft directive.", "EPA officials are also concerned about two aspects of the long-term  stewardship of sites: the burden that the operation and maintenance of  sites has on states and the monitoring and enforcement of institutional  controls. According to several EPA and state officials, states are  increasingly concerned about the turnover of sites with federally funded  remedial actions to the states for operation and maintenance. Current  budget problems exacerbate these concerns, according to EPA. EPA  regional officials reported that almost all states had met their obligations  for the operation and maintenance of sites in the past. EPA regions  predicted that 28 sites that have been in federally funded, long-term  response action could be transferred to states for operation and  maintenance by the end of 2005. Median annual costs for the operation and  maintenance of these sites could reach $172,500 per site, according to EPA  regional officials\u2019 estimates. To address the issue of operation and  maintenance, EPA is conducting an initiative to optimize the performance  of federally funded groundwater treatment facilities at sites across the  country. The goal of the initiative is to ensure that these treatment facilities  are working as effectively as possible before they are turned over to states  for operation and maintenance. The EPA Inspector General found that this  study has produced valuable information on the cost and performance of  these groundwater treatment facilities and has resulted in a number of  recommendations.", "EPA is also concerned about the monitoring and enforcement of  institutional controls following a site\u2019s cleanup. According to EPA,  institutional controls include administrative or legal controls to minimize  the potential for human exposure to contamination by limiting land or  resource use. For example, a local government could use a zoning  restriction to prohibit residential development in an area of contamination.  Other examples of institutional controls include easements, covenants,  well-drilling prohibitions, and special building permit requirements.  According to EPA, however, institutional controls have certain limitations.  For example, the enforcement of institutional controls, such as local  permits or groundwater use restrictions, depends on the willingness and  capability of the local government entity to monitor compliance and take  enforcement action. In addition, because institutional controls such as  consent decrees are not binding on subsequent owners of sites, the transfer  or sale of a site can lead to the erosion of these institutional controls. In  response to concerns about maintaining institutional controls, EPA is  developing an information network to centralize the tracking of  institutional controls so that interested parties would be able to identify  institutional controls at any site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the Superfund program continues to add sites to the NPL and funding  sources shift toward general revenues, the effect of EPA\u2019s actions to  address future program challenges remains uncertain.

To address these objectives,  we discussed the Superfund program with officials in EPA headquarters,  the 10 EPA regions, and 10 states. In order to gain a balance of views from  states, we selected a nonprobability sample of 10 states, consisting of the 5  states that had the most sites proposed to the NPL in the last 5 years  (California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas) and the 5 states that  had no sites proposed in the past 10 years (Arizona, Delaware, North  Dakota, Nevada, and Wyoming). The 5 states that have had the most sites  proposed to the NPL over the last 5 years accounted for about 44 percent of  the 164 sites proposed during that time.

All program funding and expenditure data are presented in  constant 2002 dollars. In our review of cleanup actions, we focused on  remedial actions, which are generally costly and can take a long time to  complete.", "To identify the current cleanup status of NPL sites, we obtained data from  EPA\u2019s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Information System (CERCLIS)\u2014a computerized inventory of  potential hazardous waste sites that contains national site assessment,  removal, remedial, enforcement, and financial information for over 44,000  sites. CERCLIS is a relational database system that uses client-server  architecture (each computer or process on the network is either a client or  server), installed on separate local area networks at EPA headquarters and  all 10 regional Superfund program offices, and is used by more than 1,900  EPA staff. A September 30, 2002, report issued by EPA Inspector General  found that over 40 percent of CERCLIS data they reviewed were inaccurate  or not adequately supported. The Inspector General\u2019s review focused on  site actions, which it defined as activities that have taken place at a site,  such as site inspections, removals, studies, potentially responsible parties  searches, records of decisions, and remedial actions. As a result of its  review, the Inspector General concluded that CERCLIS could not be relied  upon to provide error-free data to system users.", "For our review, we verified CERCLIS data related to NPL sites and their  overall cleanup status as of the end of fiscal year 2002, but did not verify  detailed site action data for all sites in CERCLIS. To address the reliability  of CERCLIS data used in our review, we met with Inspector General staff to  review the nature of the errors discussed in their report. According to  Inspector General staff, the reliability of CERCLIS data was more of a  concern at the action level rather than the site level. They indicated that  using data related only to NPL sites and their cleanup status would  decrease concerns about data reliability, especially if we confirmed the  data with EPA regions. As a result, we checked certain CERCLIS data fields  for all 1,560 proposed, final, or deleted NPL sites with staff in each region,  as appropriate, including the sites\u2019 NPL status (whether the site was  currently proposed to the NPL, final on the NPL, or had been deleted) and  the status of cleanup at the site (whether the site was in the study and  design phase, construction was under way, or construction was complete).  Regions found no errors with sites\u2019 NPL status, but found errors in the  status of cleanup for approximately 1 percent of NPL sites.
