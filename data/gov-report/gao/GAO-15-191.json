According to the Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs) that GAO interviewed, supervisors often do not use this time to make performance-related decisions about an employee's performance because they may not know that the probationary period is ending or they have not had time to observe performance in all critical areas", "Formal procedures \u2014specifically chapters 43 and 75 of title 5 of the United States Code and OPM implementing regulations\u2014require agencies to follow specified procedures when dismissing poor performing permanent employees, but they are more time and resource intensive than probationary dismissals.", "Federal employees have protections designed to ensure that they are not subject to arbitrary agency actions. These protections include the ability to appeal dismissal actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or to file a grievance. If employees are unsatisfied with the final decision of the MSPB or an arbitrator decision, they may seek judicial review.", "The time and resource commitment needed to remove a poor performing permanent employee can be substantial. It can take six months to a year (and sometimes longer) to dismiss an employee. According to selected experts and GAO's literature review, concerns over internal support, lack of performance management training, and legal issues can also reduce a supervisor's willingness to address poor performance.", "In 2013, agencies dismissed around 3,500 employees for performance or a combination of performance and conduct. Most dismissals took place during the probationary period. These figures do not account for those employees who voluntarily left rather than going through the dismissal process. While it is unknown how many employees voluntarily depart, the CHCOs that GAO interviewed said voluntary departures likely happen more often than dismissals.", "To help agencies address poor performance, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) makes a range of tools and guidance available in different media, including its website, in-person training, and guidebooks. However, CHCOs and other experts said agencies are not always aware of this material and in some cases it fell short of their needs.

However, according to the  MSPB, the mechanisms put in place to ensure merit principle goals are  met have at times been seen as bureaucratic obstructions that reduce  civil service effectiveness. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)  was intended, in part, to address the difficulty of dismissing employees for  poor performance. Among other changes, CSRA established new  procedures for taking action against an employee based on poor  performance set forth under chapter 43 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.", "Despite CSRA\u2019s enactment, addressing poor performance continues to  be a complex and challenging issue for agencies to navigate. In 1996, we  testified that the redress system that grew out of CSRA and provides  protections for federal employees facing dismissal for performance or  other reasons diverts managers from more productive activities and  inhibits some of them from taking legitimate actions in response to  performance or conduct problems. In 2005, we reported on ways  agencies have sought to better address poor performance, including  more effective performance management and efforts to streamline appeal  processes. In 2014, we testified that opportunities remain for agencies to  more effectively deal with poor performance through enhanced  performance management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Multiple Avenues Available to Address Employee Performance", "paragraphs": ["In general, agencies have three means to address employees\u2019 poor  performance, with dismissal as a last resort: (1) day-to-day performance  management activities (which should be provided to all employees,  regardless of their performance levels), (2) dismissal during probationary  periods, and (3) use of formal procedures. Agencies\u2019 choices will depend  on the circumstances at hand."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effective Performance Management Can Produce Desirable Outcomes for Agencies and Employees", "paragraphs": ["The first opportunity a supervisor has to observe and correct poor  performance is in day-to-day performance management activities.  Performance management and feedback can be used to help employees  improve so that they can do the work or\u2014in the event they cannot do the  work\u2014so that they can agree to move on without going through the  dismissal process. Agencies invest significant time and resources in  recruiting potential employees, training them, and providing them with  institutional knowledge that may not be easily or cost-effectively  replaceable. Therefore, effective performance management \u2013 which  consists of activities such as expectation-setting, coaching and feedback  \u2013 can help sustain and improve the performance of more talented staff  and can help marginal performers to become better. According to officials  we interviewed and our literature review, agencies should seek ways to  improve an employee\u2019s performance and only dismiss that employee if he  or she does not reach an acceptable performance level. OPM\u2019s  experience suggests that many employees who are considered to exhibit  performance problems can often improve when action is taken to address  their performance, such as employee counseling, clarification of  expectations, or additional training. Performance improvement is  considered a win-win for both the agency and the employee because it  preserves the investments agencies have already made in that individual  and those investments that the individual has made with the agency.", "We have previously reported that day-to-day performance management  activities benefit from performance management systems that, among  other things, (1) create a clear \u201cline of sight\u201d between individual  performance and organizational success; (2) provide adequate training on  the performance management system; (3) use core competencies to  reinforce organizational objectives; (4) address performance regularly;  and (5) contain transparent processes that help agencies address  performance \u201cupstream\u201d in the process within a merit-based system that  contains appropriate safeguards. Implementing such a system requires  supervisors to communicate clear performance standards and  expectations, to provide regular feedback, and to document instances of  poor performance.", "In cases where an employee cannot do the work, regular supervisory  feedback may help the employee realize that he or she is not a good fit  for the position and should seek reassignment to a more appropriate  position within the agency or should voluntarily leave the agency, rather  than go through the dismissal process. According to the performance  management experts and labor union officials we interviewed, an  employee voluntarily leaving is almost always preferable to dismissal and  benefits all parties. Experts stated that such an arrangement can produce  the following benefits:", "The employee maintains a clean record of performance, allowing him  or her to pursue a more suitable position. Unacceptable performance  scores and dismissal actions can severely limit job prospects for the  employee, within and outside of the federal government. In some  cases, an employee leaves before a poor rating is issued. Other  times, employees and agencies may agree to have the record  expunged. Organizations we interviewed stressed that agreeing to a  clean record of performance as part of a voluntary separation can be  appropriate, particularly in cases when an employee has otherwise  demonstrated professional aptitude. They cautioned, however, that  clean record agreements must be used judiciously, in an effort to  avoid making a low-performing employee another agency\u2019s problem.", "The supervisor can focus on fulfilling the agency\u2019s mission, rather  than expending the time and energy associated with the dismissal  process.", "The agency and employee avoid costs associated with litigation.", "However, effective performance management has been a long-standing  challenge for the federal government and the issue is receiving  government-wide attention. In 2011, the National Council on Federal  Labor-Management Relations (in conjunction with the CHCO Council,  labor unions, and others) developed the Goals-Engagement- Accountability-Results (GEAR) framework. The framework was designed  to help agencies improve the assessment, selection, development, and  training of supervisors. GEAR emphasized that agencies should select  and assess supervisors based on supervisory and leadership  proficiencies rather than technical competencies, and should hold them  accountable for performance of supervisory responsibilities. In June 2014,  OPM officials said that the agency will facilitate the collaboration and  information-sharing between agencies on their approaches to implement  the principles outlined in the GEAR framework. They added that OPM will  continue to provide technical support and expertise on successful  practices for performance management.", "Given the critical role that supervisors play in performance management,  it is important for agencies to identify, promote and continue to develop  effective supervisors. However, according to CHCOs we interviewed and  to our literature review, performance management continues to be a  challenge at many agencies for three reasons:", "Some employees promoted to supervisory positions because of  their technical skill are not as inclined towards supervision.  According to CHCOs we interviewed, as higher-graded work in the  federal government is typically in managerial and supervisory  positions, career advancement in many agencies requires that  employees take on supervisory responsibilities. However, some  employees critical to meeting the agency\u2019s mission are not  interested in (or as inclined to conduct) supervisory duties, but are  promoted by the agency to increase their pay and to retain them.  As a result, some supervisors are not able to effectively conduct  performance management activities. NASA addresses this  problem by offering a dual career ladder structure: one ladder to  advance employees who may have particular technical skills  and/or education but who are not interested or inclined to pursue a  management or supervisory track, and another for those seeking  managerial responsibilities. One potential benefit to this approach  is that agencies may have more flexibility to promote supervisors  who are better positioned to effectively address poor performance.", "Supervisory training may not cover performance management  sufficiently. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4121, agencies, in consultation with  OPM, are required to establish training programs for supervisors  on actions, options, and strategies to use in relating to employees  with unacceptable performance and in improving that  performance, and in conducting employee performance  appraisals, among other things. OPM implementing regulations  state that all agencies are required to have policies to ensure they  provide training within one year of an employee\u2019s initial  appointment to a supervisory position. However, some agencies  include performance management as part of a general new  supervisory curriculum that also includes training on subjects such  as cybersecurity, ethics, and an array of human resource policy  topics. CHCOs told us that receiving training in this way can be  \u201clike drinking from a fire hose\u201d and can be difficult to fully retain,  particularly for topics that can benefit from experiential learning,  such as dealing with poor performance. Some agencies seek to  address this problem by assigning a new supervisor a mentor to  assist with ongoing coaching in performance management and in  other areas where the supervisor may have limited previous  experience.", "Agencies may not be using the supervisory probationary period as  intended. A new supervisor is given a 1-year probationary period  to demonstrate successful performance as a supervisor. During  the supervisory probationary period, the agency is to determine  whether to retain that employee as a supervisor or to return the  employee to a non-supervisory position. The MSPB found that  agencies are not consistently using the probationary period to  assess new supervisors\u2019 capabilities and supervisors in general  received varying levels of feedback from management. CHCOs  told us a related issue is that the supervisory probationary period  may not be long enough for the supervisor to conduct many  performance management responsibilities associated with the  agency\u2019s employee appraisal cycle. As a result of these issues,  agencies may not be providing adequate feedback to help new  supervisors understand where further development is needed and  if they are well suited for supervisory responsibilities, and new  supervisors may not have the opportunity to demonstrate  performance management capabilities. MSPB officials told us that  some agencies address these issues by providing details or  rotation opportunities where employees interested in supervisory  positions can observe and, as appropriate, participate in  performance management activities in other parts of the  organization. These rotations not only give the employee more  experience in that role, but can also give the agency time to  observe and assess that employee\u2019s potential for success as a  supervisor. We previously reported that within the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, where a high number of technical  experts are employed, rotational assignments are encouraged to  build supervisory capacity and to allow interested employees an  opportunity to gain new experiences and responsibilities.", "As described above, although effective performance management  continues to be a challenge at many agencies, individual agencies have  taken steps to better identify those employees with an aptitude towards  performance management, to develop related leadership skills, and to  more fully assess those employees before those individuals are given  supervisory responsibilities.

The  probationary period is the last step in the employee screening process  during which time, according to an MSPB report, the individual needs to  demonstrate \u201cwhy it is in the public interest for the government to finalize  an appointment to the civil service.\u201d The appeal rights of an individual in  the probationary period are limited. If an agency decides to remove an  individual during the probationary period, the agency is not required to  follow the formal procedures for removing an employee (described  below). Rather, the agency\u2019s only obligation is to notify the individual in  writing of its conclusions regarding the individual\u2019s inadequacies and the  effective date of the removal.", "Generally, a probationary employee may not appeal their removal.  Appeal rights are extended to employees in the competitive service and  to preference eligible employees in the excepted service who have  completed 1 year of current continuous service. Appeal rights are  extended to non-preference eligible excepted service employees after 2  years of current continuous service.", "Because dismissing a poorly performing employee becomes more difficult  and time consuming after the probationary period, it is important that  agencies use this time to assess employee performance and dismiss  those that cannot do the work. However, according to our interviews,  supervisors are often not making performance-related decisions about an  individual\u2019s future likelihood of success with the agency during the  probationary period. Interviewees said this can happen for two reasons:  (1) the supervisor may not know that the individual\u2019s probationary period  is ending, and (2) the supervisor has not had enough time to observe the  individual\u2019s performance in all critical areas of the job. Because of these  two possible issues, agencies risk continuing poorly performing  individuals in a position in the civil service, with all the rights that such an  appointment entails.", "According to OPM, to remedy the first problem, some agencies are using  a tool, such as an automatic notification issued from the agency\u2019s payroll  system, to remind supervisors that an individual\u2019s probationary period is  nearing its end and to take action as appropriate. While not all agencies  use this tool, OPM officials told us that all Shared Service Centers\u2019  existing HR systems already contain the functionality to notify supervisors  that the probationary period is ending. Because it is the agencies\u2019  decision whether or not to use automated notifications, it is important that  agencies are aware of and understand the potential benefits of this tool.  Other agencies require an affirmative decision by the individual\u2019s  supervisor (or similar official) before deciding whether to retain an  individual beyond the probationary period. By sending a reminder or  requiring an affirmative decision, supervisors know when the probationary  period is ending and are prompted to consider the prospects of the  individual, according to CHCOs we interviewed and to our literature  review. OPM considers an affirmative decision a leading practice and has  implemented it for its supervisors. However, not all agencies have an  automated tool to alert supervisors prior to the expiration of an  employee\u2019s probationary period.", "CHCOs also told us supervisors often do not have enough time to  adequately assess an individual\u2019s performance before the probationary  period ends, particularly when the occupation is complex or difficult to  assess. This can happen for a number of reasons, including  the occupation is complex and individuals on a probationary period  spend much of the first year in training before beginning work in their  assigned areas,  the occupation is project based and an individual on a probationary  period may not have an opportunity to demonstrate all of the skills  associated with the position, and   individuals on a probationary period often rotate through various  offices in the agency and supervisors have only a limited opportunity  to assess their performance.", "In the past, agencies exempt from provisions of title 5 have sought to  address this by extending the probationary period and limiting appeal  rights during that time. Unless exempt however, a decision to allow  agencies to extend probationary periods beyond 1 year and to limit  appeal rights during that period would require legislative action in certain  circumstances. CHCOs told us such an extension of the probationary  period would provide supervisors with time to make a performance  assessment for those occupations that are particularly complex or difficult  to assess. However, they cautioned that such an extension would only be  beneficial if an agency had effective performance management practices  in place and it used the extra time for the purpose intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Formal Procedures Are Required to Dismiss Poor Performing Permanent Employees, but Related Processes Are Time and Resource Intensive", "paragraphs": ["Generally, once an employee has completed a probationary period, if that  employee is a poor performer who does not voluntarily leave, an agency  is required to follow the procedural requirements under either 5 U.S.C.     \u00a7 4303 (hereinafter \u201cchapter 43\u201d) or 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 (hereinafter \u201cchapter  75\u201d) in order to take an action such as removal. Though the process for  dismissal under both authorities shares several common steps, some key  differences exist. One key difference under chapter 43 is the employee  must be given a formal opportunity to improve.", "While the law and OPM implementing regulations establish requirements  and timeframes for certain steps under chapter 43 dismissal actions,  experts representing various agency and employee perspectives told us  that the practical implementation of chapter 43 is time consuming and  resource intensive. For example, based on the experiences of experts we  interviewed, it often takes 50 to 110 days to complete steps associated  with the performance improvement period (PIP). Overall, it can take six  months to a year (and sometimes significantly longer) to dismiss an  employee. Moreover, once an employee is dismissed from his or her  agency, he or she may file an appeal with the MSPB. As we report later, it  took the MSPB an average of 243 days in 2013 to adjudicate an appeal  from start to finish. Figure 1 illustrates an example of the dismissal  process under this procedure. The timeframes cited here are not required  by statute or regulation. The length of time to address performance  problems can vary based on the facts and circumstances of each  situation.", "The other option for taking action\u2014chapter 75\u2014is largely similar to  chapter 43, but has no formal improvement period and does not require a  specific standard of performance to be established and identified in  advance. The burden of proof for sustaining a dismissal under chapter 75  is higher than under chapter 43.", "Depending on the circumstances, the differences between the two  approaches make one option preferable over the other for supervisors,  according to our interviews and literature research. For example, the  formal opportunity to improve provided by chapter 43 makes this option  preferable when there is a possibility of the employee improving after  receiving additional training or more specific expectations. In contrast,  because chapter 75 has no improvement period, it is generally faster and  therefore is preferable for agencies when it is unlikely an employee will  improve or if the poor performance is in part related to conduct issues.  Supervisors, working with agency human resources and legal counsel,  have discretion to determine the most appropriate option for dismissing  an employee for poor performance. The following table lists examples of  circumstances where the use of one authority may be more appropriate  than the other.", "Appendix II provides a full comparison of these two legal authorities for  dismissing employees for performance.", "The process for taking action against a career member of the Senior  Executive Service (SES) for a less-than-fully-successful performance  rating differs from that for other civil servants.

Removals from the SES for performance  reasons may not be appealed to the MSPB. However, non-probationary  career executives may request an informal hearing before an official  designated by the MSPB. Additionally, an executive who believes the  removal action was based on discrimination may file a discrimination  complaint with their agency. Or, if an executive believes the removal was  based on a prohibited personnel practice, such as reprisal for  whistleblowing, they may go to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to  seek corrective action.

During this appeal, an employee has a right to a hearing before an MSPB  administrative judge. If the employee or agency is unsatisfied with the  administrative judge\u2019s initial decision, either may request that the full 3- member board review the matter by filing a petition for review. If the  employee is unsatisfied with the final decision of the MSPB, the employee  may seek judicial review of that decision, generally with the United States  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit).

As depicted earlier in figure 1, the  time commitment for removing an employee under chapter 43 can be  substantial. After communicating performance problems to an employee,  a supervisor will likely find it necessary to increase the frequency of  monitoring and documentation he or she conducts and of feedback  sessions he or she provides during the performance improvement period.

To more effectively ensure that agencies have a well-qualified cadre  of supervisors capable of effectively addressing poor performance,  determine if promising practices at some agencies should be more  widely used government-wide. Such practices include (1) extending  the supervisory probationary period beyond 1-year to include at least  one full employee appraisal cycle; (2) providing detail opportunities or  rotational assignments to supervisory candidates prior to promotion,  where the candidate can develop and demonstrate supervisory  competencies; and (3) using a dual career ladder structure as a way  to advance employees who may have particular technical skills and/or  education but who are not interested in or inclined to pursue a  management or supervisory track.  2.  To help ensure supervisors obtain the skills needed to effectively  conduct performance management responsibilities, assess the  adequacy of leadership training that agencies provide to supervisors.  3.  To help supervisors make effective use of the probationary period for educate agencies on the benefits of using automated notifications  to notify supervisors that an individual\u2019s probationary period is  ending and that the supervisor needs to make an affirmative  decision or otherwise take appropriate action, and encourage its  use to the extent it is appropriate and cost-effective for the  agency; and determine whether there are occupations in which\u2014because of  the nature of work and complexity\u2014the probationary period  should extend beyond 1-year to provide supervisors with sufficient  time to assess an individual\u2019s performance. If determined to be  warranted, initiate the regulatory process to extend existing  probationary periods and, where necessary, develop a legislative  proposal for congressional action to ensure that formal procedures  for taking action against an employee for poor performance (and a  right to appeal such an action) are not afforded until after the  completion of any extended probationary period.  4. To help ensure OPM\u2019s tools and guidance for dealing with poor  performers are cost-effectively meeting agencies\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 needs,  use SHCM survey results (once available), FEVS results, PAAT  responses, and other existing information, as relevant, to inform decisions  on content and distribution methods.
