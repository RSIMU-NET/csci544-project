GAO's prior work on pandemics and human capital issues has shown that agencies should consider a range of factors to carry out their missions while protecting their workforce and the members of the public with whom they interact.", "Key considerations for federal workers' reentry to workplaces . As federal agencies manage operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and plan for their employees to safely return to workplaces, GAO's prior work has shown that it is important for agencies to identify mission essential functions that cannot be performed remotely when deciding who needs to return to the office. Agencies should also consider the exposure risk level and local conditions when deciding whether to reopen offices across the country. To protect employees as they reenter the workforce, it will be important for agencies to have appropriate protection measures in place. For example, agencies should consider how they can ensure adequate distribution of hygiene supplies. They should also consider changes to the work environment to reduce workplace hazards, and implement social distancing strategies.", "How the Census Bureau decided to resume Decennial Census operations. The U.S. Census Bureau offers an example of how an agency suspended and resumed operations under the current pandemic. In March 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau suspended field operations of the Decennial Census and took a phased approach to resuming operations at its area census offices. As of June 11, all area census offices had resumed operations. Key aspects of resuming operations at area census offices included: (1) taking a phased approach to restarting operations, such as resuming operations that required less physical interaction first; (2) making operational changes to minimize face-to-face interactions; (3) addressing worker safety concerns; and (4) communicating pandemic plans to ensure continued operations.", "Key practices for ensuring telework contributes to continuity of operations. Several key practices GAO previously identified are useful for agencies to help ensure telework contributes to continuity of operations during the current pandemic and in the future. Specifically, agencies should consider based on their current experiences whether: (1) their policies and guidance related to telework are sufficient to ensure that their workforces are telework ready and balances are struck between employees' personal circumstances and work responsibilities; (2) the extent to which their telework infrastructure, including technical support and security, is adequate to support increased telework; (3) procedures and standards are in place that ensure telework does not diminish organizational and employee performance; and (4) the processes, procedures, and tracking systems to collect data provide the information needed to evaluate the use of telework. These assessments will assist agencies in considering broader changes to their policies and procedures related to telework as employees are called back to their duty stations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss how our previous work on  pandemics, the 2020 Decennial Census and federal telework, may inform  key decisions by federal agencies as they plan to safely return federal  employees to their official duty stations.

Agencies should  consider making decisions about reentry, including precautions and  safeguards agencies take, based on the local prevalence of the pandemic  at each site. As agencies consider local conditions for reentry, they  should share information and cooperate with other agencies located in  the same area.

These practices may be especially important if substantial  numbers of employees remain out of their workplaces for an extended  period or if agencies need to reverse their reentry decisions based on  changing public health circumstances. In addition, agencies\u2019 experiences  with telework during the current pandemic may suggest opportunities to  increase the availability of telework in the future.

Agencies should assess whether their  policies and guidance were sufficient to ensure that their workforces were  telework ready and understood the agency\u2019s expectation of employees  regarding teleworking during this emergency. The current crisis presents  an opportunity for agencies to assess their established policies or  requirements to ensure that they (1) balance employees\u2019 personal  circumstances and work responsibilities, and (2) effectively facilitated  communication and engagement among teleworkers, managers, and  coworkers. Agencies should institute processes for communicating  human-capital guidance for emergencies (e.g., pay, leave, benefits) to  ensure they worked effectively.", "For example, agencies should consider whether emergency employees  (including COOP employees) knew in advance about their mission critical  status. If not, agencies should ensure that, in case of future emergencies  including a potential resurgence of COVID-19, employees are notified  about requirements to report for work, remain at work, work at home, or  report to an alternative work site when government operations are  disrupted.", "Similarly, agencies should consider whether their guidance on workplace  health and safety issues was adequate to ensure that teleworkers had  safe and adequate places to work off-site, and whether information- security training was provided to all individuals, or managers of  individuals, who teleworked during the current pandemic.
