HUD is one of the nation\u2019s largest financial institutions, responsible for managing more than a reported $454 billion in mortgage insurance and, as of September 30, 1997, a reported $531 billion in guarantees of mortgage-backed securities. For fiscal year 1998, the agency\u2019s budget authority was about $24 billion, and its information technology budget was $222 million.", "HUD\u2019s major program areas are managed by the Office of Housing, which includes FHA\u2019s insurance and project-based rental assistance programs; the Office of Community Planning and Development, which includes programs for Community Development Block Grants, empowerment zones/enterprise communities, and assistance for the homeless; the Office of Public and Indian Housing, which provides funds to help operate and modernize public and Indian housing and administers tenant-based rental assistance programs; and the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which is responsible for investigating complaints and ensuring compliance with fair housing laws.", "In 1984, we reported that HUD lacked adequate information and financial management systems necessary to ensure accountability for, and control over, departmental programs. In 1989, HUD was involved in highly publicized scandals that included instances in which private real estate agents were able to steal millions of dollars by retaining the proceeds from the sale of FHA-owned properties, rather than transferring the funds to the Treasury. In 1992, we reported that these scandals were attributed, in large part, to fundamental deficiencies in the department\u2019s information and financial management systems. In particular, HUD\u2019s systems were inadequate, lacked credibility and internal controls, and failed to meet program managers\u2019 needs or provide adequate support for oversight of housing and community development programs.", "To address fundamental deficiencies in the department\u2019s information and financial systems and meet the requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which called for financial management reform across the federal government, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development initiated a number of actions. These actions included the appointment of a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to oversee the department\u2019s financial operations and initiation of a major Financial Systems Integration (FSI) effort to strengthen its financial management systems. Although HUD proceeded with this high priority effort, it continued to be affected by poorly integrated, ineffective, and generally unreliable information systems that did not satisfy management needs or provide adequate support to control housing and community development programs.", "In 1994, we designated the department a high-risk area, in part because of its inadequate information and financial management systems and slow progress in correcting fundamental management weaknesses that had allowed the 1989 scandals to occur. By 1997, we reported that HUD had formulated approaches and initiated actions to address departmentwide deficiencies, including information and financial management systems problems, but many of these actions were far from being completed.

The plan\u2019s primary objective was, therefore, to implement an integrated financial management system that would meet the department\u2019s program and financial management needs. The 1991 plan contained specific objectives to establish sound financial management controls, correct material weaknesses, improve financial management, provide timely and accurate information to managers to enable them to meet their organizational objectives, meet the goals of section 4 of the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 and comply with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular A-127.", "HUD\u2019s strategy for achieving the FSI objectives was to replace about 100 separate financial and mixed systems with nine new fully integrated systems. This strategy was based on an analysis which concluded that HUD did not have the basic financial management systems to serve as the foundation for an integrated systems environment. The design of the 1991 FSI plan required that eight financial systems be integrated with the new core accounting system and this design was consistent with the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program\u2019s (JFMIP) framework for financial management systems. Once the nine new standard systems were deployed, program offices were to use them to support their business operations. In addition, the plan noted that it would be necessary to make interim improvements to existing systems, since the integration effort would be a long-term project. The interim improvements would be needed to manage programs, comply with legal mandates, and correct material weaknesses until the nine new systems became available. The department estimated that it would cost about $103 million to develop and deploy the nine systems called for in the 1991 FSI plan by September 1998. Table 1 shows the objectives, estimated development and deployment costs, and scheduled deployment dates for the nine planned integrated systems.", "According to HUD\u2019s CFO, in fiscal years 1992 and 1993, HUD spent about $58 million on FSI. Specifically, $48 million was spent on interim improvements to legacy systems, and $10 million was spent on the Core Accounting System and Mortgage Insurance System projects. During this period, HUD (1) procured Federal Financial System (FFS), a commercial off-the-shelf software package to serve as the department\u2019s Core Accounting System, (2) halted its efforts to develop the Mortgage Insurance System as a result of poor planning, and (3) terminated the Grants, Subsidies, and Loans project because the department could not streamline its grants process.

In addition, the 1993 plan included new objectives, such as eliminating the department\u2019s financial systems from OMB\u2019s list of high-risk areas for management improvement, being consistent with HUD\u2019s reform plan, and meeting the requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993.", "The implementation strategy for the 1993 FSI plan was markedly different from that of the 1991 plan. Under the 1993 FSI plan, the CFO\u2019s office was required to complete the core financial system project initiated under the 1991 strategy and program offices were required to develop (1) new systems that would support program management priorities, financial and management information needs, and business needs and (2) integrate these systems with the core financial system. Plans for the remaining eight standard systems called for in the 1991 strategy were cancelled. As in 1991, the conceptual design of the 1993 FSI strategy was consistent with the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program\u2019s requirement that the core financial system receive data from other financial and mixed systems.

Therefore, HUD had no assurance that it had selected the most cost-beneficial solution for FSI. In 1995, the department estimated that the development and deployment cost of the 1993 strategy would be about $209 million. Also, the department extended the deployment date to December 1998, 3 months after the initial scheduled completion date of September 1998.

Also, program offices had not yet developed the interfaces between the mixed systems and the core financial system. The CFO also stated that the revised FSI strategy had to conform with the HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan, which established an October 1999 deadline for fully deploying an integrated core financial system and called for repairing or replacing the department\u2019s existing mixed systems and developing new systems to support the reforms. The primary objective of the 1997 FSI plan was consistent with the 1991 and 1993 FSI plans\u2014to implement an integrated financial management system, consisting of both financial and mixed systems, that would provide the information necessary to carry out financial and programmatic missions of the department. However, as in 1993, HUD did not perform any cost-benefit analyses despite the additional systems and schedule changes required by the plan. As a result, HUD cannot assure that the 1997 strategy is the most cost-beneficial alternative.", "As of May 1998, the CFO had identified nine projects for the 1997 FSI strategy, including five that were started under the 1993 FSI plan (i.e., HUDCAPS, FHAMIS, GEMS, IDIS, and IBS), and four new projects required to support HUD\u2019s 2020 Management Reform Plan. The objective of the HUDCAPS project, however, was expanded to centralize the development of interfaces between mixed systems and the core financial management system. New projects in the 1997 plan include developing interfaces between HUD\u2019s geographic information system and data warehouses, and deploying an executive information system, Real Estate Management System, and FHA\u2019s Financial Data Warehouse.", "The cost and schedule estimates to complete the 1997 FSI strategy have not been finalized, and the FSI cost estimate through September 1999 has fluctuated considerably.

Therefore, the July 1998 estimated deployment date was not met. In addition to the work completed under the 1993 FSI plan, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) deployed an enhanced version of the first module for the Grants Evaluation Management System (GEMS) that supports the pre-award process and completed the development of the second module to support grantee tracking in fiscal year 1998. This system is being used by FHEO to monitor its two major grant programs. In addition to the work completed under the 1993 FSI plan and to carry out Federal Housing Administration Mortgage Insurance System (FHAMIS) goals in the information strategy plans and resulting from business process reviews, the Office of Housing deployed and is using the Single Family Premium Collection Subsystem to collect and account for premiums.

For example, the Single Family Acquired Asset Management System (SAMS) replacement system which was developed and deployed as part of the FHAMIS 1993 FSI project, was delivered late and over budget and did not meet critical user needs because it was poorly managed. HUD estimated that the SAMS replacement system would be developed and deployed for about $3.2 million in 6 months. However, HUD awarded the contract to develop SAMS before adequately defining the system\u2019s requirements. As a result, the cost of SAMS grew tenfold to over $32 million, the system was deployed 10 months late, and the system did not meet some critical user needs.

Although these criteria called for information on the duration of the project, cost for fiscal year 1997 through full deployment, technical risks, and impact on HUD\u2019s mission and customer needs, the screening criteria did not include return-on-investment thresholds or full life-cycle cost estimates as required by OMB\u2019s guidance on evaluating information technology investments.", "Investment proposals were then analyzed, scored and ranked using the same criteria and data that were used in the screening process. However, the screening criteria did not require accurate and complete data on life-cycle costs, benefits, risks, project schedules or the corresponding analyses that were conducted to develop these estimates. For example, after reviewing investment proposal data for six FSI projects, we found that only two included life-cycle cost estimates and none included cost-benefit analyses or risk mitigation plans. Therefore, HUD made investment decisions without the information needed for a thorough understanding of the projects to make the necessary trade-offs among them. Finally, HUD\u2019s selection process was also insufficient since it did not establish project review schedules for selected projects as required by best practices.", "In fiscal year 1998, HUD did not use its selection process because the Secretary required that investment decisions be based on whether the proposed projects supported the department management and organizational changes called for in the HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan. As in fiscal year 1997, decisions made in 1998 were not based on reliable estimates of life-cycle costs, benefits, and return on investment. HUD is using its fiscal year 1997 selection process to make fiscal year 1999 investment decisions. In addition, HUD has deployed the Information Technology Investment Portfolio System (I-TIPS)\u2014a generic system developed by the Department of Energy\u2014to automate and support the management of information technology capital planning and integrate this planning with the department\u2019s budget process. HUD is using I-TIPS to support its processes to screen, score, and select information technology proposals for fiscal year 1999 and plans to use I-TIPS when making investment decisions for fiscal year 2000. However, because HUD has not corrected its selection process and still does not require complete, accurate, and current data to select information technology investments, there is no assurance that HUD\u2019s 1999 investments decisions will be better than they have been in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Lacks Disciplined Processes to Control and Evaluate Selected Information Technology Investments", "paragraphs": ["Once information technology projects are selected, they should be consistently monitored and controlled through progress reviews at key milestone dates. Progress reviews should assess several aspects of the project, including deliverables, methodology, technical issues, schedule, costs, benefits, and risks. Further, once a project has been fully implemented, it should be evaluated through post-implementation reviews. The post-implementation reviews should provide (1) a project assessment, including an evaluation of customer/user satisfaction and how well the project met its estimated cost and schedule and provided mission-related benefits, and (2) lessons learned so that the investment decision-making processes can be improved.", "HUD does not have an adequate process to control investments or a process to evaluate investments. In 1997, the Technology Investment Board working group was established to monitor approved projects and advise the Technology Investment Board executive committee whether to continue, modify, or terminate them. However, the Director for IRM Planning and Management stated that the working group mostly monitors annual project expenditures and the rate of expenditure for any given fiscal year. This degree of oversight is not adequate because it is not based on the project-specific measures required to effectively monitor and control information technology projects. These measures include (1) an accumulation of actual cost data and comparisons to estimated cost levels, (2) a comparison of the estimated and actual schedule, (3) a comparison of expected and actual benefits realized, and (4) an assessment of risks. The information should be regularly collected, updated, and provided to decisionmakers to support effective project monitoring.", "The department also lacks a method for evaluating investments and thus does not perform post-implementation reviews or use lessons learned to improve the investment process. HUD\u2019s Director for IRM Planning and Management acknowledged these weaknesses in both the control and evaluation phases of the investment process and added that HUD plans to define these processes by the spring of 1999, before it deploys future releases of I-TIPS. Without processes to control and evaluate investments, HUD cannot (1) determine if projects should be modified, continued, accelerated, or terminated, (2) determine whether a project has met its objectives, (3) compare projected costs and schedules to actual costs incurred and implementation dates, and (4) identify ways to modify or improve its investment management process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Cost Estimating Processes Do Not Meet Accepted Practices", "paragraphs": ["Reliable cost estimates are essential for making effective information technology investment decisions.

According to SEI, an organization must have all six requisite processes to consistently produce reliable cost estimates. These requisites are the following: a corporate memory (or historical database), which includes cost estimates, revisions, reasons for revisions, actuals, and relevant contextual information; structured processes for estimating software size and the amount and complexity of existing software that can be reused; cost models calibrated and tuned to reflect demonstrated accomplishments on similar past projects; audit trails that record and explain the values used as cost model inputs; processes for dealing with externally imposed cost or schedule constraints in order to ensure the integrity of the estimating process; and data collection and feedback processes that foster capturing and correctly interpreting data from work performed.", "The Director of HUD\u2019s Systems Engineering Group stated that the department\u2019s processes do not satisfy SEI\u2019s software cost estimating criteria. As shown in table 4, HUD\u2019s cost estimating processes for FSI projects partially meet one, but do not meet the remaining five institutional process requisites that experts say are embedded in leading information technology development and acquisition organizations.", "According to the Director of the Systems Engineering Group, HUD uses its experience in working with the program offices on software development efforts, rather than cost models, to develop cost estimates. The director acknowledged that HUD does not have an automated historical database to use when developing estimates for new FSI projects; instead, separate project files are kept with historical data on individual projects. The director was unsure of the usefulness of these files because they are not updated to identify and correct inconsistencies. Finally, HUD does not update or regularly review its initial cost estimates. As a result, HUD does not have adequate assurance that FSI cost estimates are consistently reliable.

According to several FSI project managers, cost-benefit analyses are performed only once\u2014to initiate a new information technology project. The project managers stated that the analyses are not updated, although they do prepare yearly project funding requests as part of the budget process. These requests, however, do not reflect any changes to the costs or benefits of a project. Therefore, HUD cannot compare current cost estimates and actual expenditures to determine whether unfavorable cost or benefit variances exist. As a result, HUD may continue to invest in a system without knowing whether costs or benefits have changed enough to warrant discontinuing further investment.", "The Office of the Inspector General found similar problems in 1996 and recommended that HUD\u2019s Office of Information Technology establish guidance and define management responsibilities for updating the cost-benefit analysis at appropriate intervals. HUD responded to this recommendation by stating that its September 1995 Benefit/Cost Analysis Methodology, Volume I and Benefit/Cost Analysis Workbook, Volume II define and guide the development of the required components of a cost-benefit analysis and management\u2019s responsibility for periodically updating an analysis. The requirement to use and document cost-benefit analyses in accordance with the methodology and workbook was included in the March 1997 revision of HUD\u2019s system development methodology.", "According to HUD\u2019s IRM Director for Planning and Management, although the system development methodology requires the use of both the cost-benefit analysis methodology and the workbook, the department has not officially mandated the use of either one. In addition, several FSI project managers told us that these standards are generally not followed. The director added that the quality, depth, and documentation supporting cost-benefit analyses for FSI projects have been inconsistent. For example, we found the IDIS cost-benefit analysis was well documented and included a discussion of the assumptions and constraints used in performing the analysis, information on recurring and nonrecurring costs, and the estimated life-cycle cost of the system.

HUD has not yet finalized project plans or cost and schedule estimates for completing all of the components of the latest FSI plan. Without such plans, the department is likely to continue to spend millions of dollars more, miss milestones, and still not fully meet its objective of developing and fully deploying an integrated financial management system.", "Cost increases and schedule delays have been caused by (1) changes to the FSI strategy that were not supported by thorough analyses and (2) inadequate project management and oversight. In addition, the Year 2000 computing crisis has impacted the schedule for the FHAMIS effort.
