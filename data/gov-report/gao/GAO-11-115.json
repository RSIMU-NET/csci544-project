The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for processing claims for these new education benefits. VA concluded that its legacy systems and manual processes were insufficient to support the new benefits and, therefore, began an initiative to modernize its benefits processing capabilities. The long-term solution was to provide a fully automated end-to-end information technology (IT) system to support the delivery of benefits by December 2010. VA chose an incremental development approach, called Agile software development, which is intended to deliver functionality in short increments before the system is fully deployed. GAO was asked to (1) determine the status of VA's development and implementation of its IT system to support the implementation of education benefits identified in the Post-9/11 GI Bill and (2) evaluate the department's effectiveness in managing its IT project for this initiative."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VA has made important progress in delivering key automated capabilities to process the new education benefits. Specifically, it deployed the first two of four releases of its long-term system solution by its planned dates, thereby providing regional processing offices with key automated capabilities to prepare original and amended benefit claims. In addition, the Agile process allowed the department the flexibility to accommodate legislative changes and provide functionality according to business priorities. While progress has been made, VA did not ensure that certain critical tasks were completed that were initially expected to be included in the second release by June 30, 2010. For example, the conversion of data from systems in the interim solution to systems developed for the long-term solution was not completed until August 23, 2010. Because of the delay, VA planned to reprioritize the functionality that was to be included in the third release. Further, while VA plans to include full self-service capabilities to veterans, it will not do so in the fourth release as scheduled; instead it intends to provide this capability after the release or in a separate initiative. VA reported obligations and expenditures for these releases, through July 2010, to be approximately $84.6 million, with additional planned obligations of $122.5 million through fiscal year 2011. VA has taken important steps by demonstrating a key Agile practice essential to effectively managing its system development--establishing a cross-functional team that involves senior management, governance boards, key stakeholders, and distinct Agile roles. In addition, VA made progress toward demonstrating three other Agile practices--focusing on business priorities, delivering functionality in short increments, and inspecting and adapting the project as appropriate. Specifically, to ensure business priorities are a focus, VA established a vision that captures the project purpose and goals and established a plan to maintain requirements traceability. To aid in delivering functionality, the department established an incremental testing approach. It also used an oversight tool, which was intended to allow the project to be inspected and adapted by management. However, VA could make further improvements to these practices. In this regard, it did not (1) establish metrics for the goals or prioritize project constraints; (2) always maintain traceability between legislation, policy, business rules, and test cases; (3) establish criteria for work that was considered \"done\" at all levels of the project; (4) provide for quality unit and functional testing during the second release, as GAO found that 10 of the 20 segments of system functionality were inadequate; and (5) implement an oversight tool that depicted the rate of the work completed and the changes to project scope over time. Until VA improves these areas, management will lack the visibility it needs to clearly communicate progress and unresolved issues in its development processes may not allow VA to maximize the benefits of the system. To help guide the full development and implementation of the long-term solution, GAO is recommending that VA take five actions to improve its development process for its new education benefits system. VA concurred with three of GAO's five recommendations and provided details on planned actions, but did not concur with the remaining two."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In June 2008, Congress passed the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational  Assistance Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as the Post-9/11 GI Bill or  Chapter 33).

As a result, the department undertook an initiative to modernize  its education benefits processing capabilities. This initiative involved an  interim solution that augmented existing processes by providing  temporary applications to manually collect data and a long-term solution  to deliver automated processing capabilities. The department intended to  complete enough of the system functionality in the long-term solution to  replace the interim solution by June 2010, and to include additional  capabilities, such as interfaces to legacy systems, to provide a fully  automated end-to-end system to support the delivery of education benefits  by December 2010.", "To develop the system for its long-term solution, VA is relying on  contractor assistance and is using an incremental development approach,  called Agile software development, which is to deliver software  functionality in short increments before the system is fully deployed. Agile  software development stresses the use of key practices such as working as  one team to define business priorities and, based on those priorities,  delivering work in short increments. Each increment of work is inspected  by the team and the project\u2019s plans and priorities are adapted accordingly.", "Given the importance of delivering education benefits to veterans and  their families, we were asked to review the long-term solution to    determine the status of VA\u2019s development and implementation of its  information technology (IT) system to support the implementation of  education benefits identified in the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and    evaluate the department\u2019s effectiveness in managing its IT project for this  initiative.", "As agreed with your offices, on September 13, 2010, we provided briefing  slides that outlined the results of our study to staff of your Subcommittee  on Economic Opportunity.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "In summary, our study highlighted the following:    VA has made important progress in developing and implementing the first  two of four releases of software planned for its new education benefits  processing system as scheduled, with these deployments occurring on  March 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010. In doing so, the department provided its  regional processing offices with key automated capabilities to prepare  original and amended benefit claims. It also responded to legislative  changes and provided for housing rate adjustments. While VA did not  previously estimate cost for these releases and, as such, could not track  estimated to actual costs, it reported that about $84.6 million had been  obligated through July 2010. The department noted that its Agile process  allowed the flexibility to adapt to legislative changes and provide  functionality according to business priorities.", "However, VA did not ensure that certain critical tasks were completed that  were initially expected to be included in the second release by June 30,  2010. Specifically, the department did not complete the conversion of data  from systems in the interim solution to the systems developed for the long- term solution because it was found to be more complex than the  department had anticipated. The department also did not complete the  development of interfaces between the new system and legacy systems.  Program officials stated that data conversion was included along with  housing rate adjustments in a sub-release that was later deployed on  August 23, 2010. Because of these delays, VA planned to reprioritize what  functionality would be developed in its third release by September 30,  2010. For its fourth release, it intends to reduce its planned functionality of  providing full self-service capabilities to veterans by December 31, 2010.  The department intends to provide this capability after its fourth release or  under a separate initiative. As such, VA estimates that the total system  development actual and planned obligations through 2011 will be about  $207.1 million.", "VA has demonstrated key Agile practices that are essential to effectively  managing its system development, but certain practices can be improved.  Specifically, the department ensured that teams represented key  stakeholders and that distinct Agile roles were fulfilled. For example, the  teams consisted of subject matter experts, programmers, testers, analysts,  engineers, architects, and designers. The department also made progress  toward demonstrating the three other Agile practices\u2014focusing on  business priorities, delivering functionality in short increments, and  inspecting and adapting the project as appropriate. However, VA can  improve its effectiveness in these areas.", "Business priorities. To ensure business priorities are a focus, a project  starts with a vision that contains, among other things, a purpose, goals,  metrics, and constraints. In addition, it should be traceable to  requirements. VA established a vision that captured the project purpose  and goals; however, it had not established metrics for the project\u2019s  goals or prioritized project constraints. Department officials stated that  project documentation is evolving and they intend to improve their  processes based on lessons learned; however, until it identifies metrics  and constraints, the department will not have the means to compare  the projected performance and actual results of this goal. VA had also  established a plan that identified how to maintain requirements  traceability within an Agile environment; however, the traceability  between legislation, policy, business rules, and test cases was not  always maintained. VA stated that its requirements tool did not  previously have the capability to perform this function but now  provides this traceability to test cases. Nonetheless, if the department  does not ensure that requirements are traceable to legislation, policies,  and business rules, it has limited assurance that the requirements will  be fully met.", "Deliver functionality in short increments. To aid in delivering  functionality in short increments, defining what constitutes completed  work (work that is \u201cdone\u201d) and testing functionality is critical.  However, VA had not established criteria for work that was considered  \u201cdone\u201d at all levels of the project. Program officials stated that each  development team had its own definition of \u201cdone\u201d and agreed that  they needed to provide a standard definition across all teams. If VA  does not mutually agree upon a definition of \u201cdone\u201d at each level,  confusion about what constitutes completed work can lead to  inconsistent quality and it may not be able to clearly communicate how  much work remains. In addition, while the department had established  an incremental testing approach, the quality of unit and functional  testing performed during Release 2 was inadequate in 10 of the 20  segments of system functionality we reviewed. Program officials stated  that they placed higher priority on user acceptance testing at the end of  a release and relied on users to identify defects that were not detected  during unit and functional testing. Until the department improves  testing quality, it risks deploying future releases that contain defects  which may require rework.", "Inspect and adapt. In order for projects to be effectively inspected and  adapted, management must have tools to provide effective oversight. For  Agile development, progress and the amount of work remaining can be  reflected in a burn-down chart, which depicts how factors such as the  rate at which work is completed (velocity) and changes in overall  product scope affect the project over time. While VA had an oversight  tool that showed the percentage of work completed to reflect project  status at the end of each iteration, it did not depict the velocity of the  work completed and the changes to scope over time. Program officials  stated that their current reporting did not show the changes in project  scope because their focus was on metrics that are forward looking  rather than showing past statistics for historical comparison. However,  without this level of visibility in its reporting, management may not have  all the information it needs to fully understand project status."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA deployed the first two of four releases of its long-term system solution  by its planned dates, therefore providing improved claims-processing  functionality to all regional processing offices, such as the ability to  calculate original and amended benefit claims.

However, key features of the solution were not  completed as intended in the second release because the department  found some functionality to be more complex than anticipated.  Specifically, interfaces to legacy systems and the conversion of data from  systems in the interim solution were not completed as intended in the  second release. Due to these delays, VA planned to reprioritize what  functionality would be included in its third release. Also, for its fourth  release, the department had reduced a significant planned functionality\u2014 veteran self-service capability.

However, the  department had not ensured that several key Agile practices were  performed. Measurable goals were not developed and the project  progressed without bidirectional traceability in its requirements.  Additionally, in developing the system, VA did not establish a common  standard and consistent definition for work to be considered \u201cdone\u201d or  develop oversight tools to clearly communicate velocity and the changes  to project scope over time. Testing deficiencies further hindered VA\u2019s  assurances that all critical system defects would be identified. Until VA  improves these areas, management does not have the visibility it needs to  clearly communicate progress to stakeholders and estimate when future  system capabilities will be delivered. Additionally, reduced visibility and  unresolved issues in its development processes may result in the  department continuing to remove functionality that was expected in future  releases, thus delivering a system that does not fully and effectively  support the implementation of education benefits as identified in the Post- 9/11 GI Bill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help guide the full development and implementation of the Chapter 33  long-term solution, we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  direct the Under Secretary for Benefits to take the following five actions:    establish performance measures for goals and identify constraints to  provide better clarity in the vision and expectations of the project;    establish bidirectional traceability between requirements and legislation,  policies, and business rules to provide assurance that the system will be  developed as expected;    define the conditions that must be present to consider work \u201cdone\u201d in  adherence with agency policy and guidance;  implement an oversight tool to clearly communicate velocity and the  changes to project scope over time; and  improve the adequacy of the unit and functional testing processes to  reduce the amount of system rework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs and VA\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Information and  Technology. In the Secretary\u2019s comments, reproduced in appendix II, VA  concurred with three of our recommendations and did not concur with  two recommendations. Specifically, the department concurred with our  recommendation to establish performance measures for goals and identify  constraints to provide better clarity in the vision and expectations of the  project. VA noted that it plans to develop performance measures  consistent with automating the Post-9/11 GI Bill by March 2011. While this  is a positive step, as we noted, it is also important that the department  identify any project or business constraints to better clarify the vision and  expectations of the system. VA also concurred with our recommendation  that it establish bidirectional traceability between requirements and  legislation, policies, and business rules to provide assurance that the  system will be developed as expected. The department stated that it plans  to establish traceability between its business rules for the long-term  solution and the legislation by June 2011. Additionally, VA concurred with  our recommendation to define the conditions that must be present to  consider work \u201cdone\u201d in adherence with department policy and guidance.  VA noted that the initiative\u2019s fiscal year 2011 operating plan outlines these  conditions at the project level and that it intends to clarify the definition at  the working group level by December 2010.", "VA did not concur with our recommendation that it implement an  oversight tool to clearly communicate velocity and the changes to project  scope over time. The department indicated that development metrics and  models had already been established and implemented to forecast and  measure development velocity. In this regard, as our briefing noted,  department officials stated that they previously reported project-level  metrics during the first release, and based on lessons learned, decided to  shift to reporting metrics at the development team level. While it is  important that VA established the capability to track team-level metrics, it  is also important to track and clearly report how changes to the system  development at the team level affect the overall project-level scope over  time. Specifically, without the overall velocity\u2014a key mechanism under  the Agile methodology\u2014VA does not have the information to understand  the expected effort to complete the total scope of work and the associated  length of time to do so. The overall velocity provides an understanding of  the complexity and difficulty in accomplishing tasks and provides VA  management with information to better understand project risks. This  visibility is a key concept of the Agile methodology that VA has chosen to  implement for this project. Without this level of visibility in its reporting,  management and the development teams may not have all the information  they need to fully understand project status and generate the discussion  and feedback necessary for continuous process improvement. Therefore,  we continue to believe that our recommendation for VA to clearly  communicate velocity and project scope changes can only strengthen the  department\u2019s development process to be more in line with Agile system  development practices.", "VA also did not concur with our recommendation to improve the adequacy  of the unit and functional testing processes to reduce the amount of  system rework. While the department noted that its testing approach is  compatible with Agile development, it also acknowledged in other  technical comments the department provided that there were instances of  inconsistencies of user stories for capabilities being marked \u201cdone\u201d and  the user stories we reviewed during the second release showed significant  weaknesses in the quality of testing performed. While we agree that VA\u2019s  testing approach is consistent with Agile methodology, these weaknesses  we identified demonstrate ineffective testing and the need for a consistent  and agreed-upon definition of \u201cdone.\u201d Further, the program officials noted  that their approach focused on users identifying defects at the end of the  release, which, as we have noted, can be problematic because it is difficult  for users to remember all the items and parameters needed for  functionality. Without increased focus on the quality of testing early in the  development process, VA risks delaying functionality and/or deploying  functionality with unknown defects that could require future rework that  may be costly and ultimately impede the claims examiners\u2019 ability to  process claims efficiently. Therefore, we continue to believe that our  recommendation to improve the adequacy of unit and functional testing is  needed to improve the effectiveness of VA\u2019s process called for in the Agile  methodology. This would provide stakeholders greater assurance that  functionality developed during each iteration is of releasable quality  before it is presented to users as completed work in accordance with Agile  system development practices.", "In addition, VA provided other technical comments on a draft of this  report. In the comments, the department provided additional clarification  on why there were delays to functionality and how they affected the  release schedule. Specifically, the department stated that the governance  structure it established for the initiative provided the necessary  management, support, and prioritization of development efforts to balance desired functionality within the development challenges and constraint The department noted that, among other things, delays in the firs t two  releases were a result of additional functionality prioritized and developed, such as housing rate adjustments and the ability to  automatically generate letters for veterans as well as unanticipated  challenges, such as the complexity of data conversion tasks. Further, it  noted that decisions and prioritizations were primarily made to min impact on field offices and to support fall enrollment and that they  impacted the development capacity to support the capabilities tha be developed in the third release. VA also offered oth comments which were incorporated as appropriate.  s.", "Beyond the department\u2019s comments on our recommendations, the  Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology provided additional  written comments, reproduced in appendix III, which noted concerns with our draft report. In these comments, the Assistant Secretary stated that the department believes we fell short of meeting the objectives for this repo by omitting key facts and presenting an unnecessarily negative view of VA\u2019s status and effectiveness to Congress. In particular, the Assistant  Secretary stated that VA had successfully converted all processing of new  Post-9/11 GI Bill claims to the long-term solution prior to the  commencement of the fall 2010 enrollment process and that processing with the new system has been nearly flawless. He added that Veterans  Business Administration claims processors like the new system and find it easy and effective to use. We are encouraged to hear that the department   that  is experiencing positive results from the system development efforts have been accomplished. However, as noted in our briefing, system  functionality that was envisioned to (1) provide self-service capabilities to  as  veterans and (2) end-to-end processing of benefits by December 2010 w deferred. Further, as the vision for its new education benefits system  evolves, it is essential that the department documents these changes to  ensure that its expecta aligned at all levels.    tions and goals for the system are measurable and  In addition, the Assistant Secretary stated that limited exposure to the  Agile methodology possibly caused us to present incorrect assumptions as facts, such as our evaluation of the department\u2019s testing. Our audit team,  which included a trained ScrumMaster, examined the department\u2019s use of  Agile Scrum practices against documented and accepted methodologies  and consulted with an expert in the field that is not only a ScrumMaster,  but also an Agile Scrum trainer that has extensive experience in evalu ating  Agile system development projects. At the initiation of our study, we  discussed our evaluation approach with program officials and throughout  the study, held meetings with them to ensure our full understanding of the  department\u2019s requirements and testing processes. We did not take issue  with the Agile testing approach used by VA. However, we found  deficiencies in testing. Further, we presented the results of our  observations to program officials in June 2010, at which time they did not  express any such concerns, or otherwise comment on our evaluation of  the testing. Further, given the evolving nature of Agile system  development, it is important to ensure that work that is presented as  \u201cdone\u201d and demonstrated to the users at the end of an iteration has  undergone adequate testing to prevent inaccurate information from being  provided. In addition to weaknesses we identified in the testing of select  user stories, the department identified a number of defects during the  development of the second release. In our view, VA has an opportunity to  improve the adequacy of its unit and functional testing which occurs  during each iteration to help identify and resolve any defects before any  related functionality is presented to users as completed work at the end of  the iteration. As we noted, the department agreed that they needed to  clarify their definition of \u201cdone\u201d and ensure it is being applied consistently.  As such, the definition often includes fully tested functionality that has no  defects. During our review, we observed on multiple occasions work being  presented as \u201cdone\u201d without having completed all testing. Improved  testing up front can reduce the amount of defects found later in user  acceptance testing and production that would require more costly rework.", "Further, the Assistant Secretary stated that the department believes that  we missed a substantial opportunity to positively influence real change by  not focusing on the fact that VA had adopted the Agile methodology after  many failings with other IT systems development efforts that used  waterfall development methodologies. We agree that VA has taken an  important step toward improving its development capability and that it has  developed significant segments of its new education benefits system with  its new methodology. However, as we noted in our briefing, the  department had not fully established metrics for its goals, which are  essential to fully gauge its progress beyond past initiatives.", "While we believe that VA has made substantial progress in implementing a  new process to develop its system, we stand by our position that there is  still an opportunity for the department to improve its new development  process in accordance with our recommendations. Doing so would further  increase the likelihood that VA fully develops and delivers the end-to-end  benefits processing capabilities envisioned to support the Post-9/11 and the needs of veterans.", "We are sending copies o committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and other interested parties.

Specifically, they noted that, consistent with Agile practices, the  department reprioritized work and adapted the system to add selected functionality, such  as the 2010 housing rate adjustments. They added that the Joint Executive Board had  made this decision to ensure that claims examiners would have the most recent rate to  process benefits for the fall 2010 enrollment season.
