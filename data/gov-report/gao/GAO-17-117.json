The transaction limit allows the Federal Reserve to distinguish between transaction accounts and savings deposits for reserves purposes.", "GAO was asked to review certain effects of Regulation D. This report's objectives include examining depository institutions' implementation of Regulation D's requirements, the effect of the transaction limit on their customers, and central banks' varying dependence on reserve requirements and the monetary policy implications.", "To examine these issues, GAO conducted a generalizable survey of 892 depository institutions (with a response rate of 71 percent); analyzed consumer complaint data from federal financial regulators; reviewed federal statutes and regulations, Federal Reserve System publications, and academic literature; and interviewed regulatory agency officials, representatives from banking and credit union associations, and depository institutions selected based on institution type and size.", "The Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The methods by which depository institutions can implement Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) include maintaining reserves against transaction accounts and enforcing a numeric transfer and withdrawal (transaction) limit for savings deposits if they wish to avoid classifying those accounts as reservable transaction accounts. GAO estimates that 70\u201378 percent of depository institutions limit savings deposit transactions. Other methods include automatically transferring balances from transaction (e.g., checking) accounts to savings deposits in order to reduce reserve requirements. Institutions may choose to maintain transaction account reserves against savings deposits to eliminate the need to enforce the transaction limit. But some institutions GAO surveyed indicated that they had operational burdens associated with monitoring and enforcing the transaction limit (for example, 63\u201373 percent cited challenges, such as creating forms and converting and closing accounts). Available data indicate that few customers exceeded or expressed concerns about the limit.", "Monetary policy\u2014actions taken to influence the availability and cost of money and credit (i.e., interest rates)\u2014can be conducted with varying dependence on reserve requirements. While many central banks around the world use reserve requirements, some have reduced their reliance on them due, in part, to the associated cost and administrative burdens. GAO reviewed how different central banks rely on reserve requirements and found a wide range of frameworks, including those with: (1) different mandatory reserve requirements (as compared to the United States), (2) voluntary reserve requirements, and (3) no reserve requirements at all. For example, countries with different mandatory reserves frameworks require maintaining reserves against all deposits, which eliminate the need to impose limits on transfers and withdrawals from specific accounts. While the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) has used reserve requirements to help achieve the interest rate targets it sets in the market for reserves (federal funds market), central banks of other developed countries such as Canada, Australia, Sweden, and Denmark, among others, do not rely on reserve requirements. Instead, they use interest rates under their direct control to restrict interest rates from moving outside of a targeted range (corridor operating approach).", "The authority for the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserves has reduced some of the costs associated with reserve requirements in the United States. One of the alternatives to the current reserve requirement framework that GAO examined would require legislative change to further reduce some of these costs and burdens. Other approaches, while proven feasible for some foreign central banks, have implications for the conduct of monetary policy (e.g., require the pursuit of a corridor operating approach). Given the differences in financial systems across the globe, it is unclear whether the practices used by other nations would translate to the United States. Moreover, lowering or eliminating reserve requirements would raise a number of operational and technical issues for monetary policy implementation. For example, lowering or eliminating reserve requirements could introduce the need to manage potential volatility in short-term interest rates. Therefore, minimizing the burdens associated with reserve requirements would have to be weighed against the costs and monetary policy implications of any alternative framework when considering changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Millions of households and businesses collectively have more than $7  trillion in savings and money market deposit accounts (savings deposits)  at over ten thousand depository institutions\u2014commercial banks, savings  banks, and credit unions\u2014across the United States.

FOMC comprises all members of the Board of Governors and  five Reserve Bank presidents who serve on a rotating basis.  The  Federal Reserve Act gives the Federal Reserve responsibility for setting  and implementing monetary policy\u2014actions taken to influence the  availability  and cost of money and credit\u2014to promote full employment  and ensure stable prices. To this end, section 19 of the Federal Reserve  Act requires the Board of Governors to impose reserve requirements  within certain ratios on specified liabilities\u2014transaction accounts,  nonpersonal time deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities\u2014of all depository  institutions, solely for the purpose of implementing monetary policy. The  definition  of \u201ctransaction account\u201d was added to section 19 in 1980 and  defines \u201ctransaction account\u201d to mean an account that permits the account  holder to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments (such  as checks), payment orders of withdrawal, telephone transfers, and other  similar items for the purpose of making payments to third parties or  others.

Accordingly,  before the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, the Board of Governors and  FOMC set monetary policy to promote national economic goals by  targeting the cost of overnight loans between depository institutions  (interbank loans), which influence other interest rates, and then adjusting  the supply of reserve balances in the banking system to achieve that  target. The relevant cost of interbank loans in this approach is the federal  funds rate\u2014the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve  balances to other depository institutions overnight.  According to the  Federal Reserve, FOMC has targeted the federal funds rate since roughly  1984. Before the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve\u2019s toolkit for  implementing monetary policy primarily comprised three tools:", "Reserve requirements: The minimum amount of funds that  depository institutions must hold against transaction account balances  (determined by applying a specified reserve requirement ratio).  Currently, only transaction accounts are subject to a reserve  requirement ratio greater than zero. As noted previously, the Federal  Reserve Act authorizes the Board of Governors to impose reserve  requirements only on certain deposit liabilities that do not include  savings deposits. Depository institutions may satisfy reserve  requirements by holding vault cash or reserve balances at Reserve  Banks. The Board of Governors is responsible for establishing  reserve requirements, and can adjust reserve requirements by  changing reserve requirement ratios within limits established by the  Federal Reserve Act.", "Open market operations: The purchase and sale of federal  government and federal agency securities in the open market by the  Reserve Banks at the direction of FOMC. The Federal Reserve can  use open market operations to adjust the supply of reserve balances  in the banking system overall in order to control the federal funds rate  within the target range set by FOMC. Open market operations directly  affect the total supply of reserves: purchases of securities (such as  Treasury securities) by the Federal Reserve increase reserve  balances; the sale of securities has the opposite effect on reserve  balances. Adjusting the supply of reserve balances in the banking  system through open market operations helps the Federal Reserve  control the federal funds rate. To lower the federal funds rate, the  Federal Reserve increases the supply of reserve balances;  decreasing the supply of reserve balances has the opposite effect on  the federal funds rate. Lower interest rates lower the cost of  borrowing, generally leading to increases in consumption and  business investment.", "Discount rate: The interest rate that Reserve Banks charge on loans  to depository institutions. The Reserve Bank lending function is often  generically referred to as \u201cthe discount window.\u201d The discount window  allows the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to depository  institutions under certain conditions. This complements open market  operations in achieving the target federal funds rate by making  balances available to depository institutions when the supply of  balances falls short of demand, and by serving as a backup source of  liquidity for individual depository institutions. If a depository institution  needs to borrow funds to meet reserve requirements or for other  operational needs, it typically will try to borrow at (or near) the federal  funds rate from another depository institution in the federal funds  market. If it has established borrowing privileges at the discount  window, a depository institution may borrow directly from its Reserve  Bank at the discount rate, which is set above the target federal funds  rate. There are three discount window programs: primary credit,  secondary credit, and seasonal credit, each with its own interest  rate. A generic reference to \u201cthe discount rate\u201d usually refers to the  primary credit rate. The rate for each lending program is established  by each Reserve Bank\u2019s board of directors, subject to the review and  determination of the Board of Governors.", "Pre-crisis, FOMC would set a target for the federal funds rate consistent  with its monetary policy objectives of maximum employment and price  stability and then direct the use of open market operations to achieve a  federal funds rate at or very close to the target rate. The Federal Reserve  conducted open market operations to maintain the federal funds rate  within the target range. Specifically, the Federal Reserve implemented  monetary policy by affecting the demand for and supply of reserves  (reserve balances held at Reserve Banks). In the federal funds market,  depository institutions and other eligible entities, including the  government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), trade reserves (federal funds)  with each other. By conducting open market operations, imposing reserve  requirements, and extending credit through the discount window, the  Federal Reserve exercised considerable control over the demand for and  supply of reserves and in turn the federal funds rate. Since changes in the  federal funds rate are transmitted to other short-term interest rates, which  affect longer-term interest rates and overall financial conditions, the  Federal Reserve used its three main policy tools to influence inflation and  overall economic activity and to achieve its monetary policy goals.", "According to Board of Governors officials, in response to the 2007\u20132009  financial crisis, the Federal Reserve expanded its monetary policy toolkit.  First, in 2008, the Federal Reserve began to use its authority to pay  interest on reserves, enabling the Board of Governors to break the strong  link between the quantity of reserves and the level of the federal funds  rate allowing for control over short-term interest rates with a large amount  of reserves in the system. The Federal Reserve also added two other  major tools to its toolkit: large-scale asset purchases and increasingly  explicit forward guidance. Both of these tools were used to provide further  monetary policy accommodation after short-term interest rates fell close  to zero. The Federal Reserve used its open market operations purchase  authority to purchase longer-term government securities and agency  securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, ease  broader financial market conditions, and support economic activity.  During the crisis, the Federal Reserve also established emergency  lending programs to lend directly to banks and other financial institutions  in disrupted markets to improve the flow of credit to U.S. households and  businesses. Currently, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy approach  involves FOMC setting a target range for the federal funds rate consistent  with achieving the monetary policy goals of maximum employment and  stable prices and directing the use of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary  policy toolkit to meet this target."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulation D Is Designed to Facilitate the Implementation of Reserve Requirements for the Implementation of Monetary Policy", "paragraphs": ["Regulation D, pursuant to section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, imposes  reserve requirements on transaction accounts solely for the purpose of  implementing monetary policy.

Given  the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate of promoting maximum employment and  stable prices, a predictable demand for reserves allowed the Federal  Reserve to have a predictable effect on interest rates through its targeting  of the federal funds rate and conducting open market operations to adjust  the supply of reserves, according to officials.

The  dollar amount of a depository institution\u2019s reserve requirement is  determined by applying the applicable reserve requirement ratios to the  balances held in its net transaction accounts. The reserve requirement  ratios correspond to three ranges for net transaction account balances:  \u201cexemption amount\u201d (amount of net transaction accounts subject to a zero  percent reserve requirement), \u201clow reserve tranche\u201d (amount of net  transaction accounts subject to a 3 percent reserve requirement ratio),  and \u201cover low reserve tranche\u201d (amount of net transaction accounts  subject to a 10 percent reserve requirement).", "The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of  1980 (Monetary Control Act) requires that the Board of Governors apply  transaction account reserve requirements uniformly to all transaction  accounts at all depository institutions. As shown in table 2, transaction  account reserve requirement ratios have not changed since 1992, when  the Board of Governors reduced the reserve requirement ratio on  transaction accounts over the low reserve tranche amount from 12  percent to 10 percent. In 1990, the Board of Governors reduced the  reserve requirement ratio on short-term nonpersonal time deposits and  Eurocurrency liabilities from 3 percent to 0 percent.", "The Board of Governors is required to adjust the maximum amount of  transaction account balances subject to the 3 percent ratio (the low  reserve tranche) and exemption amounts annually, according to formulas  specified in the Monetary Control Act and the Garn-St Germain Act,  respectively. The Board of Governors is not required by law to adjust  reserve requirement ratios annually or on any other schedule.", "The adjustments to the annual tranche and exemption amounts affect the  amount of net transaction accounts subject to the low reserve tranche  and exemption amounts. An increase in the low reserve tranche or  exemption amount reduces a depository institution\u2019s overall reserve  requirement, all else being equal, by reducing or eliminating reserve  requirements on additional deposit dollars. The low reserve tranche  amount may increase or decrease depending on the change in deposit  levels specified in the statutory formula. The exemption amount, however,  may only increase or remain unchanged. An increase depends on an  increase in deposit levels specified in the statutory formula. In the event  of a decrease in those deposit levels, however, the exemption amount  remains unchanged. Thus, as total deposits increase, the tranche and  exemption adjustments have the effect of keeping the overall effective  reserve ratio (the percentage of all depository institutions\u2019 total transaction  deposit balances held as reserves) approximately constant, as reflected  in figure 1. In particular, figure 1 shows that the exemption amount has  remained fairly steady since 1982 while the tranche amount increased  significantly between 2008 and 2016. The figure also shows that the trend  for the overall effective reserve ratio of all depository institutions has  remained relatively constant from 2004\u20132016.", "Annual tranche adjustments moderately affect the effective reserve ratio  of the banking sector, and therefore can influence, in theory, the money  supply. Over the last 10 years, the effective reserve ratio has been  around 8 percent, suggesting that the formulas in the Monetary Control  Act and the Garn-St Germain Act keep the adjustments relatively neutral  in their effect on the money supply. According to Board of Governors  officials, before 2008 when the Federal Reserve adjusted the supply of  bank reserves to target the federal funds rate, a stable demand for  reserves allowed the Federal Reserve to have greater control over the  federal funds rate in the conduct of monetary policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transaction Limit Originated from Statutory and Regulatory Factors and Provides a Distinction Between Transaction Accounts and Savings Deposits", "paragraphs": ["The Regulation D six-transaction limit (on certain types of transfers and  withdrawals) for savings deposit accounts helps implement reserve  requirements. According to the Board of Governors, the transaction limit  is critical for implementing reserve requirements because it allows the  Board of Governors to distinguish between transaction (e.g., checking)  accounts, which are subject to reserve requirements, and savings  deposits, which are not subject to reserve requirements.", "Reaffirmation of Transaction Limit  In 2009, the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Board of  Governors) amended Regulation D\u2019s  transaction limit rule for savings deposits. The  Board of Governors eliminated a \u201csublimit\u201d on  check and debit card transfers or withdrawals  (previously, only three out of six transfers and  w ithdrawals per month or statement cycle  could be made by check, debit card or similar  order). By eliminating  the sublimit, the Board  of Governors included such transfers and  w ithdrawals within the overall limit  of six  convenient transfers or withdrawals  (preauthorized, automatic, or telephonic  transactions that provide ease in making  payments to third parties) from savings  deposits per month or statement cycle. The  Board of Governors thus clarified that any  convenient transfer or withdrawal from a  savings deposit must be limited  to not more  than six per month or statement cycle. In  response to public comments requesting an  increase of the overall limit,  the Board of  Governors affirmed that section 19 of the  Federal Reserve Act requires imposition of  reserve requirements on transaction accounts  and not on other types of account.  Accordingly, the Board of Governors must  maintain the capacity to distinguish betw een  transaction accounts and savings deposits.  The distinction is based on convenience: the  greater the number of convenient transfers  and w ithdrawals permitted per month from a  \u201csavings deposit,\u201d the greater the difficulty in  distinguishing such an account from a  transaction account. Thus, the Board of  Governors determined it w ould neither  increase the number of convenient transfers  and w ithdrawals permitted from savings  deposits per month nor eliminate  numeric  limits entirely (on online transfers in particular  or all convenient transfers and w ithdrawals  from savings deposits in general).", "The Board of Governors has specified in Regulation D the manner of  distinguishing between transaction accounts and savings deposits.  Regulation D currently requires that for an account to be classified as a  \u201csavings deposit,\u201d it must permit the depositor to make no more than six  convenient transfers or withdrawals per month (or statement cycle of at  least 4 weeks) from the account.", "According to the Board of Governors, the six-transaction limit originated  from a mix of statutory and regulatory factors. Title II of the Monetary  Control Act, the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act of 1980, created  the Depository Institution Deregulation Committee to oversee the phase- out of limitations on interest rates previously applicable to various types of  deposit accounts. In 1982, Congress passed the Garn-St Germain Act,  which required the committee to authorize a new deposit account\u2014the  money market account. Specifically, the Garn-St Germain Act directed  the committee to issue a regulation authorizing the money market  account, which was intended to be a deposit account that was directly  equivalent to and competitive with money market mutual fund accounts.  The Garn-St Germain Act provided that money market accounts were not  to be considered transaction accounts, even if such accounts permitted  \u201cup to three preauthorized or automatic transfers and three transfers to  third parties\u201d monthly. The committee interpreted this provision as  permitting up to six preauthorized or automatic transfers to third parties  per month or statement cycle from the money market account, not more  than three of which could be made by check. This was sometimes  referred to as the \u201csix-three limit\u201d on payments and transfers from such  accounts, according to the Board of Governors.", "Based on the committee\u2019s interpretation, in Regulation D, the Board of  Governors determined that a money market account would not be subject  to transaction account reserve requirements if the account did not permit  more than six convenient (i.e., preauthorized, automatic, or telephonic)  transfers and withdrawals per month, where not more than three of such  transfers or withdrawals could be made by check or draft drawn by the  depositor. Before 1982, there was no monthly numeric limit on transfers  and withdrawals for savings deposits though such accounts were  included in the definition of \u201ctransaction accounts,\u201d which were subject to  reserve requirements. The committee ceased to exist after 1986;  however, the Board of Governors subsequently retained the \u201csix-three\u201d  transaction limit by incorporating it into the definition of \u201csavings deposits\u201d  in Regulation D, in part, because the limit was a feature of an account  type authorized by Congress that was still in use by depository  institutions. In 2009, the Board of Governors amended Regulation D to  eliminate the \u201cthree\u201d component from the \u201csix-three limit\u201d to make all  convenient payments and transfers from savings deposits, including  those made by check, debit card, or similar order, subject to the monthly  limit of six.   According to the Board of Governors, Regulation D currently  distinguishes between types of transfers and withdrawals from savings  deposits for purposes of the six-transaction limit (see table 3). The types  of transfers and withdrawals that are subject to the six-transaction limit  are those that are convenient, such as preauthorized, automatic or  telephonic  transfers or withdrawals (including by fax, email, or through an  Internet banking service) by check or debit card. Other types of transfers  and withdrawals that are less convenient, such as those made in person  or at an ATM, may be made in an unlimited number, according to the  Board of Governors.", "The Board of Governors notes that the rationale for limiting the number of  convenient transactions from savings deposits is to ensure that such  accounts are not used as transaction accounts without their balances  being subject to the reserve requirements for transaction accounts. The  Board of Governor\u2019s criteria for distinguishing between transaction  accounts and savings deposits under Regulation D are based on the  ease with which the depositor may make transfers (payments to third  parties) or withdrawals (payments directly to the depositor) from the  account. The critical element of the rationale is the nature of the  instruction for the transaction (that is, the instruction directing the third  party payment or transfer to be made), according to Board of Governors  officials. They noted that the more convenient the manner of instructing  withdrawals or transfers to be made from an account is\u2014such as  preauthorized or automatic transfers\u2014the more likely it is that the account  will be used for making payments or transfers to third parties rather than  for holding savings. Therefore, Regulation D limits the number of certain  convenient types of transfers or withdrawals that an account holder may  make in a single month or statement cycle from an account if that account  is to be classified as a savings deposit and exempt from reserve  requirements.", "A retail banking industry association and representatives from depository  institutions have noted that there may be a disconnect between this  rationale and its application\u2014because automated teller machine (ATM)  transactions may be viewed as convenient, but they are unlimited.  According to the Board of Governors, Regulation D does not limit ATM  transactions partly because ATMs formerly were considered to be  \u201cbranches\u201d of a depository institution. Therefore, appearing at an ATM  was substantially similar to appearing in person at a brick and mortar  branch of the depository institution. In addition, a withdrawal from an ATM  is generally considered to be a payment or transfer directly to the  depositor, rather than a payment to a third party as contemplated under  the statutory definition of transaction account. Furthermore, an ATM  withdrawal requires the account holder to appear physically at the ATM  location. Therefore, the Board of Governors does not deem an ATM  transaction to be a convenient method for making third-party payments,  and transfers and withdrawals initiated at an ATM have not been subject  to the numeric limits on transfers and withdrawals from savings deposits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Reserve Requirements Primarily Involves Depository Institutions and the Federal Reserve and Can Affect Customers", "paragraphs": ["Implementing and enforcing transaction account reserve requirements  (and therefore the distinction between reservable transaction accounts  and nonreservable savings deposits through the \u201csavings deposit\u201d  definition in Regulation D) imposes administrative responsibilities for  depository institutions, the Board of Governors, and Reserve Banks and  can affect the customers of depository institutions. As previously noted,  not all deposit balances are subject to reserve requirements; therefore,  not all depository institutions are required by Regulation D to maintain  reserves. For example, depository institutions with less than the  exemption amount in net transaction deposits (which do exist in the U.S.  banking system) are subject to a reserve requirement ratio of zero  percent on those accounts. However, all depository institutions are  required to enforce the six-transaction limit on convenient transfers and  withdrawals for all accounts that they classify as savings deposits and not  transaction accounts.

In October 2008, the Federal  Reserve Act amendment authorizing the payment of interest on reserve  balances became effective.

Prior to the payment of interest on reserves and the expansion  of the total supply of reserves, depository institutions preferred to closely  manage their reserve balances to their reserve requirement; therefore,  having fewer deposit balances subject to reserve requirements reduced  their reserve requirement and made more funds available for alternative  investments, such as loan provision to customers. Because they shifted  funds from transaction accounts to savings deposits to reduce balances  in transaction accounts subject to reserve requirements, these institutions  had to enforce the transfer and withdrawal limit for savings deposits  (ensuring that the automatic transfers from savings deposits did not  exceed six times per month).

This is largely because direct manipulation of  reserve requirements is a less efficient way for a central bank to influence  economic activity relative to the other tools at its disposal, such as open  market operations. Additionally,  changes to reserve requirement ratios  can significantly affect a depository institution\u2019s operations. However,  reserve requirements have played an important role in the implementation  of monetary policy, principally facilitating various operating procedures  and supporting open market operations by creating a predictable demand  for reserves. Operating procedures refer to the day-to-day policy actions,  or tactics, a central bank employs to achieve its long-run monetary policy  objectives, including technical measures and administrative activities.  The key component of an operating procedure is the central bank\u2019s  operating target, which can be a price (short-term interest rate) or a  quantity (reserves) target. For example, when a central bank uses monetary policy tools to target interest rates, it is said to be employing an  interest rate operating procedure.", "The importance of reserve requirements varies in relation to the operating  procedure used to implement monetary policy objectives. For example, a  reserve operating procedure\u2014which most central banks moved away  from decades ago\u2014depends on having control over the supply of money.  Reserve requirements played a role in controlling such growth when  these procedures were in place (see table 6). When a reserves-based  operating procedure is in place, control over the money supply suffers  when reserve requirements are lowered. Most central banks in  developed countries abandoned these approaches by the early 1980s for  interest rate-based operating procedures\u2014a common approach to  monetary policy that involves targeting the level of a short-term interest  rate to achieve policy objectives. For example, the Federal Reserve  transitioned to targeting an interest rate (federal funds rate) roughly by  1984. The movement away from reserves operating procedures and  the adoption of interest rate targeting approaches has allowed some  central banks to reduce their reliance on reserve requirements and  eliminate them in some instances.", "As shown in table 6, interest rate-based operating procedures provide  central bankers with more flexibility  in the use of reserve requirements. In  the interest rate-based operating procedure employed in the United  States during 1984\u20132008 (single target approach), the Federal Reserve  forecasted the demand for reserves, and then supplied the quantity of  reserves necessary to clear the federal funds market at the interest rate  target set by FOMC. For this type of operating procedure to be effective,  the demand for central bank balances must be reasonably stable and  predictable. Reserve requirements, by helping to establish a stable and  predictable demand for such balances, ensure that changes in short-term  interest rates are primarily the result of the central bank\u2019s actions to  achieve a policy rate within the interest rate target range. While the  amount of central bank balances needed for payment and settlement  purposes is determined by financial institutions\u2019 needs and can vary  significantly from day to day, reserve requirements that are substantial  enough\u2014relative to other factors influencing demand\u2014ensure that a  stable and predictable level of demand for central bank balances.  Therefore, reserve requirements facilitate interest-rate operating  procedures and remain an important tool for establishing control over  short-term interest rates.", "Other central banks use alternative interest-rate operating strategies to  achieve monetary policy objectives, using frameworks that place less  reliance on reserve requirements or render them nonessential (see table  6, corridor approach). Central banks generally have several tools\u2014 outside of reserve requirements\u2014that they can use to influence  conditions in interbank markets. Approaches that use these tools to  establish upper and lower limits on a short-term interest rate (policy rate)  are referred to as \u201cchannel\u201d or \u201ccorridor\u201d operating frameworks. In  general, fluctuations in the targeted interest rate are bounded within a  \u201ccorridor\u201d by a rate of interest on central bank lending and a rate of  interest on balances held at the central bank. Open market operations  can also be conducted as necessary to keep the market interest rate near  the target. When properly constructed and calibrated to the institutional  features and financial market structures of a given economy, this  \u201ccorridor\u201d operating procedure can allow a central bank to achieve an  operating target rate without the cost and administrative burdens  associated with reserve requirements. Hence, the corridor operating  framework can be viewed as an alternative to the required maintenance  of reserves. Currently, several central banks without reserve requirements use corridor operating frameworks, including the central  banks of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden and  Australia and were able to achieve sufficient control over short term  interest rates.  (See app. IV for additional details on select corridor  operating frameworks used globally.) It is important to note that reserve  requirements can be useful even in a corridor system as they can smooth  daily shocks and be leveraged to limit volatility within the corridor without  relying on daily open market operations. The European Central Bank  operates a corridor operating framework with reserve requirements.", "Key aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s current monetary policy  approach\u2014which leverages its ability to pay interest on reserves\u2014are  similar to the approaches used by many central banks that operate  without reserve requirements. In 2008, because of the increase in the  size of its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve had difficulty influencing  the federal funds rate through the typical shifts in the supply of reserves,  resulting in a revision in its operational framework for implementing  monetary policy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s response to the financial crisis  resulted in a significant expansion of its balance sheet and hundreds of  billions in excess balances in the banking system. For example, at the  end of 2008, balances maintained to satisfy reserve requirements  amounted to $53.6 billion, while excess balances totaled $767.3 billion  and by March 2016 excess balances increased to $2.4 trillion.  This  limited the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to achieve the target set by FOMC  solely by varying the supply of reserves. Given its expanded authority  granted in 2008, the Federal Reserve was able to use the rate of interest  on reserves, with support from other monetary policy tools, to help  establish a lower bound on the federal funds rate to keep it closer to  FOMC\u2019s target. This approach allowed the Federal Reserve to expand  its balance sheet to promote financial stability while maintaining control  over the federal funds rate. While the Federal Reserve\u2019s revised  operational approach leverages the tools used by central banks operating  without reserve requirements, it was designed specifically to enhance its  control over the federal funds rate within a framework using reserve  requirements. (See app. IV for more information on the current  operational framework in the United States.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conduct of Monetary Policy in an Environment of Low or Zero Reserve Requirements Raises a Number of Issues", "paragraphs": ["Implementing monetary policy without reserve requirements raises a  number of structural, operational, and technical issues, in cases in which  the operational approach (corridor operating approach) theoretically  allows for such an implementation, as the following examples illustrate.", "Because of the unique features of the U.S. financial system, it is  unclear that the practices used by other countries would translate to  the United States. Specifically, the unique structure and size of U.S.  financial markets\u2014characterized by a large number of depository  institutions and by important nondepository institutions that account  for a large share of credit intermediation\u2014would influence the  structure of a corridor operating approach in the United States. For  example, while operating without reserve requirements would likely  require the payment of interest on reserves to influence market  behavior, some important nondepository participants in the federal  funds market are not eligible to receive interest on reserves.  Therefore, as discussed below, a corridor operating approach in the  United States could be more challenging to achieve and would need  to be structured to account for nondepository institution activity in the  short-term funding markets.", "Moreover, eliminating reserve requirements and the infrastructure for  their implementation would result in less flexibility  for changing  operating approaches (such as approaches that rely on scarce  reserves and calibrated open market operations) should a central  bank find such approach desirable. Also, the federal funds market  could be significantly affected and could experience illiquidity  in some  economic environments, which could complicate monetary policy  approaches reliant on federal funds rate targeting.", "Eliminating reserve requirements could require more joint decision  making between FOMC and the Board of Governors. FOMC  determines the direction of monetary policy, but by statute, the Board  of Governors has the authority to set the rate for interest on reserves,  which is critical to the corridor operating approach. Federal Reserve  staff noted that FOMC and the Board of Governors cooperate closely  in all aspects of the conduct of monetary policy, which effectively  eliminates any coordination concerns.", "A number of operational and technical issues would emerge in a zero  reserve requirement environment, particularly if balances in the  banking system were scarce or if excess balances consisted largely of  payment and clearance balances (funds used to make payments to  other banks). When reserve requirements are set at zero or so low  that they are nonbinding on the behavior of depository institutions,  central bank balances will be maintained to make payments, settle  and clear transactions, and meet liquidity needs. While central  banks can still influence short-term interest rates in such an  environment, balances held for these purposes are behaviorally  different than balances maintained to satisfy reserve requirements  and can be less stable and predictable and potentially less sensitive  to interest rates. All else equal, in the absence of the payment of  interest on reserves, these factors would result in greater volatility of  short-term interest rates, underscoring the importance of the payment  of interest on reserves in any framework with low or zero reserve  requirements.  Also, the experiences of foreign countries relying on  settlement balances to implement monetary policy suggest the  structure of the payment system can become more important in the  conduct of monetary policy.", "The implementation of monetary policy in an environment of low or zero  reserve requirements raises particular concerns about potential short- term interest rate volatility. A key objective in an interest rate targeting  procedure\u2014which includes corridor operating approaches\u2014is to limit the  volatility of the interest rate around the targeted level because of the cost  associated with the signals it sends to market participants about the  ability of the central bank to achieve its target. A relatively stable  overnight interest rate (e.g., federal funds rate) enhances monetary policy  transmission and transparency and maximizes a central bank\u2019s influence  on market expectations. If the experiences of other central banks are a  guide, the absence of reserve requirements would likely involve  implementing or retaining one or more of the following actions or  structures to limit interest volatility and better ensure the effectiveness of  a corridor operating framework:", "Large central bank balances even in normal times. One way to  limit interest rate volatility is to set the interest paid on reserves near  or equal to the target rate and supply sufficient reserves to match  demand at a level consistent with monetary policy objectives. This  variant of the corridor operating framework is referred to as a \u201cfloor  system\u201d (or asymmetric corridor) and is used by the Reserve Bank  of New Zealand and several others. Nevertheless, this may require a  larger Federal Reserve balance sheet than might otherwise exist with  the current mandatory reserve requirements framework.", "Standing facilities serving depository and nondepository  institutions. Having Federal Reserve facilities that are available to a  broad array of financial institutions would be important for avoiding  cases in which the federal funds rate can fluctuate outside of the  established corridor. FSRRA (which amended the Federal Reserve  Act) did not authorize the payment of interest on reserves to  nondepository participants, such as the government-sponsored  enterprises (GSEs), in the federal funds market. Because GSEs do  not receive interest on their reserves held at Federal Reserve Banks,  they are willing to lend their balances at rates below the interest rate  paid on reserves. As a result, transactions by entities such as GSEs  may have contributed to the federal funds rates falling below the  interest rate on reserves, which in a corridor approach is designed to  contain the federal funds rate from below. To help control the federal  funds rate and keep it in the target range set by FOMC, the Federal  Reserve established a supplementary tool\u2014the overnight reverse  repurchase agreement facility. The facility is available to an expanded  list of counterparties, which limits the incentives for GSEs and other  qualified institutions to lend funds at rates less than the Federal  Reserve\u2019s overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate. Therefore,  the interest rate offered in reverse repurchase agreements is set  lower than the interest on reserves and helps establish a floor for the  federal funds rate.", "More frequent market intervention. Depending on the type of the  corridor operating system in place and the tolerance for interest rate  volatility, open market operations may be needed at higher  frequencies and in larger magnitudes to steer the market interest rate  to the targeted rate.", "Policies to reduce any perceived stigma associated with  borrowing from the discount window. Because of the perceived  stigma associated with using the discount window, the federal funds  rate might not be effectively bounded from above by the discount rate  in a corridor system. The reluctance by institutions to use the discount  window is driven by institutions\u2019 fears that such borrowing would  signal financial weakness to financial markets.

However, determining the ideal  reserve requirement framework in the United States is ultimately a  monetary policy decision and we take no position on the suitability of the  frameworks presented for the United States.", "For illustrative purposes only, we differentiated a few reserve requirement  frameworks, focusing narrowly on the main cost and administrative  burdens associated with each and the implications for monetary policy  (see table 7). The examples are informed by the experiences of several  foreign central banks and the analysis conducted by the Federal Reserve  prior to the adoption of the payment of interest on reserve balances. In  response to the authorities granted by FSRRA to pay interest on reserves  and reduce transaction account reserve requirements to zero in 2008, the  Federal Reserve began studying a broader range of options to achieve  monetary policy objectives.

Because reserves are required on  transaction accounts only, this approach includes a reliance on  distinguishing between accounts (e.g., with the six-transaction limit for  savings deposits in the United States).

This approach introduces administrative simplicity by  eliminating the need to distinguish between transaction accounts and  savings deposits and reduces the implicit reserves tax (through the  payment of interest on reserves) and the associated burdens on  depository institutions and the central bank. The European Central  Bank has used this framework with a corridor operating procedure for  monetary policy implementation. In the United States, this option  would require legislative change as the Federal Reserve Act  authorizes the Board of Governors to impose reserve requirements on  transaction accounts, nonpersonal time deposits and Eurocurrency  liabilities only.", "Zero reserve requirements, with voluntary reserves obligations.", "While reserves are not required, depository institutions would be  allowed to set their own reserve targets\u2014receiving a higher rate of  interest on balances held to meet that target\u2014and penalized for failing  to meet them. This framework would be less burdensome on  depository institutions than one requiring reserves such as in the  United States since it would eliminate the need for some  administrative reports and the monitoring of deposits for compliance  with the six-transaction limit. The central bank\u2019s administrative  overhead could decline as well, although it would still need to monitor  reserve targets and balances, and maintain corresponding systems.  This option approximates the approach that has been employed by  the Bank of England (with a corridor operating procedure for monetary  policy implementation).", "Zero reserve requirements. Regulation D\u2019s definitions that define  reserveable liabilities for reserve requirements purposes in the United  States would not be needed and all costs and administrative burdens  associated with reserve requirements would be eliminated.

In cases  we reviewed in which central banks implemented monetary policy  without reserve requirements, corridor operating frameworks were  used to achieve monetary policy objectives. To the extent that reserve  requirements place significant burdens on banks and central banks,  eliminating reserve requirements and employing a corridor operating  approach appear to be feasible alternatives in these select cases.

To  facilitate more widespread use of bank notes, the National Bank Act of  1863 allowed depository institutions to organize under a national charter  and created a network of institutions to easily circulate their bank notes  across the country. In exchange for a charter that promoted widespread  use of their notes, nationally chartered institutions were required to hold  25 percent reserves against their notes and customer deposits.", "The role of reserve requirements continued to change after the Federal  Reserve was created in1913 with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act  (see fig. 4). When the Federal Reserve was created, reserve  requirements did not have a stated role in influencing the availability  and  cost of money and credit. In the years before the Federal Reserve Act, a  series of bank runs and financial panics made evident the need for a  mechanism to accommodate temporary variations in the public\u2019s demand  for cash. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Act created a system of  Reserve Banks to act as lenders of last resort and thereby provide  temporary liquidity relief to the nationwide banking system during times of  financial crisis. Among other provisions, the Federal Reserve Act sought  to establish more effective supervision of banking, and the Federal  Reserve was given the responsibility of supervising state-chartered and  nationally-chartered depository institutions that chose to be members of  the Federal Reserve. All member institutions were subject to reserve  requirements.", "Beginning in the 1920s, reserve requirements gradually became  important for implementing monetary policy as the Federal Reserve  moved toward a more proactive role in influencing credit conditions. As  borrowing increased rapidly in the 1920s, the Federal Reserve  determined that reserve requirements could be used to constrain the  expansion of credit by requiring reserves against deposits used to fund  loans. However, this objective was complicated in practice because  reserve requirement ratios were established in the Federal Reserve Act  and not by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board  of Governors) and by the reliance on the discount rate as the primary tool  for influencing the availability  and cost of money and credit at the time.  The discount window rate was set below market, which provided  depository institutions the incentive to borrow from the Reserve Banks to  finance operations. This meant reserve requirements placed no  significant constraint on lending. In addition, the Federal Reserve did not  have the authority to raise reserve requirements at the time to make them  a more binding constraint on credit expansion.", "By 1931, the Federal Reserve moved from using reserve requirements as  a source of liquidity for deposits held at depository institutions to using  reserve requirements to proactively affect the cost and availability  of  money and credit. The Banking Act of 1935 gave the Board of Governors  authority to increase reserve requirements and the Board of Governors  doubled the required reserve ratios on demand deposits and time  deposits. During World War II, the emphasis on proactive monetary  policy was temporarily superseded by a focus on helping fund the war  through \u201cpegging\u201d interest rates and purchasing Treasury securities (that  is, finance government debt through open market operations).", "In 1951, the Federal Reserve returned to proactive monetary policy,  focusing on financial conditions in short-term money and credit markets.  From this period to 1980, reserve requirements for member institutions  were based on geography and were adjusted numerous times. Reserve  requirements were adjusted to reinforce or supplement the effects of  open market operations and discount policy on credit conditions as well  as in response to financial innovation that created new sources of funding  operations to circumvent reserve requirements on deposits. For example,  the Board of Governors imposed marginal reserve requirements\u2014 additional requirements on each new increment of deposits\u2014on large  time deposits and Eurocurrency liabilities (net balances of depository  institutions organized in the United States but with non-U. S. offices and  international banking facilities).", "Reserve requirement computation methods also changed in the 1960s  and 1970s. In 1968, the Board of Governors adopted a system of lagged  reserve requirements. Under this system, an institution\u2019s required  reserves were computed based on its deposit levels from the preceding 2  weeks, replacing contemporaneous computation occurring during a  reserve maintenance period. Contemporaneous computation provides for  a real-time link between reserve requirements and M1 (the sum of  currency held by the public plus transaction deposits of depository  institutions). Four years later in 1972, the Board of Governors adopted a  graduated reserve requirements schedule\u2014varying reserve requirements  depending on deposit levels regardless of geographic location. Because  reserve requirements were imposed only on the liabilities of member  institutions, some state-chartered institutions that chose to be members  began to leave the Federal Reserve. The graduated reserve  requirements were intended to reduce reserve requirements for smaller  banks, which were more likely to leave the Federal Reserve, but it further  weakened the link between M1 and aggregate reserve balances. In  response, the Federal Reserve adopted a quantity operating procedure  (targeting the amount of reserve balances in the banking system overall  through open market operations) designed to maintain close, short-run  control of M1 in 1979. According to the Federal Reserve, the ability to  control M1 depended on the strength and stability of the link between  reserves at member banks and the level of M1 deposits in the entire  banking system\u2014a link that was being weakened by the decline in  Federal Reserve membership and a complicated system for determining  reserve requirements. The Federal Reserve feared that continuing  declines in Federal Reserve membership would diminish and undermine  the effectiveness of monetary policy under a quantity operating  procedure.", "In response to declining Federal Reserve membership and to strengthen  the Federal Reserve\u2019s control over the implementation of monetary policy,  Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary  Control Act of 1980 (Monetary Control Act). The Monetary Control Act  amended the Federal Reserve Act to require \u201call depository institutions,\u201d  not just member banks, to satisfy reserve requirements, thereby  increasing the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to influence money market  conditions. It also simplified the graduated reserve requirement  schedule. Furthermore, the Monetary Control Act initially set a basic  reserve requirement ratio of 3 percent on transaction accounts below a  specified level (the \u201clow reserve tranche\u201d) and specified a reserve  requirement ratio of 12 percent on all transaction accounts over that  amount and provided that the Board of Governors could adjust the latter  ratio between 8 percent and 14 percent. The Monetary Control Act also  imposed reserve requirements on two other types of liabilities:  nonpersonal time deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities. This effectively  broadened the reserves base and allowed the Federal Reserve to  improve control over the supply of reserves. The Board of Governors  amended Regulation D in 1980 to implement the reserve requirements  provisions of the Monetary Control Act. Two years later, Congress  passed the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (Garn-St  Germain Act), which amended the Federal Reserve Act to provide that  transaction accounts at depository institutions below a certain level,  known as the \u201cexemption amount\u201d were to be subject to a reserve  requirement ratio of zero percent. This amendment provided for the  exemption amount to be adjusted each year by a statutory formula that  takes into account the percentage increase or decrease in all reservable  liabilities at all depository institutions over the previous year.", "Roughly beginning in 1984, the Federal Reserve shifted from targeting  M1 towards targeting the cost of reserves (federal funds rate) and then  adjusting the supply of balances in the banking system relative to the  demand for balances to achieve the target federal funds rate. That same  year, the Board of Governors moved from a system of lagged reserve  requirements (reserve requirements computation based on institutions\u2019  deposit levels from the preceding 2 weeks) to a system of  contemporaneous reserve requirements (reserve requirements computed  during the reserves maintenance period). Although the focus was not on  M1, this change tightened the link between reserves and M1, allowing the  Federal Reserve to achieve a stable, predictable demand for reserves  and estimate the supply of reserves needed to achieve the target federal  funds rate. In 1998, the Board of Governors returned to a system of  lagged reserve requirements, which is still in place. The Federal Reserve  Act as originally enacted neither explicitly authorized the payment of  interest on reserve balances maintained at Reserve Banks nor  specifically prohibited the payment of interest. However, Congress  passed the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, which  amended the Federal Reserve Act to provide specific authorization for  balances at Reserve Banks to receive earnings (interest on reserves).  This effectively broadened the set of monetary policy tools available to  the Federal Reserve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Monetary Policy Implementation without Reserve Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Central banks have generally transitioned from reserve operating  procedures where reserve requirements are critical to achieving monetary  policy objectives. Although not necessarily generalizeable to the United  States, the experiences of central banks in several countries suggest that  it is possible to achieve monetary policy objectives in an environment of  zero reserve requirements\u2014or when these requirements are nonbinding.  The common element in each of these cases is the use of interest rate  operating procedures, where monetary policy tools are used to contain  policy targets within a specific range. The primary instruments that enable  these operating procedures are mechanisms to influence the demand for  central bank balances, such as the payment of interest on reserves and  lending facilities similar to the discount window. Approaches that use  these tools to establish upper and lower limits on a policy rate (e.g., the  federal funds rate) are referred to as \u201cchannel\u201d or \u201ccorridor\u201d operating  frameworks. In general, the targeted interest rate is bounded within a  \u201ccorridor\u201d by a rate of interest on central bank lending at the top and a  rate of interest on deposits at the central bank at the bottom to limit  fluctuation in that targeted rate. The payment of interest on reserves is  critical to successful implementation of monetary policy in an operating  framework where required reserves are set to zero or are nonexistent.", "Useful lessons about the implementation of monetary policy in a zero  reserve requirement environment come from the experiences of countries  that have elected to eliminate or significantly reduce reserve  requirements. Many of these approaches have been employed for a  number of years. For example, Canada phased out reserve requirements  by 1994 while the Bank of England did so by 1981. While there are  consequences for reducing or eliminating reserve requirements on the  implementation of monetary policy, including potential short-term interest  rate volatility  and the cost associated with other frameworks, the corridor  operating frameworks in these and other counties also provide examples  of dealing with those consequences without reliance on the required  maintenance of reserves. However, the ability to extend the experiences  of other countries to the United States is unclear given a number of  differences, including the size of the banking systems and type of  institutions operating in the financial system. For example, the Canadian  financial system consists of roughly 80 banks according to the IMF  compared to several thousand banks in the United States.", "Corridor operating systems without reserve requirements can vary by the  key features and structural elements that reflect each nation\u2019s unique  institutional and financial market structure as well as key decisions about  tradeoffs and preferences. The institutional details of the corridor system  also can vary over time at a given central bank. The global financial crisis  resulted in a number of nonconventional monetary policy measures by  central banks and deviations from the operational frameworks in place  pre-crisis. Therefore, while not necessarily reflective of the exact  operational procedures currently in place at the given central bank, some  examples include the following:", "Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia. Before the global  financial crisis, these central banks implemented monetary policy  using a simple (or \u201csymmetric\u201d) corridor framework where the target  interest rate is bounded by central bank deposit and lending  facilities\u2014and the aim is to keep short-term rates in the center of the  corridor. In the absence of reserve requirements, central bank  balances are largely composed of payment and settlement balances  and balances held for precautionary purposes. Payment and  settlement balances, which are generally less predictable and stable  than required reserves, are also not as sensitive to short-term interest  rates. As a result, to help keep short-term rates from fluctuating  undesirably, the Bank of Canada and Bank of Australia operated  relatively narrow corridors and made frequent use of open market  operations to manage the overnight rate, among other things. In 2009,  the Bank of Canada began temporarily operating what could be  characterized as an \u201casymmetric\u201d corridor or \u201cfloor system\u201d (see  Reserve Bank of New Zealand below).", "Bank of England. Before 2009, the United Kingdom implemented a  monetary policy approach based on a system of voluntary reserves.  When active, banks must establish a reserve target and maintain that  target to earn interest and are penalized for holding an amount  outside the target range. Banks can ensure the target is reached by  using the Bank of England\u2019s standing lending and borrowing facilities.  These standing facilities form a ceiling and floor (interest rate corridor)  around the policy rate. Open market operations were conducted  several times during the day to meet the demand for central bank  balances and supply appropriate levels of reserves to meet banks\u2019  target level of reserves. The Bank of England suspended voluntary  reserves targets in March 2009 and moved to an asymmetric corridor  system in which the targeted rate is close to the Bank of England  lending rate.", "Reserve Bank of New Zealand. In 1999, the Reserve Bank of New  Zealand began implementing monetary policy through a symmetric  corridor system, relying on standing lending and deposit facilities, and  open market operations. As in the systems described above, payment  and clearance balances factor heavily in the conduct of monetary  policy. In response to concerns about the effectiveness of the corridor  framework, the central bank began substantially increasing the  volume of central bank balances in the system in 2006. This approach  of providing abundant balances (reserves) serves to reduce interest  rate volatility  within the corridor. It is important to note that there are  very few financial institutions operating in New Zealand and the  majority of these are foreign owned.", "The Federal Reserve currently operates a monetary policy approach that  is similar to the type of framework it could employ if it were to significantly  reduce or eliminate reserve requirements. However, the Federal Reserve  revised its operational framework for monetary policy implementation to  enhance its control over the federal funds rate given the amount of  excess reserves in the system. The high volume of reserves is a  consequence of actions taken by the Federal Reserve to address the  recent global financial crisis. As figure 7 shows, balances maintained to  satisfy reserve requirements are so low relative to the total balances in  the banking system that reserve requirements are considered  \u201cnonbinding\u201d on the behavior of depository institutions. As of March 2016,  balances maintained to satisfy reserve requirements totaled $152 billion  while total reserve balances totaled $2.52 trillion\u2014indicating that excess balances are more than $2 trillion. Under these conditions, reserve  requirements do not play the typical facilitating role in the implementation  of monetary policy in the United States. More importantly, because of the  size of its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve had difficulty influencing  the federal funds rate through the typical shifts in the supply of reserves,  which warranted a revision in its operational framework for implementing  monetary policy.", "To retain flexibility  in its treatment of assets purchased in response to the  financial crisis, since 2008, the Federal Reserve has been influencing the  federal funds rate using tools that include the payment of interest of  reserves (which also would be necessary to implement monetary policy in  an operating framework with reserve requirements set to zero). The  Federal Reserve\u2019s current approach is anchored by the rate of interest it  pays on reserves and the interest rate on the overnight reverse  repurchase agreement (RRP) facility that is also accessible to  nondepository financial institutions. A key feature of this operating  procedure is that it allows the Federal Reserve to significantly increase  the supply of reserves while keeping the short-term interest rate close to  its target.", "While the Federal Reserve uses key elements of the corridor operating  approaches used by foreign central banks, it has not formally adopted a  corridor system. Nevertheless, the U.S and foreign experiences illustrate  that monetary policy can be implemented in an environment in which  reserve requirements are not binding (due to low or zero reserve  requirements or abundant excess reserves). However, the operational  framework in the United States has not been tested in an environment of  scarce reserves. In such an environment, a number of technical,  operational, and practical issues would need to be addressed.
