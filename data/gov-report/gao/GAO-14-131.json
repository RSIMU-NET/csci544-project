GAO estimated that only 46 percent of all projects recommended for funding in fiscal year 2012 under these programs were documented using the complete template. EDA has a history of inconsistent documentation: for example, in 2000 the Department of Commerce's Inspector General reported inconsistencies in how EDA's regional offices documented the project review process. Standards for internal control in the federal government require all transactions and significant events to be clearly documented and available for examination.

The two largest programs EDA uses to accomplish its  mission are the Public Works and Economic Development (Public Works)  program and the Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA) program. In  fiscal year 2012, Public Works projects comprised 48 percent ($129.2  million) of EDA\u2019s total grant investment dollars, while EAA projects  comprised 14 percent ($38.5 million) of EDA\u2019s total grant investment  dollars.", "House Report 112-463 included a requirement that GAO review grants  EDA made under the Public Works and EAA programs.

EDA awarded more than 1,500 grants under  the Public Works and EAA grant programs in fiscal years 2006 through  2012 (the period of interest in the congressional mandate). In general, we  focused our review on fiscal year 2007 because EDA awarded the largest  number of grants in this year compared to the rest of the 7-year period  and fiscal year 2011 because it was the most recent year during the  period in which we considered data to be reliable. We also reviewed  relevant statutes and EDA regulations, operational guidance, and federal  funding opportunity announcements that defined the eligibility and other  criteria for awarding grants under the Public Works and EAA programs.  To address the first objective, we reviewed a nonprobability sample of 64  projects EDA funded across the six regions in fiscal years 2007 and 2011  and assessed the documentation its regional offices maintained on  meetings related to the funding of these projects. We also reviewed a  random and generalizable sample of 74 grant awards from fiscal year  2012, drawn from a sample population of 204 projects, to assess the  extent to which EDA regional offices followed new procedures for  documenting meetings related to funding of proposed projects during that  year. All estimates from our review have a margin of error of no more  than plus or minus 10 percentage points. In addition, we conducted  structured interviews with officials from EDA\u2019s six regional offices to  enable comparison of regional grant review and documentation practices.

We did not use the same  procedures that EDA staff generally use to calculate per capita income  and unemployment, and our findings are not intended to replicate EDA\u2019s  eligibility determinations. We also used EDA\u2019s data to identify and  describe projects that were funded during the period based upon a  special need. In addition, we used the U.S. Department of Agriculture  Economic Research Service\u2019s (ERS) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to  identify the population density at the county level for each funded grant.

EDA\u2019s two largest grant assistance programs are Public Works and EAA.  The Public Works program is used to finance infrastructure-related  activities that support job creation, such as water and sewer facilities,  industrial parks and business centers, broadband facilities, port and rail  improvements, and business incubator facilities.

However,  officials said that the process for applying the criteria may change from  time to time based upon, for example, a suggestion from Commerce\u2019s  Office of General Counsel or a regional office.

For most of our review, we focused on fiscal  year 2007 because EDA awarded the largest number of grants in this  year compared to the rest of the 7-year period and on fiscal year 2011  because it was the most recent year during the period in which we  considered data to be reliable. We did not focus on fiscal year 2012 data  because some of the data from that year were not considered reliable due  to an information technology event that shut down EDA\u2019s grant  management system for several months. However, to assess the extent  to which EDA staff followed documentation requirements that the agency  introduced in fiscal year 2012, we used a list of 204 projects from that  year provided by EDA to randomly select a generalizable sample. We  found this 2012 data sufficiently reliable for the purpose of drawing a  sample (see full description of this sample below).", "To determine which fiscal year 2007 and 2011 EDA projects to review, we  obtained extracts from EDA\u2019s Operations Planning and Control System,  its electronic grants management system. These data extracts contained  characteristics of each funded project for fiscal years 2007 and 2011,  including the project number; relevant program; applicant name; project  description; project state; project county; amount of EDA funding; total  project funding; rural classification of the project location; whether the  project was eligible for funding based on per capita income,  unemployment, a special need, or other criteria; the maximum percentage  of program costs the project was eligible to receive from EDA; and an  open-ended field for a description of the geographic area. The original  data that EDA provided included 751 total projects from fiscal year 2007  and 711 total projects from fiscal year 2011. These projects reflected all  of EDA\u2019s grant programs. We removed all projects except those funded  under the Public Works and EAA programs, leaving 267 and 237 projects,  respectively, from fiscal years 2007 and 2011. We excluded a small  number of projects from all or some of our analyses as described below.", "To describe the extent to which EDA documented grant selection  decisions, we selected a nonprobability sample of 72 grant awards\u201436  from fiscal year 2007 and 36 from fiscal year 2011\u2014across EDA\u2019s six  regions. We received and examined 64 of the 72 requested records (33  from fiscal year 2007 and 31 from fiscal year 2011) of EDA grant review  meeting minutes associated with these projects to summarize factors  associated with funding decisions. The results of our analyses of the  minutes from fiscal years 2007 and 2011 cannot be generalized to all  EDA grant awards in these two or any other years. In addition, we  reviewed a random and generalizable sample of 74 grant awards from  fiscal year 2012 to assess the extent to which EDA staff followed newly  required procedures for documenting grant review meetings that year. To  select the probability sample, we started with a list of all 224 Public Works  and EAA-funded projects from fiscal year 2012 and removed 20 projects  that were not subject to EDA\u2019s standard grant review process. From the  list of 204 projects, we randomly selected and requested grant review  records for 76 projects, and we received 74 records. With this probability  sample, each member of the study population had a nonzero probability  of being included, and that probability could be computed for any  member. Our analysis of the fiscal year 2012 minutes provides a  generalizable perspective (with a margin of error of plus or minus 10  percentage points) on the extent to which EDA staff followed the newly  required documentation procedures in fiscal year 2012. As noted earlier,  there were concerns over the reliability of fiscal year 2012 data. We  created the sample frame out of the 2012 data extract that EDA provided.  Later, we discovered that EDA listed 7 projects in its fiscal year 2012  annual report that were not included in the data extract and included 2  projects in the data extract that were not in the annual report. However,  after discussion with the agency, we have a reasonable level of  assurance that the fiscal year 2012 data that we used for our sampling  purposes were sufficiently reliable. We also reviewed operational  guidance that identified the eligibility and evaluation criteria for EDA staff  to apply in determining projects to fund and conducted structured  interviews with the six regional offices (Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Denver,  Philadelphia, and Seattle) to enable comparison of regional grant review  and documentation practices.", "To describe the distress characteristics for counties with EDA-funded  projects in fiscal years 2007 and 2011, we determined the 12-month per  capita income and 24-month unemployment rate at the county level for  each funded grant from fiscal years 2007 and 2011 (based on the EDA- defined date that the project record was created) using Bureau of  Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data,  respectively. We used the same data sources to calculate the national  and state per capita income and unemployment rates for the same  periods for each funded grant and compared them to the county level  data. We chose the 12-month and 24-month periods because EDA\u2019s  authorizing statute requires EDA staff to obtain \u201cthe most recent data  available\u201d for per capita income and the most recent 24-month period for  which data are available for unemployment data. To determine the  appropriate time period for the data, we referred to the date that the  project record was created in EDA\u2019s electronic grants management  system and used the BEA and BLS data from the previous 1 or 2  calendar years, respectively. We did not use the same procedures that  EDA staff generally use to calculate per capita income and  unemployment, and our findings are not intended to replicate EDA\u2019s  eligibility determinations. Some EAA project counties did not have  relevant per capita income or unemployment data from the BEA or the  BLS, respectively. In these cases, we dropped the projects from our  analysis of per capita income or unemployment, as appropriate.  Specifically, for 2007, we excluded 1 Public Works project and 4 EAA  projects from the PCI analysis and 3 Public Works projects and 2 EAA  projects from the unemployment analysis. For 2011, we excluded 2 Public  Works projects and 3 EAA projects from the PCI analysis and 1 Public  Works project and 1 EAA project from the unemployment analysis. These  exclusions resulted in final counts of 135 Public Works projects and 116  EAA projects for the fiscal year 2007 per capita income analysis, 80  Public Works projects and 150 EAA projects for the fiscal year 2011 per  capita analysis, 135 Public Works projects and 120 EAA projects for the  fiscal year 2007 unemployment analysis, and 81 Public Works projects  and 152 EAA projects for the fiscal year 2011 unemployment analysis.  We also used EDA\u2019s data to identify and describe Public Works and EAA  projects that were funded based upon a special need in fiscal years 2007  and 2011.", "To describe the distribution of EDA Public Works and EAA funds among  rural and nonrural areas in fiscal years 2007 and 2011, we used the U.S.  Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service\u2019s (ERS) Rural- Urban Continuum Codes to identify the population density at the county  level for each funded grant. These codes range from 1 (counties in  metropolitan areas of 1 million or more people) to 9 (counties that are  completely rural or less than 2,500 people, not adjacent to a metropolitan  area). ERS regards counties falling into codes 1 through 3 as  metropolitan (\u201cnonrural\u201d) and those with codes 4 through 9 as  nonmetropolitan (\u201crural\u201d). We determined the proportion of grants  awarded in nonrural versus rural areas in accordance with these  definitions. We excluded one Public Works project from the population  density analysis for each of the two fiscal years because Rural-Urban  Continuum Codes were not available for the relevant counties.", "In fiscal years 2007 and 2011, there were 28 and 15 EDA projects,  respectively, that EDA described as serving multiple counties. Three of  the fiscal year 2007 multicounty projects only listed one county, so we  treated these as single county projects. We completely removed 7 of the  multicounty projects from our fiscal year 2007 sample and 2 from our  fiscal year 2011 sample because the data extracts did not include the  names of the relevant counties, which were necessary to obtain per  capita income, unemployment, and rural classification data. For the  multicounty projects for which the individual county names were available,  we calculated a weight for each county by dividing its population for the  most recent year for which data were available (using Census Bureau  population estimates) by the total population for all counties in the project.  We applied the population weight to each county\u2019s 12-month per capita  income or 24-month unemployment rate to arrive at an average per capita  income or unemployment rate for the entire project. With regard to the  Rural-Urban Continuum Codes for the multicounty projects, we  determined that a weighted average would not be appropriate to apply to  categorical data. Instead, we applied decision rules that resulted in the  exclusion of 18 projects (10 projects from fiscal year 2007 and 8 projects  from fiscal year 2011) from our rural classification analysis and assigned  one Rural-Urban Continuum Code to each of the remaining multicounty  projects. Specifically, for each unique project serving two or more  counties, we applied the following decision rules. First, if all of the  counties in a multicounty project had the same code, we assigned that  code to the entire project. Second, if there were only 2 codes and they  were contiguous (for example, all 1s and 2s) we assigned the code that  was most frequent to the entire project. Third, when there were 2 or more  noncontiguous codes, if one code occurred two-thirds of the time or more,  we assigned that code to the entire project. Finally, if none of the first  three rules applied, we excluded the project from the rural classification  analysis.", "To describe the types of projects that EDA funded through its Public  Works and EAA programs in fiscal years 2007 and 2011, we categorized  EDA\u2019s descriptions of funded projects using GAO-defined project  categories. Specifically, in a prior GAO report, we identified nine project  categories for the Public Works and EAA programs, among other federal  economic development programs. One staff member independently  categorized the fiscal year 2007 and 2011 projects, another staff member  reviewed the categorizations, and they addressed any discrepancies with  the input of a third-party reviewer. After reviewing all project descriptions,  we condensed the original nine categories into six major categories, as  well as an \u201call other\u201d category. (See app. II for a description of project  categories.) For projects for which the EDA project descriptions were  unclear, we conducted Internet research and obtained EDA input on 31  projects to complete our categorizations.", "We assessed the reliability of the various electronic data sources used for  this report, including project data from EDA\u2019s electronic grants  management database; county, state, and national per capita income and  unemployment data from BEA and BLS; county population estimates from  the Census Bureau; and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes from ERS. To  assess reliability, we interviewed EDA officials knowledgeable about the  electronic grants management database, reviewed the data dictionary,  and conducted electronic testing of the data extracts against the relevant  fields in the full database. We reviewed documentation from BEA, BLS,  the Census Bureau, and ERS about how they compile their data. We  determined that these data sources were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of describing the poverty, unemployment, and rural  classifications of EDA project locations.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2013 to February 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Description of Project Categories", "paragraphs": ["Project categories developed by GAO include the following:", "Business Development: This category captures projects that support  entrepreneurial efforts, help businesses get started, facilitate job  placement, and promote the development of new markets for existing  products.", "Commercial and Industrial: This category captures projects that  involve the design, construction, demolition, or renovation of  commercial buildings and industrial parks, including the infrastructure  designed to support those structures, as well as financial support to  existing businesses.", "Infrastructure: This category captures projects that involve the  development of infrastructure, including constructing and repairing  various modes of transportation (e.g., airports, roads, rail, and  harbors); and water, sewer, gas, and electricity systems; as well as  projects that support telecommunications and broadband  infrastructure.", "Plans and Research: This category captures planning and strategy  development efforts for job creation and retention, and projects that  support research of the practices, principles, and innovations that  foster effective economic development strategies.", "Technical Assistance: This category captures projects that provide  business management and technical services including assistance  with technical issues such as disaster mitigation and recovery, and  biotechnology.", "Training and Education: This category captures projects that provide  training and education services, including the construction of facilities  and equipment needed to provide these services.", "All Other Project Types: This category captures projects that do not fit  appropriately into any of the other categories (e.g., performance  awards, base grant adjustments, tourism, and enterprise  development)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Marshall Hamlett, Assistant  Director; Cynthia Grant; Tiffani Humble; May Lee; John McGrail; Andrew  Moore; Lisa Reynolds; Beverly Ross; Max Sawicky; Jennifer Schwartz;  Jena Sinkfield; Ardith Spence; and Shana Wallace made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
