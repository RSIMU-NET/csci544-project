Because of widespread congressional interest in the Defense Travel System (DTS), GAO's current audit is being performed under the statutory authority given to the Comptroller General of the United States. GAO's testimony is based on the preliminary results of that audit and focuses on the following three key questions: (1) Has DOD effectively tested key functionality in DTS related to flights and fare information? (2) Will DTS correct the problems related to DOD travel previously identified by GAO and others? and (3) What challenges remain in ensuring that DTS achieves its goal as DOD's standard travel system? In addition, the Subcommittee asked that GAO provide a description of the intellectual property rights of DOD in DTS. Subsequent to this testimony, GAO plans to issue a report that will include recommendations to the Secretary of Defense aimed at improving the department's implementation of DTS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DTS development and implementation have been problematic, especially in the area of testing key functionality to ensure that the system will perform as intended. Consequently, critical flaws have been identified after deployment, resulting in significant schedule slippages. GAO's recent analysis of selected requirements disclosed that system testing was ineffective in ensuring that the promised capability has been delivered as intended. For example, GAO found that DOD did not have reasonable assurance that DTS properly display flight and airfare information. This problem was not detected prior to deployment, since DOD failed to properly test system interfaces. Accordingly, DOD travelers might not have received accurate information which, could have resulted in higher travel costs. DTS has corrected some of the previously reported travel problems but others remain. Specifically, DTS has resolved the problem related to duplicate payment for airline tickets purchased with the centrally billed accounts. However, problems remain related to improper premium class travel, unused tickets that are not refunded, and accuracy of traveler's claims. These remaining problems cannot be resolved solely within DTS and will take departmentwide action to address. GAO identified two key challenges facing DTS in becoming DOD's standard travel system: (1) developing needed interfaces and (2) underutilization of DTS at sites where it has been deployed. While DTS has developed 32 interfaces with various DOD business systems, it will have to develop interfaces with at least 17 additional systems--not a trivial task. Furthermore, the continued use of the existing legacy travel systems results in underutilization of DTS and affects the savings that DTS was planned to achieve. Components incur additional costs by operating two systems with the same function--the legacy system and DTS--and by paying higher processing fees for manual travel vouchers as opposed to processing the travel vouchers electronically through DTS."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our preliminary results of the  Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to develop and implement a new  standard end-to-end travel system.

In  response, DOD created the DOD Task Force to Reengineer Travel to  examine the process. In January 1995, the task force issued the Report of  the Department of Defense Task Force to Reengineer Travel. The Task  Force\u2019s report pinpointed three principal causes for DOD\u2019s inefficient  travel system: (1) travel policies and programs were focused on  compliance with rigid rules rather than mission performance, (2) travel  practices did not keep pace with travel management improvements  implemented by industry, and (3) the travel system was not integrated.", "On December 13, 1995, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics and the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer issued a memorandum,  \u201cReengineering Travel Initiative,\u201d establishing the PMO-DTS to acquire  travel services that would be used DOD-wide. Additionally, in a 1997  report to the Congress, the DOD Comptroller pointed out that the existing  DOD TDY travel system was never designed to be an integrated system.  Furthermore, the report stated that because there was no centralized  focus on the department\u2019s travel practices, the travel policies were issued  by different offices and the process had become fragmented and \u201cstove- piped.\u201d The report further noted that there was no vehicle in the current  structure to overcome these deficiencies, as no one individual within the  department had specific responsibility for management control of the TDY  travel system.", "To address these concerns and after the use of competitive procedures,  the department awarded a firm fixed-price, performance-based services  contract to BDM International, Inc. (BDM) in May 1998. In September  1998, we upheld the department\u2019s selection of BDM. Under the terms of  the contract, the contractor was to start deploying a travel system and to  begin providing travel services for approximately 11,000 sites worldwide,  within 120 days of the effective date of the contract, completing  deployment approximately 38 months later. The contract specified that,  upon DTS\u2019s achieving initial operational capability (IOC), BDM was to be  paid a one-time deployment fee of $20 for each user and a transaction fee  of $5.27 for each travel voucher processed. The estimated cost for the  contract was approximately $264 million. Prior to commencing the work,  BDM was acquired by TRW Inc. (TRW), which became the contractor of  record.", "The operational assessment of DTS at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri,  from October through December 2000, disclosed serious failures. For  example, the system\u2019s response time was slower than anticipated, the  result being that it took longer than expected to process a travel  order/voucher. Because of the severity of the problems, in January 2001, a  joint memorandum was issued by the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology & Logistics) directing a functional and technical assessment of  DTS. The memorandum also directed that a determination be made of any  future contract actions that would be necessary, based on the assessment  results. In July 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the  Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics)  approved proceeding with the DTS program and restructuring the contract  with TRW.", "The TRW contract was restructured through a series of contract  modifications which were finalized on March 29, 2002.

Northrop Grumman  subsequently acquired TRW in December 2002, and, as such, is now the  contractor of record.", "The first deployment of DTS was at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South  Dakota, in February 2002. As of September 2005, DTS has been deployed  to approximately 5,600 locations. The department currently estimates that  DTS will be fully deployed to all 11,000 locations by the end of fiscal year  2006, with an estimated total development and production cost of  approximately $474 million. Of this amount, the contract for the design,  development, and deployment of DTS, as restructured is worth  approximately $264 million\u2014the same amount as specified in the original  contract that was agreed to with BDM.

During fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD spent almost  $124 million on airline tickets that included at least one leg of the trip in  premium class\u2014usually business class. Because each premium class  ticket costs the government up to thousands of dollars more than a coach  class ticket, unauthorized premium class travel resulted in millions of  dollars of unnecessary costs annually.", "Because of control breakdowns, DOD paid for airline tickets that were  neither used nor processed for refund\u2014amounting to about 58,000 tickets  totaling more than $21 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. DOD was not  aware of this problem before our audit and did not maintain any data on  unused tickets. Based on limited data provided by the airlines, it is  possible that the unused value of the fully and partially unused tickets that  DOD purchased from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2003 with DOD\u2019s  CBA could be at least $100 million.", "We found that DOD sometimes paid twice for the same airline ticket\u2014first  to the Bank of America for the monthly DOD credit card bill, and second  to the traveler, who was reimbursed for the same ticket. Based on our  mining of limited data, the potential magnitude of the improper payments  was 27,000 transactions for over $8 million. For example, DOD paid a Navy  GS-15 civilian employee approximately $10,000 for 13 airline tickets he had  not purchased."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ongoing DTS Testing Remains a Concern", "paragraphs": ["DTS development and implementation have been problematic, especially  in the area of requirements and testing key functionality to ensure that the  system would perform as intended. Given the lack of adherence to such a  key practice, it is not surprising that critical flaws have been identified  after deployment, resulting in significant schedule slippages. As originally  envisioned, the initial deployment of DTS was to commence 120 days after  the effective date of the contract award in September 1998, with complete  deployment to approximately 11,000 locations by April 2002. However,  that date has been changed to September 2006\u2014a slippage of over 4 years.  Our recent analysis of selected requirements disclosed that the testing of  DTS is not always adequate prior to updated software being released for  use by DOD personnel. System testing is a critical process utilized by  organizations to improve an entity\u2019s confidence that the system will satisfy  the requirements of the end user and will operate as intended.  Additionally, an efficient and effective system testing program is one of the  critical elements that need to be in place in order to have reasonable  assurance that an organization has implemented the disciplined  processes necessary to reduce project risks to acceptable levels in  software development. In one key area, our results to date have identified  instances in which the testing of DTS was inadequate, which precluded  DOD from having reasonable assurance that DTS displayed the proper  flights and airfares. This occurred because the PMO-DTS failed to ensure  that the appropriate system interfaces were tested. Additionally, because a  system requirement covering this had never been defined, there was not  reasonable assurance that DTS displayed the accurate number of flights  and related airfares within a given flight window. As a result of these two  weaknesses, DOD travelers might not have received accurate information  on available flights and airfares, which could have resulted in higher travel  costs. Specific details on these two weaknesses are discussed below.", "The DOD tests for determining whether DTS displayed the proper flights  and airfares did not provide reasonable assurance that the proper (1)  flights were displayed and (2) airfares for those flights were displayed.  DTS uses a commercial product to obtain information from the database  that contains the applicable flight and airfare information (commonly  referred to as a Global Distribution System or ). In testing whether  DTS displayed the proper flights and airfares, the information returned  from the commercial product was compared with the information  displayed in DTS and was found to be in agreement. However, the  commercial product did not provide all of the appropriate flights or  airfares to DTS that were contained in the GDS. Since the PMO-DTS  neither performed an end-to-end test nor made sure that the information  returned from this commercial product was in agreement with the  information contained in the GDS, it did not have reasonable assurance  that DTS was displaying the proper flights and airfares information to the  users. According to DOD officials, this system weakness was detected by  users complaining that DTS did not display the proper flights and airfares.", "DOD officials stated that prior to the August 2005 system update, DTS  should have displayed 12 flights, if that many flights were available, within  a flight window. DTS program officials and Northrop Grumman  personnel acknowledged that this particular system requirement had  never been tested because DOD failed to document the requirement until  January 2005. Therefore, DOD did not have reasonable assurance that DTS  displayed the required number of flights and related airfare information.  The inability to ensure that the proper number of flights was displayed  could have caused DOD to incur unnecessary travel cost. As we have  noted in previous reports, requirements that are not defined are unlikely to  be tested.", "PMO-DTS officials acknowledged that these two problems have been  ongoing since the initial implementation of DTS. PMO-DTS officials have  stated that the two problems were corrected as part of the August 2005  DTS system update.

In November 2003, the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and  Readiness) formed a task force to address our prior recommendations  that focused on three major areas: (1) policy and controls of travel  authorization, (2) ticket issuance and reporting, and (3) internal control  and oversight. Subsequently, several policy changes were made to improve  the control and accountability over premium class travel. For example, the  approval level for first class travel was elevated to a three-star general and  for business class travel to a two-star general or civilian equivalent. Other  changes included strengthening the description of circumstances when  premium class travel may be used to more clearly show that it is an  exceptional circumstance and not a common practice. In all cases,  approving officials must have their own premium class travel approved at  the next level. These changes also set a broad policy that CTOs are not to  issue premium class tickets without proper authorization. In September  2004, the PMO-DTS made system changes to DTS that blocked seven fare  codes that were considered to be premium class fare codes from being  displayed or selected by the traveler through DTS. According to the PMO- DTS, the airline industry does not have standardized fare code indicators  to identify first class, business class, and economy class. Subsequently,  DOD found that economy class fare codes were being blocked using the  seven codes and in May 2005, reduced the list to three codes.", "Despite these various changes in policy and to DTS, we continue to  identify instances in which premium class travel is occurring without the  proper authorization. To date, our preliminary analysis disclosed at least  68 cases that involved improperly approved premium class travel. In one  case, we found that a Department of the Army civilian employee (GS-12)  flew from Columbia, South Carolina via Atlanta, Georgia to Gulf Port,  Mississippi to attend a conference. On the return trip, one leg included  first class accommodations. From our review and analysis of Bank of  America data and the travel voucher, DOD paid $1,107 for the airfare. The  cost of a GSA city pair round trip airfare was $770. According to  information provided by the Army, the traveler informed the Army that he  was meeting another traveler at the destination and they were going to  share a rental car and there were no seats available on the flight the other  traveler had booked. Therefore, the individual selected a flight arriving as  close as possible to the time of the traveler he was meeting. This is not a  valid justification, and the premium class fare was not approved by the  appropriate official. Additionally, the premium class fare occurred on the  return flight.

Additionally, the various DOD  components were directed to modify existing CTO contracts to require the  CTOs to process refunds for unused airline tickets. At the five locations  we visited we found that the Army and Air Force CTOs prepared daily  and monthly reports.

However, we continue to identify numerous instances in which  employee errors led to inaccurate reimbursements. In some cases, errors  occurred because incorrect data were entered into DTS by the traveler. In  other cases, the reviews by the AOs were inadequate. In regard to the AO  reviews, our preliminary analysis indicates that approximately 66 travel  vouchers or 39 percent were paid even though there was not reasonable  assurance that the amount of the reimbursement was accurate. More  specifically, 49 of 66 travel vouchers lacked adequate receipts for the  amounts claimed. Receipts are required for all expenses of $75 or more  and for lodging, regardless of the amount. However, for the 49 vouchers,  we saw no evidence that the AO was provided with the appropriate  receipts by the traveler. In one case, the traveler was reimbursed for  expenses claimed in excess of $500, even though none of the required  receipts were available for review and approval by the AO.

While  DOD has developed 32 interfaces, the PMO-DTS is aware of at least 17  additional DOD business systems for which interfaces must be developed.  To date, the development and testing of the interfaces has cost DOD  reportedly over $30 million. Developing the interfaces is time consuming  and costly. Additionally, the underutilization of DTS at the sites where it  has been deployed is also hindering the department\u2019s efforts to have a  standard travel system throughout the department.

To address this issue and minimize the manual entry of data,  interfaces between existing systems must be developed to provide the  exchange of data that is critical for day-to-day operations. For example,  DTS needs to know before permitting the authorization of travel that  sufficient funds are available to pay for the travel\u2014information that comes  from a non-DTS system\u2014and once the travel has been authorized, another  system needs to know this information so that it can record an obligation  and provide management and other systems with information on the funds  that remain available.

This is understandable in some  cases such as the Army General Fund Financial enterprise resource  planning (ERP), which is a relatively new endeavor within the  department and it will be some time before DOD is in position to start  development of the interface. Additionally, the development of the DTS  interfaces depends on other system owners\u2019 achieving their time frames  for implementation. For example, the Navy ERP is one of the DOD  systems with which DTS is to interface and exchange data. Any difficulties  with the Navy\u2019s ERP implementation schedule could adversely affect  DTS\u2019s interface testing and, thereby, result in a slippage in the interface  being implemented.

As set out below, DOD  officials told us that they have yet to complete the exercise of some of  DOD\u2019s intellectual property rights and to secure title to hardware  necessary to meet its long-term acquisition needs, but those steps are in  progress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Property Rights Under the Original DTS Contract", "paragraphs": ["The original DTS contract awarded in 1998 did not specifically address the  Government\u2019s intellectual property rights because the contract was  structured primarily as a fixed-priced travel services contact rather than as  a government-funded development effort. As such, the contractor was  responsible for securing the necessary intellectual property rights in the  commercial software and other products being used, except for those  pertaining to existing DOD systems or used by DOD under other  agreements. The fixed price for the services would include the cost to the  contractor to obtain or develop the necessary software, hardware, and  technical data in order to provide the required travel services to DOD.", "According to DOD officials, DOD and TRW determined in 2001 that three  key commercial software programs used in DTS would not meet DOD\u2019s  requirements without modification. Accordingly, in September 2001, TRW  executed a license agreement with the firm holding the copyright to the  software programs for TRW to use in developing and deploying DTS  within DOD. The firm charged TRW with a one-time fee for the rights  under the agreement.", "Under the license agreement, TRW obtained a perpetual and exclusive  license to use the three software programs and related software  documentation to develop and deploy software and services for use in the  DTS. This license includes the authority to modify the source code to one  of the software programs. The license agreement authorizes the  assignment of TRW\u2019s rights under the agreement to DOD for the DTS  project. The license agreement does not expressly condition such an  assignment on payment of a fee. According to DOD officials, DOD has  approached Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp.  (Northrop Grumman), as the successor to TRW, requesting assignment of  those rights to DOD. In a September 22, 2005, letter to the DTS contracting  officer, Northrop Grumman represented that they would assign its rights  under the license agreement to DOD at the conclusion of the contract, if  requested.", "The license agreement also provides that Northrop Grumman may  sublicense its rights under the agreement to other entities in support of  DTS. DOD officials told us that they believe Northrop Grumman\u2019s  assignment of these rights to DOD would include the authority for DOD to  sublicense the rights to other DOD contractors for use in providing  services related to DTS. The DOD officials noted that they are in the  process of modernizing the DTS application to include a potential  complete replacement of the licensed software with custom developed  software. The officials stated that they are still evaluating whether an  assignment of rights and issuance of any sublicenses actually would be  needed in light of these changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Property Rights Under the Restructured Contract", "paragraphs": ["In the restructuring of the DTS contract, DOD and TRW agreed to address  a number of intellectual and tangible property categories under the  contract that DOD officials told us would satisfy DOD\u2019s long-term DTS  development and implementation plans. The restructured contract  incorporated several standard DOD intellectual property rights clauses,  but DOD is still evaluating ownership rights related to key hardware used  in the DTS.", "The restructured contract incorporates standard DOD intellectual  property rights clauses for a system being developed at government  expense and it specifically gives DOD perpetual rights to DTS software.  The perpetual rights for different categories of intellectual property  generally depend upon the source of the funding of their development. In  particular, the contract requires Northrop Grumman to \u201cprovide a  perpetual license for DOD use worldwide for DTS software\u201d in accordance  with certain standard clauses or in accordance with standard commercial  terms for commercial software. Also, the contract incorporates a clause  that requires Northrop Grumman to grant or obtain for the government  royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable license rights in  technical data. Further, these clauses include provisions that permit  Northrop Grumman to assert restrictions on the government\u2019s use, release  or disclosure of technical data and computer software, depending upon  the funding of their development. For commercial software used in the  DTS, Northrop Grumman has asserted restrictions applicable to  commercial software licenses. Some of the licenses Northrop Grumman  obtained for use of commercial software may be neither perpetual nor  assignable to DOD, but DOD officials told us that this does not cause risk  to the project since there are available alternative methods to acquire  similar licenses. Table 1 sets out DOD\u2019s rights in these categories. Finally,  the contract incorporated a standard clause governing restrictions DOD  may place on information it provides to Northrop Grumman for use under  the contract.", "The restructured contract requires Northrop Grumman to provide all  hardware (and other equipment) necessary to deliver services under the  contract, but DOD officials told us that they are discussing delivery  schedules and ownership rights to hardware items, principally  configuration items. In a September 23, 2005, letter to the DTS contracting  officer, Northrop Grumman represented that they would assign title to  certain hardware at the conclusion of the contract, if requested.

In this regard, we focused on how DTS  addresses issues related to premium class travel, unused tickets, and  centrally billed accounts. We also randomly sampled 170 travel vouchers  to ascertain if some of the problems previously reported upon by DFAS  have been resolved. To be included within the selected sample, the travel  vouchers had to be for trips that were in DTS and for travel started on or  after October 1, 2004, and ended on or before December 31, 2004. We have  not yet finalized our projections for the sample. To assess the use of  premium class travel, we obtained databases from Bank of America and  the Project Management Office-Defense Travel System (PMO-DTS), which  provided information on the actual travel transactions and traveler  information for the period October-December 2004. The Bank of America\u2019s  database contained all DOD transactions for the first quarter of fiscal year  2005, and the PMO-DTS database contained all vouchers processed by  DTS for the same time period. We removed all transactions that were not  specifically airline charges, such as rail charges and commercial travel  office fees, and then selected all fare codes that corresponded to the  potential issuance of a premium class ticket. This resulted in 419 instances  in which a premium class ticket could have been issued. We have not  finalized our analysis.", "To identify some of the challenges confronting the department in making  DTS the department\u2019s standard travel system, we discussed with PMO-DTS  officials their implementation strategy and reviewed past GAO reports and  testimonies related to the department\u2019s efforts to improve the accuracy  and reliability of the information in its business systems.", "We briefed DOD officials on the contents of this testimony. We assessed  the reliability of the DOD data we used for our preliminary evaluation by  (1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing  existing information about the data and the system that produced them,  and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data.
