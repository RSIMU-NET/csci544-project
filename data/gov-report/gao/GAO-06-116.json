Under the authority of the Comptroller General of the United States, and as part of a body of GAO work on the issue of offshoring of services, this report (1) describes the extent of the gap between U.S. and Indian data, (2) identifies factors that contribute to the difference between the two countries' data, and (3) examines the challenges the United States has faced in collecting services trade data. GAO has addressed this report to the congressional committees of jurisdiction."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The gap between U.S. and Indian data on trade in BPT services is significant. For example, data show that for 2003, the United States reported $420 million in unaffiliated imports of BPT services from India, while India reported approximately $8.7 billion in exports of affiliated and unaffiliated BPT services to the United States. At least five definitional and methodological factors contribute to the difference between U.S. and Indian data on BPT services. First, India and the United States follow different practices in accounting for the earnings of temporary Indian workers residing in the United States. Second, India defines certain services, such as software embedded on computer hardware, differently than the United States. Third, India and the United States follow different practices for counting sales by India to U.S.-owned firms located outside of the United States. The United States follows International Monetary Fund standards for each of these factors. Fourth, BEA does not report country-specific data for particular types of services due to concerns about the quality of responses it receives from firms when they allocate their affiliated imports to detailed types of services. As a result, U.S. data on BPT services include only unaffiliated imports from India, while Indian data include both affiliated and unaffiliated exports. Fifth, other differences, such as identifying all services importers, may also contribute to the data gap. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has experienced challenges in identifying all U.S. services importers and obtaining quality survey data from importers. To test BEA's survey coverage, GAO provided BEA with lists of firms identified from public sources as likely importers of BPT services from India. The results of this test showed that some services importers were not included in BEA's mailing lists. However, BEA has taken action to address these challenges, including collaborating with other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service, to better identify firms to survey. However, data-sharing restrictions hamper BEA's efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The offshoring of services from the United States to overseas locations has  grown recently and is the subject of debate over its extent and  consequences for the United States.

The extent of and reasons for this gap are important to  understand in order to address questions about the magnitude of offshoring  and to analyze its future development.", "In response to widespread congressional interest, we have prepared this  report under the authority of the Comptroller General of the United States.  We examine in this report several issues related to the gap between U.S.  and Indian trade data on BPT services. Specifically:  What is the extent of the gap between U.S. and Indian data on trade in  BPT services?", "What factors explain the difference between U.S. data on imports of  BPT services and India\u2019s data on exports of those same services?", "What challenges has the United States faced in collecting services data?", "To address these questions, we compared U.S. and Indian services trade  data, reviewed official methodologies, and interviewed U.S. and Indian  government officials from relevant agencies, including the Department of  Commerce\u2019s U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Reserve  Bank of India (RBI). In order to examine the coverage of BEA surveys for  collecting services data, we supplied BEA with a list of companies we  collected to compare with its mailing lists. We identified these companies  through publicly available sources, including public media, company filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, annual reports of  companies, the list of National Association of Software and Service  Companies (NASSCOM) members, and lists of companies compiled by  information technology interest groups. Our lists of firms are not  necessarily representative of all U.S. firms importing from India, and we do  not generalize our results. We also met with representatives and reviewed  documents from members of NASSCOM, which assists in collecting India\u2019s  services data. We interviewed a range of U.S. and Indian businesses that  supply these data to the United States and India and reviewed relevant  literature on the reliability of U.S. statistics. NASSCOM did not provide us  with their methodology for ensuring the reliability of their data. However,  RBI recently released a public report outlining a new methodology to  collect services exports data separately from NASSCOM, and in  accordance with balance of payments (BOP) requirements of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a U.S. government agency, we do  not have review authority over these data. Therefore, we were not able to  independently assess the quality and consistency of these data. However,  for the purposes of this report, we found both U.S. and Indian data to be  sufficiently reliable for reporting the difference between the official U.S.  and Indian trade data in BPT services. We conducted our analysis in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards from  March 2005 through September 2005. A detailed description of our scope  and methodology appears in appendix I. This report is one of a series of  reports that we plan to issue on offshoring."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in September 2004, improvements in information  technology, decreasing data transmission costs, and expanded  infrastructure in developing countries have facilitated services offshoring.  Offshoring is reflected in services import data because when a company  replaces work done domestically with work done overseas, such as in India  or China, the services are now being imported from overseas. For example,  when a U.S.-based company pays for a service (such as computer and data  processing services in India), the payment is recorded as a services import  (from India in this example). BEA reports data on trade in services that are  frequently associated with offshoring.", "BEA\u2019s trade in services data consist of cross-border transactions between  U.S. and foreign residents and comprise five broad categories of services.  One of these five categories of services is \u201cother private services,\u201d which  includes key sectors associated with offshoring under the subcategory of  BPT services. In 2003, BPT services accounted for $40.8 billion or 48  percent of U.S. imports of \u201cother private services,\u201d which totaled $85.8  billion. (See fig. 1.)", "U.S. data on BPT services differentiate between affiliated and unaffiliated  trade. Affiliated trade occurs between U.S. parent firms and their foreign  affiliates and between foreign parent firms and their affiliates in the United  States; while unaffiliated trade occurs between U.S. entities and foreigners  that do not own, nor are owned by, the U.S. entity. In 2003, total U.S.  imports of affiliated BPT services accounted for approximately $29.9  billion, or about 73 percent of all U.S. imports of these services. BEA does  not disaggregate affiliated trade by country, in particular types of services,  due to its concerns about the accuracy and completeness of data firms\u2019  report. Total U.S. imports of unaffiliated BPT services amounted to  approximately $11.0 billion in 2003, or about 27 percent of the total  unaffiliated U.S. imports of BPT services. According to U.S. data, the  growth of U.S. trade in BPT services has been rapid. For example, from  1994 to 2003, total unaffiliated U.S. imports of these services more than  doubled. In addition, U.S. exports of unaffiliated BPT services almost  doubled during the same period.", "To report data on trade in BPT services, BEA conducts mandatory  quarterly, annual, and 5-year benchmark surveys of firms in the United  States. In administering its services surveys, BEA seeks to collect  information from the entire universe of firms with transactions in BPT  services above certain threshold levels for the period covered by each  survey. The mailing lists for the surveys include firms in the United States  that have previously filed a survey and other firms that BEA believes may  have had transactions in the services covered by the survey. The mailing  lists of firms receiving surveys are derived, in part, from U.S. government  sources, industry associations, business directories, and various  periodicals. Firms receiving the surveys are required to report transactions  above a certain threshold value, which BEA believes, in theory, captures  virtually the entire universe of transactions in the services covered by its  surveys. Those firms with transactions falling below the threshold value  are exempt from reporting data by type of service, but they are asked to  voluntarily provide estimates of the aggregate value of their transactions  for all services covered by the survey.", "The trade data that BEA produces help government officials, business  decision makers, researchers, and the American public to follow and  understand the performance of the U.S. economy. For example, analysts  and policy makers use U.S. trade data to assess the impact of international  trade on the U.S. balance of payments and the overall economy. In addition,  U.S. trade data are used by trade policy officials to negotiate international  trade agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Significant Gap Exists between U.S. and Indian Trade-in- Services Data", "paragraphs": ["U.S. data show a significantly smaller volume of trade in BPT services  between India and the United States than Indian data show. BEA data on  U.S. imports of unaffiliated BPT services from India indicate that U.S. firms  import only a small fraction of the total that India reported in exports of  similar services to the United States. In addition, this gap has grown  between 2002 and 2003. This gap does not exist just for U.S. and Indian  data. A similar gap also exists between other developed countries\u2019 import  data and Indian export data.", "BEA data show a rapid increase in U.S. imports of unaffiliated BPT services  from India. For 2002, the total unaffiliated U.S. imports of BPT services  from India totaled approximately $240 million. For 2003, the total  unaffiliated U.S. imports of BPT services from India increased to about  $420 million. India reports exports to the United States of similar services  of about $6.5 billion for 2002 and $8.7 billion for 2003. Thus, the value of  the gap between U.S. and Indian data in 2002 was approximately $6.2  billion and, in 2003, was about $8.3 billion, an increase of about one-third.  (See fig. 2.)", "RBI, which is India\u2019s central bank, is responsible for reporting official  Indian data on trade in services. However, RBI data on trade in services  incorporate the data collected by India\u2019s primary information technology  association\u2014the National Association of Software and Service Companies  (NASSCOM). To improve the completeness of the data NASSCOM provides  to RBI, NASSCOM includes data on the software services exports it  receives from an Indian government program, the Software Technology  Parks of India (STPI). While RBI does not provide country-specific data on  India\u2019s exports of services to the United States, NASSCOM\u2019s data do  provide a country-specific breakdown. Thus, the data cited above for India  come from NASSCOM. According to a recent RBI report, a technical group  recommended in 2003 that RBI compile data on software and information  technology exports through quarterly surveys, and through a  comprehensive survey to be conducted every 3 years. The first of these  studies was released in September 2005, as our report was being finalized,  and provides data on Indian exports of computer services for 2002.

U.S. data do not include such  salaries as cross-border trade in services. The United States only includes  the salaries paid to temporary foreign workers who have been in the United  States less than 1 year and are not on the payrolls of firms in the United  States. However, Indian data do include, as Indian exports, the value of  services provided by Indian workers employed in the United States for  more than 1 year, according to Indian officials. The U.S. approach accords  with the international standards of IMF. According to BEA and  international standards, cross-border trade in services occurs between  residents of a country and nonresidents, or \u201cforeigners,\u201d and residency of a  temporary foreign worker employed abroad is based, in part, on the  worker\u2019s length of stay in the country. Therefore, according to these  standards, if a temporary foreign worker stays or intends to stay in the  United States for 1 year or more, that worker is considered a U.S. resident,  and the value of the work performed is not included in U.S. import data.", "The treatment of services provided by temporary foreign workers in the  United States is likely a significant factor contributing to the difference  between U.S. and Indian data, according to Indian officials. Some Indian  officials estimated that in past years, approximately 40 percent of India\u2019s  exports to the United States of services corresponding to BPT services  were delivered by temporary Indian workers in the United States. For  example, for 2002, RBI found that approximately 47 percent of India\u2019s  global exports of computer services occurred through the on-site delivery  of services by temporary Indian workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "India Defines Services Differently Than Does the United States", "paragraphs": ["U.S. and Indian data differ, in part, due to differences in how both countries  count services trade. India counts as trade in services certain transactions  in software that are classified as trade in goods in U.S. data. For example,  Indian data on trade in services include software embedded on computer  hardware, which the United States classifies as trade in goods. Consistent  with internationally recommended standards, the United States does not  separate the value of embedded software that is physically shipped to or  from the United States from the overall value of the media or computer in which it is installed. Thus, the value of such software is not recorded as  trade in services but is included in the value of the physical media and  hardware\u2013-which are counted as trade in goods in U.S. data. We were not  able to determine the extent to which this factor contributes to the  difference in U.S. and Indian data because we found no estimates of the  proportion of embedded software in Indian data on services exports to the  United States. Indian officials stated that the difference in the treatment of  embedded software likely does not significantly contribute to the  difference in data because India exports a relatively low value of embedded  software. For example, according to Indian officials, the portion of India\u2019s  global services exports delivered through physical media and hardware  accounts for 10 to 15 percent of the total value of India-reported exports of  services corresponding to BPT services.", "U.S. and Indian data also differ in how they define services in their  respective data series. Unlike BEA, RBI and NASSCOM do not report data  under the category of BPT services. RBI officials stated that it reports trade  data on services similar to BPT services under the category of Software  Services. RBI does not report a breakdown of its data on software services  into subcategories of services. According to a NASSCOM official,  NASSCOM classifies its trade data on services that most closely  correspond to BPT services under Information Technology and  Information Technology-Enabled Services (IT-ITES). The subcategories of  services under this classification do not directly correspond to the  subcategories of BPT services, but are similar. For example, under its IT- ITES classification, NASSCOM reports data on IT Services and Software,  while BPT services include computer and data processing, and database  and other information services. However, NASSCOM includes data on  certain information technology-enabled services, such as certain financial  services, that are not included in BEA\u2019s definition of BPT services, but are  recorded separately.

BEA reports country-specific data only for unaffiliated U.S. imports of BPT  services, while Indian data include both affiliated and unaffiliated trade in  services but do not separate the two. BEA reports detailed data only for  unaffiliated trade because it has concerns about the accuracy and  completeness of the data that firms report about affiliated trade in BPT  services by country. For example, multinational firms with global offices  may find it difficult to establish where, between whom, and what type of  services have been transacted; and report these data along national lines to  a statistical agency. BEA does collect data on overall affiliated services  trade, but it reports only the total value across all countries due to its  concerns about the reliability of how companies are allocating these totals  to specific countries. In addition, due to concerns over the reporting  burden on U.S. companies, BEA collects less detailed data on affiliated  transactions than on unaffiliated transactions.", "U.S. data on overall affiliated trade across all countries show that a  significant majority of total U.S. imports of BPT services take the form of  trade between parents and affiliates. For example, for 2003, approximately  three-quarters of all U.S. imports of BPT services\u2014about $29.9 billion\u2014 represented trade within multinational firms. If U.S.-Indian trade in these  services reflects this overall share of trade through affiliates, then  unreported affiliated trade with India may be much larger than the  unaffiliated trade that is reported. Therefore, the lack of reported data on  affiliated imports of BPT services contributes to the difference in data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Data Collection and Methodological Differences May Contribute to the Difference between U.S. and Indian Data", "paragraphs": ["There are differences in the sources of data the United States and India use  to collect data on trade in services, which may contribute to overcounting  or undercounting of services trade. While both BEA and NASSCOM  prepare estimates of cross-border trade in services by surveying qualifying  firms, U.S. and Indian data differ in the universe of such firms covered by  their survey methodologies.", "The universe of firms in India exporting services is relatively easily  identified because these firms have an incentive to report data on their  exports of services and tend to be concentrated in certain industries. For  example, firms exporting software services are required to report export  data to the government of India\u2019s STPI program. STPI requires firms to  report these data in order to comply with India\u2019s foreign exchange controls  and to qualify for certain tax incentives and infrastructure benefits. To  improve the completeness of its own survey data from its member firms,  NASSCOM incorporates information on other exporters collected under  the STPI program prior to providing these data to RBI. In addition, services  exporting firms tend to be concentrated in certain industries. For instance,  according to Indian officials, NASSCOM surveys its member firms in India  to collect the annual dollar value of these firms\u2019 exports. The member firms  that NASSCOM surveys number approximately 900 and, according to a  NASSCOM official, these firms contribute a large share of India\u2019s total  exports of these services. In addition, RBI has begun its own  comprehensive survey of companies, which according to RBI, covered all  of the identified companies engaged in software and IT services exports  activities. RBI identified these companies on the basis of lists provided by  NASSCOM, STPI, and the Electronics and Computer Software Export  Promotion Council (ESC).", "In contrast to how India identifies firms exporting services, BEA does not  have an easily available list of services importers. Instead, it must identify  firms from public sources. BEA acknowledges that its survey methodology  may contribute to the undercounting of U.S. imports of services due, in  part, to the difficulty it faces in identifying the universe of services  importers. The firms in the United States that BEA surveys to estimate U.S.  imports are in many different industries and number in the thousands.  Thus, BEA notes that it is difficult to establish and maintain a  comprehensive mailing list for all U.S. firms importing services from  foreign sources, particularly if the group of firms that import services  changes substantially from year to year. In addition, maintaining accurate  coverage using surveys is particularly difficult when there is rapid growth  in the activity, as is the case with BPT services imports from India. Under  BEA regulations, BEA exempts smaller importers from reporting their  imports. Instead, it estimates these imports on the basis of a sample. If the  value of smaller transactions is higher than BEA assumes in its estimation  procedures, then imports of services would be understated. BEA,  therefore, may undercount the total value of U.S. imports of services.", "The data collection entities\u2013-BEA and NASSCOM\u2013-also differ significantly  in mission and scope. BEA is the U.S. agency charged with collecting,  analyzing, and reporting official statistics on a broad range of U.S. imports  and exports of services. BEA is regarded as a leading statistical  organization, and it provides both statistical concepts and best practices to  other countries and statistical organizations worldwide. NASSCOM is not a  government statistical agency. It is a private trade association that  represents the interests of the software and services industry in India, and  data collection is but one element of a broader mission that focuses on  representing that industry. Recently, RBI has recognized a need to  reexamine the current methodology on the collection of software exports  data, and is utilizing a methodology to collect services data in accordance  with IMF standards.

Thus, 15 of the 104  firms we identified on the basis of public-source data as likely importing  BPT services from India, reported those imports to BEA. High-level BEA  officials indicated that it is possible that companies are not reporting  country information because they fall below the survey exemption levels  and, thus, were not required to provide such detailed data to BEA. BEA  requests firms falling below survey exemption levels to voluntarily report  aggregate transactions for all countries combined, without a country- specific breakdown.", "While these results cannot be generalized, they confirm the challenges of  collecting services import data.

For  example, BEA contracted with a private firm to undertake an external  review of its data sources and methods of identifying these services  importers. The review will examine the extent of undercounting in both  affiliated and unaffiliated services transactions, including the possible  sources of undercounting, and any additional methods or sources of  information that will improve survey coverage. The goals of this effort  include identifying the extent of qualified firms that are not currently on the  survey mailing lists, and to improve the estimates of international  transactions. BEA expects the results of this review early in fiscal year  2006. BEA also has made efforts to ensure that firms receive the surveys for  which they are qualified.

In  addition, to improve the quality of its data on affiliated services imports,  including affiliated imports of BPT services, BEA is considering collecting  data on both affiliated and unaffiliated transactions on the same survey  form.

According to BEA officials, other federal agencies, such as Census, possess  data that could assist BEA in preparing its estimates of trade in services,  including information on firms in the United States that could be importing  services. For example, Census surveys firms to collect data of firms\u2019  business expenses, which include the purchase of BPT services. These  surveys may be useful to identify importers because large purchasers of  services may also be importing these services. The survey data that Census  currently collects are not directly useful for BEA because the data on  business expenses do not separate domestic from international expenses  and do not distinguish between affiliated and unaffiliated transactions.  However, BEA would get name and addresses of potential services  importers. In addition, BEA could potentially request that Census add  questions to one or more of the surveys that Census administers in order to  identify services importers.", "However, BEA currently faces legal restrictions in gaining access to data  utilized by Census. Although federal laws allow such data sharing between  Census and BEA, BEA is generally restricted from gaining access to federal  tax information that Census obtains from the Internal Revenue Service.

Some of this  difference in data can be attributed to varying definitions of BPT services,  but some also appears to be due to incomplete U.S. data. BEA has been  seeking various ways to improve the overall quality of U.S. services trade  data, but our test of whether they had identified BPT service importers  indicated that they were not identifying all U.S. importers of services.  Given the importance of this category of data in understanding the extent  of offshoring of services, a subject of continuing public and congressional  concern, we believe that additional efforts to strengthen the quality of U.S.  services data are merited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending that the Secretary of Commerce direct BEA to  systematically expand its sources of information for identifying firms to  survey. BEA should consider ways to improve its identification of the  appropriate survey forms to send to firms and the information requested  about services imports, particularly with regard to affiliated imports.

In particular, Commerce agreed that BEA should pursue  additional company information from Census. Commerce also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "Following the receipt of agency comments from Commerce, RBI publicly  released a report outlining a new methodology to compile services export  data in accordance with IMF standards. Although RBI\u2019s new survey  methodology conforms more closely to IMF standards for defining  international transactions in services, differences between U.S. and Indian  data remain due to a variety of factors we discuss in this report. For  example, the RBI report acknowledges that Indian data include not only  exports of computer-related services but also exports of ITES. Since the  primary objective of RBI\u2019s survey was to collect data on software exports in  conformity with IMF\u2019s definition of computer services, RBI\u2019s survey data  exclude data from companies exclusively exporting ITES, and include only  data on computer services. However, RBI\u2019s report does not indicate that  RBI\u2019s survey methodology addresses other factors contributing to the  difference between U.S. and Indian data. For example, it appears that RBI\u2019s  survey data include the earnings of foreign temporary workers employed  abroad without taking into account their length of stay or intention to  remain abroad. RBI estimated this on-site work to account for  approximately 47 percent of India\u2019s total worldwide exports, although  some portion of this total may include services provided by temporary  Indian workers employed abroad for over 1 year. In addition, RBI\u2019s report  does not indicate that sales of embedded software are excluded from RBI\u2019s  survey data.", "We are providing copies of this report to interested congressional  committees and the Secretary of Commerce.

RBI relies on a trade association, the National  Association of Service and Software Companies (NASSCOM), to collect  data on these services. Although we reviewed NASSCOM's survey form and  discussed with a NASSCOM official the collection of their statistics,  NASSCOM did not provide us with their methodology for ensuring the  reliability of their data. Therefore, we were not able to independently  assess the quality and consistency of their data.

We reviewed documentation  and technical notes from BEA and RBI to determine the U.S. and Indian  methodologies for collecting and reporting trade in services data and to  assess the limitations and reliability of various data series. We discussed  these topics with BEA officials. In addition, we traveled to India to  interview RBI officials and NASSCOM representatives and to obtain  documentation on the collection and limitations of Indian data. We also  interviewed a range of U.S. and Indian businesses in India that supply trade  data to the United States and India to determine how they report data. We  performed a literature search and obtained information from the Brookings  Institution, the Institute for International Economics, and the Organization  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

We  developed two lists. The first list included the names and addresses of  companies in the United States with affiliate offices in India that are likely  importing BPT services from India through affiliates. The second list  included the names and addresses of companies that are likely purchasers  of services through unaffiliated parties in India. We identified these  companies through publicly available sources, including public media,  company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, annual  reports of companies, the list of NASSCOM member companies, and lists of  companies compiled by information technology interest groups. Our lists  of firms are not necessarily representative of all U.S. firms importing from  India, and we do not generalize our results.", "We asked BEA to compare these lists with the following mailing lists for  affiliated and unaffiliated surveys to identify how many companies it was  surveying: We requested that BEA provide us with the number of companies from  both lists that BEA was able to identify and not identify on its  corresponding mailing lists. For companies that received a survey, we  asked BEA to identify the number of these companies that responded to  the survey and provided information on purchases from India. For  companies that were not on any mailing list, BEA was asked to identify (1)  whether the firms were excluded from its mailing list because they were  assumed to be below exemption levels for the particular survey, (2)  whether the firms are on BEA\u2019s current mailing list for the particular  survey, and (3) whether the firms are listed on other BEA mailing lists.
