Title I of the law replaced the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program with fixed block grants to states to provide Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and ended families\u2019 entitlement to assistance. In fiscal year 1997, $16.7 billion in federal TANF funds was made available to the states, and states provided assistance to 3.9 million families in an average month. Several goals of the TANF program are specified in the law, including that of ending welfare dependence by promoting work over welfare and self-reliance over dependency, and the law provides states with increased flexibility to help them achieve those goals. The law strengthens existing requirements that most of those receiving assistance seek employment and cooperate with child support authorities. At the same time, to address concerns that some of the new requirements could unfairly penalize victims of domestic violence or put some of them at greater risk of harm, the bill includes a provision (Title I, part A, sec. 402), generally referred to as the Family Violence Option, that allows states to identify domestic violence victims and, when appropriate, waive program requirements for them.", "The Conference Agreement of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required that we study and report on the effects of family violence on the use of welfare programs (the names of addressees are listed at the end of this letter). Accordingly, this report provides a summary of the research findings on (1) the prevalence of domestic violence among welfare recipients and (2) the implications of domestic violence for the employment of welfare recipients and other low-income women. We conducted a literature search of several on-line bibliographic databases, including Sociological Abstracts, Social Science Index, ECONLIT, and PsychInfo; reviewed bibliographies of key research studies on this issue; and consulted with experts on domestic violence issues to identify other studies we should consider. In identifying and reviewing studies on the implications of domestic violence for employment among welfare recipients, we included related studies that did not look at welfare recipients exclusively, when we felt that such studies would add to our knowledge of the situations faced by welfare recipients. We conducted our work from March through September 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["PRWORA gave states the flexibility to design their own strategies for achieving TANF program goals, including the goal of helping welfare recipients move into the workforce. States can establish their own eligibility requirements and decide what assistance and services will be available. At the same time, states must meet federal requirements that emphasize the importance of work for those receiving assistance. PRWORA requires that, to avoid federal financial penalties, states must ensure that specified minimum percentages of their caseloads participate in work or work-related activities each year. In fiscal year 1997, states were to ensure that adult recipients in 25 percent of all TANF families and 75 percent of two-parent TANF families were engaged in work or work-related activities; these participation rate requirements increase in subsequent years, reaching 50 percent and 90 percent, respectively, in fiscal year 2002. States must impose a sanction on recipients who do not comply with TANF program requirements by reducing recipients\u2019 cash grants or, at state option, by terminating the entire family\u2019s cash grant. In addition, with the exception of 20 percent of a state\u2019s caseload, federally funded TANF assistance is limited to 5 years.", "Through the Family Violence Option, states can exempt individual victims of domestic violence from program requirements\u2014including those related to participation in work activities, cooperation with child support authorities, and the 5-year time limit on receipt of federally funded TANF benefits\u2014and refer these individuals to counseling and supportive services. States that choose to adopt the Family Violence Option certify that they will screen TANF recipients for domestic violence; refer them to domestic violence and related services; and, when good cause is established, waive program requirements for them when complying would make leaving an abusive situation more difficult or would penalize those who are, have been, or are at risk of experiencing domestic violence. As of September 1998, 24 states had formally adopted the Family Violence Option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prevalence of Domestic Violence Among Welfare Recipients", "paragraphs": ["Available studies on the prevalence of domestic violence among welfare recipients consistently indicate that a sizable proportion of welfare recipients have been or are victims of some type of abuse by an intimate partner. Although nationwide estimates are not available, we identified some relevant research studies that are based on smaller geographic areas or participants in particular programs. According to these studies, approximately 15 to 56 percent of the women surveyed reported that they were current victims or had been victims of physical domestic abuse in the 12 months preceding the survey, and between 55 and 65 percent reported that they had been physically abused by an intimate partner at some point in their lives. (See app. I for more information on the findings of the studies we reviewed.) These estimates are higher than estimates of the prevalence of domestic violence among the general population. A 1998 nationally representative telephone survey of more than 8,000 women found that 1.5 percent reported having been physically abused by a partner in the 12 months preceding the survey, and 25 percent reported having been physically abused by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime. However, surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice show that, compared with women in general, women aged 20 to 34, divorced or separated women, and women with family incomes under $9,999 are more likely to be victims.", "Differences in the definition of domestic abuse used, the circumstances under which women were surveyed, and the sample of women surveyed may explain, at least in part, the relatively wide range of estimates of the prevalence of domestic violence among welfare recipients reported in the studies we reviewed. Although there is substantial overlap among the specific behaviors considered abusive in most of the studies we reviewed, a few studies had more general definitions of abuse or left the definition up to the respondent. Prevalence estimates would also be affected by the extent to which women who have been abused acknowledge that in their survey responses. It is generally believed that domestic abuse is underreported among women. The degree of potential underreporting is likely to vary across studies on the basis of the way the surveys were administered. The surveys summarized here were administered in different settings, ranging from welfare offices to respondents\u2019 homes; in groups or individually; and by individuals with whom the respondents had had time to establish relationships as well as by people respondents had met only at the time of the interview. Finally, the samples of welfare recipients surveyed varied across studies. In some cases, the prevalence estimates reported here were based on representative samples of larger populations, such as all AFDC recipients in a state, while in others, the estimates were based on groups of recipients participating in a particular program or class.", "A study requested by the Massachusetts Governor\u2019s Commission on Domestic Violence was the only one of those we reviewed that was designed specifically to estimate the prevalence of domestic violence among a state\u2019s welfare population. The study was based on a representative sample of 734 women aged 20 and older who were receiving AFDC in Massachusetts between January and June 1996. This study found that almost 20 percent of respondents had been victims of domestic violence in the 12 months preceding the survey and that about 65 percent had been victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives. For purposes of the study, a woman was considered to have been a victim of domestic violence if she answered yes to one or more of six questions about her current or former husband or boyfriend\u2019s behavior toward her, including acts of physical violence, threats of harm, and nonconsensual sexual activities. While the majority of the survey questions were administered by an interviewer, who asked the questions and recorded respondents\u2019 answers, the questions regarding abuse were put on an audiotape that respondents listened to through headphones. This methodology was used because the authors found through extensive pretesting of the survey instrument that it was the least threatening to respondents, and, therefore, the most likely to produce accurate estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications of Domestic Violence for Employment Among Welfare Recipients and Other Low-Income Women", "paragraphs": ["Research on the implications of domestic violence for the employment of welfare recipients and other low-income women presents a complex picture. Our review of 14 studies that discussed employment-related barriers for domestic violence victims among these populations indicates that while domestic violence does not rule out employment for many of these women, some victims of domestic violence may face a range of employment-related problems related to the abuse."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research Findings Regarding the Employment Status of Domestic Violence Victims", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of the available research, we cannot conclude that being a victim of domestic violence changes the likelihood that a woman will work. We were unable to find any studies that isolate the effects of domestic violence on a woman\u2019s employment status by controlling for the effects of other factors that could influence whether a woman is employed or not. Of the 14 studies we reviewed, 2 compare estimates of employment rates among samples of abused and nonabused women without attempting to control for other factors. One of these studies, the Massachusetts study of AFDC recipients described earlier, found similar employment rates among women who reported having been abused (8.8 percent) and women who reported never having been abused (7 percent). Similarly, a study of women in a low-income Chicago neighborhood found that, at the time of the survey, women in the sample who had been abused in the past 12 months or had ever been abused were employed at rates similar to those of women who reported that they had never been abused. However, the latter study also found that, compared with women who reported never having been abused, women who reported having been abused at some point in their lives had experienced more spells of unemployment; greater job turnover; and significantly higher rates of receipt of AFDC, Medicaid, and food stamps.", "When attempting to determine the effect of domestic violence on women\u2019s employment status, it is important to consider that the effect could be quite different for women who have been abused in the past and for woman who are currently in abusive relationships. This distinction is not captured in the employment rate comparisons cited above. Current victims are likely to face different circumstances than women who were abused in the past. While research indicates that women may suffer emotionally for some time after they leave an abusive situation, which could affect their ability to work, they might not face the same logistical and safety concerns that women currently in abusive relationships may face, which are discussed in the next section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Findings Regarding the Potential Effects of Current Domestic Violence on Victims\u2019 Employment", "paragraphs": ["While it appears that having experienced domestic violence at some point does not rule out employment for many welfare recipients and other low-income women, in the studies we reviewed, program staff who work with welfare recipients, as well as abused women themselves, consistently report that obtaining and maintaining employment can be difficult for many current victims of domestic violence. These studies indicate that abusers often feel threatened by women\u2019s efforts to improve themselves and become financially independent, since those efforts could provide options to women that would help them leave the abusive relationship. Approximately 16 to 60 percent of the women surveyed in five of the studies reported that their partner had discouraged them from working, and 33 to 46 percent said that their partner prevented them from working. (App. II presents these findings in more detail.)", "The research indicates that, in order to keep women from attending training programs or working, abusive partners often try to sabotage women\u2019s efforts, in some cases by becoming violent. Abusers are commonly reported to thwart women\u2019s attendance at these activities by promising child care that they then fail to deliver; destroying or hiding items the women need for the activities; and inflicting visible signs of abuse, such as bruises, black eyes, and cigarette burns, so the women will be too embarrassed to go to training, work, or a job interview. Welfare-to-work program staff report in one study that domestic violence has prevented program participation for some women who are unwilling to attend for fear of provoking their partners\u2019 \u201canger and further assaults.\u201d", "Some abusive partners may also try to keep women from participating in work-related activities by calling them frequently during the day, coming to the program or work site unannounced, or both. A survey of battered women who were working at the time the abuse occurred found that 56 percent of the women surveyed reported that their partners had harassed them at work by phone or in person, with 21 percent reporting that their partners frequently harassed them at work. In two other studies, approximately 35 to 40 percent of the women surveyed said their abuser had shown up at their place of work and caused a disruption.(App. III presents the findings discussed in this and the following paragraph.)", "The research also indicates that the effects of domestic violence on a woman\u2019s job performance can make it difficult for some battered women to maintain their employment or to advance in their jobs. According to the surveys of service providers and abused women we reviewed, women may be late for work or miss work entirely for reasons such as those described above, including unexpected lack of child care and visible injuries. In addition, abusers\u2019 harassment of women at work could jeopardize their jobs. Three studies that interviewed domestic violence victims who were working when the abuse occurred found that 44 to 60 percent of respondents said they had been reprimanded at work for behaviors related to the abuse, such as being late to work, and 24 to 52 percent said they had lost their jobs because of the abuse. Almost 70 percent of the respondents to one of the surveys said that their job performance was negatively affected by the abuse, and about 50 percent said that they felt they had lost opportunities for salary and career advancement because of problems related to the abuse.", "Some domestic violence victims may, in addition, experience emotional or physical health problems that could potentially affect their ability to find and maintain employment. The studies we reviewed found that the women who had been abused often suffered from chronic health problems, low self-esteem, and depression and exhibited behaviors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Two of the studies indicate that domestic violence victims may experience such conditions at higher rates than women who have not been abused. The Massachusetts study found that welfare recipients who had reported having been abused at some point in their lives were significantly more likely than those who had not to say that they currently had \u201ca physical disability, handicap, or any other serious physical, mental, or emotional problem.\u201d In addition, the abused women had significantly lower self-esteem, less of a sense of mastery, and more symptoms of psychological distress. The survey of low-income women in Chicago found that women who reported having been abused were significantly more likely to report problems with depression, anxiety, and anger than their nonabused counterparts.", "We provided a draft copy of this report for technical review to officials in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Family Assistance, Administration for Children and Families, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; we also provided a copy to three experts on domestic violence and welfare-to-work issues.
