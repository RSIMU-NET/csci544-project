Systems engineering is the primary means for determining whether and how that challenge can be met. It is a disciplined learning process that translates requirements into specific design features and thus identifies key risks to be resolved. GAO's prior best practices work has found that if detailed systems engineering is done early, a program can resolve such risks through trade-offs and additional investments before a program starts. A key point in systems engineering where this match can be assessed is the preliminary design. As shown below, establishing a preliminary design through early detailed systems engineering portends better program outcomes than doing so after program start.", "GAO's analysis of selected Department of Defense (DOD) programs illustrates the relationship among the four factors, systems engineering, and program outcomes. Programs with modest requirements and early detailed systems engineering had better outcomes. For example, the Small Diameter Bomb Increment I program, which delivered within cost and schedule estimates, had an incremental approach, mature technologies, a derivative design, and detailed systems engineering before development began. Programs that began with more challenging requirements and insufficient systems engineering reported worse outcomes. For example, the F-35 Lightning II, which has encountered significant cost and schedule problems, began development with a single-step approach, a highly complex design, immature technologies, and little systems engineering.", "Understanding the dynamic between a program's requirements, risks, and the requisite systems engineering effort has important implications for oversight. A particular challenge is that Congress often must consider requests to authorize and fund a new program in advance of the start of product development, when the business case would be better established. DOD policy requires that DOD decision makers have information about a proposed program's risk factors and systems engineering status, in a systems engineering plan, at the start of a new program. However, it is not clear whether Congress also has this information at that time. A systems engineering plan could provide more robust information to Congress when considering a budget request to start a new program. In commenting on a draft of this report DOD disagreed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To support oversight and inform budget decisions, Congress should consider requiring DOD to report on systems engineering status of each major acquisition program in the department's annual budget request."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) expects to have invested a total of  more than $1.4 trillion in development and procurement of the major  defense acquisition programs in its current portfolio.

Within DOD,  the process of identifying and understanding requirements typically  begins when a sponsor, usually a military service, submits an Initial  Capabilities Document that identifies the existence of a capability gap; the  operational risks associated with the gap; and a recommended solution or  preferred set of solutions for filling the gap. Potential solutions are then  assessed in an Analysis of Alternatives, system capabilities are chosen,  and top-level capability or operational requirements are then defined in a  draft Capability Development Document that goes through several stages  of service- and DOD-level review and validation. After the top-level  capability requirements are defined, they are then decomposed into more  specific capability requirements, known as the performance specification,  and then into a series of more detailed design requirements.  Progressively more detailed descriptions of the system design are  established in what systems engineering literature refers to as  configuration baselines. Within DOD, the configuration baselines are  called the \u201cfunctional baseline\u201d that details the system-level performance  requirements; the \u201callocated baseline\u201d that establishes a preliminary  design and defines the subsystems and how they are to work together;  and the \u201cproduct baseline\u201d that describes the final design and provides  component-level details (see figure 1).", "Systems engineering is a disciplined process to transform top-level  capability requirements into detailed, lower-level design requirements that  can be achieved with available resources. Programs are required to  prepare a systems engineering plan as a management tool to guide  systems engineering activities over the life of a program. According to  DOD, the discipline of this process provides the control and traceability to  develop solutions that meet customer needs. The systems engineering  process can be depicted in a V-shape that starts when a capability gap is  identified and a proposed solution for filling that gap is selected. Top-level  capability requirements are then defined and decomposed into lower-level  design requirements until a final design is established. As this process  takes place, requirements become more specific and the number of  requirements at each successive level grows. This growth can be  exponential, with tens of thousands of detailed design requirements  derived from a relatively small number of capability requirements.

While they are not  the only factors that could be considered, we found that they were  prominent and observable early in our case study programs. Those four  factors are:", "Acquisition approach - indicates whether a program intends to take an  incremental, evolutionary approach or a single-step approach to meet  all capability requirements. According to GAO best practices, an  incremental approach reduces risk by developing and delivering a  product in a series of enhanced interim capabilities until final  capability is reached. In contrast, a single-step approach increases  risk by attempting to deliver the final capability all at once without any  interim capabilities.", "Technology status - indicates the extent to which the critical  technologies for a proposed system are mature at the start of product  development. According to GAO best practices, technologies are  ready for inclusion in a product development program when they have  been demonstrated in a realistic, operational environment (i.e.,  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7), proving that they can work as  intended. Demonstrating technologies in an operational environment  provides a higher level of technology understanding and reduces risk  prior to starting product development. Beginning system development  with less mature technologies (i.e., TRL lower than 7) increases  program risk because unexpected technology challenges could  significantly affect product design.", "Design maturity - indicates the extent to which a proposed system\u2019s  design is either derived from an existing commercial or DOD  system\u2014whether operational or prototype\u2014or is new and  unprecedented. According to GAO best practices, designs derived  from existing systems, whether commercial or DOD, by nature have  more knowledge available when product development begins, thus  reducing risk. In contrast, unprecedented designs are by nature more  complex and inherently higher risk.", "System interdependency - indicates the extent to which a system  relies on another system or group of systems being developed and  managed separately to provide its required capabilities. According to  DOD acquisition guidance, although DOD programs should not be  acquired in isolation, a program office developing a more independent  system generally has more control over requirements, schedule,  funding, and interfaces, among other factors. In contrast, a program  office developing a system that is more dependent on other  systems\u2014like a system of systems\u2014generally has less control, thus  making its requirements more challenging to achieve and increasing  risk. For example, systems of systems tend to be more complex and  must manage (1) interfaces with other systems that have potentially  unaligned performance requirements, (2) the need for collaborative  governance with separately managed programs, and (3) differences in  program phases of development.", "As we discuss in the following pages, the case study programs with top- level capability requirements that posed a more modest challenge took an  incremental acquisition approach, incorporated more mature  technologies, used a design that was derived from an existing product or  prototype, and limited dependence on systems being developed and  managed separately, reducing the amount of risk being carried forward  into product development. In contrast, the programs with top-level  capability requirements that were more challenging generally assumed  full capability would be delivered in a single-step, incorporated immature  critical technologies, used a new and unprecedented system design, and  had full capability that in some cases was critically dependent on  separately developed and managed systems without sufficiently  mitigating risk before starting product development.", "The fact that some requirements can be more challenging than others  does not necessarily mean that problems are unavoidable. Rather, the  ensuing systems engineering effort, if timely and sufficiently vigorous, can  provide the needed confidence that the requirements are achievable. Our  previous work in best practices has found that conducting detailed  systems engineering analysis before starting product development  contributes to understanding the requirements challenge and identifying  and mitigating associated risks. Systems engineering is the primary  means for determining whether and how the challenge posed by a  program\u2019s requirements can be met with available resources. It is a  disciplined learning process that translates capability requirements into  specific design features and thus identifies key risks to be resolved. Our  prior best practices work has indicated that if detailed systems  engineering is done before the start of product development, the program  can resolve these risks through trade-offs and additional investments,  ensuring that risks have been sufficiently retired or that they are clearly  understood and adequately resourced if they are being carried forward.

When development began, DOD planned to achieve full  capability using a single-step acquisition approach and the F-35\u2019s critical  technologies were immature.

The first restructuring was driven by the discovery of  significant weight issues with the F-35B variant as the program developed  its preliminary design, resulting in costly design changes. DOD and prime  contractor data indicate that the system\u2019s functional baseline\u2014detailing  the system-level design\u2014was not finalized until 4 years into development.  As systems engineering continued and testing began, additional  discoveries were made, requiring further design changes and contributing  to the two additional restructurings.

They had  established neither a performance specification nor a functional baseline.  As a result, the CH-53K program did not have a sound, executable  business case. The Marine Corps and the prime contractor disagreed on  what specific systems engineering tasks were needed, and initial plans  showed that key analyses would not be complete until the system was  well into development. The Marine Corps expected the CH-53K to provide  improvements relative to the CH-53E in range and payload, survivability  and force protection, reliability and maintainability, coordination with other  assets, and overall cost of ownership. As a result and in order to meet  requirements, an entirely new aircraft design was needed. According to  the prime contractor, none of the parts in the new design were common  parts with the CH-53E.

Because the program office and prime contractor disagreed on  what systems engineering tasks needed to be accomplished, problems  began immediately following the start of development. Once systems  engineering began and problems were identified, the Marine Corps chose  to defer some key performance capabilities to reduce development costs,  and, in 2010, the program was restructured with a new baseline approved  in 2013. Discoveries during ground testing and qualification drove  additional unanticipated design changes and delays. As a result, the  program\u2019s initial production decision was delayed 8 months, and the  program now plans to establish a new cost baseline.

IAMD is expected to  network sensors, weapons, and a common battle command system  across an integrated fire control network to support the engagement of air  and missile threats. The Army planned an incremental acquisition  approach and held a competition for preliminary design to mitigate risk in  May 2009. Prime contractor officials told us they conducted systems  engineering prior to the start of development, which may have helped  them better understand design requirements. While a functional baseline  was established prior to the start of product development and the prime  contractor built a basic design prototype to demonstrate for the  government that the design architecture would work, the system\u2019s  allocated baseline was not fully established until after the start of  development.", "System interdependency has posed challenges to the IAMD program in  several ways. The Army made high-level changes in IAMD during the first  year, which resulted in the program having to integrate additional systems  and causing significant changes in how the systems were to interact.  According to prime contractor officials, three of the four IAMD critical  technologies rely on interfacing with other systems and many of these  interfaces were not defined until after the development contract was  awarded. IAMD has encountered challenges integrating new software  from the contractor with other acquisition programs critical to its  functionality. IAMD development cost has increased over 60 percent  since the start of development, with about half of the increase occurring in  the first year. The program has been rebaselined and initial operational  capability has been deferred by 2 years. This experience is somewhat  similar to that of the GPS III with an important distinction.

By the same token, it can provide indications to Congress  and other organizations responsible for oversight as to the soundness of  DOD\u2019s approach to undertaking a new program. The decision to begin  product development is the last opportunity in the acquisition process\u2014 prior to committing to a major financial investment\u2014to level a product\u2019s  requirements to available resources, thereby establishing a good  business case. A sound business case provides credible evidence that  (1) the warfighter\u2019s needs are valid and that they can best be met with the  chosen concept; and (2) the chosen concept can be developed and  produced within existing resources\u2014that is, proven technologies,  sufficient design knowledge, adequate funding, and adequate time exist  to deliver the product when it is needed. A program should not go forward  into product development, nor should this step be funded, unless a sound  business case can be made. Therefore, Congress, which is responsible  for making that funding decision, should also have insight into the  soundness of the business case. However, given current budget  processes and mechanics in DOD today, these congressional decisions  must be made well in advance of the start of product development and  establishment of the final business case.", "Systems engineering is essential to establishing a sound business case.  We have previously found that key enablers of a good business case  include firm, feasible requirements, mature technology, an incremental,  knowledge-based acquisition strategy, and a realistic cost estimate. Our  work examining commercial companies\u2019 best practices has found that  requirements should be clearly defined, affordable, and clearly  informed\u2014thus tempered\u2014by systems engineering prior to the start of  product development. Once programs begin, requirements should not  change without assessing their potential disruption to the program. In  addition, science and technology organizations should shoulder the  technology development burden, proving technologies can work as  intended before they are included in a weapon system program. The  principle is not to avoid technical risk, but rather take risk early and  resolve it ahead of the start of product development. Programs should  use an incremental, knowledge-based acquisition strategy. We have  found that rigorous systems engineering coupled with more achievable  requirements are essential to achieve faster delivery of needed capability  to the warfighter. Building on mature technologies, such a strategy  provides time, money, and other resources for a stable design, building  and testing of prototypes, and demonstration of mature production  processes. Finally, a good business case will have a realistic cost  estimate based on a knowledge-based acquisition strategy, independent  assessments, and sound methodologies.", "Over the years, and as previously noted in this report, we have found that  for a program to deliver a successful product with available resources,  high levels of knowledge\u2014informed by systems engineering\u2014must be  demonstrated before significant commitments are made. This requires  the user and developer to negotiate whatever trade-offs are needed to  achieve a match between the user\u2019s requirements and the developer\u2019s  resources before product development begins. While it would seem that  taking such an approach would be axiomatic, we have found that it is  not. On the contrary, we have previously found that there are strong  incentives within the culture of weapon system acquisition to overpromise  a prospective weapon\u2019s performance while understating its likely cost and  schedule demands. Competition with other programs vying for defense  dollars puts pressure on program sponsors to project unprecedented  levels of performance (often by counting on unproven technologies) while  promising low cost and short schedules. These incentives, coupled with a  marketplace that is characterized by a single buyer (DOD), low volume,  and limited number of major sources, create a culture in weapon system  acquisition that encourages undue optimism about program risks and  costs.", "A particular challenge for Congress is the fact that committees must often  consider requests to authorize and fund a new program well ahead of the  start of product development\u2014the point at which key business case  information would be presented. For example, if DOD has scheduled a  decision to start a new development program in August 2017, the funding  needed for the first year of development would have to be included in  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget request. This budget request would be  submitted to Congress in February 2016, or 18 months before the actual  program decision. Given this time lag, Congress could be making critical  funding decisions\u2014which in effect authorize the start of development\u2014 with limited information about program risk factors, systems engineering  progress, and the soundness of the program\u2019s business case.", "The nine case studies we examined for this report suggest that  understanding the dynamic between program requirements, risks, and the  requisite systems engineering analysis can facilitate early oversight.

Once the challenge is framed, the systems engineering plan  can be refined to obtain the requisite knowledge to (1) identify expectation  gaps and other risks, and (2) resolve them by the start of product  development. Ultimately, the final Capability Development Document  could then be informed by an allocated baseline (the preliminary design)  and provide a sound basis for an executable business case. This  sequence of events is notionally depicted in figure 14 along with when a  budget to start a new program is submitted to Congress.", "While congressional insight at the time of the funding decision is limited,  DOD policy directs program managers to provide certain documents to  DOD decision makers that when taken together could provide a picture of  a proposed program\u2019s risk factors and systems engineering status.  Programs are generally required to provide versions of these documents  to DOD decision makers prior to each major milestone review, including  the start of development. However, it is not clear whether Congress is  given the same information DOD decision makers are given when DOD  submits its budget request for funding to begin a new program.

According to DOD acquisition  policy, the plan will be submitted for approval for each milestone review,  beginning with the milestone review to approve the start of the technology  maturation and risk reduction phase\u2014the acquisition phase that precedes  the start of product development. DOD views the plan as a \u201cliving  document\u201d that it expects to be updated as needed throughout the  acquisition process. The plan is expected to support the acquisition  strategy, including the program interdependencies, and communicate the  overall technical approach to balance system performance, life-cycle cost,  and risk in addressing warfighter needs. It should describe the program\u2019s  overall technical approach, including key technical risks, processes,  resources, organization, metrics, and design considerations. It should  also detail the timing and criteria for conducting systems engineering  technical reviews, including those that will establish the functional,  allocated, and product level baselines. In addition, the plan should  address system integration risks, including risks related to external  dependencies which are outside the program manager\u2019s span of control  in order to ensure timely design, development, deployment, and  sustainment of the system.

At a minimum, this  reconciliation, or match, should be evidenced by an allocated baseline\u2014 that is, a preliminary design\u2014before committing to a product development  program. Our cases indicate that regardless of the challenge posed by  initial requirements, systems engineering, if done well, can be a key  enabler of a sound business case for starting a new development  program. This helps to ensure that if a program takes risks, those risks  are clearly identified, and any resource consequences are acknowledged  and accounted for in cost and schedule estimates. In some cases\u2014as  seen with JLTV and PIM\u2014this process could take time and result in  requirements changes, but, if done before committing to a product  development, it is more likely to result in a sound and executable  business case.", "Understanding the dynamic between program requirements, risks, and  systems engineering can facilitate early oversight\u2014thus offering a  potential curb to overpromising.

DOD did not agree with our  recommendation. In its comments, DOD agreed that early systems  engineering reduces risk and establishes a solid foundation for program  success. However, DOD noted that the systems engineering plan is a  management tool to guide a program\u2019s system engineering activities and  the timing of the plan and any updates are not aligned to inform a budget  decision that could occur as much as 18 months prior to program  initiation.
