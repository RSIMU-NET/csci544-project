However, they have not yet asserted audit readiness for certain key categories of PP&E, including land, government-furnished equipment, and internal-use software. In addition, the Marine Corps (a component of the Navy) has not yet asserted audit readiness for any of its PP&E.

However, the Status Report does not provide clear visibility for Congress and other decision makers regarding the extent to which DOD has addressed deficiencies in the related internal controls. For example, the military services have asserted audit readiness regarding PP&E accountability for some individually large-value and high-visibility equipment, such as ships and aircraft. However, the Status Report does not reflect that the services have often asserted audit readiness without evaluating or correcting the underlying internal control deficiencies. Similarly, DOD identified a number of deficiencies, referred to as dealbreakers, that it reports to be so severe that they could prevent the services from demonstrating audit readiness or succeeding in audits\u2014such as the inability to produce a complete list of items the services own. However, DOD's Status Report does not provide adequate visibility over actions taken and progress made toward correcting those dealbreakers.

Without accurate, timely, and useful financial information, our  prior work has shown that DOD and others are severely hampered in  making sound decisions affecting its operations. Further, to the extent  that current budget constraints and fiscal pressures continue, the  reliability of DOD\u2019s financial information and ability to maintain effective  accountability for its resources will be increasingly important to the federal  government\u2019s ability to make sound resource allocation decisions.", "The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2010  required that DOD develop and maintain the FIAR Plan. The FIAR Plan  must include specific actions DOD plans to take to help correct  deficiencies that impair DOD\u2019s ability to prepare timely, reliable, and  complete financial management information and ensure that its financial  statements are validated as ready for audit by September 30, 2017. The  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 also required DOD to implement semiannual  status reporting on the FIAR Plan to the congressional defense  committees. These status reports can also be used by other decision  makers to help in their oversight responsibilities.

Congress has mandated that DOD  take steps to be audit ready by September 30, 2017.", "As defined in the FIAR Guidance, an audit-ready entity is one that has  strengthened internal controls and improved financial practices,  processes, and systems so that it has reasonable confidence the  resulting information can undergo an audit by an independent auditor.  The military services have asserted that some individually large-value and  high-visibility equipment (such as ships, submarines, and aircraft) are  ready for audit. However, they have also reported that they have not  completed validation of the accountability over certain key classes of  PP&E and therefore have not yet asserted audit readiness for such  assets, including land, government-furnished equipment, and IUS. For the  latter two asset classes, DOD has stated that it does not have an  accurate estimate of what it has or where it is located. The Army, for  example, indicated in a report related to property and equipment held by  contractors that it does not know the actual amount of these assets but  anticipates that actual quantities may be greatly different than the Army\u2019s  documented property records reflect. Moreover, the Marine Corps (a  component of the Navy) has not yet asserted audit readiness for any of its  PP&E.", "While the military services have set target dates for asserting audit  readiness for its PP&E, almost all of the target dates have been delayed,  in some cases by multiple years, increasing the risk that DOD may not  complete audit readiness efforts by the target date of September 30,  2017. Figure 1 shows that some planned assertion dates have been  significantly extended.", "Although the services have asserted that several categories of  equipment, particularly military equipment, are audit ready, in some  assertions they reported that they did not evaluate or correct identified  internal control deficiencies in accordance with the FIAR Guidance prior  to asserting audit readiness. In some cases, the services acknowledged  that controls were inadequate to be relied on as a basis for the  assertions. For example, while the Army asserted audit readiness for  some of its real property, it reported that internal controls for certain real  property acquisitions and disposals were not operating effectively and  deficiencies identified had not been remediated. The Navy asserted some  categories of its equipment as audit ready and that key controls were  designed and operating effectively. However, the Navy reported that  test results for four of seven key controls had failure rates in excess of  limits established in the FIAR Guidance. Though the Navy has developed  corrective action plans, it had not remediated all of the identified  deficiencies prior to asserting audit readiness. The Air Force also  asserted in August 2015 that certain equipment, such as support  equipment and vehicles, was ready for audit. Yet, according to an Air  Force official, the service was unable to reconcile the assets from the  accountable property system to amounts in the financial statements.", "Additionally, DOD has acknowledged a set of control deficiencies,  identified as \u201cdealbreakers,\u201d that it reports are so severe that they could  prevent the services from demonstrating audit readiness or succeeding in  audits. These dealbreakers, first reported in the May 2015 FIAR Plan  Status Report, include the inability to reconcile transaction detail to the  general ledger, the inability to produce a complete universe of  transactions, and ineffective information system controls, all of which can  preclude auditability. These dealbreakers were not remediated prior to  assertion.", "Instead of addressing previous auditor-reported deficiencies and  developing effective controls over the accountability of PP&E, the  services generally focused on counting assets at a point in time as a  basis for asserting audit readiness. However, as discussed, without  effective controls, management cannot reasonably assure the ongoing  accuracy of the asset accountability records and routinely generate  timely, complete, and reliable financial information to manage its assets.  In addition, absent effective controls, auditors may need to count  substantially more items every year, at multiple locations, in order to  assess the reliability of assets recorded in DOD\u2019s accountable property  systems. More extensive testing may not be practical given the volume of  PP&E assets. To illustrate, the Army has reported that it has  approximately 250,000 individual pieces of equipment spread out among  many bases all over the world.", "Although the military services\u2019 assertions for being audit ready are  reported in DOD\u2019s semiannual FIAR Plan Status Report, the report does  not include information for decision makers about which assertions were  made based on counting assets at a point in time without correcting  internal controls or information about actions taken or progress made  toward correcting control deficiencies determined to be dealbreakers.  Without such information, DOD and congressional decision makers do  not have a complete status of DOD\u2019s audit readiness or sufficient  information about improvements that still need to be made. For example,  the November 2015 FIAR Plan Status Report identified several audit  readiness dealbreakers for each of the services\u2019 equipment. However,  other than a general statement that corrective actions needed to be  developed and implemented to correct internal control gaps, none of the  services provided specific actions taken or interim milestones of  intermediate progress made to remediate the dealbreakers. Likewise,  none of the services reported actions planned to overcome these  dealbreakers that may potentially delay audit readiness of their PP&E. As  we have previously reported, DOD components\u2019 efforts to date to  implement the FIAR Guidance have not resulted in a fundamental  transformation of systems and operations necessary to resolve the  department\u2019s long-standing financial management deficiencies.  Resolution of these deficiencies will be crucial to DOD\u2019s efforts to meet  the September 30, 2017, target date for validating audit readiness of  DOD\u2019s full financial statements.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 mandated that the semiannual report  include details of impediments to the department achieving audit  readiness, along with the department\u2019s corrective action plans to resolve  the impediments. Additionally, going forward, standards for internal  control for the federal government require an entity to communicate to  internal and external decision makers significant matters relating to risks,  changes, or issues that affect the entity\u2019s internal control system. DOD  officials have stated that they have chosen to include in the report  overarching impediments to financial statement audit readiness but have  not reported the details of services\u2019 dealbreakers and remediation plans  because other sources of that information can be made available to  decision makers. However, not disclosing such information in the  semiannual Status Report decreases visibility of DOD\u2019s audit readiness  efforts. As DOD continues to refine semiannual reporting, DOD officials  have stated that they are considering formatting changes for future Status  Reports, particularly information aimed toward addressing dealbreakers.

However,  DOD faces challenges in developing appropriate values for its PP&E  because of systems and process deficiencies. The difficulty of that task is  exacerbated by the magnitude and uniqueness of DOD\u2019s assets. For  example, DOD estimates that it needs to value over 440,000 real property  assets along with individual pieces of equipment that may number in the  several hundreds of thousands of items located at multiple installations  around the world. DOD has stated that many of its existing assets were  acquired decades ago, and acquisition cost documents required for  supporting valuation and audit were often not retained or cannot be  located.", "Current federal accounting standards require PP&E assets to be valued  and recorded using the actual historical cost of an asset as its value and  allow reasonable estimates of historical cost as a substitute for actual  historical cost. The recorded value of each asset is to be depreciated  and reduced to a net value over the estimated useful life of the asset,  except for land, which is a nondepreciable asset.", "To date, DOD has been unable to meet accounting standards for  valuation because of long-standing deficiencies in its information systems  and processes that prevent managers from obtaining the historical  acquisition cost as a basis for valuation or appropriately valuing its PP&E  by other means. For example, the DOD OIG reported that DOD does not  have property and logistics systems that record and maintain acquisition  costs, the cost of modifications and upgrades, or depreciation expense in  accordance with established accounting standards. Whether for valuing  its existing assets or new acquisitions, DOD has acknowledged that it  does not have effective business processes, systems, or controls for  recording, processing, or accurately reporting actual historical cost or a  reasonable method of estimating historical cost. DOD has reported that  fixing its long-standing systems deficiencies is a top priority as part of the  FIAR Plan\u2019s strategy, and that there are many actions under way by the  services and the department to ultimately remediate such deficiencies.", "In response to requests from DOD, FASAB, the body responsible for  issuing federal accounting standards, undertook a project to address  PP&E accounting issues. FASAB\u2019s proposed standard, which would help  DOD establish beginning account balances for PP&E, was submitted to  the FASAB sponsors (OMB, the Department of the Treasury, and GAO)  on May 5, 2016, for a 90-day review, which will end on August 3, 2016.  The proposed standard includes general approaches to the valuation of  opening balances, which would allow DOD to use an alternative valuation  method for existing assets that would substitute for actual or estimated  historical costs, including the following:  1.  For buildings, structures, facilities, and equipment, FASAB is  proposing to allow DOD to use deemed cost under several different  methods, such as using replacement cost or fair value.   2.  For land and land rights, FASAB is proposing to allow DOD to use the  following alternative methods: (1) exclude land and land rights on the  balance sheet and instead require disclosure of acreage information  or (2) recognize opening balances of land and land rights at deemed  cost.  3.  For internal-use software, FASAB is proposing to allow DOD to use  the following alternative methods: (1) deemed cost for existing IUS or  (2) excluding existing IUS from opening balances and only recording  the actual cost of new acquisitions\u2014referred to as prospective  capitalization.", "The proposed accounting standard would permit DOD to apply alternative  valuation methods only to establish opening balances for its existing  PP&E. Under the standards, DOD would still be required to develop  systems and procedures to capture and report the historical costs of  newly acquired or constructed PP&E.", "In anticipation of being allowed to use these alternative valuation  methods, DOD is developing plans to value the majority of its assets with  alternative methods. DOD has established working groups charged with  (1) developing an approach for establishing valuation methodologies and  (2) developing documentation standards for the valuation process for all  of its PP&E; however, it is early in the process of determining and  implementing such alternative valuation methodologies. Further, DOD  and the services have identified challenges in developing and  implementing valuation methodologies for existing assets, while  continuing to remedy systems and develop procedures to properly  account for the actual costs of newly acquired assets for each major  category of PP&E. Some of those challenges include the following:", "Equipment. DOD has established an overarching plan for how to  value its equipment. However, its application to specific equipment  types has not been determined. DOD has identified the following  challenges to equipment valuation: (1) numerous configurations of  highly complex equipment and weapons systems make them difficult  to value, for example, the valuation of enormous costly structures  such as Navy ships will be a complex task involving valuing  thousands of components that are used to build or modify these ships;  (2) certain equipment and weapons systems have been significantly  modified, upgraded, or overhauled to the extent that such  modifications are considered capital improvements that are required  to be capitalized as part of the asset; and (3) enormous quantities of  deployed equipment are located worldwide, posing an increased  logistical challenge to valuing all assets.", "Real property. DOD has not yet finalized an alternative valuation  methodology for real property, including capital improvements. DOD  has stated that it does not have systems in place to track capital  improvements and has not maintained documentation to support  capital improvement costs. As reported by DOD to FASAB, most of its  systems used for acquisition of and accounting for real property and  capital improvements have either never been audited or have had  significant deficiencies or material weaknesses reported. DOD has  cited several complicating factors for valuing its real property,  including (1) multiple organizations and systems involved in acquiring  real property and capital improvement projects and (2) the lack of  consistent processes or documented processes for retaining source  documentation related to real property.", "IUS. DOD has not yet established an alternative valuation  methodology for IUS. DOD has stated that identification and valuation  of IUS is one of the major challenges to asset valuation.", "Valuation alternatives currently being proposed by FASAB, assuming  they are adopted as accounting standards, hold the potential to allow  DOD to develop an acceptable initial valuation for its PP&E. However,  DOD acknowledges that it must still continue to remedy its systems and  processes to properly capture and account for the historical costs of  newly acquired assets and develop sufficient documentation to enable an  audit to be performed. If it is not able to timely implement valuation  methodologies for existing assets and remediate identified deficiencies in  its PP&E systems, there is an increased risk that DOD may not be able to  properly value its assets and be audit ready by the end of fiscal year  2017.", "Asset valuation\u2014though a significant challenge for DOD\u2014is required for  financial reporting. But beyond financial reporting, there are advantages  to tracking and maintaining the records of the historical cost of assets. For  example, federal accounting standards indicate that recording and  tracking assets\u2014and recognizing the cost of those assets through  depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives\u2014helps managers  assess the performance of an entity.

The objectives of our review were to determine the reported  status of DOD\u2019s and the military services\u2019\u2014the departments of the Army,  Navy (including the Marine Corps), and Air Force\u2014(1) assertions of audit  readiness for PP&E asset accountability in accordance with the Financial  Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance and (2) plans for  valuing PP&E assets.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed the reported status of the  military services\u2019 efforts to become audit ready regarding their accounting  for General Fund PP&E. We interviewed Army, Navy, and Air Force  officials and analyzed documentation to gain an understanding of their  processes and systems used to document and report their PP&E  accountability audit readiness assertions. We evaluated the  documentation the military services prepared to support their assertions  using the FIAR Guidance relevant to the period an assertion was made.  We obtained and documented DOD\u2019s PP&E accountability assertion  status as reported in the most recent November 2015 FIAR Plan Status  Report and reviewed the supporting documentation for the reported FIAR  status to determine whether they complied with the November 2013 FIAR  Guidance. We also reviewed the semiannual FIAR Plan Status Reports  issued from November 2010 to November 2015 in order to track the  overall progress of the military services\u2019 PP&E audit readiness assertions.  We obtained and reviewed audit reports issued by the DOD Office of  Inspector General and service auditors regarding the reliability of DOD\u2019s  asset accountability records and the effectiveness of their internal  controls.", "To address our second objective, we obtained a list of all PP&E asset  types and identified the systems used to track PP&E valuation  information. We conducted interviews with DOD officials responsible for  valuing PP&E to determine the status of the valuation process, what  valuation methodologies were being planned, and whether supporting  documentation was available. We obtained and documented the status of  DOD\u2019s PP&E valuation assertion as reported in the November 2015 FIAR  Status Report. We also monitored the Federal Accounting Standards  Advisory Board\u2019s proceedings and discussions regarding proposed  accounting standards for the valuation of PP&E.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to May 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Paul Kinney (Assistant Director),  Shawkat Ahmed (Auditor-in-Charge), Joshua Edelman, and Robert  Sharpe made key contributions to this report.
