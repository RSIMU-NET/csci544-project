The  U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is working to further improve  traffic safety through its connected vehicle research program, which aims  to develop innovative technologies that enable vehicles, road  infrastructure, and personal communications devices to wirelessly  communicate and warn drivers and pedestrians of potential accidents.  For example, DOT is collaborating with the automobile industry, academic  institutions, technology firms, and state and local agencies to develop  vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies that allow vehicles to  \u201ccommunicate\u201d with road infrastructure (such as traffic signals) through  the wireless exchange of data. These technologies can enable the  development of V2I software applications that could, among other things:  warn drivers of upcoming road conditions, such as work zones, or that  they are approaching a curve at an unsafe speed; adjust traffic signal  lights to provide priority to emergency vehicles or to address congestion;  advise drivers about upcoming traffic and alternative routes; and provide  driving advice to minimize stop-and-go driving. For example, in 2011,  Japan implemented V2I through the deployment of the ITS Spot system.  ITS Spot uses roadside equipment to collect and share data with vehicles  in order to provide three basic services to drivers: dynamic route  guidance, safe driving support, and electronic toll collection. Japan\u2019s  extensive V2I network includes roughly 55,000 pieces of V2I equipment  on local roads and 1,600 pieces of V2I equipment on its approximately  11,000 kilometers of expressways. Similarly, the Netherlands, Germany,  and Austria are working to develop a European smart corridor that will  provide drivers information on road work and upcoming traffic, among  other things. Since V2I technologies are still in development in the United  States and rely on the exchange of information between vehicles and  infrastructure, developing and deploying V2I will require the collaboration  of a number of stakeholders, particularly state and local agencies, as well  as auto manufacturers.", "In light of research showing the potential for V2I technologies to reduce  traffic accidents and fatalities, as well as questions raised regarding  potential technological and policy challenges, you asked us to review  issues related to V2I technologies. We examined: (1) the status of V2I  technologies; (2) the challenges, if any, that could affect the deployment  of V2I technologies, and DOT efforts to address these challenges; and (3)  what is known about the potential benefits and costs of V2I technologies.  To address these issues, we reviewed documentation relevant to the V2I  technology research efforts of DOT, state and local governments, and the  automobile industry, including DOT\u2019s 2015 Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA) V2I Draft Deployment Guidance and Products  and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials\u2019 (AASHTO) National Connected Vehicle Field Infrastructure  Footprint Analysis. We interviewed officials from DOT\u2019s Office of the  Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, Intelligent  Transportation Systems-Joint Program Office (ITS-JPO), FHWA, National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Volpe National  Transportation Systems Center about these efforts. In addition to DOT  and its agencies, we also interviewed an additional 12 stakeholders that  were involved in V2I efforts, such as associations representing state  transportation agencies and engineers. We interviewed officials at all  seven V2I test beds located in Virginia, Michigan, Florida, Arizona,  California, and New York. We conducted site visits to three of the seven  test beds\u2014the Safety Pilot in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the test beds in  Southeast Michigan and Northern Virginia. We selected the three site visit  locations based on which had the most advanced technology according to  DOT and state officials. We used our interviews with stakeholders to help  us understand the issues, and developed a structured set of questions for  interviews with 21 experts, nine of whom were identified by the National  Academy of Sciences. We selected an additional 12 experts based on the  following factors: (1) their personal involvement in the deployment of V2I  technologies; (2) recommendations from federal agencies and industry  associations; and, (3) experts\u2019 involvement in a professional affiliation  such as a V2I consortium or group dedicated to these technologies, or  expertise on a specific challenge affecting V2I (e.g., privacy). The 21  experts we selected included domestic automobile manufacturers, V2I  equipment suppliers, state and local government officials, privacy experts,  global industry organizations responsible for developing technology  standards, and academic researchers with relevant expertise. During  these interviews we asked, among other things, for experts\u2019 views on the  state of development and deployment of V2I technologies (including  DOT\u2019s role in this process), the potential benefits of V2I technologies, and  their potential costs.

Connected vehicle  technologies include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure  (V2I) technologies:", "V2V technologies transmit data between vehicles to enable  applications that can warn drivers about potential collisions.", "Specifically, V2V-equipped cars would emit data on their speed,  position, heading, acceleration, size, brake status, and other data  (referred to as the \u201cbasic safety message\u201d) 10 times per second to the  on-board equipment of surrounding vehicles, which would interpret  the data and provide warnings to the driver as needed. For example,  drivers may receive a forward collision warning when their vehicle is  close to colliding with the vehicle in front of them. V2V technologies  have a greater range of detection than existing sensor-based crash  avoidance technologies available in some new vehicles. NHTSA is  pursuing actions to require that vehicle manufacturers install the  underlying V2V technologies that would enable V2V applications in  new passenger cars and light truck vehicles, and requested comment  on this issue in an August 2014 Advanced Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking. We reported on V2V technologies in November 2013.  Thus, we are not focusing on these technologies in this report.", "Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies transmit data between  vehicles and the road infrastructure to enable a variety of safety,  mobility, and environmental applications. V2I applications are  designed to avoid or mitigate vehicle crashes, particularly those crash  scenarios not addressed by V2V alone, as well as provide mobility  and environmental benefits. Unlike V2V, DOT is not considering  mandating the deployment of V2I technologies.", "V2I applications rely on data sent between vehicles and infrastructure to  provide alerts and advice to drivers. For example, the Spot Weather  Impact Warning application is designed to detect unsafe weather  conditions, such as ice or fog, and notify the driver if reduced speed or an  alternative route is recommended (see left side of figure 1). DOT is also  investigating the development of V2I mobility and environmental  applications. For example, the Eco-Approach and Departure at Signalized  Intersections application alerts drivers of the most eco-friendly speed for  approaching and departing signalized intersections to minimize stop-and- go traffic and idling (see right side of fig. 1), and eco-lanes, combined with  eco-speed harmonization, (demonstrated in the following video) would  provide speed limit advice to minimize congestion and maintain  consistent speeds among vehicles in dedicated lanes.", "DOT is also pursuing the development of V2I mobility applications that  are designed to provide traffic signal priority to certain types of vehicles,  such as emergency responders or transit vehicles. In addition, other types  of V2I mobility applications could capture data from vehicles and  infrastructure (for example, data on current traffic volumes and speed)  and relay real-time traffic data to transportation system managers and  drivers. For example, after receiving data indicating vehicles on a  particular roadway were not moving, transportation system managers  could adjust traffic signals in response to the conditions, or alert drivers of  alternative routes via dynamic message signs located along the roadway.  In addition to receiving alerts via message signs, these applications could  also allow drivers to receive warnings through on-board systems or  personal devices. Japan has pursued this approach through its ITS Spot  V2I initiative, which uses roadside devices located along expressways to  simultaneously collect data from vehicles to allow traffic managers to  identify congestion, while also providing information to drivers regarding  upcoming congestion and alternative routes.", "To communicate in a connected vehicle environment, vehicles and  infrastructure must be equipped with dedicated short-range  communications (DSRC),  a wireless technology that enables vehicles  and infrastructure to transmit and receive messages over a range of  about 300 meters (nearly 1,000 feet). As previously noted, V2V- equipped cars emit data on their speed, position, heading, acceleration,  size, brake status, and other data (referred to as the \u201cbasic safety  message\u201d) 10 times per second to the surrounding vehicles and  infrastructure. V2I-equipped infrastructure can also transmit data to  vehicles, which can be used by on-board applications to issue appropriate  warnings to the driver when needed. According to DOT, DSRC is  considered critical for safety applications due to its low latency, high  reliability, and consistent availability. In addition, DSRC also transmits in a  broadcast mode, providing data to all potential users at the same time.  Stakeholders and federal agencies have noted that DSRC\u2019s ability to  reliably transfer messages between infrastructure and rapidly moving  vehicles is an essential component to detecting and preventing potential  collisions. DSRC technology uses radiofrequency spectrum to wirelessly  send and receive data. The Federal Communications Commission  (FCC), which manages spectrum for nonfederal users, including  commercial, private, and state and local government users, allocated 75  megahertz (MHz) of spectrum\u2014the 5.850 to 5.925 gigahertz (GHz) band  (5.9 GHz band)\u2014for the primary purpose of improving transportation  safety and adopted basic technical rules for DSRC operations.

DSRC systems support safety applications that require  the immediate transfer of data between entities (vehicle, infrastructure, or  other platforms). According to DOT officials, delays in the transfer of such  data due to harmful interference from unlicensed devices may jeopardize  crash avoidance capabilities. Experts cited similar concerns, with one  state official saying that if they deploy applications and they do not work  due to harmful interference, potential users may not accept V2I. Seven  experts we interviewed agreed that further testing was needed to  determine if sharing would result in harmful interference to DSRC. In  addition, DOT officials noted that changing to a shared 5.9 GHz band  could impact current V2I research, which is based on the assumption that  DSRC systems will have reliable access to the 5.9 GHz wireless  spectrum.", "According to Japanese government officials we interviewed, Japan also  considered whether to share its dedicated spectrum with unlicensed  devices and decided not to allow sharing of the spectrum used for V2I in  the 700 MHz band. According to officials we interviewed, Japan\u2019s  Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications conducted a study to test  interference with V2I technologies and mobile phones to determine the  impact on reliability and latency in delivering safety messages. Based  on these tests, the Japanese government decided not to allow sharing of  the spectrum band used for V2I, because sharing could lead to delays or  harmful interference with V2I messages. Japanese auto manufacturers  we interviewed in Japan supported the decision of the Japanese  government to keep the 700 MHz band dedicated to transportation safety  uses. According to officials, if latency problems affect the receipt of safety  messages, this could degrade the public\u2019s trust, consequently slowing  down acceptance of the V2I system in Japan.", "Since the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was announced, various  organizations have begun efforts to evaluate potential spectrum sharing  in the 5.9 GHz band and some have expressed concerns. For example,  harmful interference from unlicensed devices sharing the same band  could affect the speed at which a V2I message is delivered to a driver.  NTIA, which has conducted a study on the subject, identified risks  associated with allowing unlicensed devices to operate in the 5.9 GHz  band, and concluded that further work was needed to determine whether  and how the risks identified can be mitigated. DOT also plans to evaluate  the potential for unlicensed device interference with DSRC as discussed  below.", "Given the pending FCC rulemaking decision, DOT, technology firms, and  car manufacturers have taken an active role pursuing solutions to  spectrum sharing. Specifically, DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget request  included funds for technical analysis to determine whether DSRC can co- exist with the operation of unlicensed wireless services in the same  radiofrequency band without undermining safety applications.

DOT officials  noted, however, that they would work with NTIA in any spectrum-related  matter to inform FCC of its testing results. According to FCC officials we  spoke with, FCC is currently collecting comments and data from  government agencies, industry, and other interested parties and will use  this information to inform their decision. For example, since 2013,  representatives from Toyota, Denso, CSR Technology, and other firms  worked together as part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE) DSRC Tiger Team to evaluate potential options and  technologies that would allow unlicensed devices to use the 5.9 GHz  band without causing harmful interference to licensed devices. However,  the representatives did not reach an agreement on a unified spectrum- sharing approach. Another ongoing effort from Cisco Systems, the  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, and the Association of Global  Automakers is preparing to test whether unlicensed devices using the  \u201clisten, detect and avoid\u201d protocol would be able to share spectrum  without causing harmful interference to incumbent DSRC operations. As  of September 2015, FCC has not announced a date by which it will make  a decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of State and Local Resources to Develop and Maintain V2I Systems", "paragraphs": ["Because the deployment of V2I technologies will not be mandatory, the  decision to invest in these technologies will be up to the states and  localities that choose to use them as part of their broader traffic- management efforts. However, many states and localities may lack  resources for funding both V2I equipment and the personnel to install,  operate, and maintain the technologies. In its report on the costs,  benefits, and challenges of V2I deployment by local transportation  agencies, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program  (NCHRP) noted that many states they interviewed said that their current  state budgets are the leanest they have been in years. Furthermore,  states are affected because traditional funding sources, such as the  Highway Trust Fund, are eroding, and funding is further complicated by  the federal government\u2019s current financial condition and fiscal outlook.  Consequently, there can be less money for state highway programs that  support construction, reconstruction, and improvement of highways and  bridges on eligible federal-aid highway routes, as well as for other  authorized purposes. According to one stakeholder we interviewed,  there have been widespread funding cuts for state DOTs, and many state  DOTs must first focus on maintaining the infrastructure and equipment  they already have before investing in advanced technologies. Ten  experts we interviewed, including six experts from state and local  transportation agencies, agreed that the lack of state and local resources  will be a significant challenge to deploying V2I technologies. According  to one report, without additional federal funding, deploying V2I systems  would be difficult.", "Even if states decide to invest in V2I deployment, states and localities  may face difficulties finding the resources necessary to operate and  maintain V2I technologies. We have previously found that effectively  using intelligent transportation systems, like V2I, depends on agencies\u2019  having the staff and funding resources needed to maintain and operate  the technologies. However, a recently released DOT report noted that  staffing and information technology resources for maintaining V2I  technologies were lacking in most agencies due to low and uncompetitive  wage rates and funding constraints at the state and local government  levels. Similarly, 12 experts we interviewed stated that states and  localities generally lack the resources to hire and train personnel with the  technical skills needed to operate and maintain V2I systems.", "According to FHWA\u2019s draft guidance on V2I deployment, funds are  available for the purchase and installation of V2I technologies under  various Federal-aid highway programs. In addition, costs that support  V2I systems, including maintenance of roadside equipment and related  hardware, are eligible in the same way that other Intelligent  Transportation System (ITS) equipment and programs are eligible.  According to DOT, states have the authority and responsibility to  determine the priority for funding V2I systems along with other competing  transportation programs.", "Japan\u2019s V2I systems, which were also voluntarily deployed, were funded  in large part by the national government. According to Japan\u2019s National  Police Agency, half of the costs for traffic signals were provided by the  national government. In addition, according to the National Policy Agency,  the Japanese government has invested an estimated $97 million (2014  dollars) in research and development for these systems. Two of the  Japanese automakers we interviewed attributed the success of the  Japanese V2I system in part to the significant government involvement  and financial investment.

According to DOT, such standards define how systems, products, and  components perform, how they can connect, and how they can exchange  data to interoperate. DOT further noted that these standards are  necessary for connected vehicle technologies to work on different types  of vehicles and devices to ensure the integrity and security of their data  transmission. As well, current standardization efforts have focused on  standardizing the data elements and message sets that are transmitted  between vehicles and the infrastructure. Currently, according to DOT  officials, DOT and various organizations have worked with the Society for  Automotive Engineers (SAE) International to standardize the message  sets and associated performance requirements for DSRC (SAE J2735  and J2945), which support a wide variety of V2V and V2I applications.  DOT, SAE International, and engineers from auto manufacturers, V2I  suppliers, technology firms, and other firms meet to develop high-quality,  safe, and cost-effective standards for connected vehicle devices and  technologies, according to an expert from a leading industry organization  specializing in setting connected vehicle technical standards. This expert  also noted that developing consensus around what standards should be  instituted could be difficult given the different interests (political,  economic, or industry-related) of the many stakeholders involved in  developing and deploying V2I technologies. For example, the expert said  that developing effective security standards required for these  technologies that are also cost-effective for auto manufacturers and  government organizations to implement may be difficult.", "Without common standards, V2I technologies may not be interoperable.  DOT has noted that consistent, widely applicable standards and protocols  are needed to ensure V2I interoperability across devices and  applications. However, ensuring interoperability with a standard set of V2I  applications in each state may be particularly challenging because unlike  V2V, deployment of V2I technologies will remain voluntary. Consequently,  states and localities may choose to deploy a variety of different V2I  technologies\u2014or no technologies at all\u2014based on what they deem  appropriate for their transportation needs. DOT officials we interviewed  recognized that a complete national deployment of V2I technologies  may never occur, resulting in a patchwork deployment of different  applications in localities and states, although these applications will be  required to be interoperable with one another. As a result, V2I  deployment may be challenged by the following limitations:", "Benefits may not be optimized: Four experts we interviewed said that  having a standard set of V2I applications in each state would be  beneficial for drivers because a consistent deployment of applications  could potentially increase benefits.", "Development of applications may be more limited: AASHTO\u2019s  National Connected Vehicle Footprint Analysis argues that the more  connected vehicle infrastructure is deployed nationwide using  common standards, the more likely applications will be developed to  take advantage of new safety, mobility, and environmental  opportunities.", "Drivers may not find the system valuable: One expert from a state  agency said without a standard set of V2I applications that allows  drivers to use V2I applications seamlessly as they travel from state to  state, travelers may lose confidence in the usefulness of the system  and choose not to use it.", "DOT and standardization organizations, such as the Society of  Automotive Engineers (SAE) International, are working to develop  standards to support DSRC and other V2I communications technologies.  The data elements and message sets specified in the SAE standards are  suitable not only for use with DSRC but also with other communications  technologies such as cellular. According to DOT officials, the department  is providing funding support, expert participation, and leadership in  multiple standards development organizations to promote consensus on  the key standards required to support nationally interoperable V2I and  V2V technology deployments. Furthermore, the V2I Deployment  Coalition\u2014which includes AASHTO, the Institute of Electrical and  Electronic Engineers, and the Institute of Transportation Engineers\u2014 intends to lead the effort to develop and support publishing of V2I  standards, guidelines, and test specifications to support interoperability.  To facilitate standardization among potential state users of V2I  technologies, FHWA is currently developing deployment guidance as  discussed previously.

Auto manufacturer experts  recognized the importance of developing standards at both a domestic  and international level as cars are manufactured globally. However, this is  a challenge because international standardization organizations, including  those in Europe and Japan, have different verification and validation  processes than the United States, according to an auto manufacturer  expert.  Furthermore, another expert noted that harmonization of  standards is dependent on the country\u2019s or regional government\u2019s  regulations, and since there are different views on the role of these  regulations in Europe, Japan, and the United States, achieving global  standards will be complex. According to DOT, the joint standardization of  connected vehicle systems (V2V and V2I) is a core objective of European  Union-U.S. cooperation on ITS, and U.S.-Japan staff exchanges have  been invaluable in building relationships and facilitating technical  exchange, thus creating a strong foundation for ongoing collaboration and  research. According to DOT officials, even when identical standards are  not viable across multiple countries or regions due to technical or legal  differences, maximizing similarities can increase the likelihood that  common hardware and software can be used in multiple markets,  reducing costs and accelerating deployment.

A DOT study we reviewed and the majority of the experts we  interviewed noted that data security challenges exist and cited challenges  that range from securing messages delivered to and from vehicle devices  and infrastructure to managing security credentials and associated  policies for accessing data and the system. Fourteen of 21 experts we  interviewed cited securing data as a significant challenge to the  deployment of V2I technologies. For example, experts from 5 states and  one local agency that operated V2I test beds told us they were uncertain  how vehicle and infrastructure data would be stored and secured for a  larger deployment of V2I technologies because they have only tested V2I  applications in limited, small-scale deployments. Most of these experts  were also unsure whether current data security efforts could be scalable  to a larger deployment. According to DOT officials, they are currently  researching this area.", "DOT and industry have taken steps to develop a security framework for  all connected vehicle technologies, including V2I. DOT, along with  automakers from CAMP, are testing and developing the Security  Credential Management System (SCMS) to ensure the basic safety  messages are secure and coming from an authorized device. More than  half of the experts we interviewed expressed a variety of concerns about  (1) the SCMS system, including whether SCMS can ensure a trusted and  secure data exchange and (2) who will ultimately manage the system.  To solicit input on these issues DOT launched a Request for Information  in October 2014 to obtain feedback in developing the organizational and  operating structure for SCMS. In our previous work on V2V, we found  that as a part of its research on the security system, DOT had identified  three potential models\u2014federal, public-private, and private. We  previously found that if a federal model were pursued, according to DOT,  the federal government would likely pursue a service contract that would  include specific provisions to ensure adequate market access, privacy  and security controls, and reporting and continuity of services. We also  reported that under a public-private partnership, the security system  would be jointly owned and managed by the federal government and  private entities. At the time of our prior report, DOT officials stated that its  legal authority and resources have led NHTSA to focus primarily on  working with stakeholders to develop a viable private model, involving a  privately owned and operated security-management provider.", "According to DOT officials, the agency is expanding the scope of its  planned policy research to enable the Department to play a more active  leadership role in working with V2V and V2I stakeholders to develop and  prototype a private, multi-stakeholder organizational model for a V2V  SCMS. Officials said that such a model would ensure organizational  transparency, fair representation of stakeholders, and permit the federal  government to play an ongoing advisory role. A central component of the  Department\u2019s planned policy research is the development of policies and  procedures that could govern an operational SCMS, including minimum  standards to ensure security and appropriately protect consumer privacy.  Currently, NHTSA is reviewing comments on the management and  organization for SCMS to inform its V2V Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,  expected to be submitted for Office of Management and Budget review by  the end of 2015. In addition, according to DOT\u2019s Connected Vehicle Pilot  Deployment Program request for proposals, participating state and local  agencies will utilize SCMS as a tool to support deployment security,  which will allow states, local agencies, and private sector firms an  opportunity to test capabilities in a real-world setting. Ultimately, when  asked about the sufficiency of SCMS, almost half of the experts we  interviewed (10 of 21) indicated they were confident that a secure system  for V2I could be developed.", "According to FHWA, a secure system is essential to appropriately protect  the privacy of V2I users. Nine of the experts identified privacy as a  significant challenge for the deployment of V2I technologies.

In a connected vehicle environment, various  organizations\u2014federal, state, and local agencies; academic  organizations; and private sector firms\u2014potentially may have access to  data generated by V2I technologies in order to, for example, manage  traffic and conduct research. DOT has taken some steps to mitigate  security and privacy concerns related to V2V and V2I technologies.", "According to DOT officials, the safety message will be broadcast in a very  limited range (approximately 300 meters) and will not contain any  information that identifies a specific driver, owner or vehicle (through  vehicle identification numbers or license plate or registration information).  The messages transmitted by DSRC devices (such as roadside units) in  support of V2V and V2I technologies also will be signed by security  credentials that change on a periodic basis (currently expected to be  every 5 minutes) to minimize the risk that a third party could use the  messages as a basis for tracking the location or path of a specific  individual or vehicle.", "Additionally, with respect to V2I technologies, DOT officials, car  manufacturers and V2I suppliers plan to incorporate privacy by design  into V2I technologies. Under this approach, according to DOT, V2I data  will be aggregated, and anonymized.

First, Japan\u2019s  Intelligent Transportation Systems Technology Enhancement Association  is responsible for managing the security of their V2I systems, and  developed a system that used encryption to maintain security and ensure  privacy. More specifically, each vehicle participating in V2I is assigned a  changing, random identification number each time the vehicle started,  thus making it difficult to track the vehicle over time. MLIT officials also  noted that data generated from each vehicle is not stored permanently,  but rather saved for distinct time frames depending on its use. Further,  MLIT officials stated that security is ensured because V2I information is  protected, anonymous, non-identifiable, and not shared with outside  organizations; rather, it is used solely for public safety purposes.

For example, in an effort to prevent rear-end  collisions, Japan installed V2I infrastructure that detected and warned  motorists of upcoming congestion on an accident-prone curve on an  expressway in Tokyo. According to Japanese officials, this combined  with other measures such as road marking, led to a 60-percent  reduction in rear-end collisions on this curve.", "Mobility: In interviews, 8 of 21 experts identified mobility as one of the  primary benefits of V2I, including 6 of the 8 state and local agencies  we interviewed. Officials in three states we interviewed noted that  they are focusing on V2I applications that have the potential to  increase mobility. These applications could allow for transportation  system managers to identify and address congestion in real-time, as  well as provide traffic signal priority to certain types of vehicles, such  as emergency responders or transit.

For example, one state agency  noted that using data collected from vehicles could allow the  transportation managers to more easily monitor pavement conditions  and identify potholes (typically a costly and resource-intensive  activity). DOT and the National Cooperative Highway Research  Program have also noted that the visibility and enhanced data on  current traffic and road conditions provided by V2I applications would  provide operational benefits to state and local transportation  managers. This result, in turn, could provide safety or other benefits to  drivers. For example, officials in Japan told us that by using data  collected from vehicles through the ITS infrastructure, they were able  to identify 160 locations in which drivers were braking suddenly. After  investigating the cause, officials took steps to address safety issues at  these sites (such as trimming trees that created visual obstructions)  and incidents of sudden braking decreased by 70 percent and  accidents involving injuries or fatalities decreased 20 percent.

A study sponsored by the University of  Michigan Transportation Research Institute noted that some V2I safety  applications require a majority of vehicles to be equipped before reaching  optimum effectiveness, in contrast to mobility, road weather, and  operations applications, which only require a small percentage of  equipped vehicles before realizing benefits. Japanese government  officials, as well as representatives from a private company we  interviewed in Japan, noted that in some cases, they have found it difficult  to quantify benefits.

Despite these limitations, the cost estimates in these  two studies are cited by several experts and industry stakeholders,  including DOT. According to DOT, these cost figures may be useful to  agencies considering early deployments.", "According to AASHTO and NCHRP, costs of V2I deployment will likely be  comprised of two types of costs. First, V2I will require non-recurring  costs\u2014the upfront, initial costs required to deploy the infrastructure.  According to AASHTO, there are two primary, non-recurring cost  categories associated with V2I deployments:  Infrastructure deployment costs include the costs for planning,  acquiring, and installing the V2I roadside equipment. State and local  agencies will need to evaluate the costs for planning and design that  may include mapping intersections and deciding where to deploy the  DSRC radios based on traffic and safety analyses, according to  AASHTO. Deployment costs will include the cost of acquiring the  equipment, including the roadside unit. AASHTO estimates that the  total equipment costs would be $7,450 per site, with $3,000  attributed to each roadside unit, on average. However, 4 of the  experts we interviewed stated that the cost estimates for the hardware  are likely to decrease over time, as the technology matures and the  market becomes more competitive. The total average cost for  installation of the equipment per site includes the costs of labor and  inspection. In addition, deployment costs may include the cost of  upgrading traffic signal controllers. AASHTO estimates that  approximately two thirds of all controllers in the United States will  need to be upgraded to support connected vehicle activities.", "Backhaul costs refer to the costs for establishing connectivity for  communication between roadside units and back offices or traffic  management centers (TMCs). As discussed, backhaul includes the  fiber optic cables connecting traffic signals to the back office, as well  as any sensors or relays that link to or serve these components.  According to NCHRP, backhaul will be one of the biggest components  of costs. In fact, three state agencies and one supplier we spoke with  referred to backhaul as a factor that will affect costs for V2I  deployment. Backhaul costs are also uncertain because states vary in  the extent to which they have existing backhaul. According to  AASHTO, some sites may only require an upgrade to their current  backhaul system to support expected bandwidth requirements for  connected vehicle communications. However, 40 percent of all traffic  signals have either no backhaul or will require new systems,  according to AASHTO. The difference in cost between tying into an  existing fiber-optic backhaul and installing a new fiber-optic backhaul  for the sites is significant, according to DOT. The average national  cost to upgrade backhaul to a DSRC roadside site is estimated to vary  from $3,000, if a site has sufficient backhaul and will only need an  upgrade, to $40,000, if the V2I site requires a completely new  backhaul system, according to AASHTO estimates.", "The total potential average, non-recurring costs of deploying connected  vehicle infrastructure per site, according to DOT and AASHTO, are  $51,650 (see table 1).", "Second, V2I will also require recurring costs\u2014the costs required to  operate and maintain the infrastructure. According to AASHTO, there are  several types of recurring costs associated with V2I deployments,  including equipment maintenance and replacement, security, and  personnel costs. The amount of maintenance needed to keep roadside  units running is unclear, according to 3 of the experts we interviewed,  because the test bed deployments have generally not operated long  enough to warrant maintenance of the equipment. However, NCHRP  estimates that routine maintenance costs for roadside units would likely  vary from 2 to 5 percent of the original hardware and labor costs. This  includes such maintenance as realigning antennas and rebooting  hardware. AASHTO also estimates that the device would need replacing  every 5 to 10 years. In addition, states and localities may also need to  hire new personnel or train existing staff to operate these systems.  According to AASHTO, personnel costs will also depend on the size of  the deployment as smaller deployments may not need dedicated  personnel to complete maintenance, while large deployments may require  staff dedicated to system monitoring on site or on call. Furthermore,  security costs will be a recurring cost and include the costs of keeping the  security credentials of the SCMS up to date and the costs to manage the  security system, according to AASHTO. Given that SCMS is still being  developed, cost estimates are unknown. One car manufacturer we  interviewed explained that because the management of the security  system is unknown, it is extremely challenging to estimate future costs. In  addition, one county agency official said security costs could greatly affect  the total costs for V2I deployment because the requirements and funding  responsibility are not clearly defined. As part of its ANPRM, NHTSA  conducted an assessment of preliminary V2V costs, including costs for  the SCMS. NHTSA estimated that the SCMS costs per vehicle range  from $1 to $6, with an average of $3.14. SCMS costs will increase over  time due to the need to support an increasing number of vehicles with the  V2V technologies, according to NHTSA.", "While AASHTO and NCHRP have estimated the above potential average  costs for various components associated with a V2I deployment, 10 of 21  experts stated that it is difficult to determine the actual costs for a V2I  deployment in a particular state or locality due to a number of factors.", "First, the scope of the deployment will affect the total costs of a  region\u2019s V2I deployment, according to NCHRP, because it will  determine the amount of equipment needed for the system to  function, including the number of roadside units. Previous test bed  deployments have varied in size ranging from 1 to 2,680 DSRC  roadside units. Further, the number of devices needed will be  dependent on how many devices are required to enable the  applications. For example, while a curve-speed-warning application  may require installing equipment at a specific location, applications  that aim to mitigate congestion by advising drivers of the best speed  to approach an intersection may need to be installed at several  intersections throughout an urban corridor. One state agency said that  one factor that could affect costs is how often roadside equipment  needs to be replaced in order to enable certain V2I applications. In  addition, as previously mentioned, the size of the deployment will  contribute to personnel costs.", "Second, the state or locality\u2019s deployment environment will affect its  deployment costs. One state agency pointed out that everyone\u2019s costs  will be different because they will be deploying in environments with  differing levels of existing infrastructure. For example, as previously  noted, the region\u2019s existing backhaul infrastructure will determine the  extent of the cost for installing or upgrading the region\u2019s system,  including whether a city or state has fiber optics already installed or  signal controllers need upgrading.", "Lastly, the maturity of the technology will also affect cost estimates for  equipment such as a DSRC radio. Estimating equipment costs is  difficult at this time because the technology is still developing,  according to NCHRP. Ten of the 21 experts we interviewed, including  all of the state agencies, also mentioned that estimating costs is  challenging because the technology is still immature. Furthermore,  the reports and 4 experts we interviewed agree that the cost  estimates for the hardware are likely to decrease over time, as the  technology matures and the market becomes more competitive.", "As part of the upcoming Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program,  DOT developed the Cost Overview for Planning Ideas and Logical  Organization Tool (CO-PILOT). This tool generates high-level cost  estimates for 56 V2I applications based on AASHTO\u2019s estimations. In  addition, according to DOT, the agency will work with AASHTO to  develop a life-cycle cost tool that agencies can use to support V2I  deployment beyond the Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program.  DOT officials also indicated that they plan to update the tool over time as  more data are collected from the Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment  Program, and they expect the tool to be available for use by 2016. Also,  as previously mentioned, FHWA is developing deployment guidance that  will outline potential sources of funding for states and localities, among  other things."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to the Secretary of Transportation,  Secretary of Commerce, and the Chairman of the FCC, for review and  comment.

We interviewed  officials from DOT\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and  Technology, Intelligent Transportation Systems-Joint Program Office  (ITS-JPO), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Volpe National  Transportation Systems Center, about these efforts.", "For all objectives, we developed a structured set of questions for our  interviews with 21 experts who represented domestic automobile  manufacturers, V2I device suppliers, state and local government, privacy  experts, standardization organizations, and academic researchers with  relevant expertise. The identified experts have varying degrees of  expertise in the following areas related to V2I technology: the production  of passenger vehicles; technology development; technology deployment;  data privacy; security; state agency deployment; and legal and policy  issues. Our starting point for our expert selection was a list of experts  originally created in January 2013 by the National Academy of Sciences  for GAO\u2019s vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) report. We used this list for our initial  selection because V2V and V2I technologies are both connected vehicle  technologies with many similarities, and many V2V stakeholders are also  working on V2I. In addition to nine experts we selected from the National  Academy of Sciences list, we selected an additional 12 experts based on  the following factors:  1.  their personal involvement in the deployment of V2I technologies;  2.  recommendations from federal agencies (DOT, and the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) and associations (such as the  American Association of State and Highway Transportation Officials  (AASHTO); and  3.  experts\u2019 involvement in professional affiliations such as a V2I  consortium or groups dedicated to these technologies or to a specific  challenge affecting V2I (e.g., privacy).", "Table 2 lists the experts we selected.", "In conducting our structured interviews, we used a standardized interview  to ensure that we asked all of the experts the same questions. During  these interviews we asked, among other things, for expert views on the  state of development and deployment of V2I technologies (including  DOT\u2019s role in this process), the potential benefits of V2I technologies, and  their potential costs. We also asked for each expert\u2019s views on a number  of defined potential challenges facing the deployment of V2I technologies,  and asked the experts to rate the significance of each challenge using a  three-point scale (significant challenge, moderate challenge, or slight  challenge). We determined this list of potential challenges after initial  interviews with DOT, industry associations, and other interest groups  knowledgeable about V2I technologies. Prior to conducting the interviews,  we tested the structured interview with one association to ensure our  questions were worded appropriately. After conducting these structured  interviews, we summarized expert responses relevant to each objective.  The viewpoints gathered through our expert interviews represent the  viewpoints of individuals interviewed and cannot be generalized to a  broader population.", "For the purpose of this review, state and local agency officials were  considered experts because of their experience in deploying and testing  V2I technologies, and experience working with the required technologies  (DSRC equipment and software), decision process (funding and  scheduling); personnel requirements and skill sets needed for  deployment; operations and maintenance. We specifically included six  officials who deployed V2I test beds in their respective states in our pool  of expert interviews.", "We also included two officials who studied V2I for several years, had  taken part in the AASHTO\u2019s Connected Vehicle group, and had applied to  DOT\u2019s prior Connected Vehicles Pilot Program (V2I test bed). We also  interviewed additional officials who have contributed to the U.S. efforts to  develop and deploy connected vehicle technologies\u2014officials who we  refer to as \u201cstakeholders.\u201d Specifically, we used these stakeholders to  help us understand issues that informed our structured set of questions,  but did not administer the structured question set during these  stakeholder interviews. We primarily selected stakeholders based on  recommendations from DOT and industry associations. However, we also  included DOT as a stakeholder in the deployment of V2I technologies  because it is leading federal V2I efforts.", "We interviewed officials from 17 V2I stakeholder organizations including:   1.  DOT, NHTSA   2.  DOT, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology,  3.  DOT, FHWA   4.  DOT, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center  5.  DOT, Chief Privacy Officer  6.

Minnesota Department of Transportation  17. Road Commission for Oakland County, Michigan  To determine the status of development and deployment of V2I  technology, we interviewed officials from DOT, including the Office of the  Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, ITS-JPO, FHWA,  Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, and the NHTSA. We also  interviewed officials at all seven V2I test beds located in Virginia,  Michigan, Florida, Arizona, California, and New York. We conducted site  visits to three test beds\u2014the Safety Pilot in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the  test beds in Southeast Michigan and Northern Virginia. We selected the  three site visit locations based on which had the most advanced  technology according to DOT and state officials. At these site visits, we  conducted interviews with officials from state and local transportation  agencies and academic researchers to collect information on developing  and deploying V2I technology. We visited FHWA\u2019s Turner Fairbank  Highway Research Center in Virginia to understand the agency\u2019s  connected vehicle research efforts. We reviewed documentation of the  efforts of DOT and automobile manufacturers related to vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I) technologies, such as the 2015 FHWA\u2019s V2I Draft  Deployment Guidance and Products and documentation on completed  and ongoing research. We identified materials published in the past 4  years that were related to the terms \u201cvehicle-to-infrastructure\u201d and \u201cV2I\u201d  through searches of bibliographic databases, including Transportation  Research International Documentation and WorldCat. While a variety of  V2I technologies exist for transit and commercial vehicles, for the purpose  of this report we limited our scope to passenger vehicles since much of  DOT\u2019s connected vehicle work is focused on passenger vehicles.", "To determine the challenges affecting the deployment of V2I technology  and DOT\u2019s existing or planned actions to address potential challenges,  we reviewed FHWA\u2019s V2I draft guidance to assist in planning for future  investments and deployment of V2I systems. In addition, we interviewed  officials from FCC and NTIA about challenges related to the potential for  spectrum sharing in the 5.9 GHz band. We interviewed DOT\u2019s Privacy  Officer, two privacy experts, and several stakeholders to understand  privacy concerns regarding the deployment of V2I technologies.", "We collected information on anticipated benefits of these technologies  through interviews with officials from DOT, automobile manufacturers,  industry associations, and experts identified by National Academy of  Sciences and other stakeholders, and through reviews of studies they  provided. To specifically address the potential costs associated with V2I  technologies, we analyzed two reports, AASHTO\u2019s National Connected  Vehicle Field Infrastructure Footprint Analysis and NCHRP\u2019s 03-101, Cost  and Benefits of Public-Sector Deployment of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure  Technologies report, both of which addressed acquisition, installation,  backhaul, operations, and maintenance costs. According to DOT officials  and other stakeholders we interviewed, those two reports were the  primary sources of information for V2I potential deployment costs  estimates and actual costs. We used V2I costs estimates from the  AASHTO Footprint Analysis to give examples of potential costs for  deployment. To further assess the reliability of the cost estimates, in  addition to our own review of the two reports, our internal economic  stakeholder also independently reviewed both reports, and we  subsequently interviewed representatives from AASHTO and NCHRP to  verify the scope and methodology of the cost analyses performed in both  reports. In addition, we discussed estimated costs and factors that  affected costs for V2I investments with experts and stakeholders from  federal, local, state government, academia, car manufacturers, industry  associations, and V2I suppliers. We determined that the actual cost  figures were reliable and suitable for the purpose of our report.", "In addition to the above work, we selected Japan for a site visit because  of its nationwide deployment and years of experience with deployment  and maintenance of V2I technologies. Japan has led efforts in V2I  technology development and deployment for over two decades. The  country serves as an illustrative example from which to draw information  on potential benefits, costs, and challenges of deploying V2I technologies  in the United States.
