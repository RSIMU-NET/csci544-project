In refund fraud, an identity thief uses a taxpayer's name and Social Security Number (SSN) to file for a tax refund, which IRS discovers after the legitimate taxpayer files. In employment fraud, an identity thief uses a taxpayer's name and SSN to obtain a job. When the thief's employer reports income to IRS, the taxpayer appears to have unreported income on his or her return, leading to enforcement action. IRS has taken multiple steps to resolve, detect, and prevent employment and refund fraud: Resolve--IRS marks taxpayer accounts to alert its personnel of a taxpayer's identity theft. The purpose is to expedite resolution of existing problems and alert personnel to potential future account problems. Detect--IRS screens tax returns filed in the names of known refund and employment fraud victims. Prevent--IRS provides taxpayers with information to increase their awareness of identity theft, including tips for safeguarding personal information. IRS has also started providing identity theft victims with a personal identification number to help identify legitimate returns. IRS's ability to address identity theft issues is constrained by (1) privacy laws that limit IRS's ability to share identity theft information with other agencies; (2) the timing of fraud detection--more than a year may have passed since the original fraud occurred; (3) the resources necessary to pursue the large volume of potential criminal refund and employment fraud cases; and (4) the burden that stricter screening would likely cause taxpayers and employers since more legitimate returns would fail such screening."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss how identity theft harms taxpayers and  how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) works to resolve, detect, and  prevent these problems.

IRS also uses its identity theft indicators to screen tax returns  filed in the names of known refund and employment fraud victims. During  the 2009, 2010, and 2011 filing seasons, IRS screened returns filed in the  names of taxpayers with identity theft indicators on their accounts. There  are approximately 378,000 such taxpayers. In this screening, IRS looks for  characteristics indicating that the return was filed by an identity thief  instead of the legitimate taxpayer, such as large changes in income or a  change of address. If a return fails the screening, it is subject to additional  IRS manual review, including contacting employers to verify that the  income reported on the tax return was legitimate. In addition to U.S.  taxpayers with indicators on their accounts, IRS officials also told us that  they screened returns filed in the name of a large number\u2014about  350,000\u2014of Puerto Rican citizens who have had their U.S. SSNs  compromised in a major identity theft scheme.", "As of May 12, 2011, 216,000 returns filed in 2011 failed the screens and  were assigned for manual processing.

When screening future years\u2019 returns for possible identity theft,  IRS will exclude returns with a PIN, which will help avoid the possibility  of a \u201cfalse positive\u201d and a delayed tax refund.

However, IRS cannot disclose to the  taxpayer any other information pertaining to employment or refund fraud,  such as the perpetrator\u2019s identity or any information about the  perpetrator\u2019s employer.

CI  conducts investigations and refers cases to the Department of Justice  (DOJ), which is responsible for prosecuting cases in the federal courts.

IRS could screen returns filed in the  names of known identity theft victims more tightly than is currently done.  More restrictive screening may detect more cases of refund fraud before  IRS issues refunds. However, more restrictive screening will likely  increase the number of legitimate returns that fail the screenings (false  positives). Since returns that fail screening require a manual review, this  change could harm innocent taxpayers by causing delays in their refunds.  Using more restrictive rules would also place additional burden on  employers because IRS contacts employers listed on all returns that fail  screening.", "All taxpayers. Beyond screening returns with known tax-related identity  theft issues, screening all tax returns for possible refund fraud would pose  similar trade-offs, but on a grander scale. For example, as noted above,  one way to check for identity theft is to look for significant differences  between current year and prior year tax returns, but this could be  confounded by a large number of false positives. IRS officials told us that  in 2009 there were 10 million address changes, 46 million changes in  employer, and millions of deaths and births. Checking all returns that  reflect these changes for possible refund fraud could overwhelm IRS\u2019s  capacity to issue refunds to legitimate taxpayers in a timely manner.", "Looking Forward. IRS\u2019s identity protection strategy and the creation of  PIPDS were part of an effort to more efficiently identify refund and  employment fraud as well as to assist innocent taxpayers. Since adopting  the recommendation in our 2009 report regarding using performance  measures to assess effectiveness, IRS has followed through, using its  improved performance information to identify additional steps it could  take. These include the new indicators for taxpayer accounts, improved  routing of suspect returns, and PIN numbers. However, none of these  steps will completely eliminate refund or employment fraud. By  continuing to monitor the effectiveness of its identity theft initiatives, IRS  may find additional steps to reduce the problems faced by both taxpayers  and IRS.", "Looking further forward, other long-term initiatives underway at IRS have  at least some potential to help combat identity theft\u2013related fraud. In April  2011, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue gave a speech about a long- term vision to increase up-front compliance activities during returns  processing. One example is to match information returns with tax returns  before refunds are issued. Before this could happen, IRS would have to  make significant changes. Third-party information returns would have to  be filed with IRS earlier in the filing season. IRS would also have to  improve its automated processing systems; IRS\u2019s current Customer  Account Data Engine (CADE 2) effort is one key step. While these efforts  are part of a broad compliance improvement vision, they could also detect  some identity theft\u2013related fraud. If, for example, IRS could match  employer information to tax returns before refunds are issued, identity  thieves could not use phony W-2s to claim fraudulent refunds.", "Chairman Nelson, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
