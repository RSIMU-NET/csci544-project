We chose the four pretest  sites to include at least one installation with a primary MTF that was a  medical center, a community hospital, and a health center/clinic. We  conducted one of the pretests where all GAO participants were present  and three pretests with some GAO participants in person and others  participated by telephone. We made changes to the content and format of  the survey on the basis of the feedback we received during the pretests.", "On August 20, 2012, Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) officials sent  the survey to senior health care officials at the 27 domestic Army  installations as a Word document by email that the respondents were  requested to return after marking checkboxes or entering responses to  open-answer boxes. All surveys were returned by September 26, 2012,  for a 100 percent response rate. We conducted follow-up with senior  health care officials about missing or inconsistent responses, through  Army MEDCOM officials, between September 2012 and December 2012.  The survey is presented in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Survey Sent to Domestic Army Military Treatment Facilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bonnie Anderson,   Assistant Director; Jennie Apter; Danielle Bernstein; Natalie Herzog;   Ron La Due Lake; Amanda K.
