Investing in research and development (R&D) is essential to protect critical systems and to enhance the cybersecurity of both the government and the private sector. Federal law has called for improvements in cybersecurity R&D, and, recently, President Obama has stated that advancing R&D is one of his administration's top priorities for improving cybersecurity. GAO was asked to determine the key challenges in enhancing national-level cybersecurity R&D efforts among the federal government and private companies. To do this, GAO consulted with officials from relevant federal agencies and experts from private sector companies and academic institutions as well as analyzed key documents, such as agencies' research plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Several major challenges impede efforts to improve cybersecurity R&D. Among the most critical challenges are the following: 1) Establishing a prioritized national R&D agenda. While R&D that is in support of specific agencies' missions is important, it is also essential that national research efforts be strategically guided by an ordered set of national-level R&D goals. Additionally, it is critical that cyberspace security research efforts are prioritized across all sectors to ensure that national goals are addressed. Accordingly, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace recommended that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) coordinate the development of an annual cybersecurity research agenda that includes near-term (1-3 years), mid-term (3-5 years), and long-term (5 years or longer) goals. Although OSTP has taken initial steps toward developing such an agenda, one does not currently exist. OSTP and Office of Management and Budget officials stated that they believe an agenda is contained in existing documents; however, these documents are either outdated or lack appropriate detail. Without a current national cybersecurity R&D agenda, the nation is at risk that agencies and private sector companies may focus on their individual priorities, which may not be the most important national research priorities. 2) Strengthening leadership. While officials within OSTP's Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD)--a multiagency coordination body that is primarily responsible for providing leadership in coordinating cybersecurity R&D--have played a facilitator role in coordinating cybersecurity R&D efforts within the federal government, they have not led agencies in a strategic direction. NITRD's lack of leadership has been noted by many experts as well as by a presidential advisory committee that reported that federal cybersecurity R&D efforts should be focused, coordinated, and overseen by a central body. Until NITRD exercises its leadership responsibilities, federal agencies will lack overall direction for cybersecurity R&D. 3) Tracking R&D fundingand establishing processes for the public and private sectors to share key R&D information. Despite a congressional mandate to develop a governmentwide repository that tracks federally funded R&D, including R&D related to cybersecurity, such a repository is not currently in place. Additionally, the government does not have a process to foster the kinds of relationships necessary for coordination between the public and private sectors. While NITRD hosted a major conference last year that brought together public, private, and academic experts, this was a one-time event, and, according to experts, next steps remain unclear. Without a mechanism to track all active and completed cybersecurity R&D initiatives, federal researchers and developers as well as private companies lack essential information about ongoing and completed R&D. Moreover, without a process for industry and government to share cybersecurity R&D information, the nation is at risk of having unforeseen gaps."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Director of OSTP direct NITRD to exercise its leadership responsibilities by taking several actions, including developing a national agenda, and establishing and utilizing a mechanism to keep track of federal cybersecurity R&D funding. OSTP agreed with GAO's recommendation and provided details on planned actions. GAO recommends that TSA establish milestones for a staffing study, verify the accuracy of all reported screening data, develop a contingency plan for screening domestic cargo, and develop plans for meeting the mandate as it applies to inbound cargo. TSA partially concurred with verifying screening data and did not concur with developing a contingency plan because it did not believe such actions were feasible. GAO believes these recommendations remain valid, as discussed in this report. TSA agreed with all other recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic increases in computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of  the Internet, continue to revolutionize the way that our government, our  nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business.

Although the department\u2019s research  organizations (e.g., the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research  Laboratory, and the Air Force Research Laboratory) have cybersecurity  programs, the largest investments within its cybersecurity R&D are with  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the  National Security Agency (NSA). DARPA is the central R&D organization  for the department, and its cybersecurity R&D budget for fiscal year 2010  is approximately $144 million. Its mission is to identify revolutionary,  high-risk, high-payoff technologies of interest to the military, then to  support the development of these technologies through transition. NSA  also performs extensive cybersecurity research. Its research programs  focus on high-speed encryption and certain defense capabilities, among  other things. For fiscal year 2010, the agency\u2019s budget was approximately  $29 million for cybersecurity R&D. The research is conducted and  supported by its National Information Assurance Research Group.

In December  2008, the Center for Strategic and International Studies Commission on  Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency reported that the federal government  needs to increase the supply of skilled workers and to create a career path  (including training and advancement) for cyberspace specialists in the  federal government. Furthermore, one of the national Cybersecurity  Coordinator\u2019s responsibilities is updating the national cybersecurity  strategy, which addresses the cybersecurity human capital needs, among  other things.", "While several federal programs intended to promote cybersecurity-related  professions exist today\u2014such as NSF\u2019s Pathways to Revitalize  Undergraduate Computing Education program and DOD\u2019s Science,  Mathematics and Research for Transformation Scholarship for Service  program, which seek to develop a U.S. workforce with computing  competencies\u2014government officials and private sector experts agree that  more can be done. For example, DHS officials indicated there is a shortage  of cybersecurity R&D management officials. DOD officials indicated that  more can be done to encourage personnel to pursue security degrees, and  officials from DOE stated that it is very difficult to find highly qualified  researchers with the requisite experience. Private sector experts voiced  similar concerns, such as the need to cultivate talented people and the  need for employees with more cybersecurity R&D experience.", "Government officials and cybersecurity experts suggested that several  factors have contributed to the lack of human capital expertise in the area  of cybersecurity R&D. For example, federal officials and cybersecurity  experts suggested that unclear career paths in cybersecurity have  contributed to the lack of a sufficient skill base. Another expert stated that  colleges or universities do not have the appropriate tools and products to  adequately teach cybersecurity to students. While it has been 7 years since  The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace articulated plans for  improving training and creating certifications, human capital weaknesses  still exist.", "Without obtaining information on the shortages in researchers in the  cybersecurity field, it will be difficult for the national Cybersecurity  Coordinator to update the national cybersecurity strategy with the  appropriate cybersecurity human capital plans for addressing such  weaknesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Mechanism in Place That Identifies All Cybersecurity R&D Initiatives and Funding", "paragraphs": ["Congress has recognized the importance of making available information  on federal R&D funding for coordinating federal research activities and  improving collaboration among those conducting federal R&D. To improve  the methods by which government information is organized, preserved,  and made accessible to the public, the E-Government Act of 2002  mandated that OMB ensure the development and maintenance of a  governmentwide repository and Web site that integrates information about  federally funded R&D, including R&D related to cybersecurity. The  Director of OMB delegated this responsibility to NSF.", "As we have previously reported, NSF maintained a repository for federally  funded R&D, known as the Research and Development in the U.S.  (RaDiUS) database; however, the database was incomplete and not fully  populated. Therefore, in 2006, we recommended that OMB issue  guidance to agencies on reporting information about federally funded  cybersecurity R&D projects to RaDiUS. OMB did not implement our  recommendation. In 2008, the database was decommissioned because,  according to a senior official at NSF, the data were incomplete, users had  difficulty using it, and the database was built with antiquated technology.  In March 2010, OMB officials stated that they are currently evaluating  several repositories to replace RaDiUS as a centralized database to house  all government-funded R&D programs, including cybersecurity R&D.  While officials stated that they anticipate making a decision on a database  by the end of fiscal year 2010, officials were unable to specify when a  database would be in place that tracks all cybersecurity R&D information.  Additionally, it is not clear how this fits into the overall coordination  efforts for which NITRD is responsible.", "Tracking funding that is allocated to classified R&D adds to the  complexity of this challenge. For example, according to a DOD official, the  majority of DOD\u2019s cybersecurity R&D is composed of either classified  R&D or unclassified components of a program mixed with classified  components, thereby rendering the entire program as classified. As such, it  is difficult to identify the exact funding that is allocated to classified  versus unclassified R&D.", "There is currently no mechanism in place that identifies all cybersecurity  R&D initiatives governmentwide and associated funding. DHS officials  stated that it would be helpful to have a clearinghouse that they could use  to view what activities are already being conducted by the government. In  addition, a private sector expert stated that having a centralized database  in place would improve coordination between the public and private  sectors. However, challenges to maintaining such a mechanism exist. For  example, an OSTP official indicated that it is difficult to develop and  enforce policies for identifying specific funding as R&D. Additionally, the  level of detail to be disclosed is also a factor because national security  must also be protected.", "However, without a mechanism to track all active and completed  cybersecurity R&D initiatives, federal researchers and developers as well  as private companies lack essential information about ongoing and  completed R&D, thus increasing the likelihood of duplicative efforts,  inefficient use of government funding, and lost collaboration  opportunities. Additionally, without a complete understanding of how  much each federal agency is spending on cybersecurity R&D, it may be  difficult to make the appropriate resource allocation decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OSTP and NITRD have recently taken steps to try to improve the  coordination and oversight of cybersecurity R&D. However, key  challenges still exist, and, until these challenges are addressed, the United  States may continue to struggle in protecting and securing its critical  systems and networks. Specifically, the absence of a national  cybersecurity R&D agenda and leadership increases the risk that efforts  will not reflect national priorities, key decisions will be postponed, and  federal agencies will lack overall direction for their efforts. Furthermore,  without sufficient attention to complex, long-term research projects and  input on the current weaknesses and shortages in researchers in  cybersecurity, the nation risks falling behind in cybersecurity and not  being able to adequately protect its digital infrastructure.

For example, to  address the part of the recommendation to establish a comprehensive  national R&D agenda, OSTP has begun updating its current 5-year plan for  cybersecurity R&D. Additionally, to address the portion of the  recommendation to identify and report shortages in researchers in the  cybersecurity field, NITRD officials plan to provide an assessment of these  shortages as part of their annual planning and review processes. The  Assistant Director for Information Technology R&D also indicated that  OSTP did not concur with certain findings within our report; however, he  did not provide any additional information.", "The Director of NIST indicated that he agreed with our recommendation.  However, he stated NIST officials recommended that we make two  changes to the draft report. First, the officials believe that OSTP and  NITRD are coordinating research activities and working with the federal  government research community to identify a research strategy that meets  critical future needs in cybersecurity. We acknowledge in the report that  NITRD facilitates several activities, such as hosting monthly meetings in  which agencies discuss their initiatives and compiling all of its  participating agencies\u2019 cybersecurity R&D efforts and budgets. We also  acknowledge that NITRD hosted the National Cyber Leap Year Summit in  August 2009, which aimed to bring together researchers and developers  from the private and public sectors. Nevertheless, as we state in the  report, NITRD is not leading agencies in a strategic direction toward a  cybersecurity agenda. Second, officials requested that we add a sentence  that officials from NIST believe that a prioritized research strategy is  evolving and agencies will base their research agenda on this strategy and  their mission needs. We acknowledge in the report that NITRD is currently  working on developing a framework that focuses on three main  cybersecurity R&D themes. NITRD officials expect the framework to be  finalized in time for the 2012 budget submission. However, these themes  do not cover all of the priorities that should be included in a national  cybersecurity R&D agenda.", "Regarding comments from NSF\u2019s Senior Science Advisor, she indicated  that she generally agreed with our recommendation.

We developed a  list of companies through the membership lists of IT and communication  private sector councils, which are composed of a wide range of companies  that specialize in these areas. We narrowed down the list by asking each  company whether they conduct cybersecurity R&D and whether they  would be willing to speak to us about their cybersecurity R&D priorities,  as well as their views on what role the government should be playing in  the cybersecurity R&D arena.
