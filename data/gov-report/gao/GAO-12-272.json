GAO was requested to assess, from fiscal year 2004 to the present, the extent to which DHS has used its CBRN risk assessments to inform CBRN response plans and CBRN capabilities, and has institutionalized their use. GAO examined relevant laws, Homeland Security Presidential Directives, an Executive Order, DHS guidance, and all 12 relevant interagency CBRN response plans developed by DHS. Based on a review of a United States governmentwide CBRN database and DHS interviews, among other things, GAO selected a nongeneralizable set of seven DHS capabilities used specifically for detecting or responding to CBRN incidents to identify examples of DHS\u0092s use of its CBRN risk assessments. GAO also interviewed relevant DHS officials. This is a public version of a classified report that GAO issued in October 2011.

DHS guidance states that response planning and resource decisions should be informed by risk information. GAO\u0092s analysis showed that DHS used its CBRN risk assessments to directly inform 2 of 12 CBRN response plans GAO identified because planners considered the risk assessments to be more accurate than earlier DHS planning assumptions. For another 7 of the 12 plans, DHS officials said that the assessments indirectly informed the plans by providing background information prior to plan development. However, GAO could not independently verify this because DHS officials could not document how the risk assessments influenced the information contained in the plans. GAO\u0092s analysis found general consistency between the risk assessments and the plans. For the remaining 3 plans, DHS officials did not use the risk assessments to inform the plans; for 2 of the 3 plans DHS officials told GAO they were not aware of the assessments. DHS officials also noted that there was no departmental guidance on when or how the CBRN risk assessments should be used when developing such plans.", "Since 2004, DHS\u0092s use of its CBRN risk assessments to inform its CBRN-specific capabilities has varied, from directly impacting its capabilities to not being used at all. Of the 7 capabilities GAO reviewed, one was directly informed by the risk assessments; DHS used its biological agent risk assessments to confirm that its BioWatch program could generally detect the biological agents posing the greatest risk. For 5 of the 7 capabilities, DHS officials said they used the risk assessments along with other information sources to partially inform these capabilities. For example, DHS used its chemical agent risk assessments to determine whether its chemical detectors and the risk assessments were generally aligned for the highest risk agents. For 3 of these 5 capabilities, GAO could not independently verify that they were partially informed by the risk assessments because DHS officials could not document how the risk assessments influenced the capabilities. DHS did not use its CBRN risk assessments to inform the remaining CBRN capability because the assessments were not needed to meet the capability\u0092s mission.", "DHS and its components do not have written procedures to institutionalize their use of DHS\u0092s CBRN risk assessments for CBRN response planning and capability investment decisions. Standards for internal control in the federal government call for written procedures to better ensure management\u0092s directives are enforced. DHS does not have procedures that stipulate when and how DHS officials should use the department\u0092s CBRN risk assessments to inform CBRN response planning and capability investment decisions, and GAO found variation in the extent to which they were used. DHS officials agree with GAO that without written procedures, the consistent use of the department\u0092s CBRN risk assessments by DHS officials may not be ensured beyond the tenure of any given agency official.

More recently, the May 2010 National Security Strategy  noted that the American people face no greater or more urgent danger  than a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon. The strategy further said  that the effective dissemination of a lethal biological agent within a U.S.  city would endanger the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and  have unprecedented economic, societal, and political consequences.addition, multiple stakeholders have assessed the federal government\u2019s  ability to protect the nation from CBRN agents and deemed it inadequate.  For example, in January 2010, the congressionally mandated  Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction  Proliferation and Terrorism reported that the federal government lacked  the capability to rapidly recognize, respond to, and recover from a terrorist  attack using biological agents.", "Because CBRN agents differ in their potential to be used to cause  widespread illness and death, members of Congress have expressed the  need for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assess the risks  posed by CBRN agents to identify those that are highest risk and develop  necessary response plans and capabilities.DHS produces CBRN threat and risk assessments that analyze the  potential for adverse outcomes as a result of an attack with such agents.  Since 2004, DHS has spent over $70 million developing these analyses.  Assessing the risks posed by CBRN agents requires analyzing and  modeling areas of uncertainty, including determining an adversary\u2019s  capability to acquire these agents, develop them into weapons, and  disseminate them to estimate the plausibility and consequences of such  attacks. These assessments are designed so that decision makers can  use them to inform priorities, develop or compare courses of action, and  inform federal planning and investments for responding to the highest risk  CBRN incidents.", "To address these needs,  The 2007 National Strategy for Homeland Security (Strategy) notes that  the nation must apply a risk-based framework across all homeland  security efforts to identify and assess potential hazards, determine what  levels of relative risk are acceptable, and prioritize and allocate resources  among homeland security partners to, among other things, respond to  and recover from CBRN incidents. The Strategy states that a disciplined  approach to managing risk will help to achieve overall effectiveness and  efficiency in securing the nation. Further, the Strategy notes that for  homeland security efforts to succeed federal dollars must be allocated  based on risk assessments and on accountability for results; once  allocated, funds must be used to support or develop operational plans  and their derivative requirements and capabilities.", "In June 2011 we reported on DHS and the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) coordination for developing CBRN risk  assessments.other and with other federal departments to varying extents over time to  develop CBRN risk assessments, but that neither department has written  procedures for developing these assessments.

We selected  assumptions that contained information about the unique features of the  CBRN agent, the threat, the attack scenario, DHS\u2019s ability to detect the  agent and respond, public health consequences of an attack, or time  frames for response. We excluded generic statements regarding  coordination of the federal response to an attack and the roles and  responsibilities of relevant agencies because the CBRN risk assessments  do not assess these topics. We compared these assumptions to the  information contained in the risk assessments to determine the relative  level of consistency between examples of this type of information  contained in the plans and in the assessments.

The same  official told us that these CBRN risk assessments do not provide useful  information to inform NTNFC activities because nuclear forensic  capabilities are developed for all radiological and nuclear materials,  regardless of their relative risk. Further, he stated that NTNFC is already  aware of the universe of possible radiological and nuclear materials that  could be used to attack the nation. DHS S&T\u2019s Chief Medical and Science  Advisor, the official who oversees the development of DHS\u2019s CBRN risk  assessments, agreed that NTNFC\u2019s capabilities need to be able to  identify all radiological and nuclear materials, and that therefore the  CBRN risk assessments were not relevant for NTNFC\u2019s efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Specific Guidance Not Established to Help Ensure DHS\u2019s CBRN Risk Assessments Are Used to Inform Its Response Plans and Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["DHS policy states that DHS components should use risk assessment  information to inform planning and capability investment decisions, but  DHS has not established specific guidance, such as written procedures,  that details when and how DHS components should consider using the  department\u2019s CBRN-specific risk assessments to inform such activities.  According to the National Strategy for Homeland Security of 2007, the  assessment and management of risk underlies all homeland security  activities, including decisions about when, where, and how to invest in  resources\u2014including planning and capabilities\u2014that eliminate, control, or  mitigate risks. The TRAs and MTAs\u2014the department\u2019s most CBRN- specific risk assessments\u2014were used to inform to varying extents 9 of 12  response plans and 6 of 7 capabilities we analyzed, and how the risk  assessments were used to inform these plans and capabilities varied.  DHS officials told us that while DHS policy calls for the use of risk  information to inform the department\u2019s activities, no DHS guidance  specifically requires DHS officials to use the TRAs and MTAs for CBRN  planning and capability investments or explains how officials should use  the risk assessments to inform their decision making. As a result, the  CBRN risk assessments were used to varying extents and in varying  ways by DHS components for the plans and capabilities we analyzed.  DHS officials said that they considered the risk assessments but chose  not to use them to inform one of the plans and one of the capabilities we  reviewed because they were not useful for the plan or the capability. In  addition, the risk assessments were not considered at all for two of the  plans we reviewed.", "Since at least 2007, DHS has emphasized the need to incorporate risk  information derived from risk assessments into departmental activities,  and since 2009 DHS has issued a range of guidance\u2014including an  interim framework, a policy memo, a management directive, and a  doctrine\u2014on the use of such risk information. Specifically, DHS\u2019s Interim  Integrated Risk Management Framework of January 2009 identified risk  assessments as a fundamental information source for risk-informed  decision making and noted that the BTRA and CTRA are examples of risk  assessments produced by the department that can be used to inform risk  management efforts. In May 2010, the Secretary of Homeland Security  issued a policy memo that requires, among other things, the use of risk  assessments to inform decision making and the establishment of  mechanisms for sharing risk assessments with relevant stakeholders. In  March 2011, as called for in the Secretary\u2019s memo, DHS issued a  management directive on integrated risk management at the  department. This management directive, among other things, tasks the  Director of the Office of Risk Management and Analysis (RMA) within  DHS\u2019s NPPD with establishing a system to facilitate the sharing of risk  analysis and data across the department. Further, in April 2011, DHS  issued its doctrine for risk management\u2014titled Risk Management  Fundamentals\u2014the first in a series of publications that RMA plans to  issue to provide a structured approach for the distribution and  employment of risk information and analysis efforts across the  department.", "DHS\u2019s existing guidance on risk management generally identifies the  importance of using risk assessments to inform departmental decision  making, but it does not specifically address when and how particular risk  assessments\u2014including the TRAs and MTAs\u2014should be considered for  use by departmental entities for planning and capability investment  purposes. DHS officials stated that more specific guidance has not been  developed by the department or its components and agencies because  they were not required to do so. However, Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government state that officials should take actions, such  as establishing written procedures, to help ensure that management\u2019s  directives are carried out.Management Framework of January 2009 stated that DHS must establish  processes that make risk information available among the department  and its components and agencies when and where it is needed, noting  that the ability to receive and provide meaningful and usable risk  information in a timely manner requires well coordinated and established  processes.", "In addition, DHS\u2019s Interim Integrated Risk  While DHS has issued guidance that generally states that risk  assessments should be used to inform departmental activities, DHS could  better help to ensure that its relevant CBRN-specific risk assessments\u2014 the TRAs and MTAs\u2014are considered for use in informing CBRN-specific  planning and capability investments if more specific guidance requiring  such consideration is established. DHS officials also stated that  establishing written procedures for such consideration could better help to  ensure that officials responsible for CBRN response planning and  capability investment decision making consider the CBRN risk  assessments as a means to obtain current risk information for specific  CBRN threat agents. This information could be used to inform the  planning assumptions that CBRN response plans are designed to  address, as well as the requirements development process for CBRN  capabilities. In addition, DHS officials noted that the lack of written  procedures requiring DHS officials to consider using the TRAs and MTAs  to inform DHS\u2019s CBRN plans and capabilities could negatively affect the  likelihood that future DHS officials consider using the risk assessments  when planning and making investment decisions. By establishing more  specific guidance that details when and how DHS components should  consider using the TRAs and MTAs to inform CBRN plans and  capabilities, DHS would be better positioned to ensure that officials  consider and, as appropriate, incorporate the department\u2019s most detailed  CBRN-specific risk information. As a result, DHS would be better  positioned to ensure that its CBRN response plans and capabilities align  with the assumptions and results contained within the TRAs and MTAs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The anthrax attacks of 2001 raised concerns that the United States is  vulnerable to terrorist attacks using CBRN agents. Since 2001, DHS has  developed a range of CBRN risk assessments, response plans, and  related capabilities to prepare for such attacks. DHS has spent at least  $70 million developing these risk assessments. Using its CBRN risk  assessments to help inform CBRN response planning and capability  investments is consistent with DHS policy and could help to better ensure  that relevant information contained in the risk assessments is used to  inform such plans and capabilities. Further, given that there are  thousands of CBRN agents that could potentially pose a risk to the nation  in an era of declining federal budgets and constrained resources, the  federal government must ensure that it is focusing its limited resources on  preparing to respond to the highest risk agents. Without procedures for  using the risk assessments to inform capability investment decision  making, use of the assessments for such decisions may continue to vary  or not occur at all.
