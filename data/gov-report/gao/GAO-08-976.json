According to VHA officials, miscellaneous obligations were used to facilitate payment for goods and services when the quantities and delivery dates are not known. According to VHA data, almost $3.8 billion (55.1 percent) of VHA's miscellaneous obligations was for fee-based medical services for veterans and another $1.4 billion (20.4 percent) was for drugs and medicines. The remainder funded, among other things, state homes for the care of disabled veterans, transportation of veterans to and from medical centers for treatment, and logistical support and facility maintenance for VHA medical centers nationwide. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that agency management is responsible for developing detailed policies and procedures for internal control suitable for their agency's operations. However, VA policies and procedures were not designed to provide adequate controls over the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations with respect to oversight by contracting officials, segregation of duties, and supporting documentation for the obligation of funds. Collectively, these control design flaws increase the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse (including employees converting government assets to their own use without detection). These control design flaws were confirmed in our case studies at VHA Medical centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Kansas City, Missouri. In May 2008, VHA issued revised guidance on required procedures for authorizing and using miscellaneous obligations. GAO reviewed the revised guidance and found that while it offered some improvement, it did not fully address the specific control design flaws GAO identified. Furthermore, according to VA officials, VA's policies governing miscellaneous obligations have not been subject to legal review by VA's Office of General Counsel. Such a review is essential to ensure that policies and procedures comply with applicable federal appropriations law and internal control standards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing a  variety of services to veterans, including medical care, disability  compensation, and vocational rehabilitation. The Veterans Health  Administration (VHA), a component of VA, manages one of the largest  health care systems in the United States, providing health care to veterans  throughout the country. VHA officials briefed your Subcommittee staff in  September 2007 about various financial reporting weaknesses in the  agency and initiatives under way to address them. In the briefing, VHA  officials disclosed that $4.8 billion (56 percent) of the reported $8.6 billion  in procurements through the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 had been  done using funds categorized as \u201cmiscellaneous obligations.\u201d VHA officials  said that they have been using miscellaneous obligations for over 60 years  to record estimates of obligations to be incurred at a later time.  According to VA policy, miscellaneous obligations can be used to record  estimated obligations to facilitate the procurement of a variety of goods  and services, including fee-based medical and nursing services and  beneficiary travel.  In addition, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG)  issued a report in May 2007 on the alleged mismanagement of funds at the  VA Boston Healthcare System. According to OIG officials, they obtained  documents showing that a miscellaneous obligation for $200,000 was  requested, approved, and obligated by the same fiscal official, calling into  question the adequacy of the segregation of duty controls over  miscellaneous obligations. In light of these concerns, you requested that  we review whether the design of VHA\u2019s internal controls over the use of  miscellaneous obligations was adequate for fiscal year 2007.", "In response to your request, we initiated a review to determine (1) how  VHA used miscellaneous obligations during fiscal year 2007, and   (2) whether VA\u2019s policies and procedures are designed to provide  adequate controls over the authorization and use of miscellaneous  obligations. Our review focused on the approximately $6.9 billion of  miscellaneous obligations that VHA made during fiscal year 2007, the most  complete fiscal year for which data were available when we began our  review. We discussed our preliminary findings at a hearing before the  Subcommittee on July 31, 2008.", "To determine the purposes for which VHA used miscellaneous obligations  during fiscal year 2007, we obtained and analyzed a copy of VHA\u2019s  Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting and  Procurement (IFCAP) database of miscellaneous obligations. VA\u2019s Senior  Procurement Executive stated that the IFCAP database provided the best  available data on VHA miscellaneous obligations created in fiscal year  2007. We determined that the IFCAP data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report based on (1) testing various required data  elements, (2) performing walkthroughs of the system, and (3) tracing  selected transactions from source documents to the database. We could  not reconcile IFCAP miscellaneous obligations to VA\u2019s Financial  Management System (FMS)\u2014the VA accounting system of record used to  generate VA financial statements and other reports\u2014because FMS does  not identify the method used to obligate funds for transactions (e.g.,  miscellaneous obligations, purchase card, purchase order).", "To determine whether VA\u2019s policies and procedures are designed to  provide adequate controls over the use of miscellaneous obligations, we  compared VA policies and procedures governing the use of miscellaneous  obligations with federal appropriations law and internal control standards,  interviewed VHA officials in Denver, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., and  conducted case studies at VHA medical centers in Cheyenne, Wyoming;  Kansas City, Missouri; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As part of the case  studies, we interviewed VHA financial management and procurement  officials, and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of miscellaneous  obligations to provide more detailed data on the extent and nature of any  control design deficiencies. We did not review VHA\u2019s procurement or  service authorization processes. Appendix I contains a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology. We conducted our audit work  from November 2007 through July 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

The policy states that miscellaneous  obligations should be used as obligation control documents when a formal  purchase order or authorization is not required, and when necessary to  record estimated obligations to be incurred by the subsequent issue of  purchase orders. The policy also states that the use of miscellaneous  obligations should be kept to an absolute minimum, consistent with sound  financial management policies on the control of funds, and should only be  used in cases where there was a bona fide need for the goods and services  being procured.", "In September 2006, VA policy for miscellaneous obligations was revised in  an attempt to minimize the use of miscellaneous obligations as an  obligation control document.  The revision states that miscellaneous  obligations should not be used as obligation control documents unless the  head contracting official for the station has determined that a purchase  order or contract will not be required. However, the policy provides that  fiscal staff can use miscellaneous obligations as a tracking mechanism for  obligations of variable quantity contracts, as well as for public utilities.

A miscellaneous obligation can be created for an estimated  amount and then modified as specific quantities are needed or specific  delivery dates are set. When a purchase order is created, however, the  obligated amount cannot be changed without a modification of the  purchase order. According to VHA officials, the need to prepare numerous  modifications to purchase orders could place an undue burden on the  limited contracting personnel available at individual centers and could  also require additional work on the part of fiscal services personnel.", "VHA officials stated that the use of miscellaneous obligations can simplify  the procurement process when no preexisting contract or purchase order  exists. For example, providing medical care on a fee-basis to veterans  outside of VHA medical centers may involve the services of thousands of  private physicians nationwide. Attempting to negotiate a separate  agreement or contract with each of these individuals would be a difficult  task for VHA\u2019s contracting staff. Under the policies and procedures in  place during fiscal year 2007, VHA centers could use miscellaneous  obligations as umbrella authorizations for fee-based medical services  performed by a number of different physicians. In effect, in cases for  which there is no preexisting contract, the miscellaneous obligation form  becomes the record of an obligation. However, use of miscellaneous  obligations may also increase the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse.  Consequently, mitigating controls must be designed to help compensate  for the lack of a negotiated contract.  Absent contractual terms, one risk  area is the authorized fee schedule for the medical services being  provided. In this case, federal regulations call for payments to non-VA  physicians for services associated with outpatient and inpatient care  provided at non-VA facilities to be the lesser of the amount billed or the  amount calculated using the formula developed by the Department of  Health and Human Services under Medicare\u2019s participating physician fee  schedule for the period in which the service is provided.  However, we  did not verify that VHA officials were properly following the fee schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficiencies in Design of Controls over Miscellaneous Obligations Increase the Risk of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["VA policies and procedures were not designed to provide adequate  controls over the use of miscellaneous obligations. According to our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, agency  management is responsible for developing detailed policies and  procedures for internal control suitable for their agency\u2019s operations and  ensuring that they provide for adequate monitoring by management,  segregation of duties, and supporting documentation for the need to  acquire specific goods in the quantities purchased. We identified control  design flaws in each of these oversight areas, and we confirmed that these  weaknesses existed at the three locations where we conducted case  studies. Collectively, these control design flaws increase the risk of fraud,  waste, and abuse (including employees converting government assets to  their own use without detection). New guidance for the use of  miscellaneous obligations was released in January 2008 and finalized in  May 2008. We reviewed the new guidance and found that while it offered  some improvement, it did not fully address the specific control design  flaws we identified. Furthermore, VA officials told us that this guidance  was not subject to any legal review. Such an analysis is essential to help  ensure that the design of policies and procedures comply with all  applicable federal appropriations law and internal control standards.", "We reviewed 42 miscellaneous obligations at the three case study  locations and developed illustrative, more detailed information on the  extent and nature of these control design flaws.

Furthermore, VA  policy required review of miscellaneous obligations by contracting  officials to help ensure proper use in accordance with federal acquisition  regulations, but did not address the intended extent and nature of these  reviews or how the reviews should be documented. Contracting officials  were unable to electronically document their review of miscellaneous  obligations and no manual documentation procedures had been  developed. Our review of 42 miscellaneous obligations prepared at three  VHA stations showed that contracting officers were at times familiar with  specific miscellaneous obligations at their facilities, but that they had no  documented approvals available for review. Furthermore, none of the  three sites we visited had procedures in place to document review of the  miscellaneous obligations by the appropriate contracting authorities.", "Effective oversight and review by trained, qualified officials is a key factor  in identifying a potential risk for fraud, waste, or abuse. Without control  procedures to help ensure that contracting personnel review and approve  miscellaneous obligations prior to their creation, VHA is at risk that  procurements will not have safeguards established through a contract  approach. For example, in our case study at the VA Pittsburgh Medical  Center, we found 12 miscellaneous obligations, totaling about $673,000,  used to pay for laboratory services provided by the University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The Chief of Acquisition and Materiel  Management for the VA Pittsburgh Medical Center stated that she was not  aware of the UPMC\u2019s laboratory testing service procurements and would  review these testing services to determine whether a contract should be  established for these procurements.  Subsequently, she stated that VISN 4,  which includes the VA Pittsburgh Medical Center, was going to revise  procedures to procure laboratory testing services through purchase orders  backed by reviewed and competitively awarded contracts, instead of  funding them through miscellaneous obligations.", "Another Pittsburgh miscellaneous obligation for about $141,000 was used  to fund the procurement of livers for transplant patients. Local officials  said that there was a national contract for the services, and that livers  were provided at a standardized price of $21,800. However, officials could  not provide us with a copy of the contract, nor documentation of the  standardized pricing schedule.  Therefore, we could not confirm that VHA  was properly billed for these services or that the procurement was  properly authorized.", "Furthermore, in the absence of review by contracting officials, controls  were not designed to prevent miscellaneous obligations from being used  for unauthorized purposes, or for assets that could be readily converted to  personal use. Our analysis of the IFCAP database for fiscal year 2007  identified 145 miscellaneous obligations for over $30.2 million that  appeared to be used in the procurement of such items as passenger  vehicles; furniture and fixtures; office equipment; and medical, dental, and  scientific equipment. Although VA\u2019s miscellaneous obligation policy did  not address this issue, VA officials stated that acquisition of such assets  should be done by contracting officials and not through miscellaneous  obligations. Without adequate controls to review miscellaneous  obligations and prevent them from being used for the acquisition of such  assets, it is possible that VHA may be exposing the agency to unnecessary  risks by using miscellaneous obligations to fund the acquisitions of goods  or services that should have been obtained under contract with  conventional controls built in."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interim Guidance Does Not Address All Control Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["In January 2008, VHA issued interim guidance effective for all  miscellaneous obligations created after January 30, 2008, concerning  required procedures for using miscellaneous obligations.  The guidance  provides that prior to creating a miscellaneous obligation, fiscal service  staff are required to check with the contracting activity to ensure that a  valid contract is associated with the miscellaneous obligation, except in  specific, itemized cases. Under this guidance, the using service is to have  the contracting activity determine (1) if a valid procurement authority  exists, (2) if a procurement needs to be initiated, and (3) the appropriate  method of obligation. Also, this guidance requires that a copy of the head  contracting official\u2019s approval be kept with a copy of the miscellaneous  obligation for future audit purposes. In addition, the guidance provides  that the fiscal service may not create a miscellaneous obligation without  appropriate information recorded in the purpose, vendor, and contract  number fields on the document.

According to VA officials, these policies have  not been subject to any legal review, which is essential in ensuring that the  policies and procedures comply with federal funds control laws and  regulations and any other relevant VA policies or procedures dealing with  budgetary or procurement matters. For example, such a review would  help ensure that the guidance adequately addresses Federal Acquisition  Regulation, requiring that no contract shall be entered into unless the  contracting officer ensures that all requirements of law, executive orders,  regulations, and all other applicable procedures, including clearances and  approvals, have been met. In addition, a legal review could help to ensure  that this guidance (1) provides that all legal obligations of VA are  supported by adequate documentation to meet the requirements of the  recording statute 31 U.S.C. \u00a71501(a) and (2) prevents any individual from  committing the government for purchases of supplies, equipment, or  services without being delegated contracting authority as a contracting  officer, purchase card holder, or a designated representative of a  contracting officer.

The stations in  Kansas City and Pittsburgh were selected because they had a high volume  of miscellaneous obligation activity, and they were located in different  regions of the country. We conducted field work at the Cheyenne,  Wyoming, station during the design phase of our review to better  understand the extent and nature of miscellaneous obligation control  design deficiencies at a small medical center. Inclusion of the Cheyenne  facility in our review increased the geographic diversity of our analysis  and allowed us to compare the extent and nature of miscellaneous  obligation design deficiencies at medical centers in the eastern,  midwestern, and western portions of the United States.", "During the case studies, we met with senior medical center administrative,  procurement, and financial management officials to discuss how VA  policies and procedures were designed with regard to specific obligations,  and assess the control environment design for using miscellaneous  obligations at the local level. We discussed how miscellaneous obligations  were used as part of the procurement process and the effect of new VHA  guidance on medical center operations. We also reviewed the design of  local policies and procedures for executing miscellaneous obligations and  conducted walkthroughs of the processes.", "To provide more detailed information on the extent and nature of the  control design deficiencies we found at our case study locations, we  identified a nongeneralizable sample of obligations for further review at  each site. Through data mining techniques, we identified a total of 42  miscellaneous obligations for more detailed examination at our case study  sites: 11 from Cheyenne, 17 from Kansas City, and 14 from Pittsburgh. We  based our selection on the nature, dollar amount, date, and other  identifying characteristics of the obligations.

We noted those instances  where control design deficiencies permitted one official to perform  multiple functions.", "With respect to control design deficiencies relating to the supporting  documentation for the miscellaneous obligations, we reviewed the  purpose, vendor, and contract number fields for each obligation. For the  purpose field, we assessed whether the required description was adequate  to determine the nature, timing, and extent of the goods or services being  procured and whether controls provided for an adequate explanation for  any estimated miscellaneous obligation amounts. For the vendor and  contract number fields, we assessed whether controls were designed to  ensure entered information was complete, and we identified those  instances where control deficiencies permitted fields to be left blank.", "Because of time limitations, we did not review VHA\u2019s procurement or  service authorization processes. In addition, in our case study approach,  we were unable to analyze a sufficient number of obligations to allow us to  generalize our conclusions to the sites visited, nor to the universe of VHA  medical centers. The 42 obligations represented a total of approximately  $36.0 million; however, the results cannot be projected to the overall  population of miscellaneous obligations in fiscal year 2007.

We did not  reconcile the IFCAP miscellaneous obligations reported to us to FMS\u2014the  VA system of record\u2014and published VA financial statements because FMS  does not identify the procurement method used for transactions (i.e.,  miscellaneous obligations, purchase card, purchase order).
