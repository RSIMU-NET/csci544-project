HUD has three major programs: the Housing Choice Voucher (voucher) and public housing programs, administered by public housing agencies; and project-based Section 8, administered by private property owners. As they are in every year, some payments were too high or too low, for several reasons. To assess the magnitude and reasons for these errors, HUD established the Rental Housing Integrity Improvement Project (RHIIP). In response to a congressional request, GAO examined the sources and magnitude of improper rent subsidy payments HUD has identified and the steps HUD is taking to address them, including efforts to simplify the process of determining rent subsidies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["HUD has identified three sources of errors contributing to improper rent subsidy payments: (1) incorrect subsidy determinations by program administrators, (2) unreported tenant income, and (3) incorrect billing. HUD has attempted to estimate the amounts of improper subsidies attributable to each source but has developed reliable estimates for only the first--and likely largest--source. HUD paid an estimated $1.4 billion in gross improper subsidies (consisting of $896 million in overpayments and $519 million in underpayments) in fiscal year 2003 as a result of program administrator errors--a 39 percent decline from HUD's fiscal year 2000 (baseline) estimate. GAO estimates that the amount of net overpayments could have subsidized another 56,000 households with vouchers in 2003. HUD has made several efforts under RHIIP to address improper rent subsidies for its public housing and voucher programs. Rental Integrity Monitoring (RIM) reviews by HUD's field offices--on-site assessments of public housing agencies' compliance with policies for determining rent subsidies--are a key part of the initiative. However, GAO found that resource constraints and a lack of clear guidance from HUD headquarters hampered the reviews and that the field offices did not collect complete and consistent data, limiting HUD's ability to analyze and make use of the results. HUD has not incorporated RIM reviews into its routine oversight activities. HUD expects that a second effort, a Web-based tenant income verification system, will avoid an estimated $6 billion in improper subsidies over 10 years, but the system is not yet fully implemented. HUD has undertaken RHIIP efforts for its project-based Section 8 programs but faces several challenges. HUD has improved its policies and guidance for property owners. The agency also plans to give owners access to the Web-based income verification system by the end of 2006. HUD plans to rely more extensively on contractors to monitor property owners' compliance with its policies for determining subsidies. According to HUD, the complexity of the existing policies contributes to the difficulties program administrators have in determining rent subsidies correctly. For example, program administrators must assess tenants' eligibility for 44 different income exclusions and deductions. However, simplification will likely require statutory changes by Congress and affect the rental payments of many tenants. HUD is considering various approaches to simplifying policies for determining rent subsidies but has not conducted a formal study to inform policymakers on this issue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we evaluate issues related to  improper rent subsidy payments in the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) housing assistance programs.

HUD provides rental assistance  through three major programs: Housing Choice Vouchers (vouchers),  public housing, and several project-based Section 8 programs. These  programs reduce tenants\u2019 rental payments by providing subsidies to  owners of private properties, the public housing agencies (PHA)  responsible for government-owned developments, or both. Because these  subsidies involve complicated calculations and program rules, the process  of determining them is prone to errors. In response to growing concerns  about improper rental assistance payments, in fiscal year 2001 HUD  established the Rental Housing Integrity Improvement Project (RHIIP),  which is designed to address the causes of these errors and ensure that  only eligible people receive subsidies.", "This report discusses (1) the sources and magnitude of improper payments  that HUD has identified, (2) the actions HUD is taking under RHIIP to  reduce improper payments in the voucher and public housing programs  and the status of these initiatives, (3) the actions HUD is taking under  RHIIP to reduce improper payments in its project-based programs and the  status of these initiatives, and (4) the status and potential impact of HUD\u2019s  efforts to reduce the risk of improper payments by simplifying the subsidy  determination process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Rental Assistance Programs Vary in Size and Are Administered Differently", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s voucher, public housing, and project-based assistance programs  share the common mission of making housing affordable to low-income  households. The subsidies these programs provide are not an entitlement.  Typically, the number of low-income households eligible for assistance  exceeds the number of subsidized units and vouchers that is available.  Specifically, HUD estimated that in 1999 about a quarter of all households  eligible for housing assistance received it. HUD\u2019s programs are  administered differently and vary in the number of households they assist  and the amount of funding they receive.", "The voucher program, which local PHAs administer on HUD\u2019s behalf, is  HUD\u2019s largest rental assistance program. The program, authorized under  Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, provides  housing vouchers that eligible individuals and families can use to rent  houses or apartments in the private housing market from property owners  participating in the program. Voucher holders are responsible for finding  suitable housing, which must meet HUD\u2019s housing quality standards. In  fiscal year 2003, the program assisted about 2 million households (42  percent of all households receiving HUD housing assistance) and had  outlays of $13.4 billion (47 percent of HUD\u2019s total rental assistance  outlays). In general, only households with very low incomes\u2014those with  incomes that are less than or equal to 50 percent of area median income  (AMI)\u2014are eligible for vouchers. In addition, the legislation requires that at  least 75 percent of new participants in the voucher program have extremely  low incomes\u2014that is, their incomes must be at or below 30 percent of  AMI. Voucher holders generally pay 30 percent of their adjusted monthly  income toward rent, and the PHA receives HUD subsidies to pay the  remainder of the rent to the property owners. The subsidies in the voucher  program are tenant based\u2014that is, they are tied to the household rather  than to the rental unit. The approximately 2,500 PHAs that administer the  voucher program are responsible for ensuring that tenants meet program  eligibility requirements and that tenant subsidies are calculated properly.  PHAs are also required to develop written policies and procedures to  administer the program according to HUD regulations.", "Under the public housing program authorized by United States Housing Act  of 1937, as amended, HUD subsidized the development, operation, and  modernization of government-owned properties, which are currently  managed by some 3,300 PHAs. In fiscal year 2003, HUD\u2019s public housing  program assisted 1.2 million households (25 percent of households  receiving housing assistance) and had outlays of $7.1 billion (25 percent of  HUD\u2019s total rental assistance outlays). To be eligible for public housing, a  household must be low income\u2014that is, have an income that is less than or  equal to 80 percent of AMI\u2014and the legislation stipulates that at least 40  percent of new residents have extremely low incomes\u2014less than or equal  to 30 percent of AMI. As in the voucher program, public housing tenants  generally pay 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income on rent. HUD  pays subsidies to the PHAs for the remainder to cover the difference  between the PHAs\u2019 operating costs and rental receipts. In contrast to the  voucher program, the subsidies in the public housing program are project  based\u2014that is, they are tied to the unit, and tenants receive assistance only  when they live in units eligible for subsidies. PHAs are responsible for  ensuring that tenants are eligible for public housing, that tenant subsidies  are calculated properly, and that the PHAs\u2019 policies and procedures  conform to HUD\u2019s regulations.", "Under a variety of project-based Section 8 programs authorized by the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, HUD has  subsidized rents with multiyear rental assistance payments, which have  often been combined with construction subsidies from other HUD  programs. These programs included the New Construction, Substantial  Rehabilitation, Loan Management Set-Aside, Property Disposition, and  Moderate Rehabilitation programs. Before project-based Section 8  programs, HUD had provided rental assistance through Rent Supplement  and Section 236 Rental Assistance Payment programs. For ease of  presentation, this report refers to all of these rental assistance programs as  project-based Section 8. Property owners and managers for about 22,000  subsidized properties currently participate in these programs. In fiscal year  2003, HUD\u2019s project-based programs assisted 1.6 million households (33  percent of all households receiving assistance from HUD) and had outlays  of $7.7 billion (27 percent of HUD\u2019s total rental assistance outlays). As in  HUD\u2019s other rental assistance programs, households receiving project- based Section 8 assistance generally pay 30 percent of their adjusted  income toward rent and HUD pays a subsidy\u2014in this case to property  owners and managers\u2014for the remainder of the rent. In general, only  households with low incomes are eligible for HUD project-based Section 8  assistance, and at least 40 percent of new residents must have extremely  low incomes. Private property owners and managers have similar  requirements to PHAs for administering the project-based Section 8  program\u2014they must ensure that tenants meet program eligibility  requirements and that tenant subsidies are calculated correctly.

Laws and HUD regulations provide for 44  different types of income exclusions and deductions. Of these, HUD\u2019s  regulations cite 20 income sources, such as income from minors, student  financial aid, and qualifying employment training programs, which are  excluded when determining households\u2019 eligibility to receive assistance  and calculating tenants\u2019 rent. Nineteen other income sources qualify as  exclusions under various statutes. For example, Earned Income Tax Credit  refund payments received on or after January 1, 1991, are excluded, as is  income from participating in AmeriCorps. A complete list and descriptions  of these exclusions appear in appendix II.", "In addition to these 39 income exclusions, program administrators must  also apply five income deductions, which reduce the amount of income  that can be considered in calculating tenants\u2019 rent. Legislation specifies  the following five deductions from annual income:  a standard amount ($480) for each dependent;  a standard amount ($400) for elderly or disabled family members;  unreimbursed child care expenses that are necessary for a family  member to remain employed;  the sum of the following to the extent that it exceeds 3 percent of annual   certain unreimbursed medical expenses for elderly or disabled family   certain unreimbursed attendant care and auxiliary apparatus  expenses necessary for a disabled family member to be employed;  and  other deductions from annual income as determined by program  administrator.", "Once program administrators have collected information from tenants on  income and applicable exclusions and deductions, HUD policy requires  that program administrators independently verify this information (third- party verification). To obtain third-party verification, program  administrators must directly contact employers, welfare offices, health  care providers, and others to ensure that the information tenants have  reported is accurate and complete. However, third-party verification on its  own may not identify all income not reported (intentionally or otherwise)  by tenants. The program administrator must maintain all verified  information in the tenant\u2019s file.", "After verifying tenants\u2019 income information, program administrators must  compute the amounts tenants pay in rent. HUD regulations define these  payments as the highest of the following amounts: (1) 30 percent of a  family\u2019s monthly adjusted income\u2014that is monthly income after  exclusions or deductions; (2) 10 percent of the family\u2019s gross monthly  income\u2014that is, monthly income before exclusions or deductions; or (3)  the applicable minimum monthly rent, which is typically between $0 and  $50. Generally, the amount paid by low- and very-low- income tenants is  not enough to cover the entire rent for a unit or, for public housing, to  cover operating costs. As a result, for vouchers and project-based Section  8, HUD generally covers the difference between the unit\u2019s rent and the  tenant\u2019s rental payment in the form of a housing assistance payment. For  public housing, HUD pays the PHA an operating subsidy to cover the  difference between the PHA\u2019s operating costs and rental receipts.

We tested the reliability of both data files and found them  reliable for the purposes of this report. We estimated the total amount of  improper rent subsidies for all three housing programs. Our estimated  totals generally agreed with those in HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2003 and 2004  Performance and Accountability Report. We also estimated improper rent  subsidies per household. To illustrate the impact of improper rent  subsidies, we estimated the number of households that could have received  assistance under the voucher programs by dividing the estimated total net  improper rent subsidy overpayments (i.e., total estimated subsidy  overpayments minus total estimate subsidy underpayments) by the average  cost of a voucher (including administrative costs) in fiscal year 2003.

Program administrator errors are the broadest because,  as figure 2 shows, this type of error can affect nearly all the critical  dimensions of the process for determining rent subsidies. Program  administrators are responsible for collecting information on household  income, expenses, and composition to determine tenants\u2019 eligibility to  receive housing assistance and the size of the subsidies. In performing their  work, program administrators may incorrectly determine rent subsidies by,  for example, making calculation and transcription errors or misapplying  allowed income exclusions and deductions required by HUD policies.", "Errors that result from unreported tenant income occur when tenants do  not report an income source (either for themselves or another household  member) to program administrators. According to HUD, these errors do  not include cases in which the tenants reported all sources of income but  not the correct amounts. HUD classifies these discrepancies as program  administrator errors because program administrators are required to verify  tenants\u2019 income amounts through third parties, such as employers and  public assistance agencies. Unreported income errors generally occur early  in the process for determining rent subsidies, when the tenant first submits  income information to program administrators (fig. 2). Although some  tenants may not disclose all income sources in order to qualify for  assistance and to increase the rent subsidies they receive, tenants may also  fail to report income sources unintentionally if program administrators  provide unclear instructions.", "Finally, billing errors occur at the very end of the process for determining  rent subsidies (fig. 2). The procedures used by program administrators to  bill HUD for subsidy payments vary for each of the three rental assistance  programs, and as a result the specific types of mistakes that lead to billing  errors can also vary. However, in general, billing errors arise when  discrepancies exist between the amount of a rent subsidy determined by  the program administrator and the amount that is actually billed to and  paid by HUD. Billing errors can also include accounting discrepancies  between amounts paid by HUD and a property\u2019s bank statements and  accounting records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating Improper Rent Subsidies Resulting from Each Source of Error Is an Important Effort under RHIIP", "paragraphs": ["As part of its error measurement effort under RHIIP, HUD planned to  estimate improper rent subsidies attributable to each source of error.  According to HUD, this effort was to allow the department to assess the  magnitude of improper rent subsidies and the progress made in meeting  RHIIP\u2019s goal of reducing improper subsidies. To develop these estimates,  HUD conducted separate studies on improper rent subsidies attributable to  each source of error for fiscal years 2000 and 2003. (Information on the  methodology and reliability of these studies is discussed later in this  chapter.) About two years after HUD began estimating improper rent  subsidies, Congress passed the Improper Payments Information Act of  2002, which mandated that federal agencies submit annual estimates of  improper payments for at-risk programs. According to HUD, the  department plans to continue updating its estimates in subsequent years in  order to comply with the requirements of the act. HUD has reported its  estimates in its annual audited financial statements and performance and  accountability reports.", "There are a number of ways to describe the size and magnitude of improper  rent subsidies. One way is simply the dollar difference between the actual  rent subsidy HUD paid and the \u201ccorrect\u201d rent subsidy\u2014that is, the amount  of subsidy that would have been paid on behalf of the tenant if no errors  had occurred. The dollar amount erroneously paid can be either positive or  negative because errors can reflect subsidy overpayments or  underpayments. The gross dollar error or gross improper payment  reflects the sum of the absolute value of the subsidy overpayments and  underpayments\u2014that is, the total of all erroneously paid funds.

The major industry groups we met with were also supportive of  simplification.", "The October 2004 meeting concluded with HUD considering performing  more extensive analysis of the various approaches to simplifying its  policies for determining rent subsidies. However, HUD has not determined  when it will begin performing this analysis. Although prior to this meeting  HUD staff had conducted preliminary internal analyses of the impact of  certain simplification approaches on tenant rental payments and program  costs, as of December 2004, HUD has not conducted a formal study on the  possible impact of policy changes for consideration by policymakers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Current Policies for Determining Rent Subsidies Are Complex", "paragraphs": ["A 2001 HUD study characterized HUD\u2019s policies for determining rent  subsidies as \u201cdetailed, complex, sometimes ambiguous, and subject to  relatively frequent legislative changes.\u201d HUD field offices, program  administrators, and industry groups we interviewed frequently cited the  complexity of these policies as a concern and identified it as a major  obstacle in reducing improper rent subsidies. For example, HUD\u2019s current  policies include 44 income exclusions and deductions that program  administrators must consider when determining rent subsidies and tenants\u2019  rental payments. The purpose of some of these income exclusions and  deductions is to provide additional relief to certain tenants, such as elderly  and disabled households with large medical expenses, by reducing the  amount they contribute toward rent. Other income exclusions exist to  counteract potential work disincentives\u2014for example, increasing income  resulting in higher tenant rental payments\u2014in housing assistance  programs.", "As an example, some HUD field office staff and program administrators we  spoke with cited the earned income disallowance as a complex income  exclusion. The earned income disallowance was initially established in  1990 by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L.  No. 101-625) and was revised in 1998 by the Quality Housing and Work  Responsibility Act (Pub. L. No. 105-276). The disallowance policy provides  special treatment to families whose earned income increases as a result of  (1) employment of a family member who was previously unemployed for  one or more years or (2) participation of a family member in a family self- sufficiency or other job training program. Families that qualify under these  provisions are not subject to increases in their rental payments (that  usually occur if their incomes grow for other reasons) for a 12-month  period known as the \u201cfull exclusion period.\u201d The rent may be increased  during the following 12-month period, called the \u201cphase-in period,\u201d but the  increase may not be greater than 50 percent of the amount of the full rent  increase that would occur otherwise. After completion of both the full  exclusion and phase-in periods, tenant rent increases by the full amount.  However, low-income tenants often have jobs with little security\u2014that is,  they move in and out of employment and training programs and their  income may vary considerably from job to job. To account for this, HUD  developed additional administrative guidelines. For instance, during the  full exclusion and phase-in periods, the months for which a family can  claim the disallowance do not need to be consecutive. Consequently, a  household member can become unemployed and stop claiming the  disallowance and then become reemployed in a later month and begin  claiming the disallowance again. However, keeping track of when tenants  are employed and the amount by which the income increased is difficult  and adds a significant burden on program administrators.", "The process for determining rent subsidies is further complicated by the  difficulty some program administrator staff may have in understanding and  implementing HUD\u2019s program requirements. According to multiple field  office staff, program administrators, and industry groups we met with,  program administrator staff responsible for calculating rent subsidies are  often poorly paid, have large caseloads, and have limited education. These  factors can contribute to misapplication of program policies that result in  errors in subsidy calculations. In addition, these same groups commented  that these types of positions have high turnover, and as a result it is difficult  for program administrators to retain knowledgeable and experienced staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Simplifying the Process for Determining Rent Subsidies Could Affect Tenants and Pose Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["As noted previously, HUD is considering various approaches for statutory,  regulatory, and administrative streamlining and simplification of its subsidy  determination policies. Regardless of the approach HUD ultimately adopts,  a major concern is the effect that policy simplification will have on tenant  rental payments. It is possible that tenants\u2019 rental payments could decrease  under certain simplification approaches. However, tenants could also see  rent increases if, all other things being equal, the income deductions and  exclusions that currently provide additional rent relief to them are  eliminated. In addition, simplification of HUD\u2019s policies for determining  rent subsidies could be difficult to implement and could create confusion  among program administrators and tenants in the short-term."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD is Considering Three Basic Approaches to Simplifying Policies", "paragraphs": ["HUD is currently considering three basic approaches to simplifying its  subsidy determination policies: (1) income-based rents, (2) tiered flat rents,  and (3) mixed approaches. Descriptions of these three approaches follow:  Under an income-based approach, the tenant rental payment is set at a  certain percentage of the tenant\u2019s income. The rent subsidy covers the  difference between the contract rent for the unit (or the operating cost  for a public housing unit) and the amount that the tenant pays. A  simplified income-based approach could involve a limited number of  exclusions or deductions or none at all. For example, one approach  could involve tenants paying 30 percent of their gross income in rent  with qualifying tenants receiving standard deductions for special needs.  A different approach HUD has considered would allow elderly, disabled,  and working families to pay 27 percent of their gross income in rent  while all others pay 30 percent. No other deductions or exclusions  would be used in determining the subsidy amount under this approach.", "Under a tiered flat rent system, tenant rents would be calculated for  several income bands\u2014for example, low, very low, and extremely low  income\u2014and tenants would not see their rents adjusted as their  incomes changed provided that their incomes remain within the same  tier. This option is somewhat similar to that used at properties  developed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credit assistance. Under the  tax credit program, property owners reserve some of their units for  tenants at or below certain income limits\u2014either 50 or 60 percent of the  area\u2019s median gross income. The owners must restrict tenant rents in  these units to 30 percent of the income limit, adjusted for the number of  bedrooms.", "Under a mixed approach, HUD would give program administrators  various rent structures to choose from, including income-based rents  and tiered flat rents. This approach would give program administrators  the flexibility to choose the method that best fits their community  demographics and other factors. Currently, HUD\u2019s Moving-to-Work  demonstration program allows participating public housing agencies  (PHA) to obtain exemptions from certain public housing and voucher  program rules, including those related to the calculation of rent  subsidies, and to design and test various approaches to providing and  administering housing assistance. As long as the PHA serves  substantially the same number of households that it served under the  public housing and voucher programs, the PHA is free to design its own  rent structure for its tenants. HUD plans to study PHAs\u2019 experiences  under the Moving-to-Work demonstration as a possible model for  simplifying its policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Simplification of Policies May Significantly Affect Rents for Some Tenants and May Be Difficult to Implement", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of which simplification approach is ultimately adopted, a major  concern of program stakeholders is the effect that policy simplification will  have on tenant rent burdens. Although changes to policies could result in  some tenants paying less in rent, some tenants could end up paying more in  rent if, all other things being equal, the current system of income  exclusions and deductions that provides additional rent relief were  eliminated. To illustrate, we analyzed the potential effects of using a simple  income-based approach in which tenant rents are set at 30 percent of gross  income. Based on our analysis of HUD\u2019s data for fiscal year 2003, we found  that tenants would see their rent go up by an average of $30 per month  ($360 annually), or 16 percent. About 10 percent of these households would  see their rents go up by at least $72 per month (or $864 annually).", "Elderly and disabled households and large families who currently benefit  the most from HUD\u2019s exclusions and deductions would be hit the hardest  by the elimination of these income adjustments. To take these households  into account, we also estimated the average change in tenant rents using an  approach in which elderly, disabled, and working families would pay 27  percent of their gross income in rent, all others would pay 30 percent, and  no other deductions or exclusions would apply. Again using HUD\u2019s tenant  data from fiscal year 2003, our analysis showed that this option would  increase tenant rents, on average, by $16 per month ($192 annually), or 12  percent. About half of current tenants would see modest increases of less  than $10 per month, and around one-quarter could see increases of at least  $28 per month. In addition, the rents for about 25 percent of the tenants  would remain unchanged or decrease under this approach. A more detailed  study by HUD would be necessary to determine the impact of the other  policy simplification approaches on tenants\u2019 rental payments as well as on  program costs.", "Simplification of HUD\u2019s policies for determining rent subsidies may be  difficult to implement and will have a direct impact on how program  administrators conduct their work. Depending on the magnitude of  program changes, program administrators\u2014over the approximately 22,000  property owners and 3,000 PHAs\u2013will have to retrain staff, update written  procedures and administrative plans, and make potentially costly  modifications to their software applications. Program administrators will  also have to perform tenant outreach to explain changes to existing and  new tenants. If HUD determines that these tenants would be protected  from any increases in rent that result from simplified policies, program  administrators would have to deal with the difficulties of treating existing  and new tenants under different sets of policies. Furthermore, gradually  phasing in rent increases for existing tenants would add additional  complexities to the administration of the programs and require extensive  regulatory guidance from HUD. These changes would likely take time and  involve some trial-and-error before they are fully implemented. It is  possible, at least in the short-term, that transitioning to simplified policies  for determining rent subsidies would result in confusion among program  administrator staff and errors in calculating rent subsidies. This problem is  more likely if the changes made to program policies are comprehensive,  requiring extensive retraining of staff. Because HUD is in its early stages of  developing a policy simplification strategy and has not conducted a formal  study of these issues, it is not possible to describe how HUD intends to  address these difficulties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Although part of HUD\u2019s long-term strategy to reduce the risk of improper  rent subsidy payments under RHIIP involves simplifying statutory and  regulatory policies for determining rent subsidies, the department has not  conducted a formal study of possible simplification approaches. According  to HUD and program administrators, existing policies are difficult to  implement and have made the process prone to error. Many of these  policies are intended to provide additional relief to tenants by reducing  their rents under certain circumstances. However, HUD must weigh the  degree of relief these policies provide against the administrative burden  they create and the increased risk of error they generate. Because most  current policies stem from specific statutes, simplifying them would likely  require congressional action. In order to inform potential debate on this  issue, policymakers will need to fully understand how simplification could  affect the amount of rent subsidy errors, program administrators\u2019  workload, tenants\u2019 rental payments, and program costs. Regardless of the  simplification approach that is adopted, HUD will face many difficulties in  implementing the necessary policy changes.
