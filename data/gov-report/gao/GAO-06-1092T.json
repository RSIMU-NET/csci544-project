An additional 1,385 federal responders have registered for screening, including 1,134 current federal workers and 251 former federal workers, bringing the total number registered as of late August 2006 to 1,762, including 283 former federal workers. Because the total number of federal responders is uncertain, the proportion of the total who have registered is unknown. As of late August 2006, Federal Occupational Health Services (FOH) had completed screening of 907 federal workers, 380 of whom were screened since February 2006. Under an OPHEP agreement with CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), former federal workers are being screened through the worker and volunteer WTC program, one of the five key federally funded programs. As of July 31, 2006, the worker and volunteer WTC program provided screenings to 13 former federal workers and scheduled 11 more, and 139 former workers had been screened by FOH as part of the 907 workers. Most of the former federal workers reside outside the New York area, where the worker and volunteer WTC program is located, and NIOSH is working to establish a national network of providers to screen these workers. CDC has awarded a small portion of the $75 million appropriated for screening, monitoring, and treatment and plans to make decisions about treatment coverage before awarding most of the funds. The agency plans to award the $75 million to the five organizations that the law identified as having priority for funding. CDC officials expect to make awards to the WTC Health Registry, the Police Organization Providing Peer Assistance (the POPPA program), and the New York City Police Foundation's Project COPE over a 3-year period and to award funds to the FDNY WTC and worker and volunteer WTC programs in response to the treatment costs they incur. CDC officials have a proposed spending plan that allocates about $53.5 million for the latter two programs' treatment costs, but the officials told GAO that because they are uncertain about how quickly treatment costs could deplete the available funds, they may need to make adjustments. Officials from the FDNY WTC and worker and volunteer WTC programs told GAO that they anticipated that their estimated portion of the funds would be depleted well before the end of 3 years. As of August 2006, CDC awarded about $4.5 million of the $75 million: about $1.9 million to the WTC Health Registry, $1.5 million to the FDNY WTC program, and almost $1.1 million to the worker and volunteer WTC program. In addition, CDC expects to award $1.5 million to the POPPA program and $3 million to Project COPE in September 2006. CDC is waiting to make further awards until it has reached certain decisions about the coverage of treatment services, such as which prescription drugs would be covered.

My testimony today  updates information we reported to you in February 2006. An estimated  40,000 people served as responders in the aftermath of the WTC disaster,  including New York City Fire Department (FDNY) personnel, federal  government personnel, and other government and private-sector workers  and volunteers from New York and elsewhere. By responders we are  referring to anyone involved in rescue, recovery, or cleanup activities at or  near the vicinity of the WTC or Staten Island site. These responders were  exposed to numerous physical hazards, environmental toxins, and  psychological trauma. Five years after the destruction of the WTC  buildings, concerns remain about the long-term physical and mental health  effects of the attack on responders as well as other affected individuals,  including residents and workers.", "As we testified in September 2004, in the aftermath of the WTC attack,  five key federally funded programs were implemented to assess the short- term, and in some cases long-term, effects on the physical and mental  health of WTC responders. These programs are the FDNY WTC Medical  Monitoring Program; WTC Medical Monitoring Program, which we refer to  as the worker and volunteer WTC program; New York State responder  screening program; WTC Health Registry; and the Department of Health  and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) WTC Federal Responder Screening Program.", "We provided information on the progress of these monitoring programs in  our February 2006 testimony. We noted that federal employees who  responded in an official capacity in the aftermath of the WTC attack were  eligible only for the federal responder program but that it had  accomplished little and lagged behind the other four programs. The other  programs had provided thousands of health screenings and collected  information that could contribute to better understanding of the health  consequences of the attack and improve treatment for affected individuals.  Officials of the three programs that planned to conduct long-term health  monitoring\u2014the FDNY WTC program, the worker and volunteer WTC  program, and the WTC Health Registry\u2014told us they were concerned,  however, that federal funding for their programs could end before  sufficient monitoring occurred to identify all long-term health problems  related to the WTC attack, some of which, such as cancer, might not  appear until decades after exposure to a harmful agent. We also reported  that HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had recently  received a $75 million appropriation to fund programs providing health  screening, long-term monitoring, and treatment for WTC responders and  was deciding how to allocate those funds.", "My testimony today revisits these issues. I will discuss (1) progress made  by HHS\u2019s WTC Federal Responder Screening Program, and (2) actions  CDC has taken to award the $75 million that the Congress appropriated to  the agency in December 2005 for programs that provide screening,  monitoring, or treatment for WTC responders.", "To assess progress made by HHS\u2019s WTC Federal Responder Screening  Program, we obtained and reviewed program data and documents from  HHS, including applicable interagency agreements and budget documents.  We interviewed officials from the Agency for Toxic Substances and  Disease Registry (ATSDR); CDC\u2019s National Institute for Occupational  Safety and Health (NIOSH); Federal Occupational Health Services (FOH);  and the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). To  determine actions taken by CDC to award funds from the $75 million  appropriated, we obtained documents and interviewed officials from  NIOSH and ATSDR. We also interviewed officials from organizations  implementing programs designated in the appropriations act as having  first priority for receiving the funds\u2014including the Mount Sinai-Irving J.  Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, one of the  clinical centers of the worker and volunteer WTC program; FDNY\u2019s  Bureau of Health Services (FDNY-BHS); the New York City Department of  Health and Mental Hygiene; the Police Organization Providing Peer  Assistance (the POPPA program); and the New York City Police  Foundation\u2019s Project COPE\u2014and officials from the American Red Cross,  which has funded treatment services for responders. We relied on data  provided by agency officials and contained in government publications  and did not independently verify the data we obtained. Although we could  not independently verify the reliability of all of this information, we  compared it with other supporting documents, when available, to  determine data consistency and reasonableness. Based on these efforts,  we believe the information we obtained is sufficiently reliable for this  report. We conducted our work from July 2006 to September 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, since February 2006, HHS has registered and screened  additional federal responders, and arrangements are being developed for  screening responders who are former federal workers residing outside the  New York metropolitan area.

Almost all firefighters who responded to the attack  experienced respiratory effects, including WTC cough. A recent study  suggested that exposed firefighters on average experienced a decline in  lung function equivalent to that which would be produced by 12 years of  aging.", "Commonly reported mental health effects among responders and other  affected individuals included symptoms associated with posttraumatic  stress disorder\u2014an often debilitating disorder that can develop after a  person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event, and which may not  develop for months or years after the event. Behavioral effects such as  alcohol and tobacco use and difficulty coping with daily responsibilities  have also been reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Programs", "paragraphs": ["The five programs that were created for monitoring the health of WTC  responders vary in aspects such as the implementing agency (i.e., federal,  state, or local governments or private organizations) and eligibility  requirements. (See table 1.) Each program received federal funding, the  majority of which was provided by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of the  approximately $8.8 billion in federal assistance that the Congress  appropriated to FEMA for response and recovery activities after the WTC  disaster. FEMA is authorized to use a portion of its WTC-related funding  for screening and long-term monitoring of responders. With regard to  treatment, however, FEMA may generally fund only short-term care after a  disaster, such as emergency medical services, and not ongoing clinical  treatment. FEMA entered into interagency agreements with HHS to fund  most of the health monitoring programs. OPHEP, which coordinates and  directs HHS\u2019s emergency preparedness and response program, entered  into separate interagency agreements with FOH to implement the federal  responder screening program for current federal workers and with NIOSH  to implement the screening program for former federal workers.", "We reported in February 2006 that four of the five monitoring programs  had made progress in screening and monitoring affected individuals and  gathering data. (See table 1.) These four programs\u2014the FDNY WTC  Medical Monitoring Program, the worker and volunteer WTC program, the  New York State responder screening program, and the WTC Health  Registry\u2014had collected information that monitoring officials said could  be used by researchers to help better understand the health consequences  of the attack and improve treatment, such as by identifying which types of  treatment are effective for specific conditions. In contrast to the progress  made by the other programs, the HHS WTC Federal Responder Screening  Program had lagged behind and accomplished little. The program was  established to provide free voluntary medical screening examinations for  federal workers whom their agencies sent to respond to the WTC disaster  from September 11, 2001, through September 10, 2002, and who were not  eligible for any other WTC health monitoring program. Through March  2004, the program\u2014which started about a year later than the other WTC  monitoring programs\u2014completed screenings of 394 federal workers.  HHS put the program on hold in January 2004, when it stopped scheduling  new examinations, because it wanted to resolve several operational issues,  including HHS\u2019s determination that FOH did not have the authority to  provide examinations to people who are no longer in federal service.  Under an agreement between OPHEP and FOH that was established in  July 2005, the program resumed providing examinations for current  federal workers in December 2005, and in February 2006, OPHEP  executed an agreement with NIOSH calling for NIOSH to arrange for the  worker and volunteer WTC program to provide examinations to former  federal workers.", "Many participants in the monitoring programs required additional testing  or needed treatment for health problems that were identified during  screening examinations. The FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring Program  referred participants to the FDNY Bureau of Health Services, but the other  programs primarily referred participants to their primary care physician or  to privately funded programs available to responders, such as treatment  services provided by the Mount Sinai clinical center that are funded by the  American Red Cross. We previously reported that officials told us that  finding treatment services for such participants was an important, but  challenging, part of the programs\u2019 responsibility. For example, officials  from the worker and volunteer WTC program stated that identifying  providers available to treat participants became a major part of their  operations, and was especially difficult when participants lacked health  insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Federal Funding for Monitoring and Treatment", "paragraphs": ["In December 2005, the Congress appropriated $75 million to CDC to fund  programs providing baseline screening, long-term monitoring, and health  care treatment for emergency services and recovery personnel who  responded to the WTC disaster.

CDC officials said that they expected to make the coverage  decisions in late 2006 and that they would obtain input from the American  Red Cross and the programs.", "A CDC official told us that making decisions about which prescription  drugs to cover could be the greatest challenge CDC and the programs face,  because of the potentially high cost of drugs needed to treat responders.  An FDNY WTC program official said that prescription drug costs are a  looming financial problem for the FDNY WTC program. The CDC official  told us that the most common diagnoses of WTC responders\u2014 gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, and  mental health conditions\u2014frequently are treated with prolonged and  expensive drug therapy. For example, medications for respiratory therapy  can cost $1,000 a month and may continue for a year. The FDNY WTC  program official estimated that 100 percent coverage of prescriptions for  firefighters and emergency medical technicians could cost $10 million to  $18 million per year and potentially consume all of the funding that CDC  would provide to the program. Clinicians at the worker and volunteer  WTC clinical center at Mount Sinai stated that spending on prescription  drugs at their center was increasing by $5,000 to $10,000 each month and  amounted to $60,000 in July 2006.", "Another coverage decision that CDC faces is to determine the extent to  which inpatient care will be covered. Currently, the FDNY WTC and  worker and volunteer WTC programs provide only outpatient care, but  officials involved with these programs believe that the treatment funds  from the $75 million should cover some inpatient care, such as when a  responder\u2019s WTC-linked asthma becomes exacerbated to an extent that  requires hospitalization.", "CDC officials told us that they plan to reach decisions about treatment  coverage in fall 2006. They also plan to invite the FDNY WTC and worker  and volunteer WTC programs to submit applications for treatment funding  in the fall. If the applications are submitted by December 2006, CDC  officials expect to be able to review them in time to provide funding to the  programs by February 2007.", "CDC is also in the process of resolving issues related to providing access  to screening, monitoring, and treatment services for WTC responders,  including former federal workers, who reside outside the New York  metropolitan area. CDC is negotiating with AOEC about possibly using  AOEC clinics around the country to provide these services. CDC officials  told us they intend that monitoring and treatment services available to  responders around the country would be comparable to services provided  by the worker and volunteer WTC program.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared remarks.
