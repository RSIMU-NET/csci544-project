For each of these initiatives, GAO was asked to (1) identify their goals, objectives, and requirements; (2) determine the status of actions federal agencies have taken, or plan to take, to implement the initiatives; and (3) identify any benefits, challenges, and lessons learned. To do this, GAO reviewed plans, reports, and other documents at 23 major executive branch agencies, interviewed officials, and reviewed OMB and DHS guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The goals of TIC are to secure federal agencies' external network connections, including Internet connections, and improve the government's incident response capability by reducing the number of agencies' external network connections and implementing security controls over the connections that remain. In implementing TIC, agencies could either provide their own access points by becoming an access provider or seek service from these providers or an approved vendor. To achieve the initiative's goals, agencies were required to (1) inventory external connections, (2) establish a target number of TIC access points, (3) develop and implement plans to reduce their connections, (4) implement security capabilities (if they chose to be an access provider) addressing such issues as encryption and physical security, and (5) demonstrate to DHS the consolidation of connections and compliance with the security capabilities (if they chose to be an access provider). As of September 2009, none of the 23 agencies had met all of the requirements of the TIC initiative. Although most agencies reported that they have made progress toward reducing their external connections and implementing critical security capabilities, most agencies have also experienced delays in their implementation efforts. For example, the 16 agencies that chose to become access providers reported that they had reduced their number of external connections from 3,286 to approximately 1,753. Further, agencies have not demonstrated that they have fully implemented the required security capabilities. Throughout their reduction efforts, agencies have experienced benefits, such as improved security and network management. However, they have been challenged in implementing TIC because OMB did not promptly communicate the number of access points for which they had been approved and DHS did not always respond to agency queries on security capabilities in a timely manner. Agencies' experiences with implementing TIC offered OMB and DHS lessons learned, such as the need to define program requirements before establishing deadlines and the usefulness of sponsoring collaborative meetings for agencies' implementation efforts. Einstein is intended to provide DHS with an increased awareness of activity, including possible security incidents, on federal networks by providing intrusion detection capabilities that allow DHS to monitor and analyze agencies' incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. As of September 2009, fewer than half of the 23 agencies had executed the required agreements with DHS, and Einstein 2 had been deployed to 6 agencies. Agencies that participated in Einstein 1 improved identification of incidents and mitigation of attacks, but DHS will continue to be challenged in understanding whether the initiative is meeting all of its objectives because it lacks performance measures that address how agencies respond to alerts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pervasive and sustained cyber attacks against the United States continue  to pose a potentially devastating impact on federal systems and  operations.

Information security is thus  especially important for federal agencies to ensure the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of their systems and data.

Specifically, in one agency\u2019s review, DHS evaluated only one of the  agency\u2019s two security operations centers and one of its four TIC locations.  According to DHS, the other center and three locations were not evaluated  because the agency asserted that its other sites were identical to the ones  evaluated. For another agency, DHS evaluated a security operations center  and a telecommunications facility at the agency but did not examine  controls at either of the agency\u2019s TIC access point locations. A third  agency was only evaluated at one of its two TIC locations. DHS officials  indicated that in designing the method for TIC compliance reviews, it was  decided that the initial round of reviews would include only the most  mature TIC locations and supporting network and operations centers.  Without evaluating all agency locations in its compliance reviews, DHS  cannot be assured that agencies have implemented critical capabilities at  all locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining Requirements and Effective Communication Offer Lessons Learned for OMB and DHS as the Initiative Moves Forward", "paragraphs": ["Agencies\u2019 experiences in implementing TIC offer valuable lessons learned  for OMB and DHS.", "Defining requirements clearly and early prove useful for agency  planning. OMB and DHS did not always use sound program management  principles when planning the TIC initiative. According to The Standard for  Program Management, during the planning phase, program requirements  should be developed before schedules are defined. However, OMB and  DHS did not define certain fundamental requirements before establishing  initial deadlines for the initiative. For example, DHS did not define the  meaning of \u201cexternal connection\u201d until April 2009, 17 months after the  initiative was announced and 10 months after the initial June 2008  deadline for reducing external connections to authorized levels. This  resulted in DHS determining during a compliance validation review that  one agency had not reported a number of external connections that  needed to be consolidated. DHS officials acknowledged that this was due  to confusion over the definition of what constituted an external  connection. In addition, the technical security capabilities that would be  required for access providers were still being defined when agencies  developed their required initial implementation plans and were not  finalized until April 2008, 5 months after the initiative was announced. As a  result, several agencies stated that it was difficult for them to plan for TIC  implementation. In going forward, defining any key future requirements  prior to establishing deadlines will be critical to the initiative\u2019s success.", "Collaborative meetings aided implementation. DHS and OMB  sponsored several collaborative meetings during the initiative that many  agencies found beneficial for their implementation of TIC. Specifically,  several agencies stated that the meetings of the inter-agency TIC technical  working group were helpful. For example, one agency said that DHS  provided updates about the initiative during the meetings. Another agency  noted that the meetings provided additional specificity on aspects of the  program. Several agencies also stated that the meetings provided a forum  for agencies to discuss issues related to TIC with one another, allowing  them to gain insight from other agencies. One of these agencies found the  meetings to be helpful because it was able to provide feedback to DHS  about the technical capabilities. Another agency noted that it had recently  participated in conference calls with DHS that helped to address its  technical questions related to implementing the critical capabilities. In the  future, continuing such effective communication increases the chances of  the initiative\u2019s success.", "Meeting business needs with a reduced number of connections is  complex and time-consuming. As indicated earlier, the 16 access  provider agencies in our review are reporting that they are reducing and  consolidating from 3,286 external connections. Reducing to the approved  total of 32 TIC access points is a complex and time-consuming effort for  most agencies. For example, one agency indicated that implementing the  infrastructure required to support its mission would require 4 years to  complete. Two other agencies noted that implementing the initiative  required them to make significant changes to their existing network  architecture. In addition, for several agencies, determining how to meet  their business needs within the technical constraints of TIC has been a  complex task. For example, three agencies stated that they needed more  than two TIC access points to ensure that their networks would remain  operational in the event of a disaster. One of these agencies explained that  its high performance and capacity requirements would not be met with  only two access points. The complex effort required for agencies to  implement the initiative while still meeting their business needs has led to  significant delays in agencies\u2019 plans for implementation. As indicated  earlier, the access provider agencies have reported that they have  consolidated fewer connections than they originally planned and have  significantly revised their future plans for consolidation.
