In 2007, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded the $100 million Primary Care Access and Stabilization Grant (PCASG) to Louisiana to help restore primary care services to the low-income population. Louisiana gave PCASG funds to 25 outpatient provider organizations in the greater New Orleans area. GAO was asked to study how the federal government can effectively leverage governmental resources to help area residents gain access to primary care services. This report examines (1) how PCASG fund recipients used the PCASG funds to support primary care services in greater New Orleans, (2) how PCASG fund recipients used and benefited from other federal hurricane relief funds that support the restoration of primary care services in the area, and (3) challenges PCASG fund recipients continued to face in providing primary care, and their plans for sustaining services after PCASG funds are no longer available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["PCASG fund recipients reported that they used the PCASG funds to hire or retain health care providers and other staff, add primary care services, and open new sites. For example, 20 of the 23 recipients that responded to the GAO survey reported using PCASG funds to hire health care providers, and 17 reported using PCASG funds to retain health care providers. In addition, most of the recipients reported that they used PCASG funds to add primary care services and to add or renovate sites. Recipients also reported that the grant requirements and funding helped them improve service delivery and expand access to care in underserved neighborhoods. Other federal hurricane relief funds helped PCASG fund recipients pay staff, purchase equipment, and expand mental health services to help restore primary care. Eleven recipients received HHS Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) supplemental funds designated by Louisiana for primary care, and two received SSBG supplemental funds designated by Louisiana specifically for mental health care. The funds designated for primary care were used to pay staff and purchase equipment, and the funds designated for mental health care were used to provide a range of services for adults and children, including crisis intervention and substance abuse prevention and treatment. About two-thirds of the PCASG fund recipients benefited from the Professional Workforce Supply Grant incentives. These recipients hired or retained 69 health care providers who received incentives totaling over $4 million to work in the greater New Orleans area. In addition, one PCASG fund recipient expended $7.9 million it received from Louisiana to provide services through the federal Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program. PCASG fund recipients continue to face multiple challenges and have various plans for sustainability. Recipients face significant challenges in hiring and retaining staff, as well as in referring patients outside of their organizations, and these challenges have grown since Hurricane Katrina. For example, 20 of 23 recipients that responded to the GAO survey reported hiring was a great or moderate challenge, and among these 20 recipients over three-quarters reported that this challenge had grown since Hurricane Katrina. Six of the 7 recipients that primarily provide mental health services reported that both hiring and retention of providers were great or moderate challenges. Many PCASG fund recipients also reported challenges in referring patients outside their organization for mental health, dental, and specialty care services. Although all PCASG fund recipients have completed or planned actions to increase their ability to be sustainable, it is too early to know whether their various sustainability strategies will be successful."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 4 years after Hurricane Katrina, the greater New Orleans area  continues to face challenges in restoring health care services disrupted by  the storm. Before the hurricane, the low-income population in the area  had relied on hospital emergency rooms and outpatient clinics, mostly  hospital-based, as its main source of primary care. These clinics provided  care to many patients who were uninsured or covered by Medicaid.  Following the hurricane and the subsequent flooding, the hospitals and  clinics closed because of the significant damage they had sustained. As  studies have shown, disaster survivors continue to experience poor  physical and mental health for prolonged periods after the event. After  the hurricane, various health care provider organizations in the area were  able to reopen some health care clinics. However, gaps remained in the  availability of health care services in the greater New Orleans area.", "To help address the continuing health care needs of low-income area  residents, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded  the $100 million Primary Care Access and Stabilization Grant (PCASG) to  the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (LDHH) in July 2007.  The grant is administered at the federal level by HHS\u2019s Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). It is intended to restore and expand  access to primary care services, including mental health care services and  dental care services, without regard to a patient\u2019s ability to pay. The grant  is also intended to decrease costly reliance on emergency room use for  primary care services for patients who are uninsured, underinsured, or  covered by Medicaid. CMS required LDHH to use the grant to provide  short-term funding to outpatient provider organizations to help them take  such actions as increasing their staff, renovating clinics, and opening new  clinic sites. LDHH provided funds to 25 organizations\u2014which we refer to  as PCASG fund recipients; as of March 20, 2008, the recipients were  operating 75 sites that were eligible to use PCASG funds. The Louisiana  Public Health Institute (LPHI) administers the PCASG for LDHH and  distributes grant funds as its local partner. For an organization to be  eligible for PCASG funding, it must have been a public or private nonprofit  organization serving patients in the greater New Orleans area\u2014which CMS  defined as Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes\u2014at  the time that Louisiana\u2019s grant proposal was submitted. It must also have  had the intent to be sustainable, that is, able to continue providing primary  care after PCASG funds are no longer available.", "In addition to the PCASG, other federal grants were awarded following  Hurricane Katrina that could help support access to primary care services.  These include the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) supplemental funds  from HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and grants  from the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), which  is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  and its federal partner, HHS\u2019s Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration (SAMHSA). Provider organizations also could  benefit from CMS\u2019s Professional Workforce Supply Grant, through which  incentives were paid to prospective or current employees. Grants from the  Health Center Program of HHS\u2019s Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA) were also available during this time to certain  organizations providing primary care services.", "You asked us to study how the federal government can effectively leverage  governmental resources to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina gain  access to primary care services.

To identify the locations for our site visits, we chose a selective  sample of the recipients, including some that offered mental health care  services or dental care services and 2 that were Health Center Program  grantees. In addition, we included at least 1 recipient from each of the  area\u2019s four parishes. During these visits we collected documents and  interviewed PCASG fund recipient, state, and local officials.

We also reviewed the  recipients\u2019 applications for PCASG funding and interviewed officials at  LDHH and LPHI about how the recipients used PCASG funds.", "To answer our question on how the PCASG fund recipients used and  benefited from other federal funds for hurricane relief, we identified  relevant funding sources that recipients used or benefited from, and we  examined the funding amounts and the ways the funds were used.  Specifically, we reviewed and analyzed data from LDHH on expenditures  related to the supplemental SSBG, on awards made under CMS\u2019s  Professional Workforce Supply Grant Program, and on the CCP. Through  assessments of internal consistency and verification with state and local  officials, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.

We  also analyzed interviews we conducted with 10 recipients, including the 8  we visited, and with federal, state, and local agency officials. In addition,  we reviewed sustainability plans that the recipients included in their  applications for PCASG funding.", "To provide additional information on the PCASG fund recipients, we used  data collected by LPHI on types of services that the recipients offered. We  also used patient and encounter data that LPHI summarized for us.  PCASG funds were not the only funds used to support the services these  data describe. Based on activities we conducted to assess the reliability of  these data, such as discussing with LPHI officials their processes to   establish the accuracy and reliability of the data they gave us, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.", "We conducted our work from February 2008 through June 2009 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives.

In a 2008 survey conducted by LDHH,   88 percent of all incentive recipients reported that the availability of an  incentive payment affected their decision to remain or practice in the  greater New Orleans area.", "Three-quarters of recipients of incentive payments were existing  employees who were retained, while one-quarter were newly hired. This  pattern is consistent with the incentive payments that were made overall,  regardless of employing organization. In addition, no PCASG fund  recipient hired more than two new staff who had received an incentive  payment. In discussing these payments, a state official commented that  retaining an existing employee is generally easier than hiring a new one."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "One PCASG Fund Recipient Provided Counseling Services through the CCP", "paragraphs": ["One PCASG fund recipient provided counseling services with CCP funds.

Hiring has been  especially challenging. For example, 11 of the 23 recipients reported the  hiring of health care providers to be a great challenge, and 9 reported it  was a moderate challenge. (For detailed information on recipients\u2019  responses to the questions in our Web-based survey regarding challenges,  see fig. 3.) Among those that reported hiring providers was a great or  moderate challenge, over three-quarters responded that this challenge had  grown since Hurricane Katrina. In discussing challenges, officials from  one recipient organization told us that after Hurricane Katrina they had  greater difficulty hiring licensed nurses than before the hurricane. They  also told us that most of the nurses who were available to be hired were  recruited by hospitals, where the pay was higher. Moreover, officials we  interviewed from several recipient organizations said that the problems  with housing, schools, and overall community infrastructure that  developed after Hurricane Katrina made it difficult to attract health care  providers and other staff. An additional indication of limited availability of  primary care providers in the area is HRSA\u2019s designation of all of Orleans,  Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes and much of Jefferson Parish as  HPSAs for primary care. While some portions of the greater New Orleans  area had this HPSA designation before Hurricane Katrina, additional  portions of the area received that designation after the hurricane.", "Retention of staff has also been a challenge for the PCASG fund recipients.  (See fig. 3.) For example, 16 of the 23 recipients reported that retaining  health care providers was a great or moderate challenge. Among those that  reported retaining health care providers was a great or moderate  challenge, about three-quarters also reported that this challenge had  grown since Hurricane Katrina. Retaining other staff has also been a  challenge, with 14 of the 23 recipients reporting it to be a great or  moderate challenge. About two-thirds of those reporting that retaining  other staff was a moderate or great challenge also said this challenge had  grown since Hurricane Katrina.", "The PCASG fund recipients that primarily provide mental health services  in particular faced challenges both in hiring providers and in retaining  providers. Six of the seven that responded to our survey reported that  both hiring and retaining providers were either a great or moderate  challenge. Six recipients reported that hiring was a great challenge, and  five of these reported that the challenge was greater than before Hurricane  Katrina. Three recipients reported that retention was a great challenge,  and two of these also reported that the challenge had grown since  Hurricane Katrina. An indication of more limited availability of mental  health care providers is HRSA\u2019s designation of the four parishes of the  greater New Orleans area as HPSAs for mental health in late 2005 and  early 2006; before Hurricane Katrina, none of the parishes had this  designation for mental health. Officials we interviewed from one  recipient with multiple sites told us that while the Greater New Orleans  Health Service Corps, which was funded through the Professional  Workforce Supply Grant, had been helpful for recruiting and retaining  physicians, it had not helped fill the need for social workers. Furthermore,  officials we interviewed from two recipients with multiple sites told us  that some staff had experienced depression and trauma themselves and  found it difficult to work in mental health settings.", "Beyond challenges in hiring and retaining their own providers and other  staff, PCASG fund recipients that responded to our survey reported  significant challenges in referring their patients to other organizations for  mental health, dental, and specialty care services. (See fig. 3.) Specifically,  14 of the 23 recipients reported that the availability of mental health  providers willing to accept referrals was a great or moderate challenge,  and over two-thirds of those reporting that level of challenge responded  that this challenge had grown since Hurricane Katrina. In addition, 10 of  the 16 recipients that indicated that the question on dental service  referrals was applicable to them reported that the availability of dentists  willing to accept referrals was a great or moderate challenge, and about  two-thirds of those reporting that level of challenge also reported that this  challenge was greater than before Hurricane Katrina. An additional  indication of limited availability of dental care is that HRSA has designated  all of Orleans, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines parishes and part of Jefferson  Parish as HPSAs for dental care; before Katrina, only part of Orleans  Parish and part of Jefferson Parish had this designation. Finally, 13 of the  20 recipients that indicated that the question on specialty care referrals  was applicable to them reported that the availability of providers willing to  accept referrals for specialty care was a great or moderate challenge, and  two-thirds of those reported that this challenge had grown since Hurricane  Katrina."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PCASG Fund Recipients Are Taking Actions to Address the Challenge of Sustainability, but It Is Too Early to Know Whether They Will Be Successful", "paragraphs": ["An additional challenge that the PCASG fund recipients face is to be  sustainable after PCASG funds are no longer available.

For example, all responding  recipients reported that they had taken action\u2014such as screening patients  for eligibility\u2014to facilitate their ability to receive reimbursement for  services they provided to Medicaid or LaCHIP beneficiaries. Furthermore,  16 recipients reported that they were billing private insurance, with an  additional 5 recipients reporting they planned to do so. However,  obtaining reimbursement for all patients who are insured may not be  sufficient to ensure a recipient\u2019s sustainability, because at about half of the  PCASG fund recipients, over 50 percent of the patients are uninsured.", "Many PCASG fund recipients reported that they intended to use Health  Center Program funding or FQHC Look-Alike designation\u2014which allows  for enhanced Medicare and Medicaid payment rates\u2014as one of their  sustainability strategies. Four recipients were participating in the Health  Center Program at the time they received the initial disbursement of  PCASG funds. One of these recipients had received a Health Center New  Access Point grant to open an additional site after Hurricane Katrina and  had also received an Expanded Medical Capacity grant to increase service  capacity, which it used in part to hire additional staff and buy equipment.  Another of these recipients received a New Access Point grant to open an  additional site after receiving PCASG funds. Beyond these four recipients,  one additional recipient received an FQHC Look-Alike designation in July  2008 and a New Access Point grant in March 2009. Of the remaining 18  recipients that responded to our survey, 6 said they planned to apply for  both a Health Center Program grant and an FQHC Look-Alike designation.  In addition, 1 planned to apply for a grant only and another planned to  apply for an FQHC Look-Alike designation only. Although many recipients  indicated that they intended to use Health Center Program funding as a  sustainability strategy, they may not all be successful in obtaining a grant.  For example, in fiscal year 2008 only about 16 percent of all applications  for New Access Point grants resulted in grant awards.", "About three-quarters of PCASG fund recipients reported that as one of  their sustainability strategies they had applied or planned to apply for  additional federal funding, such as Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grants,  or for state funding. In addition, a few reported that they had applied or  planned to apply for private grants, such as from foundations.", "Although PCASG fund recipients have completed or planned actions to  increase their ability to be sustainable, it is too early to know whether  their various sustainability strategies will be successful. One factor that  may affect the degree of challenge in achieving sustainability is whether a  recipient is part of a larger institution, such as a university or government  body, that could potentially provide additional funds after PCASG funds  are no longer available.

In  addition, we reviewed and analyzed data gathered by LDHH related to the  incentive payments made under the Professional Workforce Supply Grant  and expenditures under the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training  Program (CCP). For the incentive payments made using the Professional  Workforce Supply Grant, LDHH provided us with information about health  care providers working at PCASG sites. They used the employment  address, rather than recipient name, to identify which providers to include.  They provided data about the amount of payment, payment type (retention  or hiring), and provider type (for example, internist or nurse). For the  CCP, we obtained data from LDHH on program expenditures at PCASG  sites. We also interviewed officials from LDHH and PCASG fund recipients  about the implementation of these programs in the greater New Orleans  area.
