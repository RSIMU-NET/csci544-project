Airport-related noise emanates primarily from the takeoff  and landing of aircraft, but engine maintenance and the taxiing of aircraft  on runways are some of the other activities that also contribute to airport- related noise. New technology has been making aircraft quieter, and since  1969 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been limiting the noise  that various aircraft are allowed to make. As a result, FAA estimates that  the population exposed to very high noise levels will have declined from  7 million in 1975 to an estimated 600,000 in 2000. But in spite of the recent  transition to quieter aircraft, expected growth in air traffic may result in  little or no net reduction in overall noise levels generated by individual  airports. Furthermore, concerns about airport-related noise may impede  the development of any needed additional capacity in the national network  of airports.", "The Congress has recognized the importance of developing a safe and  efficient national airport system that meets the nation\u2019s present and future  aviation needs. As a result, federally authorized investment in a national  airport system, including noise reduction projects, has totaled about  $3 billion a year in recent years. FAA has primary responsibility for  implementing federal programs addressing noise issues associated with  civilian airports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Role in Addressing Airport- Related Noise", "paragraphs": ["In order to facilitate the development of a safe and efficient national airport  system, FAA undertakes several activities that help airports and  communities reduce airport-related noise or mitigate its effects. FAA must  consult with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding some of its  responsibilities. FAA\u2019s activities focus on three areas: (1) reducing aircraft- generated noise at its source\u2014the aircraft; (2) changing an airport\u2019s use of  its runways and/or implementing different flight operations; and  (3) mitigating the effects of existing noise levels on surrounding  communities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reducing Airport-Related Noise at Its Source", "paragraphs": ["Airport-related noise can be lowered by reducing the noise that aircraft  emit when they take off from and land at airports. New technology allows  aircraft manufacturers to design and construct quieter aircraft. For aircraft  already in service, noise levels can be reduced by (1) installing quieter  engines, (2) installing equipment that reduces the noise of existing engines,  and (3) modifying aircraft use and operations in ways that reduce aircraft- generated noise.", "FAA has actively engaged in efforts to reduce aircraft noise since the 1960s.  The agency sets the noise standards aircraft must meet to be certified as  airworthy and establishes the regulations that govern the operation of  those aircraft at U.S. airports. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as  amended in 1968, gave FAA the authority to regulate aircraft design and  equipment in order to reduce noise. Pursuant to that act, FAA issued  regulations in 1969 that established noise standards for new designs of civil  subsonic turbojet aircraft. According to an aircraft design expert, the  purpose of those noise standards was to ensure that the best available  noise reduction technology was used in new aircraft designs.", "Initially, these regulations prescribed noise standards that applied only to  new types or designs of turbojet aircraft (as well as certain propeller  aircraft). In 1973, FAA amended its regulations to apply the noise standards  to all newly manufactured aircraft, whether or not the aircraft design was  new. In 1977, additional amendments established lower noise standards for  all new aircraft, as well as the concept of noise \u201cstages.\u201d Aircraft meeting  the original 1969 standards were categorized as \u201cstage 2\u201d aircraft; those  meeting the more stringent 1977 standards were categorized as \u201cstage 3\u201d  aircraft; and aircraft meeting neither standard were categorized as \u201cstage 1\u201d  aircraft.", "In addition to establishing noise standards, FAA controls aircraft noise by  regulating aircraft operations. In 1976, FAA amended its regulations to  prohibit all certificated stage 1 subsonic turbojet aircraft weighing more  than 75,000 pounds from flying into or out of U.S. airports after January 1,  1985, unless their engines had been modified or replaced to enable them to  meet the stage 2 or stage 3 noise standards. However, the Aviation Safety  and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 directed FAA to grant exemptions from  compliance until January 1, 1988, to turbojet aircraft with two engines and  fewer than 100 passenger seats.", "In 1990, the Airport Noise and Capacity Act required civil subsonic turbojet  aircraft weighing more than 75,000 pounds to comply with stage 3 noise  standards by December 31, 1999, or be retired from service. To meet this  requirement, the engines on stage 2 aircraft could be modified or replaced.", "In addition to regulating aircraft-generated noise, FAA supports aviation  research related to noise. In particular, FAA is working with the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop new technology to  reduce aircraft noise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing an Airport\u2019s Use or Operations", "paragraphs": ["By changing use and/or operations, airports can reduce airport-related  noise or mitigate its effects. For example, an airport can restrict noisy  aircraft maintenance activities to areas where noise barriers can muffle the  sound. Aircraft arrival and departure flight paths, as well as runway use,  can be changed to minimize flights over densely populated areas. Airports  can also mitigate noise impacts by seeking FAA approval to restrict certain  aircraft to takeoffs and landings during the day, when their impact on  nearby communities is considered less than during the night.", "FAA is involved in many of these activities. For example, FAA must  approve any restriction on an aircraft\u2019s access to an airport or on allowable  noise levels if the restriction involves stage 3 aircraft or is beyond those  imposed by federal regulations. Thus, if an airport wants to restrict any  stage 3 aircraft to daytime operations, it must obtain FAA\u2019s approval. FAA  must also approve and implement changes in flight paths. Furthermore,  FAA administers airport development funding programs, which can finance  the construction of runways and taxiways that enable aircraft to use  different takeoff and landing routes to minimize flights traveling over  densely populated areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigating the Effects of Airport-Related Noise", "paragraphs": ["Mitigation activities can reduce the impact of airport-related noise on the  communities surrounding an airport. For example, buildings in nearby  communities can be soundproofed and building codes can be changed to  require improved sound suppression construction; noise barriers can be  constructed; and airports can acquire land to prevent uses that are  incompatible with the prevailing noise exposure levels. Communities can  also exercise their authority over land use planning to help prevent the  future development of land for activities that are noise-sensitive\u2014such as  those occurring in residences, schools, churches, and hospitals\u2014in areas  exposed to high noise levels.", "FAA supports mitigation efforts through two programs that provide  federally authorized funds for airport projects that mitigate the effects of  noise, and one program that encourages airports to identify and address  the noise impacts of their airports on nearby communities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Administers Two Programs That Fund Noise Mitigation Projects", "paragraphs": ["The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Passenger Facility Charge  (PFC) program provide federally authorized funding that, among other  purposes, can be used to help mitigate the effects of airport-related noise.

Airports must provide a \u201cmatching share\u201d for AIP-funded projects, ranging  from 10 percent to 25 percent of a project\u2019s total cost, depending on the  type of project and the size of the airport.", "Two categories of AIP grants are available\u2014apportionment and  discretionary. Apportionment funds are distributed by a statutory formula  to commercial service airports according to the number of passengers  served and the volume of cargo moved, and to the states according to a  percentage of the total amount of the appropriated funds. Discretionary  funds\u2014for the most part, those amounts remaining after apportionment  funds are allotted and certain other amounts are \u201cset aside\u201d for special  categories, including noise-related projects\u2014can generally be awarded for  eligible projects at any eligible airport, including general aviation airports,  which do not receive apportionment funds.", "Only airports included in FAA\u2019s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems  are eligible for AIP grants. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems  identifies those U.S. airports that constitute the national airport system,  which is designed to ensure that every part of the country has an effective  aviation infrastructure. There are 529 commercial service airports\u2014those  that receive apportionment funds\u2014and 2,815 general aviation airports (for  a total of 3,344 airports) in the current national plan. Furthermore, all  projects funded with AIP funds\u2014whether apportionment or  discretionary\u2014must be approved by FAA. However, FAA will not approve  any grant for any kind of project without written assurances that the  airport will take appropriate action, to the extent possible, to restrict the  use of land near the airport to uses compatible with airport operations.", "The AIP funds noise mitigation projects in two ways. First, a specified  portion of AIP appropriations is \u201cset aside\u201d by statute specifically for  projects that address airport-related noise levels and their effects. Only  projects relating to noise may be funded from this set-aside. Table 1  identifies the portions of AIP funds that have historically been set aside for  noise. In addition to being eligible for these set-aside funds, projects  addressing airport-related noise may compete with other airport  development projects for other AIP grants.", "The second program providing federally authorized funds for mitigating  airport-related noise\u2014the PFC program\u2014is a voluntary program that  enables airports to impose fees on boarding passengers\u2014known as  passenger facility charges\u2014and retain the money for airport infrastructure  projects, including noise reduction. Under this program, authorized by the  Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990, commercial service  airports may charge boarding passengers a $1, $2, or $3 fee. Airports are  not required to impose the fee, but airports wishing to participate in the  program must seek FAA\u2019s approval both to levy the fee and to use the  revenues for particular development projects. Airlines collect the fees from  passengers and transmit them directly to the appropriate airports. FAA  officials told us that as long as a project is eligible, meets one of the  statutory objectives, and is adequately justified, they do not have the  authority to reject an airport\u2019s proposal for the collection or use of  passenger facility charges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Defines Land Use Compatibility and Administers an Airport Noise Compatibility Planning Program to Facilitate Noise Mitigation", "paragraphs": ["Although the federal government has no jurisdiction over land use  decisions (that authority lies with state and local governments), FAA can  facilitate compatible land use planning at the state and local level. The  Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 directed FAA to define  land uses that it considers compatible or incompatible with the various  noise levels that nearby communities are exposed to. The act also directed  FAA to administer a new program that encourages airports to develop  maps identifying areas in nearby communities where land uses are  considered to be incompatible. The program also encourages airports to  develop individual airport noise compatibility programs that include those  maps and the projects that have been implemented, or planned, to reduce  any existing or potential incompatible land uses identified. The act also  requires FAA to approve an airport\u2019s noise compatibility program as long  as the program does not place an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign is reasonably consistent with achieving the goal of reducing  incompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of new  incompatible land uses, and authorizes needed revisions to the program\u2019s planned projects when  noise exposure maps are updated.", "Programs, except as they relate to flight procedures, are automatically  approved if FAA has not acted within 180 days after receipt of the proposed  program. Once an airport\u2019s program is approved, the airport can apply for  AIP grants to fund the types of projects included in the program that are  eligible for federal grants.

We also  interviewed officials from FAA headquarters in Washington, D.C.; the  Airports Council International-North America; the Air Transport  Association; and the National Association of State Aviation Officials; as  well as other experts on these issues. In 1999, we independently validated  the PFC project database and found it to be very reliable (a 0.3-percent  error rate). We did not independently review the validity of the grant  program database, but it is the only database for that information, and we  have used data from it extensively during the conduct of several reviews  that have looked at various aspects of the grant program.", "To address the second set of questions\u2014on comparing methods that  measure airport-related noise\u2014we (1) discussed noise measurement  methods with FAA, airport officials, the Airports Council International- North America, the Air Transport Association, the National Association of  State Aviation Officials, and the Federal Interagency Committee on Noise,  as well as other aviation experts, to identify the kinds of methods being  used to measure noise levels and the strengths and weaknesses of these  methods; (2) reviewed the major noise measurement methods, as well as  written descriptions and analyses of them, to determine how each method  measured airport-related noise; and (3) identified the statutory  requirements for FAA to select a method for environmental impact and  land use analyses and the method that FAA chose. To compare and  illustrate the kinds of information produced by each method, we designed a  model airport and test scenarios; FAA then conducted noise measurements  for us for the test scenarios using its Integrated Noise Model, its  computerized program for applying noise measurement methods. The  methods that were compared are the Maximum Sound Level and the Sound  Exposure Levels methods used to measure the noise of a single event, and  the Equivalent Sound Level, the Day-Night Sound Level, the Community  Noise Equivalent Level, and the Time-Above methods used to measure the  levels of noise that nearby communities are exposed to. We discussed the  reliability of the Integrated Noise Model with FAA officials and found that  they had used appropriate methods\u2014including an independent  assessment\u2014to ensure the model\u2019s reliability for measuring noise  experienced at certain distances from the source.", "To address the third set of questions\u2014on aircraft noise standards\u2014we  reviewed the statutes, policies, and regulations governing noise levels for  civil subsonic jets, and we discussed these statutes, policies, and  regulations with FAA officials, representatives of the General Aviation  Manufacturers Association, the National Business Aviation Association,  and the Regional Aviation Association, and other experts. Through  interviews and document review, we identified activities under way in the  United States, Europe, and the International Civil Aviation Organization to  address the issue of a new level of more stringent aircraft noise  standards\u2014commonly referred to as \u201cstage 4\u201d noise standards. To  determine the number of aircraft weighing less than 75,000 pounds that  were not required to meet FAA\u2019s most recent aircraft noise standards, we  determined, from FAA\u2019s list of aircraft in the United States that it has  certified as airworthy, the number of civil subsonic jets weighing  75,000 pounds or less. To identify the noise standard that those aircraft met,  we reviewed FAA documentation identifying noise stages for certain  aircraft, Jane\u2019s All The World\u2019s Aircraft, and aircraft manufacturers\u2019  specifications for aircraft types. While we did not test the validity of FAA\u2019s  aircraft database, it is the only source for the information we sought.", "Finally, to address the fourth set of questions\u2014on FAA\u2019s Land Use Planning  Initiative\u2014we identified the overall objective of the Initiative, the initial  short-term actions that FAA announced in May 1999, and the status of FAA\u2019s  implementation of those actions. To determine if any issues were raised by  the Initiative, we reviewed and analyzed the public comments submitted in  response to FAA\u2019s request for comments and suggestions on its land use  planning effort under the Initiative, as well as published comments  analyzing the Initiative. We also interviewed officials at FAA, the Airports  Council International-North America, the National Association of State  Aviation Officials, and airport and community officials for Dulles  International Airport (a large hub without a completed noise compatibility  program) and Manassas Regional Airport (a general aviation airport with  an approved noise compatibility program), both in Virginia, and other  aviation experts to obtain their views.", "A panel of five experts reviewed the design and methodology for our work.

Once an airport applies for AIP funding, FAA sets  priorities for projects using two types of project selection criteria before  awarding the grants.  The PFC program is a more flexible funding source  than the AIP, in part because projects do not have to be part of an approved  noise compatibility program and because airports set their own priorities,  subject to FAA approval.

First, FAA applies a formula that assigns projects a numerical score from  0 to 100\u2014the higher the score, the higher the priority.

FAA officials have discretion  over the relative importance of the formula and other factors in deciding  the final ranking of projects.", "According to an FAA official, projects competing for AIP funds set aside for  noise-related projects are ranked on the basis of project type and airport  size because the values of the other two factors in the formula are the same  for all noise-related projects.  As a result, projects in areas with higher  noise exposure levels and for larger airports will score higher under the  formula than projects in areas with lower noise exposure levels and for  smaller airports.

The limits are intended to ensure that all airports that need  funding for noise-related projects have access to AIP funds.  The FAA  official explained that the agency has exceeded the limit for an airport  when sufficient funds were available to meet all demand and the airport  was able to document its ability to spend more in that year.

The higher the number of decibels, the louder the  sound appears to someone hearing it.  But because decibel levels are  measured logarithmically, an increase of only 10 decibels\u2014for example,  from 50 decibels to 60 decibels\u2014doubles the loudness that people believe  they hear.  Continuing the increase from 60 to 70 decibels would again  double the perceived loudness of the sound.

Thus, this method reflects both  the intensity and the duration of the sound that the takeoff or landing  produces.  For aircraft events, this method also usually uses A-weighted  decibels.

For each method, the key  factors that determine the noise exposure level affecting a community are  the types of aircraft using the airport, the number and type of engines on an  aircraft, the number of takeoffs and landings that occur during an average  day, and the time of day during which those aircraft operations occur.  The  measures are generally presented in the form of \u201cnoise contours\u201d on  maps\u2014lines around an airport that connect all the areas exposed to the  same average sound level.  A series of contours are drawn, usually at  5-decibel decrements from the airport, to produce a map that looks similar  to a land elevation map.  All three methods incorporate both the intensity  of sounds produced by single events and the average frequency of those  events.", "The first method\u2014the Equivalent Sound Level\u2014measures the average  noise level over a specified time using A-weighted decibels.  Because the  method is based on a logarithmic average, it gives greater weight to higher  noise levels than to lower ones.  For example, if sound is measured at  50 decibels for a half hour and 100 decibels for a half hour, the Equivalent  Sound Level measure for the entire hour is 97 decibels, not the 75 that  would result from simple averaging.  Any time period can be used, with  typical time periods being 1 hour, or 1 day (24 hours).  Under this method,  all flights are weighted equally regardless of when they occur during the  day.", "The second method\u2014the Day-Night Sound Level\u2014is the same as the  Equivalent Sound Level method for a 24-hour period, but it gives greater  weight to flights occurring during the nighttime\u2014between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Additional weight is given to nighttime flights because they are more  likely to interrupt sleep, relaxation, or other activities and because the  background noise level during those hours is lower.  To reflect that greater  impact, the Day-Night Sound Level method equates 1 nighttime aircraft  operation to 10 equivalent daytime operations.  This effectively adds 10 decibels to the noise produced by each takeoff or landing that occurs  during those nighttime hours.  That is, the noise impact of each single  nighttime takeoff or landing is reflected in the noise exposure level as if it  were 10 daytime takeoffs or landings.  For example, if eight takeoffs and  eight landings occur between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., they are reflected in the  noise exposure level as 16 aircraft operations.  If those same eight takeoffs  and eight landings all occur between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., they are reflected  in the noise exposure levels as the equivalent of 160 aircraft operations.", "Finally, the Community Noise Equivalent Level modifies the Day-Night  Sound Level method by adding additional weight to flights occurring  between the evening hours of 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. to account for an  assumption that greater interference with activities may be occurring  during the early evening than during the daytime.  The second and third  methods are considered to have only small differences.", "Under each of the three methods, several different combinations of flights  can produce the same noise exposure level because factors such as the  total number of flights and the type of aircraft affect the noise exposure  levels.

As figure 7 illustrates, the  Equivalent Sound Level method, which does not add weighting to evening  or nighttime flights, produced not only the smallest areas exposed to  various noise levels but also markedly smaller areas than the other two  methods, which include the effects of additional weighting.  The noise  contours produced by the Day-Night Sound Level method identified areas  that ranged from about 2-\u00bd times as large to 3-\u00bd  times as large as the areas  exposed to the same noise levels under the Equivalent Sound Level  method.  On the other hand, the size of the areas exposed to the same noise  levels were almost identical under the Day-Night Sound Level method and  the Community Noise Equivalent Level method.  The latter produced a  5 percent or less increase in the size of those areas.", "At our request, FAA also used our airport model to examine the results  from the different measurement methods when (1) flights were shifted by  time of day and (2) more aircraft operations were added.", "In the first scenario, our model illustrated the effect of assigning additional  weight to flights occurring during different times of the day.  In this  scenario, FAA calculated the noise exposure levels for seven different flight  schedules.  All three methods produced the exact same contours when all  flights occurred during the day because no method applies additional  weighting to daytime flights.  However, when all flights occurred during the  nighttime, both the Day-Night Sound Level and the Community Noise  Equivalent Level produced contours that quadrupled the size of the areas  exposed to the different noise levels.  Table  3 illustrates the impact of  changing flight schedules.", "In the second scenario, to understand how the number of aircraft  operations at an airport can affect the noise contours, we looked at the  results under each of the three methods, for seven cases in which the total  number of takeoffs and landings were increased at various increments.   The results showed that increasing the number of operations produced a  consistent increase in the size of the exposure area at each noise level  under each method.  That is, the greater the number of operations, the  further out each exposure level contour extended from the airport under  each method.  Consistent with the results illustrated in figure 7, the total  area affected by the Equivalent Sound Level method under each scenario  was noticeably smaller than that of the other two methods.

For example, communities  may prohibit the construction of schools within a certain distance from an  airport so that airport-related noise will not interrupt classes.  While the  federal government has no direct decision-making authority over land use  planning, FAA can nevertheless help communities consider the impact of  nearby airports as they develop their plans.  For example, the Aviation  Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 requires FAA to identify land uses  that would not be compatible with noise generated by the operation of a  nearby airport.  As a result, FAA identified some land uses, such as homes  and schools, as being incompatible with noise exposure levels of  65 decibels or higher (using the Day-Night Sound Level method) that occur  very close to an airport, while other land uses, such as industrial and  commercial uses, could successfully be located close to an airport without  interfering with activity.  Although FAA can provide land use planning  guidance, it is up to the state and to local communities to apply this  guidance.", "The recent transition to quieter aircraft can lower noise exposure levels in  some communities, but FAA has been concerned that noise levels may rise  again around some airports if the number of flights increase to meet the  expected growth in passenger levels.  According to an FAA official, even  where noise levels do not rise, maintaining a buffer zone between the  airport and certain land uses, such as homes and schools, serves a general  interest in maintaining a quieter environment.  Because of its concerns,  FAA embarked on a Land Use Planning Initiative to help state and local  governments achieve and maintain compatible land uses around airports.   Under this Initiative, in January 1995, FAA sponsored a Study Group on  Compatible Land Use, which was composed of community, airport, and  aviation representatives.  This group recommended federal actions that  could promote compatible land use planning around airports.  In May 1998,  FAA issued a request in the Federal Register for additional suggestions to  help state and local governments\u2019 planning efforts.  After reviewing the  submissions, FAA announced in May 1999 that it would implement five  short-term actions while it continued its review of other suggestions.  FAA  expects to announce additional actions in the future on training, education,  satellite navigation, research and development, and proposed legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Short-Term Actions Aim at Improving the Communication of Information", "paragraphs": ["The five short-term actions that FAA announced in May 1999 focus  primarily on improving the communication of its noise policies and noise  compatibility information in order to help communities and airports work  together to minimize the noise impacts of airports.

FAA has completed implementation of two of these  actions.  To establish the information clearinghouse, FAA created an  Internet website.  To provide a clearer understanding of its actions  addressing certain noise exposure situations, FAA issued revisions in June  1999 to its order that provides guidance on conducting environmental  impact analyses for airports.  The November implementation goal for the  remaining three actions was delayed until March 31, 2000, primarily  because FAA was reorganizing its Office of Environment and Energy, which  is responsible for the Land Use Planning Initiative.  As of April 26, 2000, an  FAA official expected the remaining actions to be implemented by  May 2000.", "The clearinghouse that FAA established on land use information can be  accessed at www.faa.gov/arp/app600/5054a/landuse.htm.

The website has links to information on Washington State\u2019s website  for its land use planning program and will eventually link to other states  that have similar websites.  It also incorporates links to websites for land  use planning associations, periodicals, and legal planning specialists.  FAA  plans to add information and/or links as warranted.", "FAA stated that the objectives of its fifth action include (1) providing  greater focus on the use of flight procedures to mitigate the effects of noise  over certain areas and (2) emphasizing consultations with airports and  communities.  FAA\u2019s overall goal is to clarify the actions it might take to  address rising noise exposure levels.  FAA\u2019s revised guidance, however,  does not appear to achieve its objective of providing greater focus on the  use of flight procedures because the revisions contain no explicit  discussion of the use of flight procedures to mitigate the effects of noise  over certain areas.

While FAA has  accomplished much in fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, the issues  raised in connection with FAA\u2019s Land Use Planning Initiative are not  necessarily new and show that more work remains to be done on resolving  controversies regarding airport-related noise.  Addressing these issues will  require balancing the needs of the different\u2014and often conflicting\u2014 interests of airports, airlines, manufacturers, passengers, general aviation,  and the communities near the airports.

These officials generally agreed with  the facts in the report and provided clarifying comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.  The National Association of State Aviation  Officials and the advisory panel of experts generally agreed with the facts  in the report and provided us with technical and clarifying comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.  The Airports Council International- North America provided no comments.", "We spoke with the President of the General Aviation Manufacturers  Association, who stated that the report reflects a good effort to make a  difficult topic understandable.  However, he said the Association had three  concerns about the accuracy of the presentation.  The Association believes  the draft report (1) implied that aircraft not subject to phased compliance  with operating noise limits were not subject to any noise standards, when  in fact, all aircraft manufactured after December 31, 1974, must meet  stage 3 noise standards; (2) did not explain that the exception of lighter  aircraft from compliance with stage 3 operating noise limits was consistent  with international operating rules developed by the International Civil  Aviation Organization; and (3) overestimated how many aircraft weighing  75,000 pounds or less still operate in the United States.  The Association  further believed the general aviation aircraft selected for our airport model  were not representative of the operating fleet.", "With regard to the Association\u2019s first concern, we believe the draft report  accurately explained the progressive application of noise standards to  aircraft.  However, we revised it to clarify the distinction between noise  standards for the certification of aircraft as airworthy and the application  of those standards to operating aircraft.  Regarding the second concern,  this report focuses on FAA\u2019s roles and responsibilities rather than on  international activities.  Nevertheless, we revised the draft report to clarify  that the United States is a member of the International Civil Aviation  Organization and as such participates in that organization\u2019s activities  regarding aircraft noise standards.  Concerning the final issue, data in our  draft report on the number of aircraft weighing 75,000 pounds or less  include all such aircraft certificated by FAA as airworthy as of October 1,  1999.  In contrast, data provided by the Association include only the  operating business fleet, which is a subset of FAA\u2019s list of certificated  aircraft.  With regard to our selection of aircraft for the model, we began  with the universe of certificated aircraft and selected two general aviation  aircraft from this list, as well as four others, to reflect both stage 2 and  stage 3 aircraft, and lighter and heavier aircraft.  We revised the draft report  to clarify that we selected aircraft from the list of certificated aircraft.", "We met with officials from the Air Transport Association of America, Inc.,  who stated that the draft report was generally very good, but who  expressed five concerns.  They believe the draft report (1) did not fully  recognize, in its discussion of the potential impact of growth in air traffic,  the significant progress that the Congress, FAA, airports, and the airlines  have made in reducing the number of people exposed to noise from  aircraft, nor did it recognize that aircraft used to achieve additional growth  may be quieter; (2) did not fully reflect the role of international agreements  and obligations related to noise control; (3) was overly broad in its  discussion of  flight procedures for abating noise when explaining why FAA  did not require aircraft weighing 75,000 pounds or less to be retired if they  did not meet stage 2 standards; (4) included only two aircraft in the airport  model, one of which is no longer being produced, and did not address  current production aircraft; and (5) did not fully reflect the relationship and  potential trade-offs between noise stringency standards and aircraft  emissions.  The Association also provided technical and clarifying  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "With regard to the first concern, we agree that the aviation industry and the  federal government have made substantial progress in reducing noise  generated by airports.  However, forecast growth in aviation activity could  reduce or eliminate the benefits at individual airports.  If current aircraft  are replaced with quieter aircraft, the impact of the quieter aircraft on  airport-related noise will depend on several factors including the extent to  which aircraft operations increase and when operations occur.  We revised  the draft report to clarify these points.", "With regard to the second issue, we agree that the international  administrative and regulatory framework for developing and implementing  aircraft noise standards is important for the aviation industry.  However,  this report focuses on FAA\u2019s role in major noise-related programs rather  than on international activities.  Nevertheless, we revised the draft report  to clarify that the United States is a member of the International Civil  Aviation Organization and as such participates in that organization\u2019s  activities regarding aircraft noise standards.", "Regarding the third concern, our draft report provided FAA\u2019s rationale for  not applying a retirement deadline to stage 1 aircraft weighing  75,000 pounds or less.  As noted in the report, FAA did not consider flight  operations to be an appropriate operational noise abatement procedure for  the purpose of meeting aircraft noise standards.  As also noted, however,  FAA did consider flight operations to be appropriate for further reducing  noise where circumstances warrant.  Accordingly, we did not revise this  discussion in our draft report.", "With regard to the fourth concern, the Association incorrectly concluded  that the airport model included only two aircraft.  As appendix V of the  report explains, the model was designed to provide a reasonable facsimile  of an airport for use in comparing and illustrating the various noise  measurement methods.  Six aircraft were selected from FAA\u2019s list of  certificated aircraft to represent categories of aircraft operations.  Aircraft  selection was not intended to include only those aircraft currently in  production because that would have eliminated stage 2 aircraft from the  model.", "With regard to the final concern, we revised the draft report to  acknowledge that reducing aircraft noise may result in higher aircraft  emissions."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
