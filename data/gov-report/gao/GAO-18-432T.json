For example, SSA's workloads are increasing due to 80 million baby boomers entering their disability-prone and retirement years, and institutional knowledge and leadership at SSA will be depleted due to an expected 21,000 employees retiring by the end of fiscal year 2022. GAO's prior work has identified related management challenges and opportunities for SSA to further modernize and improve its disability programs, service delivery, and information technology (IT) systems.", "Managing disability workloads and program integrity. SSA has long struggled to process disability claims and, more recently, appeals of denied claims, in a timely manner. Consistent with our 2013 recommendation, SSA produced a broad vision for improving service delivery, including ensuring prompt and accurate disability decisions. However, SSA is still developing concrete plans to implement its vision. Although SSA has initiatives underway to improve appeals backlogs, GAO reported that some of SSA's appeals initiatives are either contingent on additional funding or have met with limited success when tried in the past. GAO's prior work also identified other challenges related to SSA's disability programs, and actions SSA could take, for example, to modernize disability criteria, prevent and recover overpayments, and manage fraud risks.", "Modernizing physical infrastructure and service delivery. Advances in technology have the potential to change how and where SSA delivers its services. For example, individuals can now apply for some disability benefits online rather than in person. However, GAO found that SSA did not have readily available data on problems customers had with online applications or why staff support was needed. Additionally, the agency had not established performance goals to determine whether new service delivery options, such as off-site kiosks, are succeeding. In addition, we found that SSA has not developed a long-term plan for its building space that, among other things, includes a strategy for downsizing offices to better reflect changes in service delivery. We recommended SSA improve building plans and do more to assess and monitor service delivery, with which SSA agreed.", "Modernizing information technology. SSA's legacy IT systems are increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and GAO identified SSA's needed investment in infrastructure operations and maintenance as among the 10 largest expenditures at federal agencies in fiscal year 2015. GAO recommended SSA identify and plan to modernize or replace legacy systems, in accordance with forthcoming Office of Management and Budget guidance. SSA agreed, and reported that it is finalizing its Information Technology Modernization Plan.", "Continuing focus by SSA leadership is critical to addressing these broad and long-term challenges and effectively delivering benefits and services to the many Americans who depend on SSA programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss the significant management  challenges and structural issues currently facing the executive leadership  of the Social Security Administration (SSA).", "SSA is a vast enterprise responsible for providing benefits and services  that affect nearly every American at some point in their lives. In fiscal year  2017, SSA paid out nearly $1 trillion in Social Security retirement,  disability, and Supplemental Security Income benefits to 67 million  beneficiaries. While the services it provides are vitally important, SSA  faces significant demographic and technological challenges. For example,  as SSA noted in its 2018-2022 strategic plan and as we have previously  reported, SSA is experiencing increasing workloads due to 80 million  members of the baby boom generation entering their most disability- prone and retirement years. At the same time, SSA projects 21,000 of  its employees will retire by the end of fiscal year 2022, resulting in a loss  of institutional knowledge and impediments to succession management  and knowledge transfer. In addition, SSA noted that Americans are  increasingly relying on technology to access services while information  technology (IT) advances create opportunities for SSA to use  substantially different tools and approaches than it has in the past.", "We have issued a number of reports with recommendations addressing  shortcomings in how SSA has addressed these challenges. While SSA  has agreed with and taken action on many of our recommendations,  many others remain open, some of which we have suggested to SSA  should be given high priority. In addition, Social Security disability  programs are on our High Risk List due to persistent workload and other  challenges with processing disability claims. A common theme that cuts  across these issues is the need to modernize how SSA does business.  SSA has acknowledged the importance of modernization in its new strategic plan. The actions SSA leadership will need to take to modernize  the management of disability programs, facility planning and service  delivery, and information technology will require vision and sustained,  long-term attention.", "My testimony today summarizes the results from a number of our past  reports on SSA\u2019s operations and will focus on management challenges  and structural issues facing SSA in three key areas: 1) managing its  disability workloads and ensuring program integrity; 2) modernizing its  physical infrastructure and service delivery methods; and 3) modernizing  its information technology.", "In developing this testimony, we relied on reports that we have previously  issued.

SSA also published a plan in 2016 to  improve appeals timeliness that called for further hiring, improving  business processes, sharing workloads across offices, and making better  use of IT resources, such as increasing the number of video hearings.  However, SSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that many of the  initiatives in SSA\u2019s plan duplicated past efforts that had met with limited  success. SSA also noted that some efforts, such as additional hiring, will  depend on resource availability. We also reported that SSA is still  developing plans to implement its broad vision for service delivery, Vision  2025, which addresses SSA\u2019s capacity to provide timely initial claims and  appeals decisions.

SSA expects to have OIS in  place by 2020, and currently plans to update OIS information every 5  years thereafter. Regarding the medical criteria used to make disability  decisions, we reported in our 2017 high risk update that SSA had  published final rules for nearly all of the 14 body systems for adults and  was on track to update criteria for all body systems every 3 to 5 years.  While SSA has addressed all our recommendations in this area, other  opportunities exist for updating aspects of SSA\u2019s disability decision  process. For example, SSA officials have acknowledged that the  vocational rules it uses to determine eligibility may no longer accurately  reflect the nature and scope of work available in the national economy  and stated that the agency is conducting a review to determine if changes  to vocational factors are necessary.

SSA conducts various reviews to monitor the accuracy and  consistency of ALJ decisions, but SSA has not systematically evaluated  whether its reviews are effective. SSA has also struggled to sustain all of  its quality review efforts, in part, because SSA reassigned staff to help  expedite claims decisions. We also reported on shortcomings in SSA\u2019s  Compassionate Allowance initiative (CAL)\u2014which fast tracks disability  claims for severe medical conditions that are most likely to be approved\u2014 that could prevent claims from being consistently and accurately identified  for expedited processing.

In fiscal year 2015, the most  recent year for which we have data, SSA identified $1.2 billion in new  overpayments in its DI program, and had $6.3 billion in total overpayment  debt outstanding. In 2015, we reported that the SSA process for  beneficiaries to report earnings (and consequently inform whether they  remain eligible for DI benefits) had a number of weaknesses, including  staff not following established procedures, limited oversight, and a lack of  automated reporting options for beneficiaries, such as an automated  telephone system or smart phone app. SSA has made progress  expanding electronic work reporting, but these efforts will not eliminate  vulnerabilities caused by SSA\u2019s multi-faceted processes for receiving and  handling work reports, and will require additional management focus to  shore up internal controls and avoid unnecessary overpayments.", "Once overpayments do occur, SSA will endeavor to recover those  overpayments. However, we recently found that the collection of  overpayment debts warrants more attention than SSA has demonstrated  to date. In 2016, we reported that SSA\u2019s largest source of debt recovery  is withholding a portion of beneficiaries\u2019 monthly benefits payments.

We reported in 2017 that SSA  established a new office responsible for coordinating antifraud programs  across the agency, and had taken steps to gather information on some  fraud risks. However, we also found that SSA had not fully assessed its  fraud risks, had not developed an overall antifraud strategy to align its  efforts with those risks, and did not have a complete set of metrics to  determine whether its antifraud efforts are effective. SSA has already  taken action on one of our recommendations by producing a fraud risk  assessment, which we will evaluate, and has stated its intent to take  action on our other recommendations.

For example, we  found that despite progress reducing its square footage and the number  of occupied buildings, SSA\u2019s inflation-adjusted rental costs have  remained steady. SSA\u2019s ability to further reduce or enlarge its physical  space is constrained by rental markets, and by union and community  concerns. According to SSA officials, high rents, limited building stock  and complicated federal leasing processes present difficulties and  community needs and union concerns may further complicate relocating  offices.

Applications that are submitted online often  require follow-up contacts with applicants to obtain missing information,  according to SSA front-line staff. However, while SSA has taken steps to  make its online services more user-friendly, such as adding a click-to-chat  function for customers who run into problems, the agency does not  routinely collect data on the reasons for staff follow-ups with online  applicants. Such data are critical to SSA\u2019s efforts to further improve its  online applications and ultimately allow SSA to shift more of its business  online and further reconfigure its physical footprint.", "SSA would also benefit from establishing performance goals to help it  determine whether new service delivery options are succeeding. To help  address access challenges such as limited broadband internet in some  rural areas, SSA has rolled out self-service personal computers in field  offices, icons to link to SSA services on computers in public libraries and  video services accessed from senior centers. SSA also recently  completed a trial of customer service kiosks in seven SSA offices and  third-party locations. SSA staff in field offices reported some positive  impacts from these initiatives in terms of extending remote access to  certain populations, but also cited challenges, such as with customers\u2019  varying ability to use self-service computers.

For example, in 2012, a GAO review reported that SSA did not have an  updated IT strategic plan to guide its efforts and its enterprise architecture  lacked important content that would have allowed the agency to more  effectively plan its IT investments. In addition, SSA and others have  reported substantial difficulty in the agency\u2019s ability to implement its  Disability Case Processing System\u2014intended to replace 54 disparate  systems used by state Disability Determination Services\u2014citing software  quality and poor system performance as issues. Consequently, in June  2016, the initiative was placed on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) government-wide list of 10 high-priority programs requiring  attention. In February 2018, the SSA OIG completed an assessment of  an independent contractor\u2019s analysis of options for the system.

We also recommended OMB ensure that the Federal Chief Information Officer is directly involved in overseeing these high-priority  programs as past experience has shown that this oversight could improve  accountability and achieve positive results. OMB neither agreed nor  disagreed with our recommendations, and has not indicated whether it  will take action on these recommendations.", "Beyond the challenges identified in these previous reports, GAO\u2019s May  2016 report on federal agencies\u2019 IT legacy systems highlighted the  increasing costs that agencies, including SSA, may face as they continue  to operate and maintain at-risk legacy systems. We identified SSA\u2019s  investment in IT infrastructure operations and maintenance as being  among the 10 largest expenditures of federal agencies in fiscal year  2015. Further, we pointed out that legacy systems may become  increasingly expensive as agencies have to deal with issues such as  obsolete parts and unsupported hardware and software, and potentially  have to pay a premium to hire staff or engage contractors with the  knowledge to maintain outdated systems. For example, SSA reported re- hiring retired employees to maintain its systems that include many  programs written in Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL).  We highlighted a group of systems for determining retirement benefits  eligibility and amounts which were over 30 years old, with some written in  COBOL. We also noted that the agency had ongoing efforts to modernize  the systems but was experiencing cost and schedule challenges due to  the complexity of the legacy systems. We recommended that the agency  identify and plan to modernize or replace legacy systems, in accordance  with forthcoming OMB guidance. SSA agreed, and reported that it is  finalizing its Information Technology Modernization Plan.", "To its credit, SSA has made progress in consolidating and optimizing its  data centers. Specifically, in August 2017, we reported that, as of  February 2017, SSA was one of only two agencies that had met three of  the five data optimization targets established by OMB pursuant to  provisions referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition  Reform Act.
