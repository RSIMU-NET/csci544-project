State underestimated the increase in demand and consequently was not able to provide enough notice to the financial agent it uses for passport application payment processing for the agent to prepare for the increased workload, further adding to delays. As a result, reported wait times reached 10 to 12 weeks in the summer of 2007--more than double the normal wait--with hundreds of thousands of passports taking significantly longer. State had difficulty tracking individual applications and failed to effectively measure or communicate to applicants the total expected wait times, prompting many to re-apply and further straining State's processing capacity. State took a number of emergency measures and accelerated other planned efforts to increase its passport production capacity in 2007. For example, to help adjudicate passports, State established four adjudication task forces and deployed passport specialists to U.S. passport agencies severely affected by the surge. In addition, State accelerated hiring and expansion efforts. As a result of these efforts and the normal seasonal decline in passport applications, wait times returned to normal by October 2007. According to State estimates, these emergency measures cost $42.8 million. Although State has taken steps to improve its ability to respond to near-term surges in passport demand, it lacks a comprehensive strategy to improve long-term passport operations. State previously identified several deficiencies limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of passport operations, such as reliance on a paper-based work flow and ineffective communications, and these deficiencies were exposed by State's response to the surge. While State also identified a framework to guide its modernization efforts, it does not have a comprehensive plan to prioritize and synchronize improvements to its passport operations. A comprehensive strategy for making these improvements--for example, using a business enterprise approach--would better equip State to handle a significantly higher workload in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In early 2007, the Department of State (State) received a record number of  passport applications, resulting in lengthy delays in passport issuances,  which inconvenienced thousands of Americans.

State based its estimate partly on a survey of an  unrepresentative sample of land border crossers. This survey initially  estimated an increase over the baseline demand for passports of more  than 4 million applications in fiscal year 2007 due to implementation of the  first phase of WHTI. However, our analysis of the survey methodology  found several limitations. First, the survey was conducted in July 2005,  over a year before the beginning of fiscal year 2007 and roughly 2 years  before the peak of the surge in demand.

To refine its estimate, State adjusted the figures provided by the survey by  using monthly application trends from previous years.

State also  obtained an exemption from the Office of Personnel Management to the  hiring cap for civil service annuitants, so that it could rehire experienced  and well-trained retired adjudicators while it continued to recruit and train  new passport specialists. In addition, the department dispatched teams of  passport specialists to high-volume passport agencies to assist with walk- in applicants and process pending passport applications.

Public  counters at passport agencies were also opened on Saturdays for  emergency appointments, which were scheduled through State\u2019s  centralized customer service call center. In addition to increasing work  hours, State realigned workspace to make more room for adjudication  purposes. For example, passport agencies used training and conference  rooms to accommodate additional passport specialists. One passport  agency borrowed space from another government agency housed in the  same building to prescreen applicants. Some passport agencies that had  more than one shift instituted desk sharing among staff. In some instances,  because of the lack of workstations, adjudication staff also manually  adjudicated applications with a pen and paper and entered the  application\u2019s approval into State\u2019s information system at a later time.

First, Treasury  coordinated with State to amend the terms of its memorandum of  understanding with its financial agent responsible for passport application  data entry and payment processing, to increase the agent\u2019s lockbox  capacity. Specifically, under the revised memorandum, the financial agent  committed to processing up to 3 million applications per month at the  lockbox. According to Treasury officials, to increase its processing  capacity, the financial agent increased the number of its staff at the  lockbox facility from 833 in January 2007 to 994 in September 2007;  offered a pay incentive to increase the number of its employees working  overtime; and opened an additional lockbox facility\u2014operating 24 hours  a day, 7 days a week in three shifts. In addition, the financial agent  implemented some process improvements at the lockbox during the surge,  including automating data entry, presorting mail by travel date, and  implementing a new batching process to increase the number of  applications processed. The financial agent also increased the number of  scanners, the capacity of its application server and data storage, and the  bandwidth of its network to accommodate the heavy volume of passport  applications. In addition to the measures described above, Treasury and  State held weekly conference calls with the financial agent to discuss  concerns and determine various courses of action to clear the passport  application backlog.

The contractor\u2019s 2007  estimate of total demand for passports in 2008 was derived from (1) a land  border crosser survey to collect data on the impact of WHTI on passport  demand in 2008, and (2) a nationally representative panel survey of  41,000 U.S. citizens, which included data on overall passport demand,  including for sea and air travel and for nontravel identification purposes.

Several of these limitations were  exposed by State\u2019s response to the 2007 surge in passport demand, and  many of them remain unresolved. For example, the study found that  State\u2019s practice of manually routing the original paper passport application  through the issuance process\u2014including mailing, storage, management,  and retrieval of physical batch boxes containing paper applications\u2014 slowed the process, extended processing time, and made upgrade requests  difficult to handle. Due to the overwhelming number of applications  during the surge, a few passport agencies told us that there was no extra  space available at their facilities; according to agency officials, this  situation led to duplicative efforts. In addition, the study found that limited  information was available to management and that reporting tools, such as  Consular Affairs\u2019 Management Information System, could not produce  customized reports. Further, the study found that this system could not  provide information on the performance of its business partners, such as  acceptance facilities or the lockbox, resulting in data being available only  for applications that had been received at a passport agency. As a result,  during the surge, State was not immediately aware of the growing  workload at the lockbox. The study also found limitations in State\u2019s  communications, including challenges to communicating among passport  agencies, providing feedback to headquarters in Washington, and  conducting public outreach.

As part of this guide, the study identified key  factors that affected State\u2019s methods for conducting business and the  performance of passport operations. For example, the study identified  increased demand as one such factor, due to normal trends in passport  demand, the impact of WHTI implementation, and the passport\u2019s  increasing role as an identification document for everyday transactions.  To address these issues, the study suggests that State will have to take  steps such as redistributing workload through centralization to meet  increasing volumes\u2014State has begun to implement this suggestion by  establishing passport printing facilities in Arkansas and Arizona.  Additionally, the study notes that passport adjudication practices will  become an even more important part of combating terrorism and other  security concerns in the future, which will require State to utilize  technology and external data to improve its risk assessment and fraud  detection methods.

We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  to illustrate a relatively stable level of demand for passports between 1997  and 2003, followed by a significant increase in passport issuances since  2003.", "To determine whether State is prepared to more accurately estimate future  passport demand and has a comprehensive strategy in place to address  such demand, we assessed State\u2019s passport demand study for fiscal year  2008 and beyond, a draft report on lessons learned from the 2007 surge in  passport demand, and State\u2019s long-term road map for the future of  passport operations. We also reviewed prior GAO reports on enterprise  architecture and business systems management. In addition, we  interviewed Bureau of Consular Affairs officials in Washington and at the  regional passport agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 through July 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. State said that the 2005 study it commissioned to review existing  passport processes and propose recommendations for improving these  processes did not identify or mention deficiencies. We disagree. The  version of the study provided to us notes that it includes an \u201cassessment of  the deficiencies of the current state\u201d (p. 3) and identifies issues that \u201climit  the efficiency and effectiveness of passport operations\u201d (p. 4). These  deficiencies included the reliance on a manual, paper-based work flow,  ineffective communications, and inflexible passport systems.  2. We did not intend to suggest that the department should have adopted  all of the 2005 study\u2019s recommendations and have made slight  modifications to our finding to clarify this point. Our intent was to note  that the department has developed a variety of recommendations to  improve its passport operations\u2014many of which were developed by staff  in Consular Affairs\u2014but still needs a comprehensive strategy to prioritize  and synchronize the improvements it intends to undertake.  3. While our report recognizes that State has developed several plans  designed to increase passport production capacity, improving the  department\u2019s ability to respond to near-term increases in demand, these  plans are not the same as a comprehensive strategy for improving passport  operations. Our recommendation addresses State\u2019s need for such a  strategy to guide its modernization efforts, by using a business enterprise  approach, and not just to increase capacity.  4. State notes that it has improved its efforts to track the 72 percent of  passport applications it receives from U.S. Postal Service acceptance  facilities for accountability purposes. From a customer service standpoint,  we believe that the department should track all applications from the time  of execution in order to give the customer an accurate estimate of when to  expect his or her passport. Doing so would help eliminate customer  confusion, which contributed to the strain on State\u2019s customer service  operation experienced during the 2007 surge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Michael Courts (Assistant  Director), Robert Ball, Melissa Pickworth, and Neetha Rao made key  contributions to this report.
