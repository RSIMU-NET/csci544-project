For example, GAO reported that, in the response to Hurricane Katrina, there was confusion over roles and responsibilities under the National Response Plan, including the roles of the DHS Secretary, the FEMA Administrator, the Principal Federal Official (PFO), and the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO). The Post-Katrina Act clarified FEMA's mission within DHS and set forth the role and responsibilities of the FEMA Administrator. The act also required that the FEMA Administrator provide a clear chain of command that accounts for these roles. In revising the National Response Plan--now called the National Response Framework--FEMA articulated specific roles for the PFO and FCO, which are described in GAO's November 2008 report. GAO reported in September 2006 that various congressional reports and GAO's own work on FEMA's performance before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina suggested that FEMA's capabilities were insufficient to meet the challenges posed by the degree of damage and the number of hurricane victims. The capabilities issues GAO identified related to, among others, (1) emergency communications, (2) evacuations, (3) logistics, (4) mass care, (5) planning and training, and (6) human capital. The Post-Katrina Act included a variety of provisions that related to these issues. For example, related to emergency communications, the act established an Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) within DHS. GAO reported in November 2008 that, in response to specific responsibilities outlined in its authorizing provision, OEC has been working with Urban Area Working Groups and states to assess gaps in communications infrastructure and to determine technical requirements to enhance interoperable communications systems. GAO reported in February 2006 that accountability mechanisms--specifically, internal controls--were lacking or nonexistent in processing applications for individual and household assistance following Hurricane Katrina, which left the government vulnerable to fraud and abuse. For example, GAO estimated that through February 2006, FEMA made about 16 percent ($1 billion) in improper and potentially fraudulent payments to applicants who used invalid information to apply for disaster assistance. The Post-Katrina Act required the development of a system, including an electronic database, to counter improper payments. GAO reported in November 2008 that FEMA established a process to identify and collect duplicative payments by, among other things, enabling its disaster assistance database to check automatically for duplicate applications."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to strengthen emergency  management by implementing provisions of the Post-Katrina Emergency  Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act), which Congress  enacted in October 2006 to address shortcomings in the preparation for  and response to Hurricane Katrina. My remarks today are grounded in our  prior work on FEMA\u2019s and DHS\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina and the  actions they have taken to implement the Post-Katrina Act. In September  2006, we identified leadership, capabilities, and accountability as elements  that FEMA and DHS needed to strengthen to respond to catastrophic  disasters.

To conduct  our 2008 work about actions to implement provisions of the Post-Katrina  Act, we analyzed the text of the act and identified well over 300 discrete  provisions within the legislation that called for FEMA or DHS action to  implement requirements or exercise authorities. We reviewed agency  documents and discussed the act\u2019s implementation with numerous senior- level program officials at FEMA and DHS to identify the actions that had  been taken.

Beginning in February 2006, reports by the House Select Bipartisan  Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane  Katrina, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee, the White House Homeland Security Council, the DHS  Inspector General, DHS, and FEMA all identified a variety of failures and  some strengths in the preparation for, response to, and initial recovery  from Hurricane Katrina. Our findings about the response to Hurricane  Katrina in a March 2006 testimony and a September 2006 report focused  on the need for strengthened leadership, capabilities, and accountability to  improve emergency preparedness and response.", "The Post-Katrina Act was enacted to address various shortcomings  identified in the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina. The  act enhances FEMA\u2019s responsibilities and its autonomy within DHS. FEMA  is to lead and support the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive  emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response,  recovery, and mitigation. Under the act, the FEMA Administrator reports  directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security; FEMA is now a distinct  entity within DHS; and the Secretary of Homeland Security can no longer  substantially or significantly reduce the authorities, responsibilities, or  functions of FEMA or the capability to perform them unless authorized by  subsequent legislation. The act further directs the transfer to FEMA of  many functions of DHS\u2019s former Preparedness Directorate. The statute  also codified FEMA\u2019s existing regional structure, which includes 10  regional offices, and specified their responsibilities. It also contains a  provision establishing in FEMA a National Integration Center, which is  responsible for the ongoing management and maintenance of the National  Incident Management System (NIMS)\u2014which describes how emergency  incident response is to be managed and coordinated\u2014and the National  Response Plan (NRP)\u2014now revised and known as the National Response  Framework (NRF). In addition, the act includes several provisions to  strengthen the management and capability of FEMA\u2019s workforce. For  example, the statute calls for a strategic human capital plan to shape and  improve FEMA\u2019s workforce, authorizes recruitment and retention  bonuses, and establishes requirements for a Surge Capacity Force.", "The Post-Katrina Act extends beyond changes to FEMA\u2019s organizational  and management structure and includes legislative reforms in other  emergency management areas that were considered shortcomings during  Hurricane Katrina. For example, the Post-Katrina Act includes an  emergency communications title that requires, among other things, the  development of a National Emergency Communications Plan, as well as  the establishment of working groups within each FEMA region dedicated  to emergency communications coordination. The act also addresses  catastrophic planning and preparedness; for example, it charges FEMA\u2019s  National Integration Center with revising the NRF\u2019s catastrophic incident  annex, and it makes state catastrophic planning a component of one grant  program. In addition, the act addresses evacuation plans and exercises  and the needs of individuals with disabilities.", "In November 2008, we reported the actions FEMA and DHS had taken in  response to more than 300 distinct provisions of the Post-Katrina Act that  we had identified. We also reported on areas where FEMA and DHS still  needed to take action and any challenges to implementation that FEMA  and DHS officials identified during our discussions with them. In general,  we found that FEMA and DHS had made some progress in their efforts to  implement the act since it was enacted in October 2006. For most of the  provisions we examined, FEMA and DHS had at least preliminary efforts  under way to address them.

We further noted that the  experience of Hurricane Katrina showed the need to improve leadership at  all levels of government to better respond to a catastrophic disaster.  Specifically, we reported that in the response to Hurricane Katrina there  was confusion regarding roles and responsibilities under the NRP,  including the roles of the Secretary of Homeland Security and two key  federal officials with responsibility for disaster response\u2014the Principal  Federal Official (PFO), and the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Updating the National Response Framework and Clarifying the Role of the FEMA Administrator", "paragraphs": ["The Post-Katrina Act clarified FEMA\u2019s mission within DHS and set forth  the role and responsibilities of the FEMA Administrator.
