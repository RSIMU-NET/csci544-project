The policy calls for imposing administrative, rather than criminal, sanctions on first-time violators who do not otherwise have criminal histories. In October 1995, the Attorney General appointed the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California as her Special Representative for Southwest Border Issues. This collateral responsibility includes coordinating the border law enforcement activities of various Justice Department agencies, including INS, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the activities undertaken by the Departments of the Treasury and Defense.", "The Department of State also has a role in deterring illegal entry along the southwest border.

We interviewed INS officials from the five INS district offices responsible for all of the ports of entry along the southwest border, INS Inspections officials from seven ports of entry, and Customs officials from five ports of entry. In addition, we analyzed INS\u2019 Border Patrol and Inspections workload and apprehension data, reviewed documents pertaining to INS\u2019 management priorities, and reviewed INS intelligence reports and previous reports done by us and the Department of Justice\u2019s Inspector General. We did not verify the validity of INS computer generated data related to workload and apprehension statistics. However, we discussed with INS officials their data validation efforts.

The strategy was to involve concentrating new resources on the front lines at the most active points of illegal activity along the southwest border.", "To carry out the priority to strengthen the border, the Border Patrol was to, among other things, (1) concentrate personnel and technology resources in a four-phased approach, starting first with the sectors with the highest level of illegal immigration activity (as measured by apprehensions) and moving to the areas with the least activity; (2) make maximum use of physical barriers to deter entry along the border; (3) increase the proportion of time Border Patrol agents spent on border control activities; and (4) identify the appropriate quantity and mix of technology and personnel needed to control the border.", "Recognizing that increased enforcement by the Border Patrol might force some aliens to try to enter the United States illegally through the ports of entry, the strategy calls for INS\u2019 Inspections program to increase the number of inspectors and the use of technology to both deter and detect illegal entry and improve management of legal traffic and commerce. For example, to deter illegal entry the strategy called for increasing the number of illegal aliens referred for prosecution and testing automated fingerprint technology to detect inadmissible aliens. To improve management of legal traffic, the strategy called for providing the public with more information so they would be better prepared for the inspection process.", "In concert with INS\u2019 efforts to deter illegal entry, the strategy calls for increasing felony prosecutions of alien smugglers and those criminal aliens who have repeatedly reentered the United States after having been removed.", "In addition, the 1996 Act requires the Attorney General to take additional border control measures to deter illegal entry into the United States.

In September 1997, Border Patrol officials told us that the Border Patrol had nearly completed phase I of the strategy, which called for allocating Border Patrol resources to the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas, sectors. They stated that the Border Patrol was now moving into phase II of the strategy, which called for increasing resources in the Tucson, Arizona, sector and three sectors in south Texas\u2014Del Rio, Laredo, and McAllen. INS officials told us they could not speculate as to when they would complete the remaining aspects of the strategy, that called for focusing resources in the remaining three sectors along the southwest border (phase III) and the sectors along the rest of the U.S. land border and coastal waterways (phase IV).", "As part of phase I of the strategy, in October 1994, INS launched a major initiative in San Diego called Operation Gatekeeper. This multiphase, multiyear operation was designed to reduce illegal immigration into San Diego and to force alien traffic eastward to deter and delay illegal aliens\u2019 attempts to reach urban areas. Resources added to the area as a result of Gatekeeper included new Border Patrol agents and support staff, new inspectors at the San Ysidro port of entry, new computers and technology to maximize efficiency, and new resources for the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California to increase its capability to prosecute criminal aliens. Gatekeeper focused first on the area of the greatest illegal immigration activity\u2014the 5-mile stretch of Imperial Beach, California. The next phase, which began in June 1995, included intensified enforcement at the San Ysidro port of entry and the rural parts of the San Diego sector. In December 1994, we reported that on the basis of initial positive results, the strategy appeared encouraging.", "In August 1997, INS began the next major phase of its strategy by concentrating resources in the McAllen sector, starting first in Brownsville, Texas. Named Operation Rio Grande, INS plans to add agents and equipment, such as high-powered vision scopes and stadium type lighting, to the McAllen sector to deter illegal entry.", "The Border Patrol has generally allocated its additional resources in accordance with the strategy and has made progress in constructing barriers along the southwest border. However, the agents\u2019 percentage of time spent on border enforcement has not increased in most southwest border sectors since 1994, and the Border Patrol has yet to determine the best mix of agents and technology on which to base future staffing allocations. INS\u2019 Inspections program has deployed additional inspectors to the southwest border and is in the process of pilot testing various technology initiatives designed to deter illegal entry and streamline the inspections process. In addition, the U.S. Attorneys in the five districts along the southwest border increased the number of prosecutions for certain immigration violations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Border Patrol Has Generally Allocated New Agents and Other Resources in Accordance With Strategy", "paragraphs": ["With some exceptions, the Border Patrol was generally able to allocate its additional resources according to the strategy, allocating first to sectors with the highest level of known illegal immigration activity. In fiscal year 1993, the San Diego and El Paso sectors had the highest levels of apprehensions of illegal immigrants, accounting for 68 percent of all apprehensions along the southwest border. In fiscal year 1994, INS received funding for an additional 350 agents and assigned these new agents to San Diego and El Paso, the sectors with the highest priority. Three hundred agents were allocated to the San Diego sector and 50 to the El Paso sector.", "The strategy noted that the Border Patrol needed to be flexible to respond to changing patterns in illegal alien traffic. According to INS officials, the Border Patrol began to notice \u201calmost immediately\u201d an increase in apprehensions in other sectors, particularly Tucson and those in south Texas (Del Rio, McAllen, and Laredo). INS officials attributed this increase in apprehensions in other sectors to a \u201cshift\u201d in the flow of illegal alien traffic as it became more difficult to cross illegally in San Diego and El Paso. Consequently, in fiscal year 1995, the Border Patrol deployed some of the additional agents funded that year and originally planned for San Diego and El Paso to the Tucson and south Texas sectors, the sectors with the next highest priority after San Diego and El Paso.", "According to Border Patrol officials, deploying additional agents in a phased manner was a new approach. Prior to the strategy, as additional positions became available, the Border Patrol tried to allocate at least a few additional positions to as many of the 21 sectors as possible. However, under the strategy, 98 percent (or 2,792) of the 2,850 new Border Patrol agent positions nationwide authorized from fiscal year 1994 through fiscal year 1997 have gone to 6 of the 21 Border Patrol sectors. INS allocated 1,235 (about 43 percent) of these positions to the San Diego sector and 351 (about 12 percent) to the El Paso sector, sectors with the highest priority. Nearly all of the remaining 1,264 went to the Tucson and the south Texas sectors, the sectors with the next highest priority (see fig. 3).", "As shown in figure 4, the additional allocations have resulted in an increase in on-board staff in most southwest border sectors. Overall, the number of Border Patrol agents on board along the southwest border increased 76 percent between October 1993 and July 1997.", "To complement the increase in staffing, southwest border sectors have also received additional technology, equipment, and infrastructure improvements in accordance with the Border Patrol strategy. For example, between October 1994 and October 1996, the San Diego sector added almost 5 miles of permanent high-intensity lighting, 8 miles of reinforced steel fencing, 28 infrared scopes (a night-vision device), and 3 helicopters to detect illegal entry. El Paso sector officials told us they received six additional infrared scopes and expected to receive five more soon, and in March 1997, the sector completed a 3.5 mile fencing project. INS purchased a building for a new Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona, to house the increased number of new agents.", "In March 1997, the Border Patrol submitted a 5-year staffing plan to Congress covering fiscal years 1996 through 2000. The plan calls for adding between 1,500 and 2,500 additional Border Patrol agents in fiscal years 1998 through 2000. This is fewer than the 3,000 additional agents whom the 1996 Act authorized INS to hire over the 3-year period because, according to INS officials, they were concerned that their staff was growing faster than they could properly manage and that they did not have an adequate infrastructure (facilities, equipment, training, and supervisory capacity) to absorb 3,000 new agents. INS plans to assign two-thirds of the new agents to Arizona and Texas; the remainder will go to states along the northern border and Gulf Coast."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress in Installing Barriers Between Ports of Entry", "paragraphs": ["One of the main efforts outlined in the strategy is the \u201cmaximum utilization of lighting, fencing, and other barriers\u201d by all sectors, although the strategy did not outline specific barrier projects or miles of fencing to be built. A 1993 border control study, commissioned by the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy (Sandia Study), recommended fencing and in some cases vehicle barriers in every southwest border patrol sector to deter illegal entry. While INS has not formally endorsed all of the Sandia Study recommendations, INS Headquarters Border Patrol officials told us that some recommendations, such as erecting 90 miles of barriers along the southwest border, are valid. These officials told us that, while adding barriers is part of the strategy, INS has left it up to each sector chief to propose where and when to build barriers. Seven of the nine sector plans written to carry out the strategy cite the need for barriers to increase agents\u2019 effectiveness in apprehending illegal aliens and reducing crime. According to INS officials, proposals for barrier projects are reviewed in the context of INS\u2019 budget process; require consultation with Congress; and must be coordinated with the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Task Force Six, the military unit that constructs much of the fencing for INS.", "Congress has also emphasized the need for additional fencing. The 1996 Act requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner of INS, to take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the U.S. border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States. In carrying out this provision in the San Diego sector, the 1996 Act requires the Attorney General to provide for second and third fences, in addition to the existing reinforced fence, and for roads between the fences for the 14 miles of the international land border of the United States extending eastward from the Pacific Ocean.", "INS has allocated $8.6 million of its fiscal year 1996 and 1997 appropriations to complete the first two phases of the triple fencing project in the San Diego sector. Of the $8.6 million allocated, about $4.3 million had been obligated for expenditure as of July 1997. According to a San Diego sector official, INS is in the process of acquiring the property upon which to build the fencing and conducting environmental assessment reports, before construction can begin in certain areas. Figure 5 depicts bollard-type (concrete cylindrical columns set in a staggered manner) fencing which is being constructed in the area immediately inland from the Pacific Ocean in the San Diego sector.", "Prior to 1994, very little substantial fencing existed\u2014about 14 miles of reinforced steel fencing in the San Diego sector. Since the strategy was announced, INS has built approximately 32 miles of new fencing in five sectors. As of July 1997, nearly 24 miles of additional fencing was under construction. Most of the fencing constructed, under construction, or planned to be built is in the San Diego sector. Currently, no barriers exist or are planned to be built in four Texas sectors (Marfa, Del Rio, Laredo, and McAllen). However, two of these sectors (Laredo and McAllen) had indicated a need for barriers in their sector plans. INS officials cited the need to overcome community concerns as a reason why they have not built more barriers.", "The majority of the fencing construction along the southwest border has been accomplished by the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Task Force Six and, to a lesser degree, the National Guard. The military provides the personnel to construct the fencing and pays for their salaries, transportation, meals, and housing. INS typically pays for building materials (although steel runway landing mats are provided at no cost because they are military surplus) and other costs, such as equipment rental. INS employees, such as repair and maintenance staff, also help with the construction. In a few instances, private contractors have been hired by INS to construct particular types of fencing, such as the bollard fencing project in the San Diego sector. However, INS officials stated that the use of private contractors is much more costly to INS than using military assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proportion of Time Spent on Border Enforcement Did Not Increase in Most Southwest Border Sectors", "paragraphs": ["The strategy called for an increasing border enforcement activity, as measured by the proportion of time Border Patrol agents spent on border enforcement.

However, this proportion of time spent on border enforcement activities was the same as that in fiscal year 1994. Although the proportion of time spent on border enforcement activities did not increase during this period, the total number of hours spent by all Border Patrol agents on border enforcement activities along the southwest border has been increasing since fiscal year 1994, because the overall number of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southwest border sectors increased.", "In five of the nine southwest border sectors, the proportion of time that Border Patrol agents spent on border enforcement in the first half of fiscal year 1997 was within 2 percentage points (plus or minus) of what it was in fiscal year 1994. In two sectors, Tucson and El Paso, the proportion of time spent on border enforcement decreased by 7 and 13 percentage points, respectively. In two other sectors, San Diego and Marfa, it increased by 7 and 10 percentage points, respectively (see fig. 6).", "INS officials reported that an increase in the amount of time spent on program support activities such as supervision, training, and processing apprehended aliens, as well as possible reporting errors, could have hindered increasing the overall percentage of time spent on border control activities. For example, during fiscal year 1994, the El Paso sector spent 20 percent of its time on program support compared with 33 percent during the first half of fiscal year 1997, an increase of 13 percentage points. During this same time period, the Tucson sector\u2019s percentage of time on program support increased from 41 percent to 50 percent, an increase of 9 percentage points.", "Consistent with the strategy, southwest border sectors have redirected Border Patrol agents from general enforcement activities back to border control. For example, the San Diego sector reduced the proportion of time spent on general enforcement from 4 percent in fiscal year 1994 to less than 1 percent for the first half of fiscal year 1997. The Marfa sector reduced the proportion of time spent on general enforcement from 14 percent to 2 percent during this same time period. As a result, Marfa increased its border enforcement percentage although it did not receive additional staff during this period.", "Servicewide, the proportion of time spent on border enforcement declined from 56 percent in fiscal year 1994 to 50 percent in the first half of fiscal year 1997. Thus, the performance of INS as a whole on this measure declined rather than increased as intended. INS has lowered its expectations regarding the percentage of time, servicewide, that it expects its Border Patrol agents to spend on border enforcement.

As of March 1997, 1,275 inspectors were on board at land ports of entry along the southwest border (see fig. 8).", "INS has begun testing a number of programs and systems to increase deterrence to illegal entry and improve and streamline the inspection process. These efforts are intended to prevent illegal aliens and criminal violators from entering the United States and facilitate the entry of legal travelers. To accomplish these objectives, INS is using technology to segment people seeking admission by risk category and forming strategic partnerships with others concerned with border management, such as the Customs Service, local communities, and the Mexican government. INS is also planning to measure its effectiveness in detecting illegal entry attempts.", "According to port-of-entry officials, the additional INS inspectors have enabled INS to staff more inspection booths at peak hours, and allowed both INS and Customs to increase enforcement efforts and undertake some new initiatives to deter illegal entry. For example, inspectors at some ports of entry are spending more time inspecting vehicles before they reach the inspection booth to detect concealed drugs or smuggled aliens.", "INS believes that increased sanctions will result in deterring illegal aliens from attempting to enter the United States fraudulently. In response to an increase in attempted fraudulent entries at ports of entry in the San Diego area, the Justice Department established the first permanent immigration court facility to be located at a port of entry. The \u201cport court,\u201d located at the Otay Mesa port of entry, began as a pilot project in July 1995 and was made permanent in October 1995. This program was intended to eliminate costly and time-consuming transportation of aliens to the immigration court in downtown San Diego and allowed for the immediate implementation of the immigration judge\u2019s order of exclusion and deportation.", "In addition, INS inspectors in San Diego worked with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California to develop a program intended to increase prosecutions of persons attempting to enter the United States fraudulently. However, the ability to prosecute may be hampered by the limited availability of detention space, according to Inspections officials. Provisions in the 1996 Act that took effect April 1, 1997, provide for the expedited removal of certain aliens who attempt fraudulent entry. INS officials believe these provisions may also help deter attempted fraudulent entry.", "INS has several pilot projects under way that use technology to try to segregate low- and high-risk traffic and streamline the inspections process. In the San Diego area, a dedicated commuter lane is in operation. INS authorizes certain frequent crossers and their vehicles to enter the United States through a preclearance process. Through an automated photo identification and card system, registered vehicles and occupants can pass through the port of entry quickly. INS is testing other technology, including automated vehicle license-plate readers to check vehicles against law enforcement lookout databases and a system which uses palm prints and fingerprints to verify the identity of individuals in order to reduce passenger processing time.", "In addition, according to INS headquarters and most port officials we interviewed, INS and Customs have increased cooperation between their agencies and are working together to manage the ports in a more efficient manner. In 1993, we reported on the lack of cooperation and coordination of border crossing operations as well as a long history of interagency rivalries between INS and Customs. We recommended that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), working with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, develop and present to Congress a proposal for ending the dual management of border inspections. As a result of our report, INS and Customs formed Port Quality Improvement Committees (PQIC) at selected ports of entry, including some along the southwest border. A 1996 follow-up report on the Vice President\u2019s National Performance Review indicated that the PQIC structure encouraged and strengthened cooperation and communication among officers of all federal inspection service personnel. In addition, Customs and INS reviews have found that better coordination and improved services have been achieved through PQICs. Four of the ports we visited (San Ysidro, El Paso, Nogales, and Brownsville) had PQICs and had implemented various cooperative initiatives to facilitate border crossing (e.g., increased cross-training). We did not independently assess whether the PQICs have resulted in better coordination and cooperation between INS and Customs because such an assessment was beyond the scope of this review.", "As part of its efforts to measure performance, as required by the Results Act, INS plans full implementation in fiscal year 1998 of a port performance measurement system, which is to include randomly selecting applicants who seek to cross into the United States and processing them through a more rigorous inspection.

According to an INS analysis of seasonally adjusted San Diego sector apprehension data from October 1992 to March 1997 (see fig. 9), monthly sector apprehensions were on a downward trend from February 1993 through December 1994. In January 1995, 3 months after the sector began applying Operation Gatekeeper resources in the western part of the San Diego sector, apprehensions began increasing. Apprehensions continued to increase for about 1 year. Beginning in January 1996, apprehensions started to decline and continued to do so through March 1997 (the end point of the INS analysis). The last decline in apprehensions coincided with the addition of Border Patrol agents, barriers, and technology to areas of the San Diego sector that were east of the original Gatekeeper effort.", "It is difficult to determine whether the increase in apprehensions experienced in 1995 is due to increased enforcement or other factors. In December 1994, the Mexican government devalued the peso. According to INS officials and INS reports, apprehensions in the San Diego sector could have increased in part due to the strategy and in part due to an increase in illegal flow resulting from poor economic conditions in Mexico and the associated devaluation of the peso. It is also difficult to determine whether the decline in apprehensions that began in January 1996 was part of the original downward trend predicted by the strategy or a specific result of the spring initiative\u2014INS\u2019 1996 enhancement to Operation Gatekeeper\u2014in which additional resources were applied to the eastern parts of the San Diego sector.", "In El Paso, the pattern of apprehensions following implementation of a separate border enforcement initiative, Operation Hold the Line, differed from that of San Diego. In this operation, begun in September 1993, the sector redeployed its agents directly to a 20-mile section of the border in the metropolitan El Paso area adjoining Ciudad Juarez in Mexico and maintained a high-profile presence that was intended to deter illegal aliens from attempting to cross the border. According to an INS analysis of seasonally adjusted apprehension data, apprehensions decreased in the El Paso sector immediately after the initiative was launched, and after declining for a period of 1 month, apprehensions began to increase (see fig. 10). Although the Border Patrol has continued Operation Hold-the-Line and added new agents to the sector between fiscal years 1994 and 1997, apprehension levels began to increase in November 1993, and have generally continued to do so through March 1997, although remaining at levels below those that existed before September 1993."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shift in Illegal Alien Traffic", "paragraphs": ["The Border Patrol strategy directed additional enforcement resources first to the San Diego and El Paso sectors, where the majority of illegal entries have historically occurred. INS expected that the flow of illegal alien traffic would shift from San Diego and El Paso to other sectors as control was achieved. Our analysis of INS apprehension data indicate that a shift in apprehensions has occurred. As shown in figure 11, in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1993 the San Diego and El Paso sectors accounted for 68 percent of all southwest border apprehensions. However, during the first 6 months of fiscal year 1997, San Diego and El Paso accounted for 33 percent of all southwest border apprehensions. Other sectors now account for a larger share of the apprehensions. For example, in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1993, the Tucson sector accounted for 7 percent of all southwest border apprehensions. During the first half of fiscal year 1997, the sector\u2019s share rose to 19 percent. The proportion of southwest border apprehensions of the three south Texas sectors\u2014McAllen, Laredo, and Del Rio\u2014rose from 19 percent to 37 percent over the same period.", "The Border Patrol\u2019s enforcement posture aimed to reduce illegal entries into large urban areas, thereby, forcing illegal alien traffic to use rural routes where the Border Patrol believes it has a tactical advantage. Our analysis of INS apprehension data shows that within the San Diego, El Paso, and Tucson sectors, apprehensions have decreased in areas that have received greater concentrations of enforcement resources and increased in more remote areas. As shown in figure 12, in the San Diego sector, the stations of Imperial Beach and Chula Vista, which provide the shortest established routes to urban San Diego, accounted for 61 percent of the sector apprehensions in the first half of fiscal year 1993. In the first half of fiscal year 1997, these two stations accounted for 39 percent of the sector\u2019s apprehensions. Conversely, in the other stations, largely in rural sections of the sector, the share of total apprehensions increased from 39 percent to 61 percent over the same time period.", "In the El Paso sector, the proportion of apprehensions in the urban El Paso station dropped from 79 percent of all sector apprehensions in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1993, to 30 percent in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1997, as shown in figure 13. A 1994 study commissioned by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform concluded that Operation Hold-the-Line appeared to have substantially deterred some types of illegal crossers but not others. Using official statistics on apprehensions and crossings at the ports of entry (e.g., police and crime data, birth and hospital data, education and school attendance statistics, sales tax and general sales data) and qualitative information from in-depth interviews with government officials and persons at border crossing sites in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, the study concluded that the operation had been more successful in curtailing illegal immigration among aliens who crossed illegally from Ciudad Juarez to engage in illegal work or criminal activity in El Paso (local crossers) than among aliens who crossed at El Paso but were headed for other U.S. destinations (long-distance labor migrants). According to the study, a substantial amount of long-distance labor migration appeared to have been diverted to other locations along the southwest border. Border Patrol officials in the El Paso sector told us in March 1997 that the majority of illegal aliens entering the sector were long-distance migrants, so they believed that their enforcement efforts were continuing to deter local crossers.", "Apprehension data also provide some support that a shift occurred in illegal alien traffic from the urban area of Nogales, Arizona, targeted by the Border Patrol in the first phase of its enforcement strategy in the Tucson sector, to other stations in the sector. As shown in figure 14, in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1993, the Nogales station accounted for 39 percent of all sector apprehensions. In the first 6 months of fiscal year 1997, the station accounted for 28 percent of all sector apprehensions. Over this same period, apprehensions have increased in the city of Douglas, Arizona, from 27 percent to 43 percent of all sector apprehensions.", "Other information also indicates that there has been a shift in alien traffic. According to an INS report on Operation Gatekeeper, data from INS\u2019 automated fingerprinting system, known as IDENT, showed that illegal aliens were less likely to try to cross in Imperial Beach in January 1995 than in October 1994. According to an April 1996 report summarizing the results from an INS Intelligence conference held in the Del Rio sector, potential illegal aliens had been channeled away from the U.S. urban areas on the southwest border to more inhospitable areas. The report stated that a sizeable number of apprehensions were being made in extremely desolate areas of the border, and this was taken to be an indication that illegal aliens were trying to avoid Border Patrol deployments. However, according to the report, INS lacked the resources to apprehend aliens traversing the remote areas. The report suggested that the Border Patrol should not abandon its high-visibility deterrent posture in the urban areas to respond to the remote areas because it would encourage a return to the earlier entry patterns.", "According to some INS sector officials, shifts in illegal alien traffic have had a negative effect in their sectors. For example, according to a January 1997 Laredo sector report, continued media coverage of Operations Hold-the-Line and Gatekeeper have discouraged entries in those areas and made Laredo vulnerable to would-be crossers. Border Patrol officials in the Del Rio sector told us in May 1997 that because of substantial increases in illegal alien entry attempts and limited resources, the sector had limited success in controlling the two main corridors within the sector. According to INS headquarters officials, such shifts in illegal traffic are not failures of the strategy; rather, they are interim effects.", "The strategy has also produced some effects that INS did not anticipate. INS officials told us that they were in some cases caught unaware by some of the changes in illegal alien traffic and the tactics of illegal crossers. For example, INS Western Region officials told us that the increases in illegal alien traffic that they predicted would occur in the Tucson, Arizona, and McAllen, Texas, sectors happened earlier than they expected. According to these officials and San Diego sector officials, the mountains in the eastern section of the San Diego sector were expected to serve as a natural barrier to entry.

Officials from the San Diego district told us that they had seen large increases in attempts to enter the United States using fraudulent documents or making false claims to U.S. citizenship immediately following the increase of resources to the Border Patrol in the San Diego sector. According to San Diego district inspections data, the number of fraudulent documents intercepted increased about 11 percent from fiscal year 1994 to 1995 (from about 42,000 to about 46,500), and the number of false claims to U.S. citizenship increased 26 percent (from about 15,400 to about 19,400). Officials in El Paso told us they uncovered more fraudulent documents after the initiation of Operation Hold-the-Line. El Paso district inspections data show a steady increase in the number of fraudulent documents intercepted from fiscal year 1994 (about 8,200) through fiscal year 1996 (about 11,000). The Del Rio intelligence conference report stated that Border Patrol enforcement efforts had forced more people to attempt entry fraudulently through the ports of entry. Officials from the Phoenix district, however, told us that they had not seen any significant change in the number of fraudulent documents intercepted at Arizona ports of entry, as the Border Patrol resources increased in the Tucson, Arizona sector.", "INS Western Region and San Diego District officials told us that they had not expected the volume of people trying to enter illegally at the ports of entry in the San Diego areas to be as large as it was after Operation Gatekeeper or the tactics illegal aliens chose to try to get past the inspectors. For example, at various times during 1995, illegal aliens gathered at the entrance to the San Ysidro port of entry and attempted to overwhelm inspectors by running in large groups through the port. INS created emergency response teams at the port to deal with these unexpected tactics and added bollards and other physical barriers to make unimpeded passage more difficult. In addition, INS asked Mexican government officials to help prevent large gatherings on the Mexican side of the border. During our visit to San Ysidro in March 1997, INS officials told us that due to these actions, large groups of port-runners were no longer a problem.", "It is difficult to determine whether the increases in number of fraudulent documents intercepted and false claims to U.S. citizenship were a result of actual increases in illegal entry attempts at the ports or greater efforts made to detect fraud. The 1994 U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform evaluation of Operation Hold-the-Line noted that INS inspectors at the ports of entry in El Paso began checking documents more closely after the Border Patrol instituted the operation, which may have contributed to the increase in recorded illegal entry attempts.", "INS headquarters officials disagreed with these findings. They stated that they believed that inspectors in El Paso were exposed to heavier traffic flows after the operation began and, therefore, inspectors could have compensated for the increased workload by doing more cursory reviews of documents. These headquarters officials stated that increases in detected fraud reflected actual increases in fraudulent entry attempts, which were a response to heightened enforcement between the ports of entry caused by the Border Patrol\u2019s implementation of Operation Hold-the-Line."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alien Smuggling", "paragraphs": ["INS expected that if successful, its enforcement efforts along the southwest border would make it more difficult and costly for illegal aliens and alien smugglers to cross the border.

On the basis of testimony of the U.S. Attorney for Southern California, INS evaluation reports on enforcement efforts in San Diego, and INS intelligence reports, fees paid by illegal aliens to smugglers have increased substantially. Fees for smuggling illegal aliens across the southwest border have reportedly tripled in some instances and may be as high as several thousand dollars for transportation to the interior of the United States.", "Intelligence assessments by INS\u2019 Central Region in April and October 1996 concluded that smugglers had become more sophisticated in their methods of operation. The assessments said that smugglers were more organized and were transporting aliens further into the interior of the United States. Similarly, officials from the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform told us that their examination of alien smuggling along the southwest border indicated a trend toward more organized smuggling.", "INS sector officials and documents have reported that changes in alien smuggling patterns may be having a negative impact in some sectors. According to a June 1996 Laredo sector intelligence assessment, due to the success of Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold-the-Line, as well as increased personnel in the McAllen sector, alien smuggling had increased in the sector. The assessment further stated that limited manpower caused deterrence to be \u201cnegligible\u201d and, consequently, alien smugglers crossed virtually at any point along the Rio Grande River beyond the area where the sector focused its enforcement resources. According to the report from the Del Rio intelligence conference, the increased use of organized smuggling may make INS\u2019 mission more difficult. For example, most of the alien smuggling organizations were reportedly \u201clong-haul\u201d groups transporting aliens to interior work sites via interstate highways.

However, due to the length of time that it is taking INS to deploy the IDENT system in field locations, difficulties in getting agents to use IDENT or use it properly, and computer problems, IDENT to date has provided limited information on recidivism.", "According to INS\u2019 fiscal year 1998 budget request, IDENT systems were to be installed in 158 fixed locations along the southwest border by the end of fiscal year 1997. As of October 1, 1997, however, only 140 of these locations had an IDENT system in place. Of the nine southwest border sectors, only the San Diego and El Centro sectors had an IDENT system installed in every fixed location. Even when IDENT has been installed, according to INS sector officials, it has not always been put in locations where aliens are apprehended. One of the reasons given for not installing IDENT in these locations is that it depends on telephone hookup to a central database, but aliens are not necessarily apprehended where such telephone communications exist. As a result, many apprehended aliens have not been entered into IDENT and whether they are recidivists cannot be readily determined.", "Further, according to INS Headquarters officials, even when agents have access to IDENT, they don\u2019t always use all the system capabilities to identify recidivists. This reportedly occurs when agents input information on apprehended aliens into IDENT at the end of their work shift. In such a case, agents may input apprehended aliens into the system but leave without determining whether the alien is a recidivist, because doing so would require additional time for further processing. In addition, if agents don\u2019t use the IDENT equipment properly (e.g., they do not clean the platen, which records the fingerprint), they may obtain poor quality fingerprints from apprehended aliens. This can result in a failure to identify aliens as recidivists. These situations have been acknowledged as problems by INS, but the frequency of their occurrence is not known.", "Finally, computer problems have affected the usefulness of IDENT data and INS\u2019 ability to track recidivism over several years. The first year of IDENT data, which were collected in fiscal year 1995, is not comparable with data collected in later years because of changes made to the software at the end of 1995. Accordingly, data collected since January 1996 can be used as a baseline for assessing the effects of the southwest border strategy, but data collected prior to then cannot be used. In addition, computer problems arose in fiscal year 1996, affecting the ability of IDENT to accurately read apprehension dates and times recorded by agents and to match poor quality fingerprints within the system. INS officials told us these problems have been corrected and the data have been reprocessed, validated, verified, and are more consistent.

A major limitation of apprehension data is that it only provides information on illegal aliens who have been captured by INS. Because arrested aliens are the basis for apprehension data, such data provide little information about illegal aliens who eluded capture, possibly by (1) changing their crossing patterns and entering in areas where INS has not been able to detect them, (2) using smugglers to raise the probability of a successful crossing, (3) entering successfully at the ports of entry with false documents, or (4) entering legally with a valid visa or border-crossing card and then overstaying the time limits on these documents or working illegally in the United States.", "INS has, in various contexts, made note of indicators other than apprehensions to measure the effects of various border-control initiatives.

Although we cannot attest to the quality of data collected in these research studies, nor that the data were properly analyzed and interpreted, these research studies have produced quantitative and qualitative information on the crossing experiences of illegal aliens\u2014including the number of times individuals have been apprehended on prior illegal trips, the locations where they have crossed the border, tactics used to cross the border, whether smugglers were used, and the overall costs of making an illegal trip. One ongoing project, the Mexican Migration Project, has gathered interview data from migrants from over 30 communities in Mexico, including detailed histories of border crossing and migratory experience in the United States covering the past 30 years. Two other projects conducted by a Mexican university gathered interview data from migrants who were preparing to cross the border illegally or legally, or who had just returned from the United States to Mexico. The recently completed Binational Study on Migration gathered interview data from Mexican migrants and from alien smugglers on such issues as smuggling costs and tactics and perceptions of United States border-control efforts. (See app. VI for more details on these research projects, and others listed below, including discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.)", "Members of our expert panel also suggested that evaluations of the strategy should include indicators of the social costs and benefits of border enforcement, such as the social and financial effects of illegal migration on border communities in the United States. As mentioned earlier, the 1994 U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform evaluation of Operation Hold-the-Line examined a variety of social indicators in El Paso to estimate the impact of illegal aliens on these communities and to determine whether there were any changes in these indicators as a result of the operation. Future evaluation research could examine these kinds of indicators in other cities along the southwest border. Such evaluations would need to take into account differences between border cities in terms of the enforcement strategies employed by INS, social and cultural conditions, and the types of illegal aliens that traditionally cross through these cities.", "The panel also recommended more systematic study of deaths, injuries, and abuse suffered by illegal aliens in crossing the border. Advocacy groups have raised concerns that the strategy may divert illegal aliens to more dangerous terrain to cross the border, thereby, producing an unacceptably high toll in human suffering. A recent study by the University of Houston\u2019s Center for Immigration Research tracked deaths of illegal aliens from such causes as automobile-pedestrian accidents, drowning, and environmental and weather hazards (dehydration, hypothermia, accidental falls) in counties on the U.S.-Mexico border during the years 1993 to 1996. The study did not find an increase in the overall number of illegal alien deaths over the time period but did find an increase in the number of deaths in the remote areas where immigrants have traveled in an effort to avoid areas of greater enforcement along the border. These deaths in remote areas were purportedly caused by exposure. The study also noted that alien deaths were not recorded systematically by any centralized agency, and local databases were partial and did not use common standards.", "Immigration researchers and INS officials we spoke with agreed that IDENT data, when more fully available, could be quite useful for examining the flow of illegal aliens across the border. First, IDENT could provide an unduplicated count of the number of persons apprehended. Second, information on the frequency of apprehension of individuals, the time between multiple apprehensions, and the locations where illegal aliens are apprehended could provide a greater understanding of how border enforcement efforts are affecting illegal crossing patterns. Finally, recidivism data have potential for statistically modeling the flow of illegal aliens across the border and the probability of apprehension. INS officials told us in June 1997 that they were examining different analytic techniques that could be used to model the flow."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Deterrence", "paragraphs": ["The southwest border strategy is ultimately designed to deter illegal entry into the United States.

The previously mentioned Mexican Migration Project has collected some survey information on economic conditions in each of the communities selected for study as well as the extent of social networks that facilitate migration from these communities to the United States. Although the validity of the results would depend greatly on the quality of the underlying data and the appropriateness of the statistical assumptions made, data from the project may help to (1) estimate annual changes over a 30-year period in migrants\u2019 likelihood to take an illegal trip to the United States and (2) examine the factors contributing to decisions to take an illegal trip.", "The Binational Study also conducted interviews with Mexicans concerning factors affecting their decisions to migrate illegally. Researchers interviewed residents of several different types of communities in Mexico that differed in the extent to which patterns of migration to the United States had taken hold. In older sending communities, nearly all male residents had made a trip to the United States, and illegal migration was seen as a rite of passage. Study directors from the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform told us that efforts at deterring illegal migration from these kinds of communities were unlikely to be effective. However, they said that deterrence efforts might work better with migrants from newer sending communities, where social networks were not yet well established. Some people in these communities reportedly were leaving because of difficult economic circumstances, while others were staying because they had heard that the trip was harder, more costly, and more dangerous. Commission officials told us that an evaluation should include interviews with residents of older and newer sending communities in Mexico to ascertain their rationales for undertaking trips to the United States and their perceptions of border-control efforts.", "If the border becomes harder to cross illegally, it is possible that some migrants who might have crossed illegally may try to enter through legal means by applying for nonimmigrant visas or border-crossing cards. Information available from INS and the Department of State on the number of people applying for nonimmigrant visas and border-crossing cards could be used to track whether greater numbers of aliens are applying for legal means of entry. Trends in application rates may be difficult to interpret in the future, however, since aliens already holding border-crossing cards will be required to use new cards containing biometric information, such as the cardholder\u2019s fingerprints, by October 1, 1999. Application rates may then overstate the actual demand for legal entry to the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indicators of the Number of Illegal Aliens in the United States", "paragraphs": ["The strategy anticipates that enforcement activities will ultimately reduce the number of illegal aliens in the United States and, thereby, reduce their use of benefits and social services. INS estimated that the number of illegal aliens residing in the United States grew from 3.9 million in October 1992 to 5.0 million in October 1996. These estimates are difficult to use to evaluate the impact of the strategy, however, because (1) they focus on long-term illegal residents, rather than illegal aliens who come to the United States for relatively short periods and return periodically to their country of origin; (2) they do not allow for estimates of the extent to which reductions in the flow of illegal immigration across the southwest border may be offset by increases in aliens using legal nonimmigrant visas but overstaying the terms of their visas; (3) they have so far been produced too infrequently to be useful to evaluate short-term effects of enforcement efforts; and (4) a shortage of information about some components of the estimates makes it difficult to estimate the number of illegal aliens without making questionable assumptions about these components. Some additional data sources are available that could supplement INS data. However, considerable effort and research would probably be entailed in actually obtaining adequate estimates of the number of illegal aliens in the United States.", "There are numerous difficulties in accurately measuring the total number of illegal aliens in the United States and in estimating how many illegal aliens come to this country each year. One of the major difficulties arises because of the heterogeneity of the illegal alien population. Some illegal aliens, referred to as sojourners in the illegal immigration research literature, come to the United States on a temporary basis but consider themselves residents of a foreign country and intend to return. Others, referred to as settlers, come here with the intention of staying on a more permanent basis. In addition, illegal aliens differ in their mode of arrival. Some illegally cross the southwest border; enter illegally along other borders; or enter illegally at the land, sea, or air ports of entry. Other aliens enter legally with one of several types of visas and then fail to leave within the allowed time period.", "Border enforcement efforts may have different effects on each of these groups, some of them not intended or anticipated in the Attorney General\u2019s strategy. For example, successful border enforcement may result in sojourners limiting the number of trips they make to the United States, but staying for longer periods of time, because of the greater difficulty in crossing the border. In that case, successful border control would effectively reduce the number of illegal border crossings but could increase the average length of time that illegal aliens reside in the United States. Successful border strategies may also discourage sojourners from crossing the border illegally but may encourage them to try to enter legally and stay longer than authorized. A comprehensive evaluation that seeks to determine the effect of the strategy on the number of illegal aliens in the United States would need to have reliable and valid data on sojourners and settlers, and on those who enter legally as well as those who overstay. The evaluation would also have to account for the impact of outside factors, such as economic conditions in countries of origin and policy changes in the United States.", "In February 1997 INS released estimates of the overall stock of illegal aliens residing in the United States in October 1996 and updated earlier estimates that it had made for October 1992, using data collected by INS and the Census Bureau. According to the latest estimates, 5 million illegal aliens resided in the United States as of October 1996, up from 3.9 million as of October 1992. These estimates are difficult to use to evaluate the impact of enforcement efforts at the border, for a number of reasons. First, individuals covered in these estimates are defined as those who have established residence in the United States by remaining here illegally for more than 12 months. The estimates therefore provide little information about the number of sojourners who come to the United States and stay for periods shorter than 1 year. Other kinds of data are needed to examine the sojourner population.", "Second, uncertainty about the number of people who enter legally with nonimmigrant visas and stay longer than authorized (overstays) makes it difficult to assess whether a decrease in the estimated number of illegal border crossers from Mexico due to border enforcement is offset by an increase in Mexican overstays. The INS overstay estimates for 1996 contain a projection based on earlier overstay data, thus the total estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty. In recent testimony to Congress, INS admitted that it has been unable to produce estimates of overstays since 1992. Indeed, because of problems with the data system on overstays,INS acknowledges that it is unable to estimate the current size of the overstay problem and the magnitude by country of origin.", "Third, estimates made once every 4 years are not suited to identifying intermediate trends that might signal effects of border enforcement efforts. INS has calculated an average annual growth rate of 275,000 in the illegal resident population between 1992 and 1996, but these estimates result from averaging over 4 years and cannot distinguish yearly changes in the illegal alien population.", "Fourth, INS acknowledges that limited information about some components of the estimates may increase uncertainty about the size of the illegal population. For example, limited information about the extent to which the Mexican-born population may be undercounted and the number who emigrated from the United States during the period between estimates necessitate assumptions that affect the precision of the estimates of the illegal alien population.", "Unfortunately, data are limited on the number of illegal alien sojourners who travel back and forth between Mexico and the United States. The Binational Study on Migration cited estimates from the previously mentioned Northern Border study of the number of both legal and illegal sojourners traveling to the United States and returning to Mexico in 1993 and 1995. The study found a decrease between 1993 and 1995 in the overall number of people traveling in each direction. The Binational Study interpreted these findings to mean that sojourners were likely staying longer in the United States in 1995 than in 1993. However, the study was unable to distinguish the size of the illegal from the legal alien flow. The Mexican Migration Project data have also been used to estimate changes in net annual illegal migration from Mexico (subtracting estimates of the number of illegal aliens who return to Mexico from estimates of the number of illegal aliens who migrate to the United States). Because neither study was based on data that represented all illegal aliens in the United States, estimates derived from these studies may be most useful for looking at trends, rather than absolute levels, of illegal immigration from Mexico.", "Finally, a number of existing data sources provide estimates of the number of illegal aliens in United States workplaces. Since 1988, the U.S. Department of Labor has administered its National Agricultural Workers Survey 3 times a year to a random sample of the nation\u2019s crop farm workers and has asked respondents about their immigration status, among other things. Such data may be useful for examining whether border enforcement efforts have reduced the number, or proportion, of illegal aliens in a sector that has traditionally attracted high proportions of illegal migrants, and whether the characteristics of illegal aliens working in agriculture have changed. An April 1997 report prepared for the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, based on National Agricultural Workers Survey data from 1988 to 1995, showed an increasing percentage of illegal aliens in agriculture during this time period.", "Many illegal aliens work in sectors other than agriculture, including urban-sector employment in construction and services. INS collects statistics on the results of targeted and random investigations in U.S. workplaces. Trends in the number of illegal aliens apprehended at the workplace may reflect enforcement efforts at the southwest border. For example, if recent border enforcement efforts are effective, the proportion of apprehended illegal aliens who have recently arrived in the United States might decrease at various workplaces. However, changes in the number of illegal aliens apprehended at U.S. workplaces may be a result of other causes, such as greater emphasis by INS staff on investigating whether employers are complying with the law and INS regulations concerning aliens\u2019 right to work in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INS Evaluation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["INS recognizes that multiple indicators are necessary, and, as part of its fiscal year 1997 priority to strengthen border facilitation and control, INS stated that it would \u201creview past and current studies and initiatives regarding measurements of success of both enforcement and facilitation along the  border.\u201d An objective within this priority was to make recommendations for appropriate measures and complete implementation plans.

Thus, devising such an evaluation plan should entail determining the most important data needs and the most appropriate and cost-effective data sources and data collection activities as well as carefully analyzing the relationships among various indicators to correctly interpret the results. Furthermore, data obtained on any set of indicators should be interpreted in the context of economic conditions and policy changes in the countries of origin of illegal immigrants and in the United States to help ensure that the results are attributable to the strategy and not to other potential causes.", "Notwithstanding the challenges in devising such a broad-based evaluation plan, we believe that the substantial investment of billions of dollars being made in the Attorney General\u2019s strategy warrants a cost-effective, comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate whether benefits commensurate to the investment have been realized.
