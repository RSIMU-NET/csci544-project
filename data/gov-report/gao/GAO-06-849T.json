The tribes received compensation when the dams were built and additional compensation in the 1990s. The tribes are seeking a third round of compensation on the basis of a consultant's analysis. The Congress provided additional compensation to other tribes after two prior GAO reports in 1991 and 1998 (GAO/RCED-91-77 and GAO/RCED-98-77). For those reports, GAO proposed that one recommended approach to providing additional compensation would be to calculate the difference between the tribe's final asking price and the amount that was appropriated by the Congress and then adjust that difference using the inflation rate and an interest rate to reflect a range of current values. This testimony is based on GAO's report, Indian Issues: Analysis of the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux Tribes' Additional Compensation Claims ( GAO-06-517 , May 19, 2006).

First, in calculating additional compensation amounts, GAO used the tribes' final asking prices, recognizing that their final settlement position should be the most complete and realistic. In contrast, the consultant used selected figures from a variety of tribal settlement proposals. For example, for the rehabilitation component of the tribes' settlement proposals, the consultant used $13.1 million from proposals in 1957, rather than $6.7 million from the tribes' final rehabilitation proposals in 1961. Second, the tribes' consultant calculated only the highest additional compensation dollar value rather than providing the Congress with a range based on different adjustment factors, as in the earlier GAO reports. Based on calculations using the tribes' final asking prices, GAO's estimated range of additional compensation is generally comparable with what the tribes were authorized in the 1990s. GAO determined that the tribes' final asking prices were a reasonable starting point for the calculations, as was the case for the tribes GAO reviewed in two prior reports. By contrast, the consultant estimated about $106 million and $186 million for additional compensations for the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes, respectively (in 2003 dollars). Rather than bringing the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes into parity with the additional compensation provided to other tribes, GAO believes that the two bills under consideration in the 109th Congress--H.R. 109 and S. 374--would have the opposite effect.

As you know, during a 20-year period, from 1946 to 1966, the federal  government constructed the Fort Randall and Big Bend Dams as flood  control projects on the Missouri River in South Dakota. Installation of the  dams caused the permanent flooding of approximately 38,000 acres of the  tribes\u2019 reservations. During the construction of the two dams, the tribes  entered into negotiations with the federal government for compensation  for their land that would be flooded by the reservoirs that the dams  created. In both cases, the tribes and the federal government were unable  to reach a negotiated settlement, and the legislative settlements imposed  by the Congress were for less than the amounts that the tribes\u2019 had  requested.", "In 1958, the Congress authorized the payment of $2.6 million to the two  tribes for damages and administrative expenses related to the Fort Randall  Dam. Similarly, in 1962, the Congress authorized the payment of about  $7.7 million to the two tribes for damages, rehabilitation (funds for  improving the tribes\u2019 standard of living), and administrative expenses  related to the Big Bend Dam. However, the tribes did not consider the  compensation they received in 1958 and 1962 to be sufficient, and they  sought additional compensation to address the effects of both dams. As a  result, in 1996 and 1997, the Congress authorized the Crow Creek Sioux  and the Lower Brule Sioux tribes additional compensation of $27.5 million  and $39.3 million, respectively, through the establishment of development  trust funds for each tribe.", "In addition to the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes, Indian  tribes at five other reservations also (1) lost land to flood control projects  on the Missouri River, (2) received compensation for damages in the mid- 1900s, and (3) requested and received additional compensation in the  1990s or early 2000s. Before the Congress authorized additional  compensation to Indian tribes at three\u2014Fort Berthold, Standing Rock, and  Cheyenne River\u2014of these five other reservations, we were asked to  review their additional compensation claims. In 1991, we reported on the  additional compensation claims for the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort  Berthold Reservation and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and, in 1998, we  reported on the additional compensation claims for the Cheyenne River  Sioux tribe. For the tribes at these three reservations, we found the  economic analyses used to justify their additional compensation claims to  be unreliable, and we suggested that the Congress not rely on them as a  basis for providing the tribes with additional compensation.", "As an alternative, we suggested that if the Congress determined that  additional compensation was warranted, it could determine the amount of  compensation by calculating the difference between the tribe\u2019s final  settlement proposal (referred to in this report as the tribe\u2019s \u201cfinal asking  price\u201d) and the amount of compensation the Congress originally  authorized the tribes. We used the inflation rate and an interest rate to  adjust the difference to reflect a range of current values, using the inflation  rate for the lower end of the range and the interest rate for the higher end.  Using this approach, we calculated how much additional compensation it  would take today to make up for the difference between the tribes\u2019 final  asking prices and the original compensation provided.", "In 2003, the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes hired a  consultant to determine if they were due even further additional  compensation based on the method we proposed in our two prior reports.  As a result of the consultant\u2019s analysis, the two tribes are currently seeking  a third round of compensation totaling an additional $226 million (in 2003  dollars). The tribes assert that their new calculations for additional  compensation will bring them into parity with the additional compensation  provided to the other tribes on the Missouri River. The additional  compensation amounts the consultant recommended are included in two  bills pending in the 109th Congress, H.R. 109 and S. 374, referred to as the  Tribal Parity Act. Our testimony today is based on our May 2006 report in  which we assessed whether the tribes\u2019 consultant followed the approach  in our prior reports in calculating the additional compensation amounts  for the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes.", "To assess the consultant\u2019s methods and analysis for determining additional  compensation for the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes, we  used standard economic principles and the analysis we conducted in our  two prior reports on additional compensation. In order to ensure that we  obtained and reviewed all relevant data, we conducted a literature search  for congressional, agency, and tribal documents at the National Archives  and the Department of the Interior\u2019s library. We used original documents  to learn about the negotiation process and to identify the appraised land  prices and various proposed settlement amounts. As a result, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of this  report. We met with representatives of the two tribes and the tribes\u2019  consultant to discuss the analysis that was the basis for the tribes\u2019  additional compensation claims. Our May 2006 report, on which this  testimony is based, was prepared in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "The tribes\u2019 consultant differed from the approach used in prior GAO  reports by (1) not using the tribes\u2019 final asking prices as the starting point  of the analysis and (2) not providing a range of additional compensation.

The construction of the Fort Randall  Dam, located 7 miles above the Nebraska line in south-central South  Dakota, began in May 1946 and was officially dedicated in August 1956.  The dam is 160 feet high, and the reservoir behind it, known as Lake Case,  stretches 107 miles to the northwest. (See fig. 1.)", "In September 1959, the Corps began work on the Big Bend Dam, which is  about 100 miles northwest of the Fort Randall Dam on land belonging to  both the Crow Creek Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes.

The  major employers on the reservations are the tribes, the casinos, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Indian Health Service.", "The construction of the Fort Randall Dam caused the flooding of more  than 17,000 acres of Crow Creek and Lower Brule reservation land and the  displacement of more than 100 tribal families. After these two tribes  sustained major damage from this project, the construction of the Big  Bend Dam inundated over 20,000 additional acres of their reservations.  This flooding displaced more families, some of whom had moved earlier as  a result of flooding from the Fort Randall Dam. (See table 1.) Flooding  from the installation of both dams resulted in the loss of valuable timber  and pasture and forced families to move to less desirable land, which  affected their way of life.", "During the 1950s and 1960s, the Corps, Interior, through its Missouri River  Basin Investigations Unit (MRBI), and the tribes\u2014represented through  tribal negotiating committees\u2014developed their own estimates of the  damages caused by the Fort Randall and Big Bend dams. The settlement  negotiations for the Fort Randall Dam stretched over several years, and  the tribes put forward a number of different settlement proposals. The  settlement negotiations for the Big Bend Dam were conducted in a much  shorter time frame, but there still were a number of settlement proposals  and counter-proposals.

These tribes received some compensation, primarily during  the 1950s, for the damages they sustained. However, beginning in the  1980s, some of these tribes began requesting additional compensation. The  Congress responded to their requests by authorizing the establishment of  development trust funds. (See table 3.) The tribes at the Fort Berthold,  Standing Rock, and Cheyenne River reservations received compensation  within the ranges we had suggested the Congress consider in our reviews  of the tribes\u2019 additional compensation claims.

In determining possible additional compensation for the tribes at  the Fort Berthold and Standing Rock reservations in 1991, and Cheyenne  River reservation in 1998, we used the tribes\u2019 final asking prices to  calculate the difference between what the tribes asked for and what they  received. In our prior reports, we used the tribes\u2019 final position because  we believed that it represented the most up-to-date and complete  information and that their final position was more realistic than their  initial asking prices.

As a  result, the consultant\u2019s estimate of the tribes\u2019 asking prices in the late  1950s and early 1960s was about $7.7 million higher than it would have  been if he had consistently used the tribes\u2019 final asking prices. Choosing  which settlement proposal to use to calculate the difference between what  the tribe asked for and what it finally received is critically important,  because a small numerical difference 50 years ago can result in a large  difference today, once it is adjusted to reflect more current values.", "With respect to the Fort Randall Dam, the consultant used amounts from a  variety of settlement proposals for damages and administrative expenses.  To determine additional compensation, the consultant used a $2.2 million  settlement proposal by the Crow Creek Sioux tribe and a $2.6 million  settlement proposal by the Lower Brule Sioux tribe. (See table 4.) The  Crow Creek proposal was from May 1957, and was the same as the tribe\u2019s  final asking price requested about 1 year later, in February 1958.

To  determine additional compensation, the consultant used amounts from  congressional bills introduced in March 1961 for direct damages, but used  amounts from proposed amendments to the bills in June 1961 for indirect  damages. The tribes\u2019 asking prices from June 1961 can be considered their  final asking prices because the proposed amendments are the last  evidence of when the tribes requested specific compensation (indirect  damages) or agreed to a compensation amount (direct damages). The  consultant would have been more consistent had he used both the indirect  and direct damage settlement figures in the proposed amendments from  June 1961, rather than a mixture of these figures. As a result, the total  amount for damages the consultant used to calculate the difference  between what the tribes requested and what it finally received is about  $427,000 (in 1961 dollars), which is higher than if the tribes\u2019 final asking  prices from June 1961 had been used consistently. (See table 5.)", "Lastly, the consultant did not use the tribes\u2019 final asking prices for the  rehabilitation component of the settlement payment. The consultant used  a $6.7 million rehabilitation figure that the Crow Creek Sioux tribe\u2019s  negotiating committee proposed in May 1957 and a $6.3 million  rehabilitation figure that was proposed in congressional bills in 1955 and  1957 for the Lower Brule Sioux tribe.

However, the tribes agreed in their February and March 1958 proposals\u2014 their final asking prices for the Fort Randall Dam\u2014to defer consideration  of their rehabilitation proposals until after land acquisitions were made for  the construction of the Big Bend Dam. The Big Bend Dam\u2019s installation  would once again result in the flooding of their lands. In our view, the  consultant should have used the final rehabilitation figures proposed by  the tribes in 1961\u2014that is, $4 million for the Crow Creek Sioux tribe and  $2.7 million for the Lower Brule Sioux tribe.", "During the settlement negotiations for the two dams, the tribes never  submitted a settlement proposal at a singular point in time that consisted  of the settlement figures that the tribes\u2019 consultant grouped together for  the purposes of his calculations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consultant Developed a Single Compensation Estimate for Each Tribe, Rather Than a Range of Estimates", "paragraphs": ["In our two prior reports, we suggested that, for the tribes of Fort Berthold,  Standing Rock, and Cheyenne River, the Congress consider a range of  possible compensation based on the current value of the difference  between the final asking price of each tribe and the amount that it  received.

For the lower end of the  range, we used the inflation rate to estimate the amount the tribes would  need to equal the purchasing power of the difference. For the higher  range, we used an interest rate to estimate the amount the tribes might  have earned if they had invested the difference in Aaa corporate bonds as  of the date of the settlement.
