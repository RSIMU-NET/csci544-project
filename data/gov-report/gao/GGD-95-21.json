Most trust assets were in custodial or other accounts for which the bank did not provide investment management service. About $2 trillion of the $10.6 trillion were in discretionary trust asset accounts (i.e., accounts for which banks provided investment management service). Most assets in these discretionary accounts were managed for employee benefit plans ($914 billion) and personal trusts ($556 billion).", "In 1993, $760 billion\u2014representing approximately half of the funds contained in discretionary employee benefit plans and personal trusts\u2014were invested in pooled trust investment funds. Discretionary trust assets that were not invested in pooled funds were invested in separate portfolios for each account. Pooled trust investment funds were generally used for relatively small accounts or to achieve diversification in areas that were too costly to achieve on an individual account basis.", "Pooled trust investment funds are similar to mutual funds in that the cash assets of many trust accounts are commingled in a single investment portfolio for the proportional benefit of all participating accounts. Pooled trust investment funds, like mutual funds, may serve different investment objectives and can be invested in such instruments as short-term treasuries, long-term bonds, growth stocks, and tax-free bonds. However, unlike mutual funds, pooled trust investment funds are not marketed to the general public. Pooled trust investment funds can be transferred to a bank proprietary mutual fund in a single transaction known as a conversion.", "Pooled trust investment funds for employee benefit accounts and personal trusts differ in some ways. The pooled funds are maintained separately for each type of account because employee benefit plans have different legal requirements. Pooled trust investment funds for personal trusts are called common trust funds.

The duty of loyalty requires a fiduciary to act solely in the interests of its clients, excluding all self-interest. Banks are required to resolve any possible conflicts of interest in favor of the trust account and its beneficiaries, not the bank. In addition, the fiduciary is to avoid situations of potential conflict of interest that may prevent it from serving in the best interest of a client. Prudence requires banks that act as fiduciaries to be able to justify the suitability of trust investments for trust accounts.", "Federal trust regulatory authority stems in part from the fact that the bank regulators have the authority to grant or terminate the trust powers of banks and bank holding companies and their bank and trust subsidiaries.

One bank had proprietary mutual funds that were among the 10 largest such proprietary funds offered by banks.", "We were interested in each bank\u2019s policies and experience, and also in their officers\u2019 views about the prospects for the investment of trust assets in proprietary mutual funds. Specifically, we asked them why mutual funds were becoming a more commonly used investment choice and how they had dealt with issues of disclosure, consent, and fees charged in connection with trust asset investment in proprietary mutual funds. Data that would fully describe these activities were not available, and we did not independently verify the information we obtained. Because we interviewed only a limited number of banks, we do not know if the practices described in this report reflect those of the industry as a whole, and our results are not statistically valid.", "Our work was done in Washington, D.C., between December 1993 and April 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For these assets, banks simply provide a variety of investment support services, such as custody of securities, dividend collections and distributions, and record keeping.", "The focus of this report is on the discretionary trust assets because banks are to provide investment management services for them. Discretionary trust assets may be divided into three categories: (1) employee benefit accounts, (2) personal trust accounts, and (3) other accounts. In 1993, almost half of the discretionary trust assets, $914 billion, were held in employee benefit accounts; another quarter, $556 billion, were held in personal trusts; the remaining $577 billion were held in other accounts, which may include the assets of proprietary mutual funds.

Of the $2 trillion in discretionary trust assets in 1993, $760 billion were invested in pooled trust investment funds composed of pooled employee benefit accounts and pooled personal trust accounts. Separate pools are maintained for these accounts because employee benefit plans have deferred tax status whereas personal trusts generally do not. Pooled personal trust accounts are generally referred to as common trust funds. (See fig. II.1.) Discretionary trust assets are separated into three groups, and for two of these groups\u2014employee benefit plans and personal trusts\u2014the assets are further divided into pooled trust investment funds and individually managed employee benefit plans and personal trust accounts.", "Industry officials and regulators we spoke with said that pooled trust investment funds are a likely source of trust assets for conversion into proprietary mutual funds because they are very similar to mutual funds. Accounts that are not invested in pooled trust funds are referred to as individually managed trust accounts. Some of the bankers we interviewed said that individually managed accounts are less likely to be converted into mutual fund investments because of customer preference.", "Of the $914 billion in employee benefit accounts in 1993, $608 billion, or 67 percent, were invested in pooled funds. By contrast, only $152 billion of the $556 billion in personal trust accounts, or 27 percent, were invested in pooled funds (i.e., common trusts). The concentration of pooled employee benefit funds in a few large banks was also greater than that of common trust funds. The five banks with the largest amount of pooled employee benefit funds controlled $460 billion, or 76 percent, of the total assets in these pools. The five banks with the largest amount of common trust funds held $46 billion, or only 30 percent of the total assets in these pools.

The number of banks offering one or both types of pooled trust investment funds, however, declined from 895 in 1983 to 533 at the end of 1992. It is possible that bank mergers account for a significant part of this decline. In other cases, banks could have either converted their pooled trust investment funds to proprietary mutual funds or liquidated their pooled funds and invested the proceeds elsewhere.", "Table III.1 shows the status of pooled trust investment funds and proprietary mutual funds for 1983, 1988, and 1993.

Although customer preference and the relative performance of pooled trust investment funds compared with mutual funds will be important factors in determining whether there are additional conversions of pooled trust investment funds to proprietary mutual funds, several other factors may have an impact on this process. These factors include (1) the profitability of continuing to offer both pooled trust investment funds and proprietary mutual funds, especially since proprietary mutual funds can be offered to a wider range of customers; (2) changes in federal tax laws to allow capital gains accrued in common trusts to be deferred in a conversion; and (3) changes in federal regulation, such as that which has been proposed by OCC for a number of years to allow banks to advertise the performance of their pooled trust investment funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Trust Assets in Banks That Offered Pooled Trust Investment Funds and Proprietary Mutual Funds", "paragraphs": ["Out of the more than 3,000 banks active in the trust business, about 500 offered pooled trust investment funds at year-end 1992. At the end of 1993, 91 of the banks offering pooled trust investment funds offered proprietary mutual funds as well. As table IV.1 shows, these 91 banks, which we will call dual providers, dominated both markets. They held 95 percent, $719 billion, of all reported pooled trust investment fund assets and 94 percent, $191 billion, of all reported proprietary mutual fund assets.", "Table IV.1 also shows that the number of separate pooled trust investment funds offered by dual providers had declined since 1988 while asset growth had been substantial. In about half of these banks, the number of separate pooled trust investment funds decreased, although fewer than one-fourth of the 91 banks reported a decline in the assets of pooled funds over that period. Such declines could reflect different events, such as conversions of trust assets into proprietary or other mutual funds, bank mergers, or trouble at the bank.", "The decline in the number of pooled trust investment funds compared to the increase in the number of proprietary mutual funds offered by the dual providers is an interesting development. However, the extent of the shift toward proprietary mutual funds needs to be kept in perspective. Most pooled trust investment funds have not been converted, and in fact their assets are continuing to grow. One indication of the continuing importance of pooled funds is that only 17 of the banks that offered proprietary mutual funds in 1993 had actually discontinued either their common trust funds or their pooled employee benefit funds since 1986, and only 5 had discontinued both. While a huge potential for future conversions may exist, particularly for employee benefit funds, we have no basis for predicting the extent of future conversions.", "In reviewing banks that had pooled trust investment funds, we noted a high and increasing concentration of pooled trust assets. At the end of 1993, the 10 largest banks, measured by their pooled trust investment funds, held 75 percent of all pooled trust investment fund assets. In 1986, the 10 largest banks had only 55 percent of this market. Since 1986, assets in pooled trust investment funds in these banks have grown almost eight times faster than pooled trust assets in smaller banks. The increase in concentration of these funds among the 10 largest banks indicated that despite the large volume of pooled trust assets managed by banks, many banks are unlikely to reach the scale of assets needed to make a mutual fund viable simply by converting trust assets into a proprietary mutual fund.", "The average size of pooled trust investment funds has also grown.
