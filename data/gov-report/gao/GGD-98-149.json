In April 1998, we briefed the offices of our congressional requesters on Treasury\u2019s plan, and we agreed with them that it would be useful to provide our observations to you.", "The Results Act requires federal agencies to prepare annual performance plans covering the program activities set out in the agencies\u2019 budgets, beginning with plans for fiscal year 1999. These plans are to (1) establish performance goals to define levels of performance to be achieved; (2) express those goals in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form; (3) briefly describe the operational processes, skills, and technology and the human, capital, information, or other resources required to meet the goals; (4) establish performance measures for assessing the progress toward achievement of the goals; (5) provide a basis for comparing actual program results with the established goals; and (6) describe the means to be used to verify and validate measured values.", "For purposes of our review, these six requirements of the Results Act for the annual performance plans were collapsed into the following three core questions:", "To what extent does the agency\u2019s performance plan provide a clear picture of intended performance across the agency?", "How well does the agency\u2019s performance plan discuss the strategies and resources the agency will use to achieve its performance goals?", "To what extent does the agency\u2019s performance plan provide confidence that its performance information will be credible?", "These questions are contained in our February 1998 congressional guide and our April 1998 evaluators\u2019 guide for assessing performance plans, which we used to do our review. These guides integrated criteria from the Results Act, its legislative history, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidance for developing performance plans (OMB Circular A-11, Part 2), a December 1997 letter to OMB from several congressional leaders, and our other guidance on implementation of the Results Act. We used the criteria and questions contained in the guides to help us determine whether Treasury\u2019s plan met the requirements of the Act, to identify strengths and weaknesses in the plan, and to assess the plan\u2019s usefulness for executive branch and congressional decisionmakers.", "As requested, we reviewed the Department of the Treasury\u2019s annual performance plan for fiscal year 1999 that was submitted to Congress in February 1998. Treasury\u2019s annual performance plan and budget request for fiscal year 1999 has separate sections for each of the Department\u2019s bureaus and offices. We conducted a more in-depth analysis of sections relating to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); United States Customs Service; Financial Management Service (FMS); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). These components, except for OCC and OTS, which do not receive appropriated funds, represent about 88 percent of Treasury\u2019s total budget request for fiscal year 1999.", "We sent a draft of this letter to Treasury\u2019s Office of Strategic Planning for review and comment. On May 28, 1998, Treasury officials provided oral comments on that draft, which are discussed at the end of this letter. We did our work from February 1998 through June 1998, according to generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs by establishing a system to set goals for program performance and to measure results. Specifically, the Act requires executive agencies to prepare multiyear strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. The strategic plan serves as the starting point and basic underpinning of the performance-based management system and includes the agency\u2019s mission statement and its long-term goals and objectives for implementing the mission. Treasury submitted its first strategic plan under the Results Act to Congress and the Director of OMB, as required, by September 30, 1997. The annual performance plan links the agency\u2019s day-to-day activities to its long-term strategic goals. The first plans, covering fiscal year 1999, were submitted to OMB in the fall of 1997 and to Congress after the President\u2019s budget in February 1998. Finally, the first annual performance reports for fiscal year 1999 are due to Congress and the President no later than March 31, 2000. Performance reports are to include, among other things, an evaluation of the agencies\u2019 progress toward achieving the goals in their annual plans. These reports are to provide feedback to federal managers, policymakers, and the public on the results achieved each year.", "The Treasury Department has responsibilities in key governmental roles, including tax administrator, revenue collector, law enforcer, and financial manager. Treasury also formulates and recommends economic, financial, tax, and fiscal policies and manufactures coins and currency. To carry out its diverse responsibilities, Treasury houses more than a dozen bureaus and offices. For its fiscal year 1999 budget, Treasury requested about $12.301 billion and about 147,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff years.", "Public sector organizations, like Treasury, are faced with demands to be more effective and accountable for the results of their programs. To meet such demands, Treasury began moving toward a performance-based approach to management before the Results Act requirements became mandatory. This is the third year that Treasury has included performance goals derived from its strategic plan in its budget request. Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance plan under Results Act requirements is combined with its budget request and includes reports on performance goals for the past 2 fiscal years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury\u2019s Performance Plan Provides a Partial Picture of Intended Performance Across the Department", "paragraphs": ["As the Results Act requires, the annual performance plan is to provide a basis for an agency to compare actual results with performance goals. To do this, the agency needs to set goals and develop appropriate performance measures and show how it will use them to assess performance across the agency. By showing the relationship between the annual performance goals and the agency\u2019s mission and strategic goals, an agency\u2019s performance plan can demonstrate how the agency intends to make progress toward the achievement of its strategic goals. An agency\u2019s performance plan should also reflect and discuss the crosscutting nature of its programs and how they will contribute to achieving performance related to crosscutting functions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defining Expected Performance", "paragraphs": ["Treasury\u2019s performance plan does not provide a succinct and concrete statement of expected performance for subsequent comparison with actual performance for several reasons. First, many of the annual performance goals in Treasury\u2019s plan are necessarily abstract and not directly measurable. IRS, for example, has established three performance goals\u2014improve customer service, increase compliance, and increase productivity\u2014for defining its intended performance. Each of these broad goals is complemented with program-level measures to assess progress toward achieving the three goals. IRS\u2019 performance goal relating to improving customer service is particularly difficult to quantify because achieving it implies that IRS can measure and reduce taxpayer burden. IRS currently does not know how to realistically measure taxpayer burden. Reliable data for measuring burden do not exist because taxpayers normally do not track the time they spend complying with their tax and filing obligations.", "IRS recognizes the limitations of these goals on defining its performance and is looking for alternatives. Because reducing taxpayer burden affects IRS\u2019 ability to achieve its performance goals and IRS\u2019 measure of taxpayer burden is not based on reliable data, its performance measures based on burden may not be very useful. However, devising ways to measure the burden that IRS influences and developing reliable measures of taxpayer burden and the impact of IRS\u2019 programs on burden will be challenging. IRS is not alone; Treasury as a whole faces similar challenges.", "Second, the quality of some measures in Treasury\u2019s plan could be improved so that they directly relate to the performance goals. The relationship between some measures and goals is not clear, making it difficult to define the level of expected performance. Also, the measures do not always appear to cover key aspects of performance. Examples from OCC\u2019s plan illustrate this.", "One of OCC\u2019s strategic goals is to \u201cimprove the efficiency of bank supervision and reduc burden by streamlining supervisory processes.\u201d This strategic goal has three performance goals, and each has a single indicator or measure. One such performance goal is to \u201ccontinue with the regulatory reinvention process to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary burden.\u201d The single measure in the plan for this goal is \u201cpercentage  time meeting the application processing time frames,\u201d with a performance target of 95 percent in calendar year 1998. This measure only addresses application processing time frames and does not clearly relate to the goal of continuing with the regulatory reinvention process.", "OCC has two measures for its performance goal to \u201csupport efforts to foster a national bank charter that will effectively compete with other financial service providers and continue to meet the financial service needs of all types of customers.\u201d However, these measures\u2014\u201crating on customer satisfaction in connection with the licensing process\u201d and \u201caverage processing time for analysis of customer complaints\u201d\u2014do not clearly relate to the performance goal.", "Third, Treasury\u2019s plan is also incomplete in that some of the performance measures for its bureaus and offices are still being developed and defined. For example, many IRS measures are coded \u201cTBD,\u201d or to be determined. For these proposed measures, IRS does not have complete information, such as definitions, data sources, level of detail, and data reliability. During fiscal year 1998, IRS is working with OMB, a contractor, and others to develop a balanced scorecard measurement system that is to evaluate IRS on customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and business results.", "Finally, many of the measures in Treasury\u2019s plan are output measures. While output measures are expected to be in the plan, Treasury could better convey its expected results and show how goals are to be achieved by developing additional outcome measures and better explaining how the outputs that are measured relate to the goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Connecting Mission, Goals, and Program Activities", "paragraphs": ["For the most part, the performance goals of the Department\u2019s bureaus and offices are connected to their missions, strategic goals, and program activities in the budget request. Specifically, the plan contains tables that align the Departmentwide strategic goals, bureau missions and strategic goals, and performance goals and measures. However, the linkages between the program-level measures and performance goals are not consistently clear.", "IRS, for example, has tables that show the linkage between its strategic goals or objectives and the Departmentwide strategic plan and its performance goals and annual performance measures. However, the plan does not discuss how the intended results of its many performance measures will be assessed to indicate IRS\u2019 success in achieving its performance goals. For example, the number of individual refunds issued, paper processing accuracy rate, and number of calls answered are 3 of the 19 performance measures under the goal to improve customer service. The plan does not explain how any of these measures should be rolled up to indicate progress toward achieving the customer service goal. We recognize the difficulty IRS faces in explaining this, especially since its performance goals are necessarily abstract and not directly measurable. However, some discussion of how IRS plans to evaluate progress toward achieving its performance goals would help explain how the results of its performance measures affect the attainment of its performance goals.", "Although Customs\u2019 plan provides information to align its strategic goals and performance goals, the information is not consistent. Customs\u2019 plan has a table that shows the linkage between its strategic goals and performance goals. Later in the plan, other tables show the exact same strategic goals as performance goals; and what are shown in the earlier table as performance goals are now called performance measures.", "The Results Act requires that annual performance plans identify annual performance goals that cover all the program activities in the agency\u2019s budget. Treasury\u2019s plan complies with this requirement, as each component and major office generally has one or more performance goals for each of the budget activities in the budget request. For one new IRS budget activity relating to the earned-income tax credit compliance initiative, the plan listed one performance goal\u2014overclaim rate\u2014but the definition and targets for the goal have not yet been determined. Also, IRS\u2019 budget activity, \u201cModernization Investments,\u201d did not list any performance goals.

Specifically, we found that Treasury\u2019s annual performance plan generally did not identify performance goals that reflect activities being undertaken to support crosscutting programs, and the plan does not consistently address the crosscutting nature of its programs.", "Treasury has responsibilities for functions and issues that involve other agencies. As such, its plan should indicate how Treasury will coordinate those programs with other federal programs having related strategic or performance goals. In crosscutting program areas, Treasury should present output goals and intermediate outcome goals that would clarify its contribution to the intended outcomes of the crosscutting program. This information would be helpful to Congress and other stakeholders in identifying areas in which agencies should be coordinating efforts to efficiently and effectively meet national concerns. A focus on results, as envisioned by the Results Act, implies that federal programs contributing to the same or similar outcomes should be coordinated to ensure that goals are consistent and that program efforts are mutually reinforcing.", "Customs, for example, is involved in several crosscutting activities\u2014drug interdiction, counterterrorism, and investigations of money laundering. These activities are recognized in Customs\u2019 plan as crosscutting activities, but there is no clear evidence in the plan that its fiscal year 1999 performance goals have been coordinated with other agencies. The plan does mention some past coordination efforts\u2014such as between Customs and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to develop measures for a strategy to reduce the supply of narcotics. The plan did not clearly discuss the results of those efforts or indicate whether Customs\u2019 fiscal year 1999 performance goals were based on them.

However, the plan does not clearly indicate that ATF coordinated with the other agencies in setting its fiscal year 1999 annual goals or targets.", "FMS states that one part of its mission focuses on efforts to increase the collection of delinquent debts owed the federal government and that its success is achieved through such activities as providing debt collection and management services to all federal agencies and developing and implementing governmentwide debt management policies. The debt collection program activity in FMS\u2019 plan, for example, has a measure on the percentage of market share of federal agencies with debt servicing requirements that have referred their debts to FMS as required by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and another measure to increase governmentwide delinquent nontax debt collections over the fiscal year 1995 baseline. However, FMS does not provide any information to show how it plans to coordinate with other agencies to achieve these goals.", "IRS plays a role in administering tax code provisions pertaining to several billions of dollars in tax expenditures, such as the earned-income tax credit, the low-income housing credit, and the research credit, and there is no discussion of these crosscutting programs. IRS, too, shares responsibilities with other agencies, such as the Social Security Administration (SSA), in processing and reconciling information on employee wages and social security benefits, but the plan does not explicitly discuss or describe whether any performance goals were coordinated with SSA or other agencies.

The strategies and standards include improving the clarity of notices, forms, and tax publications; increasing the hours for its telephone service; opening district offices on Saturdays during the filing season; providing additional telephone assistance to small businesses; and creating citizen advocacy panels. The descriptions of the strategies are succinct; and they outline methods that, if followed, should enhance customer service.", "In contrast, Customs\u2019 plan provides only a partial description of the strategies it expects to use in fiscal year 1999 to achieve its projected results. For example, Customs indicates that it plans to improve drug interdiction results by focusing attention on areas of increased vulnerability, exploiting intelligence leads, and improving technology. However, Customs offered no strategies for its goals in the revenue-producing and antimoney-laundering areas.", "In addition, OCC\u2019s plan does not fully describe strategies to achieve its performance goals. Those goals included general references to an approach, such as streamlining, but OCC did not provide detailed strategies for achieving the goals. In some cases, regulatory requirements were mentioned as a means for achieving goals.", "Although the Act does not require agencies\u2019 annual performance plans to disclose how external factors might affect performance and results, including this information in the plans would enhance their overall usefulness as it would more fully describe Treasury\u2019s potential to achieve the expected performance. Treasury\u2019s strategic plan did mention some of the external factors that may affect its ability to achieve its strategic goals.

One area of concern has been IRS\u2019 inability to adequately measure the performance of some of its programs because of the lack of reliable data to measure such key indicators as taxpayer compliance and burden. We have raised concerns that some of IRS\u2019 program-level performance indicators need to be balanced with indicators designed to measure whether taxpayers are treated properly.", "Concerning Customs, we have pointed out that the agency has traditionally measured the success of its drug interdiction efforts by the resulting number of seizures, arrests, indictments, and convictions.

The plan has one related \u201cmeasure\u201d for the goal, which is \u201cestablishing IT investment controls and ensuring  Treasury and all bureaus have established investment review boards with defined, repeatable processes for project selection.\u201d However, the plan does not include any discussion of strategies for achieving this goal or how performance data will be used to demonstrate improvements to agency programs.", "Further, none of the bureaus\u2019 plans we reviewed in depth had related performance goals for establishing IT investment controls. This is a very important element of any investment strategy and the purpose for establishing it at the Department level. To ensure that all ongoing and new IT projects are considered by the investment review boards, each of Treasury\u2019s bureaus and offices should have performance goals that address IT investment controls in their respective plans.", "Treasury\u2019s plan also mentions the requirement in the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-356) that the Secretary of Treasury is to prepare audited consolidated financial statements (CFS) of the federal government beginning in the spring of 1998. FMS, which is responsible for preparing the audited cfs, revised the program activities in its fiscal year 1999 budget creating one on governmentwide accounting and reporting that covers the cfs requirement. For this activity, FMS\u2019 has one goal\u2014to make the federal government a model for financial management\u2014and four related measures such as the percent of agency reports for the cfs processed by FMS within the established range for accuracy. However, there is no discussion of how the 1999 proposed targets for the four performance measures relate to being a model for financial management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act seeks to improve the management of federal programs by shifting the focus of decisionmaking from staffing and activity levels to the results of federal programs. Annual performance plans, as required by the Act, should establish linkages between the long-term strategic goals outlined in agencies\u2019 strategic plans and their day-to-day program activities. Treasury\u2019s annual performance plan appropriately links its annual performance goals and measures to its strategic goals. Although, the plan provides useful information for congressional decisionmakers and other stakeholders, it did not fully present information that reflects the intended performance across the Department, describes how strategies relate to attainment of goals, and assures readers that performance results and data are credible.", "The plan we reviewed was Treasury\u2019s first one under the Results Act. Developing a plan that fully meets all the criteria of the Act and related guidance will be a challenge because developing measures and collecting reliable data for some important areas of Treasury\u2019s performance, such as taxpayer burden, are very difficult to do. Treasury\u2019s plan could be enhanced by explicitly discussing the Department\u2019s strategy to improve its performance measurement systems and data and by describing Treasury\u2019s interim plans to measure performance in critical areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On May 28, 1998, we obtained oral comments from Treasury\u2019s Director of the Office of Strategic Planning and his staff on a draft of this report.

The officials said that Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance plan\u2014the first such plan required by the Results Act\u2014is not its first plan. According to the officials, Treasury has published performance plans in the past and has publicly reported its performance results against the plans for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, ahead of the Act\u2019s requirements.", "Treasury agreed with our concerns about the validity of its performance data. Treasury pointed out that the validity of its performance data and its capacity to regularly and accurately report on performance are key challenges it needs to address. To this end, they said Treasury\u2019s Office of Inspector General is planning to identify critical information systems for inclusion in its annual evaluation work plans; Treasury\u2019s bureaus are continuing to identify and report where data are of questionable reliability; and the Department is developing a performance reporting system to routinely report the results of performance.", "In the draft of this report that Treasury reviewed, we said that a fuller description of strategies to achieve goals would be beneficial. Treasury said that to keep the plan focused and useful, a balance is needed on the amount of detailed information provided in the plan. Further, Treasury said that since its plan is incorporated in its budget request, congressional stakeholders can explore specific strategies of interest during hearings and follow-up questions. We agree that balance is needed in the amount of detailed information provided in the plan. At the meeting, we clarified that the plan did not always list strategies or adequately describe them. We revised our report to reflect this, and we also made other technical changes on the basis of Treasury\u2019s comments where appropriate.", "We will send copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of interested congressional committees; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties.
