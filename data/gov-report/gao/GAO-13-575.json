GAO examined petition data from ITC and interviewed petitioners, trade lawyers, trade association officials, academics, trade experts from the Congressional Research Service, and Commerce and ITC officials. In addition, GAO reviewed AD/CV duty petitions and reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Some small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)--which are defined by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy as independent businesses with fewer than 500 employees--have petitioned for the imposition of antidumping (AD) and countervailing (CV) duties to seek relief from unfair trade practices. Among the 56 petitions filed between 2007 and 2012, GAO found 21 that included at least 1 SME petitioner. In addition, the 56 petitions represented a total of 147 petitioners, of which 38 were SMEs. The majority of these SME petitioners had annual sales revenue of at least $10 million. Close to half of the total SME petitioners were in the iron and steel industry. Since participation in the petitions is not mandatory, producers, including SMEs, may benefit from a successful petition even if they choose not to join as a petitioner.", "SMEs face three key challenges when pursuing the imposition of AD/CV duties: (1) high legal costs, (2) difficulty obtaining domestic and foreign pricing and production data, and (3) difficulty demonstrating industry support. Trade lawyers estimated that the cost of pursuing an AD or CV case during the petition and investigation phases can average between $1 million and $2 million and sometimes more, especially if the case involves multiple countries. It is often difficult for prospective petitioners to obtain domestic and foreign pricing and production data required by Department of Commerce (Commerce) and International Trade Commission (ITC) regulations and guidance. In addition, it can be difficult for prospective petitioners to demonstrate enough industry support to meet statutory requirements.", "Commerce and ITC both have offices that provide information and assistance to SMEs to help them meet some of the administrative requirements and reduce costs. Commerce has the authority to self-initiate an AD/CV duty investigation without a petition and has used this authority only once since 1991. According to Commerce officials, the Department uses this authority only when it has significant participation from the industry. Self-initiation would likely have little impact on SMEs' overall costs since SMEs incur most costs during the investigation phase. Also, self-initiation could have adverse effects, including raising questions of whether the action was taken consistent with U.S. obligations under international trade agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States and many of its trading partners have enacted laws to  remedy the unfair trade practices of other countries and foreign  companies that cause or threaten to cause material injury to domestic  producers and workers. U.S. laws authorize the imposition of antidumping  (AD) duties on certain imports that were dumped (i.e., sold at less than  fair market value) and countervailing (CV) duties on certain imports  subsidized by foreign governments. AD/CV duties are among the most  commonly applied U.S. trade remedies. The U.S. Department of  Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission  (ITC) conduct AD/CV duty investigations, most of which are initiated  based on petitions filed on behalf of a domestic industry.

We also inquired about  the use of safeguards\u2014trade remedies that provide temporary relief from  injurious surges of imports. Most ITC safeguard investigations are  conducted on the basis of a petition filed by a representative of a  domestic industry.  However, the ITC may be required to conduct  investigations at the request of the President or U.S. Trade  Representative, or upon resolution of the House Committee on Ways and  Means or the Senate Committee on Finance. According to ITC officials,  domestic industries may be less likely to seek imposition of safeguards  than AD/CV duties because the imposition of safeguards requires  Presidential approval and a consideration of the impact of relief on the  national economic interest. Therefore, we focus on AD/CV trade  remedies in this report but include information on safeguards in appendix  I. Other trade remedies, such as those providing direct assistance to  harmed domestic parties or addressing infringement of intellectual  property, were outside the scope of our review.", "To examine the extent to which SMEs have petitioned for the imposition  of AD/CV duties, we analyzed ITC data on AD/CV duty petitions from  2007 through 2012, which included information on companies that were  petitioners and non-petitioners. To determine whether a company was an  SME, we searched two databases of U.S. businesses\u2014LexisNexis and  Dun & Bradstreet\u2014to determine the number of employees and whether a  company was a subsidiary of a larger corporation. We designated a  company as an SME if it had fewer than 500 employees and was not a  subsidiary. We analyzed the ITC data to determine the number of SME  petitioners and non-petitioners over the past 6 years. To identify key  challenges to SMEs\u2019 ability to pursue the imposition of AD/CV duties, we  interviewed Commerce and ITC officials, three academics,  representatives from two industry associations, six trade lawyers, two  Congressional Research Service (CRS) trade experts, and two SME  petitioners. We selected the academics, industry association  representatives, and trade lawyers on the basis of recommendations from  CRS trade experts and Commerce and ITC officials. Three of the six  trade law firms we spoke with represented 38 percent of the 21 petitions  with SMEs filed from 2007 through 2012. We contacted 18 SMEs who  filed petitions, but only 2 volunteered to participate in our interview. To  examine assistance provided by Commerce and ITC to help SMEs  address key challenges, we interviewed several of the same parties as for  the prior objective.

This information includes the  composition of the domestic industry, identity of importers, volume and  value of production of the domestic like product by the petitioner and each  U.S. producer, and information concerning material injury. Prospective  petitioners are also required to include information such as the proportion  of total exports to the United States that the petitioners believe each  producer is selling at less than fair value or benefiting from  countervailable subsidies accounted for during the most recent 12-month  period. For AD duty petitions, prospective petitioners should provide  pricing and cost information relevant to calculating dumping margins. For  CV duty petitions, prospective petitioners should provide factual  information relevant to the alleged countervailable subsidy.

These questionnaires ask  responding U.S. producers to indicate whether they support, oppose, or  take no position on the petition. According to ITC officials, all data  submitted by firms in questionnaires are treated as business proprietary,  and thus, individual producer responses with regard to support of the  petition are confidential. During the investigation, ITC holds a hearing that  allows petitioners, other domestic producers, and opposing parties, who  are typically represented by legal counsel, to express their position on the  case and respond to questions that ITC Commissioners may have about  factual information or legal issues in the case.

Generally, ITC makes a  preliminary decision regarding material injury within 45 days after a  petition is filed. If the ITC preliminary decision is negative, the  investigation is terminated. If the ITC determination is affirmative,  Commerce generally makes a preliminary decision regarding whether  imports are being dumped or subsidized within 140 days after initiation for  an AD duty case and 65 days for a CV duty case.

Table 1 lists the products included in the  petitions filed by SME petitioners from 2007 through 2012.", "Producers of goods under investigation, including SMEs, can benefit from  successful AD/CV duty petitions even if they are not petitioners.  Producers may support the petition but choose not to join as petitioners to  avoid bearing the cost, including petition preparation and representation  throughout the proceeding. In some cases individual petitioners may  cover all or most of the legal costs, thereby sparing co-petitioners from  paying for any or much of the cost. Additionally, according to Commerce,  it is possible that some non-petitioners may support the petition by  assuming some of the cost. Trade remedy duties add to the price of  foreign imports and can benefit domestic producers of the competing like  products, regardless of whether or not they choose to be petitioners.  When deciding whether to become a petitioner, a producer weighs the  expected benefits against the cost, according to our literature review and  interviews we conducted with experts. For a producer with a small share  of the market, the expected benefits from a successful petition might be  small, leading to a stronger incentive not to share the cost by becoming a  petitioner. Petitioners also have to weigh the benefit against the cost of  having additional producers join as petitioners. For example, more  petitioners could help an industry obtain greater resources to use for  advocacy and increase the likelihood of a successful petition, but having  more petitioners would also require more effort and cost.", "It is difficult to measure the extent to which non-petitioners, including  SMEs, have benefited from successful AD/CV duty petitions without  knowing either how producers allocated the cost among themselves or  the specific reasons why certain producers chose not to be named on a  petition. Those reasons could include the fear of retaliation from  internationally active producers and not wanting to share the cost, as  discussed earlier. Public ITC reports do not disclose the position of the  non-petitioning domestic producers, unless a non-petitioning producer  has publicly disclosed that information. However, we can estimate the  maximum number of producers who may have benefited from a duty  associated with a successful petition without becoming a petitioner, by  calculating the share of non-petitioners within the industry and assuming  that all non-petitioners benefit from successful petitions without having to  share the cost. As discussed earlier, ITC typically sends questionnaires to  all producers (petitioners and non-petitioners) in the industry during its  material injury investigation. Of the 93 SMEs surveyed by ITC for the  petitions filed from 2007 through 2012, 38 were petitioners and 55 were  non-petitioners.

Agency officials and trade lawyers we spoke with  stated that it is expensive for SMEs to pursue AD/CV duty cases because  the process generally involves trade lawyers. Five of the six trade lawyers  we interviewed roughly estimated that the average legal cost for pursuing  an AD or CV duty case from petition through the investigation was  between $1 million and $2 million, with approximately 70 to 75 percent of  the cost incurred during the investigation phase. One trade lawyer  stated that the average cost for pursuing a case could be considerably  more than $2 million, depending on the complexity of the case or whether  it involves multiple countries. According to agency officials, prospective  petitioners are not required to hire a trade lawyer to file a petition, but  legal representation is advantageous because trade lawyers can obtain  confidential information from multiple domestic producers and foreign  respondents and have the expertise to guide a case through the  investigation phase. Trade lawyers or authorized representatives also  have the ability to obtain confidential information collected by Commerce  or ITC by entering that agency\u2019s Administrative Protective Order (APO)  system. A company would not be able to obtain this information  because producers typically seek to protect their pricing and production  data from disclosure to their competitors. In addition, trade lawyers or  other representatives are able to provide advocacy and guidance through  the often complicated proceedings before Commerce and ITC. For  example, trade lawyers advocate for their clients and challenge those  who oppose the case at public ITC hearings where ITC Commissioners  ask witnesses numerous detailed questions to gather more information.  Commerce officials were only aware of one instance where a petitioner  did not hire a trade lawyer until the investigation phase. In this case, the  officials said the petitioner was the sole producer in its industry.", "Legal costs may be incurred during each phase of an AD/CV duty  investigation, as well as after the investigation is completed.  Representatives from all six trade law firms we spoke with told us that the  overall legal cost of pursuing an AD/CV duty varies according to the  nature of the case. Factors affecting the overall cost include the number  of respondent countries and companies, the complexity of the case, the  number of products involved, and how much data are available. In  addition to the costs associated with pursuing a case through the petition  and investigation phases, additional costs may be incurred after the  completion of a case during appeals and administrative reviews. For  example, SMEs may hire a trade lawyer to represent them if the final  Commerce or ITC determination is appealed to the U.S. Court of  International Trade, or further appealed from that court to the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. SMEs may also use trade lawyers to  assist with any requested yearly administrative reviews of a case, which  determine the final amounts of duties owed on past imports and set new  duty deposit rates for future imports. Trade attorneys look at a range of  trade remedy options to potentially address a trade issue, and may advise  potential petitioners that seeking the imposition of an AD/CV duty is not in  their best interest.", "Petitioners are generally responsible for paying their legal costs, and the  amount each entity pays depends on the particular circumstances of the  case. Two trade lawyers we spoke with stated that in some instances,  petitioners may agree to allocate costs according to each petitioner\u2019s  share of production in the given industry. Another trade lawyer explained  that a petitioner with higher revenue may assume most or all the costs.  One SME petitioner we spoke with said that his company covered the  majority of costs associated with its case because it was the largest  producer in a small industry composed of relatively few other companies.  In some instances, outside sources such as trade associations may cover  some of the costs.

SMEs have fewer employees than larger firms and generally lack  the expertise needed to take on the additional tasks of data collection,  according to agency officials. Representatives from all six law firms and  agency officials we spoke with agreed that SMEs face challenges when  collecting the pricing and production data for a petition because the data  required are extensive and difficult to obtain. An SME petitioner explained  that his company employed legal counsel because his company lacked  the resources and expertise required to research and gather the data  required to file a petition. The SME petitioner further explained that it is  particularly difficult to collect and review domestic and foreign pricing  data, which are composed of several inputs\u2014such as electricity, water,  and raw materials\u2014whose price varies based on geographic location.  One trade lawyer we spoke with hired Chinese nationals to assist with  data collection for AD/CV duty cases involving China.", "Petitioners also face an administrative burden during AD/CV duty  investigations. For example, they are required to respond to detailed ITC  questionnaires that collect the trade, pricing, and financial data ITC uses  in making its determination of whether a domestic industry is materially  injured by reason of the imports under investigation. According to ITC  officials, the questionnaire is comprehensive and takes approximately 50  hours to complete, which may place a strain on SMEs\u2019 limited resources.  Two trade lawyers noted that during the investigation phase they review  data collected by Commerce from foreign respondents. For example, a  trade lawyer may conduct research leading to a discovery that data  reported by a foreign producer may not be accurate. In such an instance,  the trade lawyer may ask Commerce to send a supplemental  questionnaire to collect additional data from the foreign producer.  According to Commerce officials, this information is important because  Commerce uses data in the questionnaire to calculate whether there is  dumping or countervailable subsidization and at what level. Trade lawyers  also help petitioners determine the precise description of the imported  goods, which according to Commerce, it uses to ascertain the scope of  an investigation. For example, a 2010 AD order on seamless refined  copper pipe and tube from China and Mexico defined the product very  narrowly as \u201cseamless circular refined copper pipes and tubes, including  redraw hollows, greater than or equal to 6 inches (152.4mm) in length  and measuring less than 12.130 inches (308.102 mm) (actual) in outside  diameter...\u201d The scope definition went on to define the product with even  greater specificity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demonstrating Industry Support for a Petition to Commerce Can Be Difficult", "paragraphs": ["It can be difficult for prospective petitioners to garner sufficient support  from other producers to demonstrate to Commerce that the petition will  meet the statutory requirement of industry support.

According to four trade lawyers  and agency officials, it can be difficult for SMEs in an industry with  numerous producers to organize themselves in order to meet the  statutory requirement for industry support. For example, SMEs in  geographically dispersed industries with numerous producers\u2014such as  aquaculture and agriculture\u2014may need to coordinate with hundreds of  domestic producers to obtain the support required for their petition. SMEs  may form an industry association to help them coordinate and establish  support for a petition. For example, several hundred shrimp producers  formed the Coalition of Gulf Shrimp Industries to file a petition on behalf  of their industry. These producers would have had more difficulty  undertaking the necessary steps to file a petition if they had remained an  unorganized, geographically dispersed collection of individual companies,  according to an SME petitioner from the coalition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Commerce and ITC Assistance Can Help SMEs Address Key Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Commerce and ITC Staff Help SMEs Obtain Data Required to File a Petition and Review Draft Petitions", "paragraphs": ["Both Commerce and ITC have staff that respond to inquiries and provide  information and assistance to SMEs to relieve some of the administrative  challenges and costs of filing a petition. Commerce and ITC officials  stated that much of the assistance they provide involves helping SMEs  obtain the data needed to file a petition and reviewing draft petitions. If a  petition does not establish that it has the support of domestic producers  or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of total domestic  production, after a petition is filed Commerce staff will send a polling  questionnaire to domestic producers tailored to the product and industry  in question, or rely on other information, to determine if the original  support criterion is met. According to Commerce officials, in cases  where the industry is dispersed, they can provide assistance to petitioners  in their efforts to form a coalition. For example, after discussing options  with Commerce, the numerous shrimp fishing companies and processers  formed an association that enabled them to file six AD petitions in 2004,  according to Commerce officials and a representative for shrimp  producers. Officials from both Commerce and ITC also stated that staff  are on hand to help SMEs obtain publically available data. For example, if  prospective petitioners do preliminary work and data gathering with the  assistance of Commerce staff in advance of hiring law firms, this may  reduce legal costs, according to Commerce officials. In addition, officials  from both agencies stated that they frequently review draft petitions and  comment on how the petitions can be improved to ensure that they  include all the required detailed data to support initiation of an AD/CV  duty investigation.

Commerce has used this authority once  since 1991, under special circumstances. In 1991, when Canada  unilaterally terminated a 1986 trade agreement with the United States,  Commerce self-initiated a softwood lumber investigation. The United  States and Canada had entered into an agreement in 1986 regarding the  importation of softwood lumber that required the U.S. industry to withdraw  its CV duty petition and Commerce to terminate its ongoing CV duty  investigation. According to Commerce officials, because the initiation of  the softwood lumber case followed a bilateral dispute between the two  governments, it is an example of how Commerce applies special  circumstances as criteria for using its self-initiation authority.", "Because self-initiation opens an investigation without a petition, it could  reduce some initial costs to SMEs but could also have adverse effects,  including raising questions of whether the action was taken consistent  with U.S. obligations under international trade agreements. Opening an  investigation without a petition could reduce the costs that SMEs incur  during the petition phase, but would likely have little impact on overall  costs because most legal costs are incurred during the investigation  phase. For example, one trade lawyer and an official representing a  coalition of SMEs suggested that self-initiation could lead to decreased  legal costs because less time would be billed and lawyers\u2019 involvement  could start at the investigation phase. However, according to Commerce  officials, changing the department\u2019s practice to permit increased use of its  self-initiation authority could be vulnerable in U.S. courts. In addition,  Commerce officials stated that the limited use of self-initiation is  consistent with language in the World Trade Organization (WTO)  Antidumping Agreement, the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures  Agreement, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which  limits the ability to self-initiate investigations to instances in which there  are \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d According to Commerce, the department has  limited resources to self-initiate investigations, and self-initiation without  significant participation of the industry is unlikely to result in the imposition  of duties. Finally, Commerce noted that when it initiates an investigation  based on a petition or by self-initiation, its decision is based on  information available to it that indicates that a formal investigation is  warranted. Therefore, when Commerce initiates an investigation by  petition or by self-initiation, it needs the cooperation of the affected  industry to help gather information that is generally the same as that  required in a petition. According to Commerce officials, the data needed  to show that a domestic industry is experiencing injury as a result of  dumping or subsidization are most readily available to that same industry.  Therefore, Commerce would need significant cooperation and data from  domestic producers to meet the requirements to initiate an investigation.", "Commerce officials also stated that the United States tries to serve as a  role model for other WTO signatory countries, so any increased use of  self-initiation could lead to additional adverse effects. For example, other  countries might open investigations without the data supporting  allegations of unfair trade practices, which are normally included in a  petition. In addition, both Commerce and ITC officials expressed  concerns that without support and direct participation from domestic  producers affected by unfair trade practices, it would be difficult for ITC to  obtain the detailed, company-specific information in the 45 days available  to it to make a preliminary determination. According to ITC officials, the  questionnaires they send to domestic producers to obtain the data that  support allegations of material injury are based on product definitions  usually included in the petitions. Therefore, if an investigation is initiated  without a petition, ITC would lack key information it needs to develop its  questionnaires."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["U.S. AD/CV duty laws implement U.S. international obligations under the  World Trade Organization (WTO).

Commerce and  ITC require detailed information to generate sufficient evidence to  substantiate a case. High legal costs, difficulty obtaining pricing and  production data, and garnering industry support may prove too much of a  challenge for many SMEs to overcome. However, these challenges are  part of a process designed to ensure that the imposition of AD/CV duties  on foreign exports is backed by sufficient evidence of unfair trade  practices and is consistent with U.S. law and internationally agreed-upon  standards.", "Whether or not a U.S. industry ultimately files an AD/CV duty petition is a  complex decision made after considering the resources required for the  petition and investigation process, whether there is sufficient industry  support, and the probable outcome. While both Commerce and ITC  provide some assistance to SMEs, in the absence of additional public  resources to help SMEs address the challenges of high legal costs and  difficulty obtaining pricing and production data, limited options exist to  address challenges to pursuing the imposition of AD/CV duties.

Most ITC safeguard investigations are conducted on the basis of  a petition filed by a representative of a domestic industry.

Instead, ITC must first find that increased imports are a substantial cause  of serious injury (or threat thereof) to a domestic industry producing an  article like or directly competitive with the imported article. If ITC makes  an affirmative injury determination, it recommends a remedy to the  President.

Since 2001, safeguard measures have been imposed twice. In 2002,  safeguard measures were imposed on imports of certain steel products  under the global safeguards provisions following an affirmative ITC injury  determination and remedy recommendations in response to a request for  investigation made by the U.S. Trade Representative and a subsequent  resolution by the Senate Committee on Finance. These measures were in  effect from March 2002 until December 2003, when they were terminated  by the President following an adverse report by the World Trade  Organization Dispute Settlement Body. In 2009 the President imposed  higher tariffs on imports of certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires  from China under the China safeguard provision following an affirmative  ITC injury determination and remedy recommendation in response to a  petition from a labor union representing U.S. workers producing tires. The  safeguard measure on tires from China was in effect between September  2009 and September 2012.

These  data contained the names and locations of the companies, and the  products in question in the petitions. To identify which companies were  SMEs, we used a combination of both LexisNexis and Dun & Bradstreet  databases to search for the number of employees and affiliation  information. Our method for collecting and assessing the information on  company employment size and their affiliation to determine whether a  company was an SME was as follows:", "We first searched the LexisNexis database for the number of  employees and affiliation information of each of the 406 companies.", "If LexisNexis did not contain the company or the number of  employees, we then searched Dun & Bradstreet. We were able to find  the number of employees for 386 of the 406 companies.", "Based on the information obtained from these two databases, we  determined whether the company was an SME using the following  criteria: (1) the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of  Advocacy\u2019s definition of SME based on the number of employees (i.e.  fewer than 500 employees), and (2) the company affiliation  information. In other words, we designated companies that were not  subsidiaries of a larger company and had fewer than 500 employees  as SMEs. If we were unable to determine whether a company was a  subsidiary, we did not designate it as an SME. This methodology  reflects the overall conservative approach we developed to avoid  over-counting the number of SMEs. We identified 46 SME petitioners  at the end of this step.", "As a check on the reliability of the data, for the 46 SME petitioners we  identified in the prior step, we conducted a second search in Dun &  Bradstreet for the number of employees and affiliation information. For  the companies where the number of employees differed, we used the  larger employment number to make the final determination as to  whether a company was an SME. After this check, we concluded that  38 petitioners were SMEs. Information on the number of employees  for 7 of the 38 SME petitioners came from one database, which we  determined to be adequate because there was a high level of  correspondence between the two databases. For the 42 companies  for which we had employment numbers from both data sources, the  employment numbers were largely consistent. There were only two  companies for which one source showed under 500 employees and  the other showed 500 and over.", "To assess the characteristics of the SME petitioners, we analyzed the  annual sales revenue and the industry distribution of the 38 SME  petitioners.
