Specifically, the Indian Health Service (IHS) worked with tribes to identify, in fiscal year 2016, an estimated $3.2 billion in water infrastructure projects to address existing sanitation deficiencies in Indian homes, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified an additional $2.4 billion in future tribal drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years. However, IHS could enhance the accuracy of its information about the water infrastructure needs of some Indian homes. In February 2018, the database that IHS uses to track Indian homes' sanitation deficiencies showed that about one-third of the homes (138,700) had no deficiency. However, because the database does not provide IHS with a way to record if a home's deficiency has been assessed, IHS could not determine whether these homes had no deficiency or if they had not yet been assessed to identify a deficiency. IHS officials stated that improving the database's accuracy would be beneficial. By implementing a way to indicate in its database whether these homes' deficiencies have been assessed, IHS could also more efficiently address any deficiencies in these homes.", "Federal agencies provided about $370 million for tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects in fiscal year 2016, including some projects to address what the agencies identified as the most severe sanitation deficiencies (i.e., communities that lack safe drinking water or wastewater disposal). IHS and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) policies direct the agencies to fund tribal projects that address these deficiencies. However, agency scoring processes may not always prioritize the projects that address them:", "IHS assigns points to projects using eight scoring factors, including sanitation deficiency and cost. Based on GAO's review of IHS documents and interviews with agency officials, IHS's process for selecting projects can discourage funding some projects that address the most severe sanitation deficiencies, especially those with a relatively high cost per home. As a result, some projects to serve homes without water infrastructure can remain unfunded for many years. IHS officials said the scoring factors balance a number of interests, and the agency is looking to improve the extent to which it funds projects that address these deficiencies.", "USDA uses a different set of scoring factors to assign points when evaluating project applications for its tribal water program, including rural population and income levels. However, USDA does not have a scoring factor to assign points to a project based on whether it will serve homes that lack safe drinking water or wastewater disposal, as it does with another program with similar goals. Instead, USDA officials said they use discretionary points to score projects on this basis, but these points may not be awarded at all. As a result, USDA may not have reasonable assurance that it consistently evaluates project applications in a way that aligns with agency policy to fund projects that address the most severe sanitation deficiencies.", "By IHS reviewing and USDA updating their scoring processes, the agencies could have more assurance that the projects they fund address the most severe sanitation deficiencies in Indian communities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 16 recommendations, including that (1) IHS develop a way to indicate in its database if homes' deficiencies have been assessed and (2) IHS and USDA review and update project scoring processes.

According to IHS  estimates, the federal government provides a significant share of the  financial assistance to construct and repair drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure in Indian country. In contrast, in non-tribal communities,  utilities typically sell municipal bonds and raise revenues to pay for  construction of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure by charging  customers. These communities and utilities can receive funding and  planning assistance from their respective states and the federal  government to repair, replace, and upgrade their drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure. In Indian country, tribes, tribally owned utilities,  or separate entities are generally responsible for operating and  maintaining drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. However,  according to a national intertribal organization, tribes typically do not  have access to the same array of financing options as state or local  governments, and do not necessarily charge their customers for services.", "Seven federal agencies administer programs that provide drinking water  and wastewater infrastructure assistance to Indian tribes.

We  reviewed IHS\u2019s and EPA\u2019s most recent reports describing tribal drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure needs and reviewed the supporting  data in IHS\u2019s Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) on proposed tribal  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects from fiscal year  2016, the most recent year of data available at the time of our review.  To assess the reliability of SDS project data and EPA needs information,  we discussed the data and any of its limitations with agency officials and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to provide descriptive  information about tribes\u2019 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  project needs. We also assessed the reliability of specific information in  IHS\u2019s Home Inventory Tracking System (HITS), including the sanitation  deficiencies associated with homes, by reviewing documentation and  interviewing IHS officials. As we discuss later in this report, we indicate  when we found certain limitations with that information. We did not assess  the reliability of other information in HITS that was not relevant to our  review. We interviewed IHS and EPA officials involved with identifying  tribal water needs from all 12 IHS areas and the 9 EPA regions that  administer tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure programs.

To assess the reliability of the data obtained from  these agencies, we discussed the funding data, each agency\u2019s data  system, and any limitations with agency officials and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objective.  To determine the extent to which agency funding addressed the most  severe sanitation deficiencies, we identified programs that have  documented goals in regulation and policy to fund projects that address  these needs. For these programs, we compared the number of funded  projects that addressed the most severe deficiencies with the number of  funded projects that met other needs for fiscal year 2016. During the  course of reviewing these regulations and agencies\u2019 obligations data, we  identified issues with how USDA awarded grants under one of its tribal  programs\u2014the Rural Alaska Village Grant program. We then obtained  and reviewed documentation of these grant awards and interviewed  officials who manage the program and officials from the agency\u2019s Office  of the General Counsel.", "To determine the extent to which the federal agencies collaborated to  meet tribal water needs, we reviewed documentation of national-level  interagency collaboration, including memorandums of understanding.  We compared the agencies\u2019 actions to the key features of interagency  collaboration that we have previously identified. We reviewed agencies\u2019  collaboration at the regional level by surveying the seven agencies about  their joint actions on activities related to tribal drinking water and  wastewater in six states\u2014Alaska, Arizona, California, New York,  Oklahoma, and South Dakota\u2014and by conducting a network analysis  using the survey responses. We selected regional offices that operate in  individual states as the unit of analysis because the federal agencies  organize their field structures differently, with some using region, area,  and state offices to work with tribes\u2014we refer to all of these office types  as regional offices. We selected this nonprobability sample of six states to  include a large percentage of the number of federally recognized tribes, to  obtain a range in the total federal obligations to tribes and the identified  needs of tribes, and for geographic diversity. The sample of states is not  generalizable, and the results of our work do not apply to all states where  Indian tribes are located. However, they provide illustrative examples of  interagency collaboration within the six selected states, which include  about 70 percent of the 573 federally recognized tribes.", "We sent collaboration surveys to the regional offices of each of the seven  federal agencies in the six states. We also sent a survey to the State of  Alaska because the state provides a 25 percent match for two federal  water infrastructure programs, but we did not include other state agencies  in our survey because they do not provide a similar match. The survey  asked each agency regional office in each state about the mechanisms  that it used to collaborate with each of the other regional offices within the  same state for the 3-year period prior to our survey, the factors that  affected their collaboration, and any additional mechanisms that would be  beneficial to use in the future. We disseminated a total of 46 surveys and  obtained and analyzed 46 responses. We conducted site visits to three of  the six states, selected based on their geographic diversity and the range  of identified water infrastructure needs. We also interviewed federal  agency officials and officials with the State of Alaska about their  collaboration in the six states. We interviewed officials from 22 Indian  tribes and representatives from 8 intertribal organizations to obtain their  perspectives on obtaining drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  assistance from the seven agencies in the six selected states.

A regulated, centralized  wastewater system may include sewer lines, tanks, and wastewater  treatment plants or lagoons, but small, rural communities are more likely  to have decentralized wastewater systems, such as individual septic  systems. Once centralized water or wastewater systems are constructed  in Indian country, ownership is typically transferred to the tribe. A tribally  owned utility, tribal government, or a separate entity operates and  maintains the system on behalf of the tribe.

According to EPA and IHS  documents, some tribal members may haul drinking water from a  regulated drinking water source. However, containers used to haul and  store the water can introduce bacteria and other contaminants. Also,  because the regulated water source in some communities may be many  miles away, residents may haul drinking water from nearby unregulated  water sources, such as streams or livestock wells.

Therefore, the remaining approximately  176,600 tribal homes had deficiency levels 1 through 5. HITS  automatically assigns a deficiency level 0 to each home when IHS enters  it into the system, and homes remain at a deficiency level 0 until IHS  develops projects in the SDS to serve those homes.

For  example, Phoenix Area staff said they knew of homes with a deficiency  level 4 or 5 that had a deficiency level 0 in HITS because these homes  were not yet included within the scope of an SDS project.

For homes that are not connected to a public water  system, such as homes with private wells, IHS staff may need to visit  homes to identify any existing deficiencies, with permission of the tribe.  For homes connected to a public water system, staff can assign the  homes the deficiency level associated with the water system but may  need to visit the community to assess the system\u2019s overall deficiency  level.

IHS had not included  the remaining approximately 138,700 homes with a deficiency level 0 in  a project in the SDS.

Specifically,  according to IHS\u2019s Sanitation Facilities Construction program policy, the  program\u2019s goal includes providing funding first and in greater degree to  homes and communities with the greatest needs, that is, those that lack  safe drinking water or wastewater disposal, or both. EPA\u2019s clean water  set-aside program policy states the program\u2019s goal is to protect public  health in Indian country by addressing the lack of access to sanitation  facilities (i.e., deficiency levels 4 and 5 for IHS and EPA). Finally, under  the applicable requirements and policy, USDA\u2019s Native American  program\u2019s objective is to provide water and waste disposal facilities and  services to low-income rural communities whose residents face significant  health risks. The program\u2019s goal includes funding the neediest projects,  giving priority to areas that lack running water, flushing toilets, and  modern sewage disposal systems.", "According to agency policy, IHS\u2019s Sanitation Facilities Construction  program and EPA\u2019s clean water set-aside program prioritize and select  projects to fund according to the projects\u2019 rankings in each IHS area\u2019s  SDS list. To create the ranked lists, IHS staff assign scores to each  project based on a set of eight scoring factors, each with a different  number of points that may be assigned to a project (see table 2).", "USDA prioritizes and selects projects to fund from its Native American  program using a different process than IHS and EPA. USDA\u2019s process  involves tribes, working with USDA state offices, submitting project grant  applications to the headquarters office. USDA state offices score project  applications before submitting them to the headquarters office. USDA  policy directs the program to make funds available according to priority,  and the agency accepts and evaluates applications and awards grants  throughout the year. USDA officials said the program maintains a wait list  for eligible applications received after all available funds have been  obligated each year. According to USDA\u2019s scoring sheet for the Native  American program, the agency evaluates project applications based on a  set of five scoring factors, each with a different number of points to award.  These scoring factor categories include population, income, joint  financing, and discretionary points that can be awarded at state offices  and headquarters (see table 3). USDA officials said that they also take  SDS deficiency levels into account when reviewing project applications,  but that the statute authorizing the Native American program does not  specifically reference IHS\u2019s deficiency level definitions.", "Using their respective processes to prioritize and select projects for  funding, IHS\u2019s Sanitation Facilities Construction program, EPA\u2019s clean  water set-aside program, and USDA\u2019s Native American program  obligated a total of nearly $110 million in fiscal year 2016 for projects to  meet a mixture of needs. For example, for approximately 190 projects  from the SDS that IHS, EPA, and others funded in fiscal year 2016, about  40 percent were projects to address deficiency levels 2 and 3, and about  60 percent were projects to address deficiency levels 4 and 5. Further,  in fiscal year 2016, USDA reported that its Native American program  funded four projects that provided new drinking water and wastewater  service to some tribal communities and funded nine projects that  replaced, renovated, or expanded existing infrastructure. Based on our  review of IHS and USDA documents, deficiency level 2 and 3 projects as  well as replacement and renovation projects can address important water  quality and other problems, but they generally do not address the most  severe deficiencies or the most significant health risks.", "Based on our review of IHS and EPA documents and interviews with  these agencies\u2019 officials, we found that their process for prioritizing and  selecting projects to fund from the SDS can discourage funding some  deficiency level 4 and 5 projects, especially those with a relatively high  cost per home. According to some IHS area officials we interviewed,  applying IHS\u2019s scoring factors and the points associated with each factor  means that deficiency level 3 projects may score higher than\u2014and  therefore receive funding before\u2014deficiency level 4 or 5 projects. For  example, a project\u2019s cost per home is a significant contributor to its score  because IHS assigns as low as minus 20 points for projects that have a  relatively high cost to implement per home. IHS officials said that,  typically, deficiency level 3 projects replace existing community  infrastructure and serve more homes, which makes those projects\u2019  relative cost per home lower than deficiency level 4 and 5 projects. IHS  headquarters officials explained that they developed the SDS scoring  system in consultation with tribes so the system could balance the need  to fund deficiency level 4 and 5 projects with the need to fund projects  with lower deficiencies that address health needs and serve a larger  number of homes. However, because deficiency level 4 and 5 projects  may rank lower than some projects that address less severe deficiencies  and rank too low to be funded in a given year, hundreds of feasible  projects to address the most severe sanitation deficiencies have  remained on SDS lists for 5 years or more, based on our review of these  lists. As of the end of fiscal year 2016, many of these projects had not  been selected for funding from IHS or EPA.", "IHS headquarters officials said that the agency is working to improve the  extent to which it funds feasible projects to address the highest sanitation  deficiencies. For example, these officials said that they are updating the  2003 Sanitation Facilities Construction program guidelines to incorporate subsequently issued guidance, and this update should also more directly  align the guidelines with the program\u2019s original focus\u2014to prioritize service  to Indian homes and communities that lack access to piped water and  sewer systems. However, a senior IHS official said that changing the  SDS scoring factors is not part of this effort because the current scoring  factors balance a number of interests in addition to projects\u2019 deficiency  levels. The official said that higher deficiency level projects ranking lower  than other projects on the SDS list in a given year does not mean that  public health needs are going unaddressed. Yet, our analysis shows that  projects to address the highest deficiency levels have remained in the  SDS for many years. We recognize that IHS faces trade-offs when  selecting tribal infrastructure projects to fund. By reassessing the point  distribution across the SDS scoring factors as part of IHS\u2019s program  guidelines update, in light of trade-offs between funding projects that  address the most severe sanitation deficiencies and projects that meet  other needs, IHS may have better assurance that its projects address the  most severe sanitation deficiencies in Indian communities.", "Regarding USDA\u2019s Native American program, based on our review of  agency documents and interviews with USDA officials, we found that the  agency\u2019s process for prioritizing and selecting projects may not provide  USDA with reasonable assurance that it is selecting projects to fund that  address the most severe sanitation deficiencies. Specifically, USDA\u2019s  scoring factors for its Native American program do not include a scoring  factor category to evaluate the extent to which projects will address health  risks that stem from tribes\u2019 lack of drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure. In contrast, USDA prioritizes projects to fund under its  Colonias grant program using an additional scoring factor that awards  points based on the extent to which a proposed project will address  health risks stemming from lack of safe drinking water and wastewater  disposal in a colonia. For example, USDA awards 50 points for projects  in colonias where a lack of access to safe drinking water and wastewater  disposal results in a significant health risk. We recommended in  December 2009 that USDA take steps to better target its limited funds  for the Colonias program, and USDA responded in part by creating the  additional scoring factor for colonias to ensure that the neediest colonias  receive funding.", "To prioritize Native American program applications that address  significant health risks, USDA officials said they use discretionary points.  However, according to program policy, USDA state office and  headquarters officials may award discretionary points to meet other  purposes that are not related to addressing health risks, such as  encouraging projects with green infrastructure or promoting geographic  diversity among grantees, or they may not award these points at all. As a  result, USDA may not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently  evaluating or funding project applications in a way that aligns with the  Native American program\u2019s goal. USDA policy states that both the Native  American and Colonias programs are to prioritize areas that lack running  water, flushing toilets, and modern sewage disposal systems. By  implementing a scoring factor similar to the one in the Colonias  program\u2014that is, one that awards points for proposed projects that  address health risks from a lack of access to safe drinking water and  wastewater disposal\u2014for the Native American program, USDA would  have more assurance that it is evaluating project applications consistently  and funding projects to address the most severe sanitation deficiencies in  Indian communities, consistent with the program\u2019s goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Did Not Always Award Rural Alaska Village Grants to Authorized Recipients, and the Program\u2019s Regulations Are Inconsistent with Its Authority", "paragraphs": ["During the course of reviewing funding for tribal drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure projects, we encountered several issues with  one of USDA\u2019s tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  programs, the Rural Alaska Village Grant program. Specifically, section  306D of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act authorizes  USDA to make grants to the State of Alaska for the benefit of rural or  Native villages to provide for the development and construction of  drinking water and wastewater systems. According to USDA reports,  these grants are used for projects that have provided, for example, rural  Alaska Native residents with access to safe drinking water and flush  toilets in their homes. From the program\u2019s beginning in fiscal year 1997  through fiscal year 2016, USDA awarded 455 grants totaling more than  $444 million to provide safe drinking water and wastewater disposal to  thousands of Alaska Natives in remote communities.", "We found that from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2016, USDA  awarded 159 Rural Alaska Village grants totaling about $157 million to  recipients not authorized by section 306D. These recipients were Alaska  Native villages, municipalities, and the Alaska Native Tribal Health  Consortium, which is the tribal organization that administers IHS\u2019s  Sanitation Facilities Construction program in Alaska. USDA\u2019s  appropriations acts for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, however,  authorized USDA to provide Rural Alaska Village grants to the  Consortium. Of the 159 grants, USDA awarded 127 grants (about  $121 million) to municipalities and Alaska Native villages from 1997  through 2016, and it awarded 32 grants (about $36 million) to the  Consortium in 2011 before first receiving authority to do so in fiscal year  2012. Based on our review of a list of USDA grant agreements, selected  agreements, and according to agency officials, in 2011, USDA signed  32 such agreements with the Consortium and the communities on whose  behalf the Consortium administered the grants. USDA officials stated that  the agency made seven total obligations to the Consortium in 2011 for  these grants.", "USDA officials stated that they did not agree that the agency had  awarded Rural Alaska Village grants to ineligible entities because the  program\u2019s authorizing statute gives the State of Alaska control over the  use of the grants, and the state concurred with USDA making some  grants directly to other parties. For example, the USDA officials stated  that a 2011 memorandum of agreement between USDA, the State of  Alaska, IHS, and the Consortium was a vehicle for the state to direct a  portion of the Rural Alaska Village grants to other parties. These officials  stated that since the statute does not prevent the state from redirecting  portions of the grant to other parties, it is not improper for USDA to enter  into an agreement with the state to award the grants directly to other  parties so that the state does not have to redirect them. In commenting on  a draft of this report, USDA noted that the agency has awarded two  grants to municipalities since signing the 2011 agreement.", "In addition, USDA officials said that they entered into the memorandum  of agreement and began awarding grants to the Consortium in 2011 to  address problems with the program\u2019s administration, which resulted in  projects that were delayed or halted. For example, USDA stated in a 2010  report that the State of Alaska had not adequately documented project  costs and that USDA staff were concerned that the state had not applied  the obligations it received from USDA to the intended communities.  According to USDA officials, they have seen a significant improvement in  the state\u2019s grant administration and more timely delivery of projects since  the 2011 agreement. In addition, the Rural Alaska Village Grant program  manager said the agency awards grants directly to Native villages that  have the capacity to administer them. In commenting on a draft of this  report, USDA stated that the agency has made all grants to the  Consortium pursuant to the 2011 memorandum of agreement.", "The State of Alaska can choose to make subgrants once it receives the  Rural Alaska Village grant, but section 306D of the Consolidated Farm  and Rural Development Act only authorizes USDA to award grants to the  State of Alaska. Moreover, the 2011 memorandum of agreement cannot  authorize USDA to award grants to recipients that are not authorized by  statute. By ensuring that all Rural Alaska Village grants are awarded only  to recipients identified as eligible in section 306D or USDA appropriations  acts, USDA will have assurance that it is complying with the law. If USDA  wants to award Rural Alaska Village grants to municipalities and Alaska  Native villages, it should seek authority to do so, as it did to award such  grants to the Consortium.", "In addition, the regulations governing the Rural Alaska Village Grant  program identify rural or native villages in Alaska as eligible grant  recipients. USDA officials explained that the agency amended the Rural  Alaska Village Grant program regulations in 2015 to codify the 2011  memorandum of agreement. However, this regulation identifying rural  and Alaska Native villages as eligible grant recipients expands USDA\u2019s  authority to award grants beyond the existing statutory authorities, which  do not list rural or Alaska Native villages as eligible recipients.

In the  memorandum, the member agencies also agreed on the task force\u2019s  stated purposes, one of which is to enhance the efficient leveraging of  funds.", "Leadership. We have found that identifying one agency as the leader  of a collaborative group is often beneficial because it centralizes  accountability and can speed decision making.

According to an official involved with the task  force, EPA\u2019s role has provided continuity in leadership.", "The task force\u2019s efforts have yielded some specific results. For example,  in 2013, tribal infrastructure task force members agreed to adopt a  uniform preliminary engineering report template, a key supporting  document that multiple agencies require in their project application and  evaluation processes. Task force members created this template in part  in response to our October 2012 recommendation that EPA and USDA  develop such a document. According to agency officials we interviewed,  the report template has been helpful for tribes since they no longer have  to produce different versions of the same document when submitting  multiple applications to different agencies. USDA officials said they have  since worked with other agencies to develop an online version of the  preliminary engineering report that is accessible to task force members  and others to further improve collaboration.", "However, according to agency officials involved with the task force, there  may be additional opportunities to improve the efficiency of their  collaboration at the national level. For example, in 2011, a workgroup of  the task force identified a series of 10 options to increase the efficiency of  collaboration by streamlining their application processes. As of  November 2017, according to agency officials, the task force had not  acted on most of the options. One such option was for agencies to better  align their different funding and application cycles where possible.  Several tribal officials and representatives from a tribal organization we  interviewed cited challenges with complying with the agencies\u2019 different  application requirements. For example, they said that doing so can be  resource intensive and can make it difficult to obtain funds for one project.  Other tribal officials we interviewed also identified ways that agencies could improve their collaboration that would benefit tribal applicants and  that the task force did not identify in its 2011 report. For example, various  tribal officials suggested that agencies standardize federal program  application processes and coordinate their outreach to tribes to discuss  agency programs and their requirements.", "According to an agency official involved with the task force, when the  group considered which options from the 2011 report to implement,  member agencies focused their efforts on implementing those that were  most achievable given the agencies\u2019 limited resources. Other officials  also said that it would be worthwhile to reconsider some of the options  identified in the report. As stated in the task force\u2019s 2013 memorandum of  understanding, one of its purposes is to enhance the member agencies\u2019  efficient leveraging of funds.

However, based on our review of agency survey  responses, these agencies did not always collaborate in each of the six  states. We measured agency collaboration in terms of the number of  instances in which one agency regional office reported using a  collaborative mechanism with another agency. These collaborative  mechanisms include state- or project-level working groups,  memorandums of understanding, and shared databases, among others.  In responses to our survey, we found that the number of instances of  agency regional offices reporting that they used one or more collaborative  mechanism with other agencies varied across the six states. For  example, the agencies\u2019 regional offices collaborated the most in Alaska  and the least in New York and Oklahoma.

Appendix II contains additional details about our survey and  agency responses.", "In responses to our survey, certain agencies\u2019 regional offices reported  collaborating with each other in some states but not in other states. For example, EPA and USDA regional offices both reported working together  in Alaska, Arizona, and California, but not in New York, Oklahoma, or  South Dakota. IHS and HUD reported collaborating with each other in  three states but not in the other states. Not all agencies work with tribes in  every state. For example, Reclamation does not operate in Alaska or New  York, so we did not survey the agency in those states. The Corps\u2019  regional offices responded that they are not authorized to work on  drinking water or wastewater infrastructure with tribes in two of the six  states. In contrast, IHS and EPA regional offices reported collaborating  with each other in all six states, the most of any agency pair.", "In their responses to our survey and in interviews, the seven federal  agencies\u2019 regional offices most frequently identified three key factors that  limited how much they collaborated in the six states. Specifically:  Incompatibility of agency policies and missions. Agencies\u2019  regional offices reported that having incompatible policies or agency  missions was a factor that had hindered their collaboration with other  agencies. For example, IHS and HUD regional offices in four states  reported that a restriction on IHS\u2019s ability to serve new homes  constructed with grants from HUD\u2019s housing programs limited their  collaboration. Several agencies\u2019 regional offices reported that  having compatible policies helped their collaboration. For example,  IHS and USDA regional offices in Alaska responded that multiple  agencies\u2019 use of IHS\u2019s SDS list as a common source for identifying  potential projects to fund has helped collaboration. We previously  found that adopting compatible policies and procedures is one way for  agencies to establish means of operating across agency  boundaries.", "Insufficient resources. An additional factor that hindered agencies\u2019  collaboration was insufficient staff and financial resources. For  example, HUD and IHS regional officials we interviewed in Arizona  said that a state-level tribal infrastructure working group they were  involved in became inactive in 2016, after the lead agency determined  it was unable to continue dedicating staff resources to that role and  none of the other agencies picked up the lead. In contrast, several  IHS and EPA regional offices reported that the existence of standard  interagency agreements that facilitate transferring EPA funds to IHS  helped them collaborate and leverage funding for projects that each  agency would not have funded on its own. Identifying and leveraging  the resources needed to initiate or sustain a collaborative effort is a  key consideration for implementing the interagency collaborative  mechanisms we previously identified.", "Absence of personal relationships. Agencies\u2019 regional offices also  reported that the absence of relationships with staff from other  agencies hindered their collaboration. In contrast, agencies\u2019 regional  offices reported that having good working relationships with staff from  other agencies helped their collaboration. For example, USDA\u2019s  regional office and the State of Alaska reported that their strong  relationships with each other and other agencies in Alaska helped  their collaboration, and that these relationships were enhanced by  agency staff\u2019s frequent communication through regular meetings. We  previously found that having positive working relationships can bridge  organizational cultures and build trust.", "In their responses to the survey and in interviews, several agencies\u2019  regional offices identified examples of inefficiencies that have occurred  when they did not collaborate, including inefficient use of their limited  resources. For example, officials from one EPA region we interviewed  said that there have been years when EPA staff spent time developing a  project only to learn that USDA had already funded the same project. The  officials stated that this inefficiency could have been avoided if they had  been communicating with their USDA counterparts about the projects that  each agency was considering to fund. Also, in two states, EPA\u2019s regional  office reported that EPA and USDA may be missing opportunities to  leverage funding for individual projects by not sharing information about  projects.", "In all six states, nearly all of the federal agency regional offices  responded that it would be beneficial to increase their collaboration.  Specifically, more than 90 percent of the federal agency respondents  identified at least one collaborative mechanism that would be beneficial  for them to begin using with another agency. The specific mechanisms  that the agencies identified appeared to relate to the amount of  collaboration in which they had already engaged. For example, agency  regional offices that reported not having collaborated with another agency  most frequently said that it would be beneficial to begin having informal  communications with their counterparts in other agencies and to start  sharing project-specific documents such as preliminary engineering  reports. Alternatively, agency regional offices that reported having  collaborated with another agency most frequently responded that it would  be beneficial to begin using a memorandum of understanding as an  additional mechanism for collaborating where they had not already done  so. In the tribal infrastructure task force\u2019s 2013 memorandum of  understanding, the member agencies\u2014IHS, EPA, USDA, HUD, and  Reclamation\u2014agreed that they are expected to collaborate at the  regional level to provide safe drinking water and basic sanitation for tribes  and to more efficiently leverage program funds. By directing their regional  offices to identify and pursue additional mechanisms to increase their  collaboration, the task force member agencies would have better  assurance that their regional offices are efficiently leveraging limited  program funds and following through on the commitment to collaborate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Identifying and addressing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  needs in Indian country is a difficult undertaking. IHS dedicates a  significant effort each year to working with tribes to identify their existing  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs. However, one of  IHS\u2019s systems\u2014HITS\u2014may be missing tens of thousands of eligible  Indian homes, an unknown number of which may have existing sanitation  deficiencies. Additionally, some homes\u2019 deficiency levels in HITS are  inaccurate. By implementing a targeted, resource-efficient method to  identify additional eligible Indian homes that may have existing sanitation  deficiencies to include in HITS, IHS could have better assurance that it  has more complete information to help improve its estimate of the number  of eligible Indian homes that may need sanitation facilities assistance.  Also, IHS officials said that improving the system\u2019s accuracy would be  beneficial. By implementing a mechanism to indicate in HITS whether  each home with a deficiency level of 0 has been assessed, IHS could  also have more efficient ways to take steps to address the deficiencies  of the homes contained in HITS.", "IHS and USDA funded some projects to address the most severe  sanitation deficiencies, but residents of many Indian homes remain  without safe drinking water or wastewater disposal as the agencies also  prioritized and funded projects that addressed other needs. We recognize  that IHS faces trade-offs when selecting tribal infrastructure projects to  fund. By reassessing the point distribution across the SDS scoring factors  as part of IHS\u2019s program guidelines update, in light of trade-offs between  funding projects that address the most severe sanitation deficiencies and  projects that meet other needs, IHS may have better assurance that its  projects address the most severe sanitation deficiencies in Indian  communities. Also, by USDA implementing a scoring factor similar to the  one in its Colonias program\u2014that is, one that awards points for proposed  projects that address health risks from a lack of access to safe drinking  water and wastewater disposal\u2014for the Native American program, USDA  would have more assurance that it is evaluating project applications  consistently and funding projects to address the most severe sanitation  deficiencies in Indian communities, consistent with the program\u2019s goal.", "USDA has provided thousands of Alaska Natives with safe drinking water  and wastewater infrastructure through its Rural Alaska Village Grant  program. However, USDA awarded some grants to recipients not  authorized by statute. By ensuring that all Rural Alaska Village grants are  awarded only to recipients authorized by statute, USDA will have  assurance that it is complying with the law. If USDA wants to award Rural  Alaska Village grants to municipalities and Alaska Native villages, it  should seek authority to do so as it did to award these grants to the  Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. Also, until USDA amends the  Rural Alaska Village Grant program regulations to be consistent with  USDA\u2019s authority, the agency\u2019s regulations will continue to recognize  recipients not authorized by statute.", "The five agencies that participate in the national tribal infrastructure task  force have committed to working together at the national and regional  levels to increase tribes\u2019 access to safe drinking water and basic  sanitation. In our previous work, we have found that achieving important  national outcomes, such as providing access to safe drinking water and  wastewater disposal, often requires collaborative efforts by a number of  programs across the federal government. At the national level, the task  force has not acted on most of the options it previously identified to  improve member agencies\u2019 collaboration. By reviewing the 2011 task  force report and identifying and implementing additional actions to help  increase their collaboration, the task force member agencies could  improve their ability to leverage limited program funds. At the regional  level, we found that the task force member agencies had not fulfilled their  commitment to collaborate in all of the six states we reviewed. Responses  to our survey also indicated that there is unrealized potential for the task  force member agencies\u2019 regional offices to increase the extent of their  collaboration.

Of the five agencies to which we directed recommendations, three\u2014 Health and Human Services, HUD, and Interior\u2014agreed with the  recommendations directed to them. The fourth agency, EPA, agreed with  one of the recommendations and agreed with the intent of the second  recommendation but proposed revised language, as discussed below.  The Acting Director of Grants Evaluation for HUD\u2019s Office of Native  American Programs provided comments by e-mail, and Health and  Human Services, Interior, and EPA provided written comments that are  reproduced in appendixes V, VI, and VII, respectively. The fifth agency to  which we directed recommendations, USDA, disagreed with the two  recommendations regarding the Rural Alaska Village Grant program and  neither agreed nor disagreed with the other three recommendations  directed to it, although the agency proposed alternative language for two  of these recommendations in its written comments, reproduced in  appendix VIII. Of the two agencies to which we did not direct  recommendations, Defense provided a letter, reproduced in appendix IX,  in which it indicated the agency had no comments on the report, and  Commerce\u2019s Audit Liaison stated in an e-mail that Commerce would not  send a formal comment letter. In addition, Health and Human Services,  USDA, and EDA (for Commerce) provided technical comments, which we  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "In its written comments, EPA requested that we revise the language of  the recommendation that the members of the tribal infrastructure task  force direct their regional, state, or area offices to identify and pursue  additional mechanisms to increase their collaboration. EPA stated that it  agreed with the intent of the recommendation but that it was concerned  that, as worded, the recommendation may not achieve the intended goal.  Instead, EPA stated that it can accomplish increased regional  collaboration through multiple avenues and as such, provided revised  language that would remove reference to its regional offices taking the  recommended action. We encourage EPA to take advantage of  increasing regional collaboration through all avenues it sees fit. However,  because EPA\u2019s regional offices are the entities that collaborate with other  agencies in the various regions, we continue to believe it is important for  these offices to participate in identifying and implementing the means for  increasing collaboration in their respective regions. As a result, we did not  modify the recommendation language in response to EPA\u2019s comment.", "In its written comments, USDA stated it disagreed with our statements  concerning the Rural Alaska Village Grant program and asked that we  remove the two corresponding recommendations from our report.  Specifically, USDA stated that our recommendations are unnecessary  because the agency is operating within its authorities. USDA stated that it  believes providing grants directly to parties other than the state\u2014 including Alaska Native villages and municipalities\u2014under the 2011  memorandum of agreement is consistent with the purpose of section  306D of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and  appropriations made for the program. As we state in the report, we agree  that the State of Alaska can choose to make subgrants once it receives  the Rural Alaska Village grant. We also state in the report that we did not  see any evidence of grants being used for other than their intended  purposes during the course of our review. However, the language of  section 306D only authorizes USDA to award grants to the State of  Alaska and not directly to other entities. Therefore, we believe that our  recommendations are necessary. If USDA wants to make Rural Alaska  Village grants to municipalities and Alaska Native villages, it should seek  authority to do so as it did to award such grants to the Alaska Native  Tribal Health Consortium.", "Regarding our fourth recommendation that USDA implement a scoring  factor that awards points for proposed Native American program projects  that address health risks, USDA stated that it would like clarification as to  what form of scoring factor would be acceptable to address this  recommendation. USDA stated that it would prefer to use its discretionary  points under the program\u2019s existing regulations to award additional points  to give a higher priority to projects that address a lack of access to safe  drinking water and wastewater disposal, and that the agency could  implement this change at the start of fiscal year 2019 or sooner. In  contrast, USDA stated that changing the program\u2019s regulations to  implement the scoring factor could take 18 months or longer. USDA also  stated that this approach would only have a programmatic effect in fiscal  years when demand for Native American program grant funds exceeds  the available funding. Our intent for the recommendation as written is to  provide USDA with the flexibility to best determine how to implement it. If  USDA has determined that using its discretionary points under the  program\u2019s existing regulations gives greater priority to addressing health  risks faced by Native American communities, and that such an approach  is consistent with applicable law, such an approach could meet the intent  of our recommendation.", "USDA also requested in its written comments that we modify the  language of the ninth recommendation aimed at increasing collaboration  at the national level by removing reference to increasing national  collaboration and that we modify the thirteenth recommendation aimed at  increasing regional collaboration by removing reference to the agency\u2019s  state offices and regional level collaboration. USDA did not provide a  clear rationale for its requested change for either recommendation. We  continue to believe that implementing these recommendations, as  worded, would help improve collaboration at the national and regional  levels. Therefore, we did not modify the language in response to USDA\u2019s  comments.", "In several places in its written comments, USDA stated that our draft  either omitted information or contained inaccurate information and  requested that we make modifications. Specifically, USDA stated that we  omitted statutory language for the Native American program in a few  places in the report. In response, we added additional language from and  about the Native American program\u2019s authorizing statute in several  places. USDA also stated the report is missing information about the  scope of some of its programs, including its Technical Assistance and  Training program. In response, we added more information about this  program, including obligations made to non-profit organizations that work  on behalf of tribes. Further, USDA stated that we did not accurately  characterize certain activities that USDA conducts under some of its  programs, including identifying tribal needs and conducting operations  and maintenance. In response, we modified language to reflect additional  information about how USDA identifies tribal needs and to indicate that  the Native American program is not authorized to fund operations and  maintenance. Regarding the Rural Alaska Village Grant program, USDA  stated that we did not accurately represent information shared by a USDA  official and information about the number of grants made to the  Consortium. We revised language attributed to the official and clarified  information about the number of grants awarded based on additional  information that USDA provided by e-mail after submitting its written  comments.", "In other cases where USDA requested revisions to the draft in its written  comments, we did not make suggested changes because they did not  align with the scope of our review. Specifically, in addition to its Technical  Assistance and Training program, USDA asked that we add information  about tribal obligations under its Solid Waste Management program.  Since federal agency efforts to fund solid waste management projects are  outside the scope of this review, we did not make this revision. In  addition, USDA requested that we limit our discussion of Rural Alaska  Village Grant awards to fiscal year 2011 and forward. We did not make  this change because USDA\u2019s grants to municipalities and Native villages  prior to 2011 are directly relevant to our findings and are within the scope  of this review.

We identified seven agencies, as shown in  table 4. We identified the Indian Health Service (IHS), Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as  federal agencies that have drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  programs specifically targeted to provide financial assistance for planning  and construction to address Indian tribes\u2019 needs. According to IHS  documentation, such needs arise from a sanitation deficiency in existing  drinking water or wastewater infrastructure (or lack thereof) that can  negatively affect public health. In addition, the Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau  of Reclamation, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development  Administration (EDA), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administer  programs that may assist tribes with drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure planning and construction. The types of assistance these  agencies provide vary by program, and each program has its own  eligibility requirements and authorities.", "To determine the extent to which these federal agencies identified Indian  tribes\u2019 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs, we identified  requirements for IHS and EPA to collect and report information on needs,  but we did not identify such requirements for the other agencies. We  reviewed IHS\u2019s project-level tribal drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure needs data from the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) for  fiscal year 2016, the most recent year of data available at the time of our  review. The SDS contains information about proposed drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure projects, including each project\u2019s estimated  cost. IHS policy directs area staff to invite all federally recognized tribes to  identify potential projects each year. Area staff then work with interested  tribes to develop projects and enter project information into standard  fields in the SDS. As of the end of fiscal year 2016, the SDS included  more than 2,000 projects for 373 tribes. We also reviewed IHS\u2019s most  recent reports describing tribal drinking water and wastewater needs.  In addition, we reviewed information about tribal public drinking water  systems reported in EPA\u2019s 2013 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs  Survey and Assessment report. EPA assesses and reports on the  nation\u2019s public water systems\u2019 capital improvement needs every 4 years,  including needs of tribally owned or operated drinking water systems. For  its 2013 report, EPA assessed tribal water system needs by administering  a survey to a statistical sample of 306 tribal water systems out of  956 identified tribal public drinking water systems.", "We assessed the reliability of SDS project-level needs data and  information from EPA\u2019s 2013 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey  and Assessment report by reviewing our previous related work regarding  the use of these data and documentation from IHS and EPA. We also  interviewed IHS and EPA officials involved with identifying tribal water  needs from headquarters and all 12 IHS areas and 9 EPA regions that  administered the drinking water and clean water set-aside programs,  discussing the data and any of its limitations. We tested the data for  accuracy and completeness by identifying any duplicate, missing, or  invalid records and cross-referencing with relevant datasets. We  determined that IHS\u2019s SDS project-level needs data and information  from EPA\u2019s 2013 report were sufficiently reliable to provide descriptive  information on tribes\u2019 needs for drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure projects for this report.", "Further, we reviewed documentation on the Home Inventory Tracking  System (HITS)\u2014IHS\u2019s database containing home-specific information  that the agency also uses in administering the Sanitation Facilities  Construction program. The information in HITS includes each home\u2019s  geographic location and individual sanitation deficiency, and IHS officials  said in February 2018 that the system contained a total of 405,986  homes. We also interviewed IHS headquarters and area officials about  this system\u2019s contents, uses, and limitations, and we compared this  information to the agency\u2019s implementation plan and other documentation  for HITS. We identified issues with the information contained in the  system related to its completeness (whether it contains the correct  number of homes in light of its purpose) and related to the accuracy of  homes identified as having no deficiency, as we discuss in the report.  These issues were sufficient for us to determine that the number of  homes in the system was incomplete and that deficiency level information  was not accurate for all homes in the system. As a result, we did not  assess the reliability of other information in HITS that was not relevant to  our review. We also interviewed officials from the other five agencies  regarding any efforts to collect information on tribal drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure needs.", "To determine the extent to which the agencies funded tribal drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure projects, we analyzed data from the  seven agencies administering programs that provide assistance to tribes  for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure\u2014IHS, EPA, USDA, HUD,  Reclamation, EDA, and Corps. Specifically, we obtained and analyzed  obligations data for drinking water and wastewater projects under  programs that are specifically for or available to tribes. Generally, we  reviewed each agency\u2019s obligations data for fiscal years 2012 through  2016, the most recent 5 years of data available at the time of our review.  Corps provided us with information on obligations for projects that  involved tribal drinking water or wastewater infrastructure, but none of  these obligations were in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. We assessed  the reliability of the other agencies\u2019 data by reviewing our previous related  work regarding the use of these data and any available documentation  from each agency; interviewing knowledgeable agency officials involved  with collecting or analyzing these data; and testing data for accuracy and  completeness by identifying any duplicate, missing, or invalid records. We  present more details about each agency\u2019s data, any limitations, and how  we addressed those limitations below. On the basis of these efforts, we  determined that the data obtained from these agencies were sufficiently  reliable for our descriptive purposes unless otherwise noted below.", "IHS. IHS provided us with project-level obligations data from fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 for tribal drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure projects from its Project Data System. In reviewing  these data, we found data reliability issues that posed challenges to  accurately reporting IHS\u2019s project obligations separate from other  agencies\u2019 contributions to projects, which IHS also tracks in the  system. We determined that the project-level obligations data from the  Project Data System were not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this objective. However, we determined that using IHS\u2019s information  on allocations to areas for the same time frame would introduce fewer  limitations to our reporting. IHS provided us with information from  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 on allocations to each of its 12 areas  by Sanitation Facilities Program activity (i.e., sanitation deficiencies,  new housing, and emergency and special projects). IHS officials  stated that the IHS Director of the Division of Sanitation Facilities  Construction determines the area allocations amounts annually, and  that IHS obligated all of its area allocations each fiscal year. IHS did  not separate the area allocations information by drinking water,  wastewater, or solid waste projects; therefore, we report total  obligations with solid waste projects included.", "EPA. EPA provided us with project-level obligations data from fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 from each of its three tribal-specific  programs listed in table 4. EPA uses its Tribal Direct Implementation  Nexus system to track project obligations for the Clean Water Indian  Set-Aside and Drinking Water Infrastructure Grants Tribal Set-Aside  programs, but the agency relies on the State of Alaska to provide  similar project-level information for its Alaska Native Villages and  Rural Community Water Grant program. In reviewing EPA\u2019s data,  we found several duplicate project records. We confirmed the issue  with EPA officials and deleted those duplicate records to accurately  aggregate EPA\u2019s obligations by fiscal year for our report.", "USDA. USDA provided us with grant and loan obligations data from  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 for all of its programs specifically for  or available to tribes from its Community Program Application  Processing system. First, we removed solid waste and landfill projects  that were indicated as such in the project name. To determine the  project obligations for programs specifically for tribes, we included all  obligations from USDA\u2019s Native American and Rural Alaska Village  Grant programs. USDA also awarded grants and loans to tribes or  non-profit organizations working on behalf of tribes from non-tribal  specific programs such as from its Water and Waste Disposal  program as well as the Section 306C Colonias, Emergency  Community Water Assistance Grant, Predevelopment Planning  Grants, Special Evaluation Assistance for Rural Communities and  Households, and Technical Assistance and Training programs. To  determine the project obligations for those programs, we included  projects that had an applicant or customer type as a tribe or tribal  entity (e.g., an organization working on behalf of a tribe or tribes such  as tribal health consortia or tribal utility authorities) and projects that  served a population of at least 50 percent tribal users. For these  awards, we included the full amount of the award regardless of the  percent of tribal users served.", "HUD. HUD provided us with project-level obligations data from fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 for its Indian Community Development Block  Grant program from its Performance Tracking Database. We worked  with HUD officials to identify projects that included drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure and to identify the amount of the obligations  used for those purposes to determine HUD\u2019s overall fiscal year project  obligations for tribal water infrastructure.", "Reclamation. Reclamation provided us with project-level obligations  data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 for the tribal portions of  authorized water system projects, including projects authorized by  enacted Indian water rights settlements. For the Indian water rights  settlement project obligations, Reclamation provided both mandatory  and discretionary amounts. We included both rural water system  projects and Indian water rights settlements projects in reporting  Reclamation\u2019s overall fiscal year obligations.", "EDA. EDA provided us with project-level obligations data from fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 for tribal projects funded by its Public  Works, Economic Adjustment Assistance, and Planning programs  from its Operations Planning and Control System. To determine  whether the EDA projects included drinking water or wastewater  infrastructure, we reviewed each project\u2019s description or scope of  work for mention of a drinking water or wastewater infrastructure  component. If we determined that the project included water  infrastructure, we included the entire project\u2019s obligation amount for  each fiscal year we report.", "In addition, to determine the extent to which agencies\u2019 funding addressed  the most severe sanitation deficiencies, we identified programs that have  documented goals in regulation and policy to fund projects that meet  these needs, which the programs identify as the absence of safe drinking  water or wastewater disposal facilities. These selected programs included  IHS\u2019s Sanitation Facilities Construction program, EPA\u2019s clean water set- aside program, and USDA\u2019s Native American program. For these  programs, we compared the number of funded projects to address the  most severe sanitation deficiencies with the number of funded projects  that met other needs for fiscal year 2016. Specifically, for IHS and EPA,  we calculated the percentage of projects for each deficiency level that the  agencies and other entities selected to fund from the fiscal year 2016  SDS list. For USDA, we reviewed the list of Native American program  project obligations in fiscal year 2016 and determined the number of  projects where USDA reported the purpose as new, replacement,  renovation, or expansion. We also reviewed documentation of the  agencies\u2019 project identification and selection methods to determine  whether these methods aligned with stated goals. We interviewed IHS  and EPA officials from headquarters and all area and regional offices that  administer these programs, and USDA officials from headquarters and six  state-level offices (see below for state selection information), regarding  their administration of these programs. Additionally, we analyzed IHS\u2019s  data from the SDS from fiscal years 2005 through 2016 to identify  projects that remained unfunded and that were in the SDS for more than  5 years.
