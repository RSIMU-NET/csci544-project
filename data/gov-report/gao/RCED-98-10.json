Recently, however, some U.S. airlines have begun to analyze flight data from uneventful airline flights to identify potential problems and correct them before they lead to accidents. In your letter of December 2, 1996, you asked us to examine efforts by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and U.S. airlines to implement Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) programs. The objective of a FOQA program is to use flight data to detect technical flaws, unsafe practices, or conditions outside of desired operating procedures early enough to allow timely intervention to avert accidents or incidents. These programs are voluntary efforts by airlines that involve equipping aircraft with specialized devices to continuously record up to hundreds of different flight data parameters from aircraft systems and sensors, analyzing the data, identifying trends, and taking action to correct potential problems. The analysis of flight data allows airlines to reconstruct entire flights on the basis of the values over time of flight data parameters, such as heading, altitude, throttle settings, ground speed, and many others. Currently, about 33 foreign airlines and 4 U.S. airlines\u2014United, US Airways, Continental, and Alaska\u2014have implemented FOQA or FOQA-type programs.", "You requested that we determine (1) how FOQA programs will enhance aviation safety, (2) the costs and benefits of such programs, and (3) the factors that could impede their full implementation and actions that could be taken to overcome any impediments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Modern commercial aircraft contain sophisticated electronic systems that gather, process, and manage digital data on many aspects of flight. These data originate from various systems and sensors throughout the aircraft. The data range from pilot operations to the outputs of sensors and systems. Some of these data are continuously recorded by the aircraft\u2019s digital flight data recorder to help investigators understand what happened if the aircraft is involved in an accident or a serious incident. Designed to survive crashes, flight data recorders typically retain the data recorded during the last 25 hours of flight.", "Rather than analyzing flight data only after an incident or accident, some airlines routinely analyze the flight data from regular flights. Their aim is to identify problems that occur in routine operations and to correct these problems before they become accidents or incidents. In its 1992 study for FAA, the Flight Safety Foundation coined the term \u201cFlight Operational Quality Assurance\u201d to describe this function. The Foundation defined FOQA as \u201ca program for obtaining and analyzing data recorded in flight to improve flight crew performance, air carrier training programs and operating procedures, air traffic control procedures, airport maintenance and design, and aircraft operations and design.\u201d", "FOQA has its origin in the use of flight data recorders as mandated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in 1958. Although the first flight data recorders captured only six parameters, they were a valuable tool for reconstructing what had occurred preceding a crash. In addition to recording data to assist in crash investigations, some airlines began to monitor data recorded on routine flights. Initially, the monitoring systems captured airworthiness data, but over time they have expanded to include operational data. FOQA programs were first established in Europe and Asia, and only within the past few years have some U.S. airlines begun adopting such a system on a trial basis. At present, about 33 foreign airlines and 4 U.S. airlines\u2014United, US Airways, Continental, and Alaska\u2014have implemented FOQA or FOQA-type programs. (See app. I for more detailed background information on FOQA and U.S. airlines\u2019 experience with these programs; see app. II for a list of airlines worldwide that have implemented FOQA programs.)", "As part of FAA\u2019s strategy to achieve significant reductions in aviation accident rates despite the rapid increase in air travel anticipated over the next decade, in 1995 the agency initiated a FOQA demonstration project to promote the voluntary implementation of FOQA programs by U.S. airlines. The objective of such a program is to use flight data to detect technical flaws, unsafe practices, or conditions outside of desired operating procedures early enough to allow timely intervention to avert accidents or incidents. For example, identifying repeated instances of unstabilized approaches to a particular airport could help to define a new approach pattern less likely to lead to an accident under adverse conditions, or to improved pilot training. Such a system has potentially broad application to flight crews\u2019 performance and training, aircraft operating procedures, air traffic control procedures, aircraft maintenance, and airport design and maintenance. Major airlines in Europe and Asia, as well as the U.S. airlines that have FOQA programs, are uniform in their support of the program.", "How FOQA Works. FOQA involves (1) capturing and analyzing flight data to determine if the pilot, the aircraft\u2019s systems, or the aircraft itself deviated from typical operating norms; (2) identifying trends; and (3) taking action to correct potential problems. Airlines with FOQA programs typically use a device called a quick access recorder to capture flight data onto a removable optical disk that facilitates the data\u2019s frequent removal from the aircraft. Periodically, the optical disks are removed from the aircraft, and the flight data are analyzed by the ground analysis system at a centralized location. The data are analyzed by a computer system that evaluates about 40 to 80 predefined events for deviations from the airline\u2019s specified tolerance thresholds. For example, an event might be the descent rate during approach. Deviations of more than certain predetermined values, called \u201cexceedances,\u201d are flagged and evaluated by a monitoring team. After investigating these exceedances to determine their validity and analyzing them to understand possible causes, the monitoring team will propose and evaluate corrective actions. Periodically, airlines aggregate exceedances over time to determine and monitor trends. (For a more complete discussion of FOQA operations, see app. I.)", "The FOQA Demonstration Project. In July 1995, FAA initiated a 3-year, $5.5 million demonstration project to facilitate the start-up of voluntary airline FOQA programs and to assess the costs, benefits, and safety enhancement associated with such programs. FAA provided hardware and software to each of the three airlines\u2014United, US Airways, and Continental\u2014that have implemented FOQA programs according to the demonstration project\u2019s requirements. FAA purchased quick access recorders to equip 15 Boeing 737 aircraft at each of the three airlines. FAA also purchased a ground analysis system\u2014the computer hardware and software for analyzing and visualizing FOQA data\u2014for US Airways and Continental. Because United already had purchased a ground analysis system that analyzes these data for other types of aircraft, FAA purchased for the airline the additional software needed to analyze FOQA data from 737s. For their part, these airlines funded the cost of obtaining supplemental type certification of the airborne equipment, the costs of installation and maintenance, and the cost of personnel to run and monitor the program. Alaska Airlines is the fourth U.S. airline to have begun a FOQA program, but it has only recently met the demonstration project\u2019s requirement for an agreement on FOQA by the airline\u2019s pilot union. Consequently, the project has not yet provided any equipment to the airline. Alaska Airlines, however, received quick access recorders and a ground analysis system from the FAA Structural Loads Program and uses this equipment to operate its FOQA program. (See app. III for more information on the Structural Loads Program.) Other airlines that are participating in the demonstration project and are considering the implementation of a FOQA program are America West, Delta, Northwest, Trans World, Southwest, Continental Express, and United Parcel Service.(See app. I for a detailed description of the FAA demonstration project.) As a research and development effort of the FOQA initiative, FAA is developing the Aviation Performance Measuring System, an advanced system for conducting automated analysis and research on FOQA data. (See app. III for a description of this system and FAA\u2019s other related technical programs.)", "Rather than requiring airlines to implement FOQA, FAA has chosen to promote the initiative through a cooperative demonstration project in partnership with the industry. According to the demonstration project\u2019s program manager, it would be premature for FAA to mandate FOQA at this time because U.S. aviation is still in the early stages of developing FOQA and is primarily in a learning mode. The program manager contends that a mandated program would stifle innovation, encounter substantial resistance from airlines and pilots, and most likely result in minimal compliance. Thus, at present, FAA is working with the industry to raise interest in the concept, facilitate the design and implementation of voluntary FOQA programs, provide financial and technical assistance, and foster innovation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FOQA Identifies Potential Safety Problems", "paragraphs": ["The primary characteristic that distinguishes FOQA from other safety reporting programs, such as the Aviation Safety Reporting Program or Aviation Safety Action Programs, is that FOQA provides objective, quantitative data on what occurs during flights rather than what is subjectively reported by individuals. Instead of needing to rely on perceived problems or risks, FOQA yields precise information on many aspects of flight operations, and this information can be used to help objectively evaluate a wide range of safety-related issues.", "U.S. and foreign airlines have reported on previously unknown or suspected problems for which FOQA has provided objective information that resulted in corrective actions. One airline found through its FOQA program that more exceedances occurred during visual flying than during instrument flying. This finding prompted the airline\u2019s flight-training managers to rethink the relative emphasis given visual and instrument flying in the airline\u2019s training programs. Another airline\u2019s FOQA analysis confirmed that the incidence of descent rate exceedances during approaches was significantly higher at a particular runway at a U.S. airport than at other runways. After investigating the problem, the airline concluded that the air traffic control approach had been set too high, requiring pilots to descend more steeply than usual during their final approach. When the airline shared its findings with FAA management, the approach was modified to correct this potential problem.", "For landings, some airports\u2019 air traffic control procedures require pilots to approach high and fast and then descend steeply. These approaches can result from a number of factors, including noise abatement rules, traffic volume, terrain, or weather conditions. Although airline managers know about the situations from pilots\u2019 reports, FOQA gives them the quantitative information to demonstrate the extent of this problem at the various airports. With these data in hand, managers can be more effective in addressing the problem and taking action to mitigate or eliminate risks.", "FOQA can also help airlines determine the frequency of certain occurrences rather than having to rely on human judgment, particularly for the level of maintenance required. Two examples of these types of occurrences are hard landings and exceedances in engine temperatures. Prior to FOQA, airlines generally relied on pilots\u2019 judgment of the necessity for corrective action if a hard landing occurred or an engine overheated. FOQA, however, can provide better information on the amount of force the aircraft experienced during a hard landing. Similarly, FOQA gives more data on the engines\u2019 temperatures and the duration of overheating in some aircraft than were previously available without FOQA. With these data, managers can make more informed decisions about whether the aircraft needs to be inspected to check for structural damage or whether an engine needs to be overhauled.", "U.S. and foreign airlines have reported that they have used FOQA analysis to identify a variety of potential safety problems and take corrective action to resolve or mitigate them. These have included steep takeoffs, which can damage the aircraft\u2019s tail; approaches that are outside the prescribed procedures for a \u201cstabilized\u201d approach; descent rates or bank angles that are considered excessive; high taxi speeds; hard landings; wind shear occurrences; ground proximity warnings; and engine malfunctions. Corrective action can include notifying pilots of a change in standard operating procedures or restating and emphasizing them, correcting an equipment problem, or providing additional training. The continued monitoring of trends will tell the airline if the corrective action has been effective or whether additional measures are needed.", "A number of airlines plan to complement the use of FOQA data with information from safety reporting systems, such as Aviation Safety Action Programs or internal pilot reporting systems. FOQA data, originating from aircraft sensors and systems, tell \u201cwhat\u201d happened to the aircraft. Internal safety reporting systems, based on reports of pilots, flight crews, and other persons, are more likely to tell \u201cwhy\u201d something happened. Together, information from FOQA and internal reporting systems can provide valuable insight into current and emerging problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FOQA\u2019s Potential Costs and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Based on preliminary estimates from an ongoing cost-benefit study by Universal Technical Resource Services, Inc. (UTRS), an FAA contractor, table 1 summarizes the estimated annual costs for airlines to equip 15, 50, and 100 aircraft with quick access recorders, purchase a ground analysis system, and pay FOQA-related salaries.", "The cost-benefit study estimates that airlines will reduce their expenditures for fuel and maintenance as well as reduce the number of accidents and incidents over time, avoiding their associated costs. Because FOQA programs analyze additional data on aircraft systems and engine conditions, airlines are better able to achieve optimum fuel consumption and avoid unneeded engine maintenance. Although more difficult to quantify and directly relate to a FOQA program, enhanced safety should result in lower costs over time as a result of accidents avoided and lower insurance premiums. Table 2 summarizes the estimated annual savings for fleet sizes of 15, 50, and 100 aircraft. Fuel savings and engine savings figures are based on estimates of a 0.5-percent reduction in fuel consumption and a 1-percent reduction in engine maintenance costs. The safety savings figure is based on a hypothetical 1-percent reduction in the annual costs incurred from accidents. FAA\u2019s contractor based its safety savings calculation on a current loss rate of 2 aircraft per million departures at a cost of $150 million for each loss.", "According to these annual cost and savings estimates, FOQA would result in net annual savings of $11,800 for 15 aircraft, $892,000 for 50 aircraft, and $2,035,000 for 100 aircraft.

In addition to these concerns, pilots\u2019 representatives were concerned that airline managers could use FOQA data to punish or discipline pilots. \u201cThe FAA commits that it will not use information collected by a carrier in an FOQA program to undertake any certificate or other enforcement action against an air carrier participating in such a program or one of its individual employees. Notwithstanding, the FAA reserves its rights to use, for any other purpose, information obtained from sources other than FOQA, including flight-recorder parameters specifically required by the Federal Aviation Regulations. The limitation on the use of information applies only to information collected specifically in an FOQA program.\u201d", "In an April 1997 letter to the Air Transport Association\u2019s FOQA Steering Committee, the Director of FAA\u2019s Flight Standards Service said that the 1995 policy letter will remain in effect until the regulation on enforcement is issued. The letter stated that a proposed rulemaking setting forth FAA\u2019s enforcement protection policy should be ready by the end of 1997.", "According to airline officials and a pilot union\u2019s representative, FAA\u2019s delay in promulgating an enforcement regulation has hampered efforts to reach agreement with some pilot unions and threatens the continuance of agreements already reached. One of the issues facing FAA is how broad the enforcement protection should be. FAA attorneys have concluded that it is beyond the scope of FAA\u2019s authority and in violation of its statutory duties to issue a regulation that precludes the agency from taking action if FOQA data reveal that an airplane was not in a condition for safe flight or that a pilot lacked qualifications. Pilots\u2019 representatives, however, have cited the precedent of FAA\u2019s cockpit voice recorder regulation that prohibits the agency from using the record in enforcement actions without exceptions.", "FAA officials told us that the agency is trying to find the proper balance between carrying out its enforcement responsibilities and providing incentives for implementing safety programs and sharing information with FAA. In similar programs, such as the Aviation Safety Reporting Program, Air Carrier Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Procedures, and Aviation Safety Action Programs, under which safety information is voluntarily submitted, the agency has a policy of addressing alleged violations through administrative actions or forgoing and/or waiving the imposition of any legal enforcement if certain qualifying criteria are met. These programs are intended to encourage prompt reporting of violations, sharing of important safety information, and pilot training to enhance future compliance. While the qualifying criteria differ for each program, these programs exclude actions that are deliberate or demonstrate or raise questions of qualifications. Generally, the parameters of the programs, including the qualifying criteria, are spelled out in the governing advisory circular. It is FAA\u2019s belief that by offering incentives, such as forgoing legal enforcement actions under certain conditions, more problems may be reported and ultimately corrected than could be discovered through other means, such as inspections.", "Airline Enforcement. Airline managers are working with their respective pilot unions to enter into data-use agreements that include individual protection provisions. According to the Flight Safety Foundation study, data-use agreements with pilot associations have existed since flight data recorders were first required in the late 1950s. Having such an agreement is a precursor to becoming a full partner in the FOQA demonstration project. Generally, these agreements provide, among other things, the company\u2019s assurance not to use the recorded flight data for punitive or disciplinary action against a crew member, or as evidence in any proceeding. Also, to ensure the protection of the company\u2019s employees, the data-use agreements generally provide for the de-identification of the information as soon as possible, usually within 7 days.

The report states that to provide assurance that such information is not publicly released, the legislation would prohibit FAA from disclosing voluntarily submitted safety information. According to the report, this protection should \u201calleviate the aviation community\u2019s concerns and allow the data-sharing safety programs to move forward.\u201d Moreover, the report noted that the provision would not reduce the information available to the public, since the public does not receive the data.

It is also expected that FOQA data will be proposed as qualifying for the protection. According to an FAA attorney, the determinations for the FOQA program may be included in the notice of proposed rulemaking on the FOQA nonenforcement policy.

Generally, privileges are narrowly construed and in some cases are qualified. However, even in the absence of a privilege, a district court has broad discretion under the federal rules to issue an order to protect a person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense if there is a good cause for issuance of the order. Courts generally invoke a balancing test to decide when a protective order is appropriate and how it is to be applied.", "In two recent cases, the airlines have tried to convince federal courts that voluntarily collected safety data similar to FOQA data should be protected from discovery or, at the very least, covered under a protective order. In both cases, the courts sought to achieve a balance between the airlines\u2019 desire to protect the information and the plaintiffs\u2019 right to a fair trial. In the first case, the court rejected a claim that the information should be protected under the self-critical evaluation privilege but limited the possible uses of the documents it ordered to be produced. This determination was effected through a protective order. In the other case, the court also rejected the claim of self-critical evaluation privilege but at the same time recognized a new qualified privilege for information collected under a partnership program with FAA, the American Airlines Safety Action Program.", "Although airlines are generally pleased with the court\u2019s decision to grant a qualified privilege to Aviation Safety Action Program materials, it is not clear whether other courts will recognize this new privilege or extend it to other safety and security information that has been voluntarily collected. Nor is there a guarantee that FOQA data or other similar information, if found not to be privileged, would be covered under a protective order. However, we found no instances to date in which FOQA data have been subject to a discovery request. This situation may result from the fact that airlines are just beginning to institute FOQA programs. However, some of the pilot union officials we spoke with noted that discovery is a concern because of the potentially large amounts of data that will be collected. While some in the aviation community believe that one way to ensure protection would be through legislation, there does not appear to be a consensus to seek legislation at this time.

By the 1960s, airlines had begun to monitor data on routine flights. Initially, the monitoring systems captured airworthiness data, but over time they have expanded to include operational data. In the late 1960s, Trans World Airlines began a program to monitor a limited number of parameters related to approaches and landings as flight data recorders received periodic maintenance.", "At least eight foreign airlines have had FOQA-type programs in operation for over 25 years. A program using data from flight data recorders was begun by British Airways (BA) in 1962 to validate airworthiness criteria. Although limited by today\u2019s standards, BA\u2019s program contained the seeds of a modern, safety-oriented FOQA program. Currently, BA analyzes the flight data from all of the aircraft in its fleet through its Special Events Search and Master Analysis program. Over the years, the number of foreign airlines that have implemented a FOQA-type program has steadily risen. Japan Airlines\u2019 FOQA program of over 15 years includes a printer in the cockpit so that pilots can monitor their own performance. All Nippon Airways began a program to analyze flight data in 1974. Other foreign airlines with established FOQA programs include Scandinavian Airlines System, Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), and Lufthansa. Many of these airlines are convinced that FOQA is a critical component in their safety efforts and that the program has paid valuable safety dividends over the years. Currently, about 33 foreign airlines and 4 U.S. airlines\u2014United, US Airways, Continental, and Alaska\u2014have implemented FOQA programs (see app. II for the complete list). \u201cThe proposal was based on FSF\u2019s conviction, formed by the positive experiences of its international member airlines using FOQA, that the appropriate use of FOQA data by airlines, pilot associations and aircraft and equipment manufacturers would result in a significant improvement of flight safety by identifying operational irregularities that can foreshadow accidents and incidents.\u201d", "The FSF study concluded that FOQA must proceed in the United States and that the implementation of FOQA by U.S. airlines would have a more positive impact on Part 121 operational safety than any other human factors program included in FAA\u2019s research and development plans. FSF recommended that FAA promote voluntary FOQA programs by instituting a demonstration program in partnership with industry. In 1992, FAA\u2019s Flight Standards Service proposed funding for a demonstration program. On February 9, 1995, FAA announced its plans for an FAA-industry demonstration project, and the Administrator sent a policy letter to the Air Transport Association and the Air Line Pilots Association stating that FAA would not use FOQA data for enforcement purposes, provided that the airlines met certain requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How FOQA Works", "paragraphs": ["At a minimum, FOQA involves the analysis of flight data on a routine basis to reveal situations requiring corrective actions before problems occur. To institute such a program, airlines need methods to capture flight data, transform the data into the appropriate format for analysis, and generate reports and visualizations to assist personnel in analyzing the data. Although different methods are available, the following describes how a representative FOQA program operates; the descriptions are based on the experience of the four U.S. airlines that have implemented FOQA.", "Management. A typical program is managed and operated by a FOQA manager, one or more analysts, and a FOQA monitoring team (sometimes referred to as the exceedance guidance team) made up of airline pilots who work on FOQA on a part-time basis. Generally, the majority of the monitoring team\u2019s pilots are also representatives of the pilot union. These individuals manage the FOQA program in strict adherence to the agreements made with the pilot union, most notably on ensuring the confidentiality of pilots\u2019 identities. This group is responsible for defining and refining exceedances and parameters, reviewing and analyzing data, and determining and monitoring corrective actions.", "Data capture. The first step is the capture of data over the duration of the flight. Flight data comprise snapshots of values or measurements from various aircraft systems. Each data item represents information from a discrete source, such as an instrument or sensor. Generally, these data items are referred to as \u201cparameters.\u201d Examples of parameters are \u201caltitude\u201d or \u201clanding gear position.\u201d Recording rates vary, depending on the parameter, ranging from many times per second to about once per minute.", "Although flight data recorders continuously record, at a minimum, FAA-mandated parameters during every flight, they typically are not designed to provide frequent access to their data but rather to survive the extreme conditions during and after crashes to preserve flight data for accident investigations. These devices are housed in crash-resistant, sealed containers designed to withstand high \u201cg\u201d forces, submersion in water, and fire. Obtaining frequent access to flight data recorders for FOQA purposes, however, would produce increased wear on internal mechanisms and result in shortened mechanical life and increased expense for a very specialized device. Also, flight data recorders may not capture a sufficient number of parameters to be useful for FOQA purposes. Currently, FAA requires from 16 to 29 parameters to be recorded on flight data recorders in transport aircraft; a FOQA program, however, would likely capture many more parameters. Typically, the 200-500 parameters available on modern digital aircraft allow a more comprehensive set of conditions to be monitored. Finally, flight data recorders hold about 25 hours of flight data, a relatively short time period. Instead, some U.S. airlines use a device called a quick access recorder (QAR) to record FOQA data to a removable optical disk or Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card. QARs record flight data that are output from the aircraft\u2019s digital flight data acquisition unit (DFDAU), the same device that feeds parameters to the flight data recorder. On average, QARs hold from 100 to 200 hours of flight data.", "Data transfer. As aircraft receive periodic servicing, the medium (optical disk or PCMCIA card) containing flight data is removed from the QAR and sent to a central location for analysis. A new disk or card is inserted into the QAR for the next round of flights. Airlines retrieve the data on schedules ranging from 3 to 20 days.", "An alternative to physical recording media is the use of datalink systems to transmit information directly to the ground-based system, eliminating the need to retrieve data from the aircraft. Two participating airlines are investigating the use of automatic wireless data transfer upon landing at specially equipped airports. Data would be transmitted on a radio frequency link from the aircraft to a receiving station after the aircraft lands. In turn, a local area network would transfer the data to the ground analysis station. Data encryption and other methods would be used to ensure the security of the transmitted FOQA data.", "Data processing and analysis. Each airline has a ground analysis system where airborne collected data are processed and analyzed. The ground analysis system transforms the raw digital flight records into usable form for processing, analyzes the flight information, and generates information on any detected exceedances that represent deviations from normal operating practices or exceptional conditions.", "The flight data analysis component of the ground analysis system categorizes operational events to be flagged by defining a set of parameters that indicate normal operating envelopes. The associated thresholds for these parameters vary by the type of aircraft and associated operating limits, accepted practices for safe operations, the phase of flight, and the duration of any irregularity. For example, the threshold of selected parameters may be defined for various altitudes, e.g., 1,000, 500, 250, and 100 feet, during landing mode events. Typically, 40 to 80 events are defined and analyzed for a particular aircraft. For example, events might be the ground speed during taxi or the descent rate during approach. The analysis software will track the descent over time to calculate a rate in terms of feet per minute. Depending on the aircraft\u2019s altitude, a descent rate in excess of specified thresholds will trigger an exceedance. Various categorization schemes are used to classify the seriousness of the exceedance. U.S. airlines use two or three categories to describe the seriousness of exceedances, ranging from minor deviations to major deviations. Exceedances are typically specified on the basis of a strategy for identifying those that have the greatest potential for safety and performance considerations. Once the initial exceedance categories and associated parameters have been defined and utilized, they are subject to an ongoing evaluation and refinement process.", "The ground analysis software also validates the quality and integrity of the collected data and filters out any marginal or transitory irregularities. Ground analysis systems also include protective mechanisms, such as the de-identification of pilot and specific flight information and user access privileges based on assigned passwords. As the data are processed, the flight number and day of the month are removed and saved into a separate controlled file. This step \u201cde-identifies\u201d the FOQA data.", "The FOQA monitoring team investigates each exceedance to determine what occurred and the severity of the exceedance. An analyst will review the parameter values surrounding the event and other information to determine if the exceedance was valid or if the exceedance was based on bad data, a faulty sensor, or some other invalidating factor. For example, one flight had excessive rudder input on landing that correctly registered as an exceedance. On closer examination, it was determined that because the aircraft was making a cross-wind landing, the use of large rudder input was justified. In this case, the exceedance was deemed invalid and was removed from the exceedance database.", "Depending on the particular circumstances of the exceedance, the pilot association\u2019s representative may contact the flight crew to gather more information. After reviewing the situation to determine the exceedance\u2019s cause, the FOQA monitoring team and pilot association\u2019s representative will determine any necessary corrective action. Corrective action can range from additional flight crew training, to revisions of the operating procedures, to redesigns of equipment.", "Trend analysis. On a periodic basis, airlines aggregate and analyze exceedances over time\u2014for example, the number of unstabilized approaches at a particular airport per month, over the last 12 months. This type of analysis provides valuable information to the airline, especially in terms of whether the airline\u2019s performance is improving, holding steady, or deteriorating. This look at aggregate exceedances over time provides airline managers with a new perspective on potential problems that would not be visible otherwise. On the basis of the trend analysis, airline managers can take corrective action to reduce or eliminate these exceedances by focusing on the root causes and making or recommending changes.", "Data retention. Detailed FOQA data, including exceedances, are destroyed in 30 days or less by three of the four U.S. airlines with FOQA programs. Trend data, however, are kept indefinitely.", "Aircraft equipping decisions. The U.S. airlines with active FOQA programs have each equipped a portion of their available fleets with QARs. They began their programs by equipping their more modern, technically advanced aircraft with QARs\u2014late-generation aircraft already contain the sensors and advanced digital systems that acquire and control many more flight data parameters than earlier-generation aircraft. Generally, these airlines do not plan to equip any of their older, analog-based aircraft, such as Lockheed L-1011, McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and DC-10, and Boeing 727, 737-100, and 737-200, with QARs to record flight data because these aircraft would be expensive to retrofit and because the airlines plan to retire many of them in the near future.", "Several U.S. airlines plan to equip all new aircraft with QARs or other technology to capture FOQA data. Some new aircraft, for example, are delivered with QARs as standard equipment. Airlines cited several advantages in having new aircraft delivered with factory-equipped QARs. One advantage is that aircraft are not taken out of service to be retrofitted with equipment. Another advantage is that the additional cost of a QAR can be spread over the finance period of the new aircraft.", "Depending on the specific goals of a FOQA program, an airline may wish to equip some or all of its fleet to collect flight data. If a program\u2019s goal is to identify broad trends in flight operations and safety, the airline may choose to equip only a portion of its fleet. If a program\u2019s goal, however, is to more closely monitor the flight operations and performance of individual aircraft, the airline may want to equip more or all of its fleet. For an airline that begins by equipping only a portion of its fleet, more aircraft will likely be added to the program so that these data can be monitored as its FOQA program matures and efficiency and maintenance functions are added to the program. Some U.S. airlines, for example, are planning to use FOQA data to cut aircraft maintenance costs by more closely monitoring engine conditions and fuel consumption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The FOQA Demonstration Project", "paragraphs": ["\u201cThe goal of DEMOPROJ is to facilitate the start-up of the FOQA initiative and to comprehensively assess the cost-benefits and safety enhancement effectiveness of an implemented FOQA program in which airlines voluntarily employ in-flight recorded data to routinely monitor their flight operations.\u201d", "UTRS facilitated the establishment of collaborative partnerships between FAA, UTRS, and interested airlines.
