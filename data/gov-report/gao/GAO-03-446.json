Human capital leaders took actions to transform the agencies' human capital organizations by establishing clear human capital strategic visions, restructuring their organizations, and improving the use of technology to free organizational resources. Human capital leaders also promoted a transition to a larger strategic role for human capital professionals with their focus being more on consulting rather than compliance activities. The human capital profession is in transition from valuing narrowly focused specialists to requiring generalists, who have all the skills necessary to play an active role in helping to determine the overall strategic direction of the organization.

Recent  legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security includes a  provision to establish a chief human capital officer (CHCO) in major  agencies of the federal government.  One of the functions of the CHCO is  to align the agency\u2019s human capital policies and programs with  organization mission, strategic goals, and performance outcomes.  This  increased visibility of human capital organizations within federal agencies  underscores the increased recognition that strategic human capital  management is a vital enabler of organizational success.", "We are addressing this report to you because of your ongoing interest in  federal human capital issues and how agencies can effectively manage their  human capital to achieve their organizational goals.

These actions may prove helpful to  other agencies as they seek to ensure that their human capital approaches  are aligned with their program goals.  We examined selected human capital  integration actions within the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), the U.S. Coast  Guard (USCG), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

The agenda specifically sets an  expectation for agencies to integrate their human capital strategies with  their organizational missions, visions, core values, goals, and objectives.  In  October 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and OPM  approved revised standards for success in the human capital area of the  PMA, reflecting language that was developed in collaboration with GAO.   To assist agencies in responding to the revised PMA standards, OPM  released the Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework.", "Our work and that of others has shown that high-performing organizations  link their human capital management systems\u2014from the organizational  level down to individual employees\u2014with their strategic planning and  mission accomplishment.  This means the function that has traditionally  been called personnel or human resources needs to make a fundamental  transformation, from being a strictly support function involved in managing  personnel processes and ensuring compliance with rules and regulations to  designing and implementing human capital approaches to attain the  agency\u2019s strategic goals.

They stated that because of the Assistant Commandant\u2019s organizational  status, USCG\u2019s HR unit has participated earlier in strategic planning and  decision making, thus facilitating a smoother transition and execution of  ideas.  The officials cited USCG\u2019s use of scenario-based planning as an  example of early involvement by USCG\u2019s HR unit in agency strategic  planning and decision making.  Scenario-based planning is a technique  used by USCG for managing uncertainty and risk when planning into the  future.  The agency develops a few plausible future scenarios and then  plans how it would best respond to each scenario and what resources it  would need to respond.  For example, one scenario may describe  conditions that imply a greater need to interdict drugs in harbors than  another scenario, which may describe a world where the higher priority is  to intercept possible terrorist threats from the seas as far offshore as  legally possible.  Differing competency requirements and operating  concepts (e.g., time spent at sea) require different human capital  approaches in each of these scenarios.  With USCG\u2019s migration to the  Department of Homeland Security and its added security responsibilities,  the agency\u2019s plans for balancing resources among its many missions will  become increasingly important.", "In the summer of 1998, senior USCG human capital staff members were  part of a core group of USCG planners who developed scenarios and  constructed the operational and support strategies to succeed in those  scenarios.  The group eventually created five very different worlds that  might exist in the year 2020, along with the \"history\" of events that led to  each of those, based on the combined factors of U.S. economic vitality, the  global demand for maritime services, the role of the federal government,  and threats to U.S. society.  The purpose of the five worlds was to create  the boundaries of the possible future, and allow leaders and planners to  create a strategy for USCG that would work well in each independent  scenario. The core group then analyzed the elements common to all five  strategies and crafted a core strategy.  The human capital strategies that  emerged became part of USCG\u2019s official strategy, and simultaneously drove  the human resource organization\u2019s business planning and resource  investments for the 2001-2005 time frame.", "USCG attributes a number of its improved processes to the early  involvement of its human capital unit with the agency\u2019s decision-making  management team.  Specific examples cited by USCG include (1) a  significant restructuring of military occupations and career paths to reflect  emerging requirements for new competencies, (2) a revision of assignment  and reassignment practices to make better use of the investments in  training and development, and (3) a restructuring of civilian personnel  management functions to better support line managers in meeting their  operational requirements.", "USGS\u2019s HR Office has also played a prominent role in agency strategic  planning and decision making.  In 1997, USGS\u2019s HR Office led a group of  senior USGS managers in developing the first strategic HR plan for USGS  as the agency strategically planned how it would remain at the forefront of  earth and biological science and technology.  USGS\u2019s strategic HR plan  formed the basis for the four people goals (skills, rewards, flexibility, and  leadership) included in the agency\u2019s current strategic plan.  HR staff  members were active in the development of the people goals and in the  creation of the current and next-generation measures by which the agency  is assessing progress under these goals.

One USGS  business strategy is to increase the agency\u2019s flexibility to get work done by  using all options other than permanent staff members.  The strategic  human resources plan states that to enhance USGS\u2019s flexibility to acquire  skills to meet short-term needs and provide an influx of new ideas, the HR  Office will, for example, expand the use of short-term student and faculty  appointments from academia and development agreements from the  private sector.", "SSA\u2019s Deputy Commissioner for Human Resources reports directly to the  Commissioner and is an equal partner with the agency\u2019s other deputies.   SSA\u2019s human capital officials report that their engagement in the strategic  planning activities of the agency has provided a much greater opportunity  to contribute to effective outcomes.

When we reported on agencies\u2019 initial efforts to restructure their personnel  operations in 1998, we noted that the four departments reviewed generally  approached the restructuring of their personnel offices with the intent of  achieving staff reductions.   Some human capital leaders are now focusing  less on finding additional internal efficiencies and more on replacing stove- piped structures that include separate units for functions such as staffing  and classification, with more flexible structures that support new human  capital roles.", "The right organizational structure can help human capital organizations  strategically align with agency objectives and improve the delivery of  human capital products and services.  Although some federal agencies are  restructuring their human capital organizations along similar lines, the  right organizational structure depends on the unique characteristics of the  agency.  In a 1999 report, OPM maintained that because organizations are  starting from different positions, they would need to structure their human  capital functions based on mission, not on a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution.  In  a similar vein, in July 2000 a coalition of individuals representing a wide  cross section of organizations with an interest in the federal human capital  community anticipated that a variety of human capital organizational  structures would form across the federal government.  The coalition  predicted that factors such as customer needs and agency budgets would  design and drive the structure of a particular agency\u2019s human capital  organization.  The report noted, however, that the group did expect to see  movement away from traditional structures toward more flexible  arrangements.", "In a 2001 National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) report, one of  the key findings was that human capital organizations were restructuring,  and the report noted that the emerging organizational model appears to  consist of three elements:  a center of expertise, a shared service center,  and a strategic consultant component.  The center of expertise provides  expert technical advice and assistance to managers and employees while  the shared service center processes traditional personnel transactions.   The strategic consultant component serves as a strategic partner, change  agent, and consultant to agency managers.   The elements in the new  structure attempt to balance the need for consolidation while still allowing  human capital professionals to have a direct connection with their  customers.", "FEMA\u2019s Human Resources Division (HRD) has recently restructured in a  manner similar to this emerging organizational model.

Since the restructuring, HRD has initiated over 30  projects targeting human capital improvements that are aligned to the  agency\u2019s strategic plan and the President\u2019s Management Agenda.   For  example, the improvement initiatives included determining uniform  compensation bands based on staff competencies and a series of initiatives  focused on improving human capital services throughout the agency.

He believes  that technology is vital to achieving GSA\u2019s Chief People Officer\u2019s goals.  He  explained that improved technology and automation efforts mean less staff  time is needed for traditional human capital functions, thus allowing the  CPO staff members to play bigger roles as business partners.  However,  because most of GSA\u2019s system is fairly new or still under development,  CPO\u2019s CIO has not reduced resources and identified staff savings.  In an  earlier report, we noted instances where agencies eliminated personnel  staff before new technology for automating personnel transactions was in  place.  This resulted in delays in implementing new personnel and payroll  systems.  According to CPO\u2019s CIO, resources reallocation will be  accomplished as efficiencies are demonstrated. CHRIS is expected to  ultimately provide self-service to employees and managers, performance  management capability, integrated training solutions, and succession  planning.

As  agencies further integrate strategic human capital approaches into their  strategic planning and decision making, investment in the development of  new competencies for human capital professionals is receiving more  attention.", "OPM published a study in 1999 establishing a statistical profile of the  human capital profession within the federal government.   The report  described the federal human capital community as a cadre of experts  separated into seven distinct occupational series.  One series represented  the human capital generalist, who typically has a breadth of knowledge  about personnel issues.  The other six categories consisted of specialists,  such as classifiers and staffing specialists, who possess in-depth  knowledge in specific human capital areas.  The report noted that from  1969 through 1998 there had been a small but noticeable shift occurring in  the human capital profession away from specialist positions to generalist  positions.  In 1998, generalists made up a slight majority of human capital  professionals at 53 percent, while specialists positions had declined to 47  percent.", "Consistent with the changing roles and expectations for human capital  professionals, this noticeable shift toward human capital generalists has  accelerated since 1998.  As of June 2002, generalists made up 73 percent of  human capital professionals, while specialists had declined to 27 percent.   Figure 2 shows the dramatic change in the percentage of human capital  generalists since 1996.", "A combination of factors appears to have contributed to this shift.   According to OPM, it was necessitated, to a large degree, by the significant  downsizing in federal office staffing levels during the 1990s, which  precluded continuing a specialized approach.  In addition, OPM  concluded that human capital management as an occupation had been  undergoing a significant redefinition.  For example, automation began to  greatly affect how human capital products and services were delivered.   Many agencies began using the Internet or their own intranets to educate  managers and employees about human capital programs and options.  OPM  also noted in a 1999 report that many agencies were beginning to outsource  some of their human capital services.  With more efficient ways to deliver  products and services, human capital professionals could focus on their  emerging roles as advisors and consultants, which require more generalist  practitioners able to work across multiple human capital functions.", "The advantage to the agencies of this shift was that existing staff members  could be deployed more flexibly and new staff members could be recruited  for broader human capital competencies that had less to do with  specialized procedures than with general human capital knowledge,  concepts, and principles.  In fact, OPM concluded in 2000, based on a body  of research and evidence, that the human capital occupation was truly  becoming generalized in nature both inside and outside the federal  government.  Although OPM did not find that human capital roles had  shifted in every agency, it determined that agencies needed their human  capital staff members to leave behind their roles of technical specialists  focused on regulatory compliance and to take on more consultative roles.   This entailed working with managers, employees, and their representatives  to ensure that human capital programs and practices were properly aligned  to help the organization meet its strategic objectives, while adhering to  merit system principles and other legal obligations.", "To reflect these changes in the federal human capital community, in  December 2000, OPM issued a new consolidated classification standard for  the Administrative Work in the Human Resources Management Group.    OPM expects the agencies to apply the new job family position  classification standard within a reasonable amount of time of its release, as  determined by the agency.  According to an OPM official, agencies are  making progress in applying the new standard.", "The pressures on human capital professionals to assume new roles present  a significant learning and development challenge for human capital staff  members.  For human capital professionals to begin acting in their new  capacities, human capital leaders must ensure that they develop the  competencies and gain the experience to effectively take on the expected  roles.  Consistent with the changes reflected by OPM\u2019s new classification  standards, several of the agencies we reviewed have developed human  capital competency models designed to develop staff members who can  contribute at the strategic and business partner levels as well as design and  manage delivery systems, which achieve value-added services at lower  costs.", "GSA recognized the vision of its Chief People Officer and the changing role  of its human resources organization and assembled a team of experienced  human resources staff members to develop new core competences needed  by the CPO staff.  This group developed GSA\u2019s new human capital core  competencies needed to support its CPO business model and identified five  roles that GSA believes its human capital community must play  successfully to achieve the Chief People Officer\u2019s vision and to meet the  expectations of the GSA customers.  The five roles are consultant, leader,  technologist, transactional expert, and expert.  Specific competencies  support each role.  In addition, GSA uses its competency model as a  recruiting tool for human resources professionals.  The model lists  desirable attributes for job candidates as well as a few suggested interview  questions for determining whether applicants possess these attributes.   Table 3 lists GSA\u2019s HR roles and the primary competencies GSA states are  essential for success in each of the roles.", "USGS\u2019s HR Competency Model also identifies and describes a set of human  capital competencies that are essential to effective performance in the  roles and responsibilities of the agency\u2019s human capital office as outlined in  its business model.   USGS\u2019s competency model identifies core or universal  competencies that USGS human capital staff members need and specific  competencies that human capital managers, strategic consultants,  operating specialists and generalists, and assistants need.  For each  competency, the model describes how that competency is applied.   According to USGS, the competency model is currently being used as a tool  for self-directed human capital development, and portions of the model  have been incorporated in the new automated skills assessment system.  In  the future, USGS plans to use the model as a basis for recruiting and  interviewing candidates, making decisions about developmental  assignments, and developing the competencies of every human capital staff  member to think and relate strategically to the science mission of USGS.

In a  recent report, we highlighted the importance of delegating authority and  holding line managers accountable for the effective use of human capital  flexibilities, important tools that assist agencies in managing their  workforces.  Agencies are also following a more collaborative approach  between managers and human capital professionals for those human  capital authorities retained by the human capital staff members.

Human capital staff members are responsible  for advising operating division managers on how to best apply human  capital strategy to improve results.  The human capital professional may  have responsibility, for example, for assisting managers in anticipating  changes in the labor market and recommending strategies for sustaining a  well-qualified and productive workforce.  The operating division managers  are responsible for rating the performance of the human capital  professionals working with them.  According to IRS officials, some of the  benefits of the shared accountability of human capital professionals  working with operating division managers have included customized  support for recruitment plans and hiring products and a facilitated merit  promotion process.", "FEMA line managers and human capital staff members have developed a  system where the human capital staff works with line managers to quickly  identify available employees for deployment as soon as disasters are  declared.  FEMA employs approximately 2,600 full-time employees and as  many as 4,000 temporary and reserve employees who are deployed during  federal disasters.  In response to this need, the human capital office has  implemented the Automated Disaster Deployment System.  This automated  system allows the staff to track employee credentialing (including  knowledge and experience levels and performance ratings), availability,  past and present assignment locations, dates of employment, and other  vital employee data.  According to FEMA officials, the system enables  human capital staff and line managers to share accountability for  identifying employee training and promotion needs, matching employee  expertise with specific disaster site victim needs, and creating a selection  routine that rotates available employees, thereby avoiding employee  burnout.
