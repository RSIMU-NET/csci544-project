USAID funds one of the two projects through a cooperative agreement  focused on strengthening human rights, and the other project through a  contract focused on improving the criminal justice sector.", "USAID and project implementers outlined these projects\u2019 performance  measures in project-specific monitoring plans that both parties developed  at the start of the project or revised after the project was in place. Project  implementers developed these plans, and USAID approved them. The  plans included details related to the performance measures, such as data  sources, data collection frequency, and targets. In accordance with these  plans, USAID and project implementers tracked performance measures in  annual progress reports, while they primarily tracked detailed project  activity in quarterly progress reports.", "The two USAID projects\u2019 progress reports included tables that tracked  project performance. Some of the projects\u2019 performance measures  reflected outcomes, such as prosecution rates of Mexican government  prosecution units that received technical support and the number of  improved measures to address serious human rights violations. Some  performance measures reflected outputs, such as the number of Mexican  officials trained in human rights advocacy areas. See table 4 for  examples of performance measures and information in the progress  reports we reviewed.", "When the implementer and USAID changed performance measures, they  also revised project-specific monitoring plans to document these  changes. For example, for one project we reviewed, the established  measures were no longer effective in measuring progress toward the  project\u2019s objectives, according to USAID officials. As a result, the  implementer and USAID modified the project\u2019s monitoring plan at least  twice, revising the performance measures to better align with the project\u2019s  objectives. The subsequent progress reports we reviewed for these  projects included data on the revised performance measures.", "USAID has procedures to help ensure that monitoring staff track  performance data. According to USAID officials, USAID began sending  out a standard spreadsheet to all M\u00e9rida Initiative implementing partners  in 2018 that requires them to report performance data on a quarterly or  annual basis. USAID uses these spreadsheets to track M\u00e9rida Initiative  project performance data. Since May 2017, USAID has also conducted 6- month portfolio reviews in which monitoring managers and their staff review project activities and performance data collected for their projects  and discuss project successes and challenges.

In 2015, Mexico agreed that it would provide data to  State/INL on this set of indicators to demonstrate the effects of the M\u00e9rida  Initiative, according to State/INL officials. These officials told us that they  try to obtain the data on an annual basis. They also noted that the  purpose of collecting the data from Mexico was to establish a mechanism  to share information on the M\u00e9rida Initiative\u2019s effects and to improve U.S.- Mexico cooperation on the initiative.

Some  data are closely linked to M\u00e9rida Initiative\u2013funded projects, such as the  accreditation status of Mexican correctional facilities. Other data provide  broader context, such as Mexican civil society\u2019s perception of Mexican  agencies. In addition, data, such as the number of accredited forensic  laboratories and correctional facilities, may reflect progress in institution  building. Other data, such as the number of accounts blocked by the  Mexican Financial Intelligence Unit, may reflect operational capacity  development. See table 5 below for examples of the indicators, as  reported by Mexico to State/INL.", "State/INL officials said they use the indicator data in discussions with  Mexican officials to help monitor the implementation and activities of the  M\u00e9rida Initiative, including which best practices can be replicated across  Mexico. State/INL officials said the data also inform the agency\u2019s internal  decision making on which M\u00e9rida Initiative programs are effective and  which programs it should modify. For example, according to State/INL  officials, the indicator data help track the use of equipment donated to  Mexico through the M\u00e9rida Initiative.

USAID has established procedures that help ensure  that it follows most key monitoring practices, including those related to  assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff and monitoring project  implementation. State/INL management has not established such  procedures for the projects we reviewed, limiting its ability to stay well  informed of project performance and make course corrections to improve  performance when necessary. While State/INL and USAID often  conducted assessments to identify risks that may affect the achievement  of project objectives, they generally did not address the results of the risk  assessments in projects\u2019 monitoring plans.

From these leading  practices, which are focused on a high-level assessment of agency  monitoring policies, we derived eight key practices that can help agencies  monitor the implementation and performance at the project level, such as  those implemented under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. These eight key practices  include those that in our judgment directly relate to monitoring project- level performance activities. We did not address monitoring of financial  activities, because our review focused on performance monitoring. We  made minor modifications to the key practices selected to reflect the  focus of our review. We also grouped the selected key monitoring  practices into three areas: (1) assigning monitoring duties to qualified  staff, (2) planning a monitoring approach, and (3) monitoring project  implementation.", "To determine the extent to which State/INL and USAID followed key  practices in monitoring M\u00e9rida Initiative projects, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 15 high\u2013dollar value State/INL projects and  five high\u2013dollar value USAID projects that started between January 1,  2014, and December 31, 2016. (See app. II for details on these 20  projects). Some of these projects were ongoing after fiscal year 2019. We  selected the projects from a list provided by State/INL and USAID. State\u2019s  list included 388 projects, and USAID\u2019s list included 57 projects for a total  of 445 projects under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. We selected projects  implemented through a variety of mechanisms. For State/INL, we  selected two letters of agreement with international organizations, four  grants, three contracts, and two interagency agreements implemented by  DOD, two interagency agreements implemented by DHS, and two  interagency agreements implemented by DOJ. For USAID, we selected  two contracts and three grants. The value of the 15 State projects in our  sample is about $88 million, and the value of the five USAID projects in  our sample is about $107 million. These 15 State/INL projects represent  about 25 percent of the total value of the State/INL projects that started  during this period. These five USAID projects were the highest value  contracts and grants cooperative agreements and represent about 70  percent of the total value of USAID projects that started during this period.  Because State/INL implements about 90 percent of all M\u00e9rida Initiative  projects, we chose a larger State/INL sample than USAID sample.", "We assessed the agencies\u2019 monitoring of the 20 selected M\u00e9rida Initiative  projects against eight key monitoring practices largely derived from  GAO\u2019s Leading Practices for Monitoring Foreign Assistance. We  reviewed documents to determine the extent to which State/INL and  USAID followed the eight key monitoring practices for each of the  selected M\u00e9rida Initiative projects. Specifically, for each selected project,  we requested monitoring plans; work plans; risk assessments; Contract,  Grant, or Agreement Officer Representative Certificates; Contract, Grant,  or Agreement Officers Representatives Designation Letters; implementer  progress reports for the latest year of activity of each project (at the time  of our review); samples of field or site visit reports; and samples of  monitoring emails between monitoring staff and the implementers. We  reviewed available documents as they related to each key practice to  determine the extent to which the agency had taken steps to follow and  document the key practice for each project.", "On the basis of our review, we assessed whether the key practices were  \u201cgenerally followed,\u201d \u201cpartially followed,\u201d or \u201cnot followed.\u201d We rated the  extent to which the agency followed each key practice as \u201cgenerally  followed\u201d if we received evidence that all critical elements of the key  practice were conducted and documented to a large or full extent,  \u201cpartially followed\u201d if we received evidence that some but not all critical  elements of the key practice were conducted and documented, and \u201cnot  followed\u201d if we did not receive evidence that any of the critical elements of  the key practice were conducted and documented. To perform these  analyses, two analysts reviewed the documents to rate the extent to  which each key practice was met. The analysts worked iteratively,  comparing notes and reconciling differences at each stage of the  analysis. In addition, GAO staff independent of the two analysts reviewed  the final analysis, and modified it as appropriate.", "To determine the extent State/INL and USAID track project performance,  we chose a nongeneralizable subset of the 20 projects listed above.

We chose a small subset of State/INL  and USAID projects to conduct a detailed analysis of data in the projects\u2019  annual and quarterly reports. Specifically, for the four State/INL projects,  we chose high\u2013dollar value projects for each of the following  implementing mechanisms: grants, interagency agreements, and  agreements with international organizations. We excluded contracts from  the State/INL subset sample, because the high\u2013dollar value contracts  generally did not have the project-level performance measures needed to  assess State\u2019s tracking of performance data. We included a second grant  in our sample in place of a contract, because more M\u00e9rida Initiative  State/INL projects are grants than interagency agreements or agreements  with international organizations. As a result, our State/INL sample  consisted of two grants, one interagency agreement, and one agreement  with an international organization. For the USAID sample, we chose one  grant or cooperative agreement and one contract. We did not choose  other types of implementing agreements because grants/cooperative  agreements and contracts comprise over 98 percent of USAID projects  for the timeframe of our review.", "For both the State/INL and USAID selected projects, we reviewed project  monitoring documents\u2014such as project narratives, workplans, and  monitoring plans\u2014and identified the performance measures outlined in  these documents for each project.
