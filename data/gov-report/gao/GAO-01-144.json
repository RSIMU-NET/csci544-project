In 1999, IRS began operating this network as a single call center providing round-the-clock service. Managing the network in this way enabled IRS to route calls from three separate toll-free lines\u2014one each for questions about tax law, account services, and refund status\u2014to the sites with the shortest hold times among those customer service representatives assigned to answer questions concerning those issues. (Fig. 1 illustrates call routing within IRS\u2019 toll-free network.)", "Before IRS began operating the network as a single call center, taxpayer calls were routed by area codes or by the percentage of staff the site had scheduled to work. Calls routed in this manner could not be easily rerouted when a site was experiencing frequent busy signals or lengthy hold times. Although individual call site operating hours and call handling responsibilities varied, IRS expanded its overall toll-free network coverage in January 1999\u2014from 16 hours a day, 6 days a week, to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.", "IRS\u2019 call center network is controlled by the Operations Center. In general, the Operations Center is responsible for forecasting call demand\u2014the numbers, types, and timing of calls IRS is expected to receive throughout the planning year on each of its three toll-free lines (tax law, accounts, and refunds); planning the routing of calls among call sites, based on each call site\u2019s assigned toll-free line and subject coverage responsibilities; developing staffing requirements for each call site and monitoring site adherence to those requirements; and monitoring network call traffic status and, when necessary, rerouting calls among the sites to optimize service.", "The Operations Center develops call site staffing requirements weekly, with call site input and agreement. These requirements prescribe the numbers of trained customer service representatives that are to be available and ready each half-hour to take calls on each assigned subject category and toll-free line. The call sites, in turn, are expected to adhere to the staffing requirements prescribed by the Operations Center. They are generally responsible for recruiting, training, and assigning customer service representatives in sufficient numbers and skills to enable them to meet prescribed staffing requirements. Collectively, IRS call centers employed nearly 10,000 customer service representatives in October 2000.", "The top picture in figure 2 shows Operations Center officials monitoring network operations, while the picture on the right shows a representative handling a call at IRS\u2019 call center in Atlanta."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our objectives, we interviewed IRS officials involved in managing toll-free telephone operations, obtained supporting documentation, and reviewed related reports by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).

Because people are a key resource for carrying out agencies\u2019 missions, we also reviewed the Government Performance and Results Act\u2019s requirements for agency strategic planning, goal-setting, and performance measurement. To identify human capital management practices used by other organizations in telephone customer service, we obtained information from several sources, including our August 2000 report on human capital management practices of public and private organizations;the 1995 National Performance Review report on best practices in telephone service; and literature on call center management, including Incoming Calls Management Institute information and reports.", "We did our work at IRS\u2019 National Office in Washington, D.C.; the Office of the Chief Customer Service Field Operations in Atlanta; the Customer Service Operations Center in Atlanta; and six of IRS\u2019 25 call sites.", "As agreed with your office, we judgmentally selected the six sites to ensure geographic coverage and other characteristics and, therefore, cannot project our results to all 25 call sites.", "Because IRS began providing 24-hour coverage in 1999, we included the two call sites that operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and four sites operating fewer than 24 hours a day. Because some call sites were colocated with IRS service centers that had large labor pools from which the sites might recruit staff, the six sites included three that were colocated with service centers and three that were not. To understand human capital management practices within the context of IRS\u2019 new organizational and operational structure, our sample includes three sites that were designated to serve taxpayers with incomes from wages and investments and three sites that were designated to serve small business and self-employed taxpayers. Since differences in site staffing levels could lead to differences in their human capital management practices, we selected two sites each from the low, middle, and high ranges of staffing levels among the 25 call sites\u2014less than 200 staff, between 200 and 400, and more than 400, respectively.

IRS has not established a long-term, desired level-of-telephone-service goal based on the needs of taxpayers and the costs and benefits of meeting them, and then determined what staffing level is needed to achieve that service level. Rather, IRS annually determines the level of funding it will seek for its customer service workforce, based on its judgment of how to best balance its efforts to assist taxpayers and to ensure their compliance with tax laws, and then calculates the expected level of service that funding level will provide. IRS\u2019 approach to setting this goal is inconsistent with federal guidance on strategic planning, which calls for agencies to develop strategic goals covering at least a 5-year period and to determine the staffing and other resources needed to achieve the goals. IRS\u2019 approach is also inconsistent with industry practices, which base their goals and staffing on customer needs. Without a long-term level-of-service goal, as well as annual goals aimed at achieving the long-term goal over time, IRS lacks meaningful targets for strategically planning and managing call center performance and measuring improvement. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commissioner stated that IRS planned to set strategic goals and staff to meet those goals.", "IInn  the absence of a long-term goal, and multiyear plans for reaching it, IRS has estimated the service it could provide based on different staffing levels. For example, when formulating its fiscal year 2000 budget, IRS estimated that it would receive over 100 million calls on its three toll-free lines throughout the fiscal year and that its customer service representatives could handle an average of 5.6 calls per hour that they were available to take calls. These workload and productivity assumptions were the basis for calculating the expected levels of service IRS could provide with different staffing levels. Specifically, with customer service representative levels ranging from 8,291 to 10,800 full-time- equivalent staff, IRS estimated that it could achieve levels of service ranging from 58 to 80 percent, respectively. Because of the need to balance service and compliance activities within overall staffing budget limitations, IRS decided to request funding at the lower level, establishing a 58-percent level-of-service goal for fiscal year 2000 and a 60-percent level for fiscal year 2001.", "A long-term, results-oriented goal is important because its provides a meaningful sense of direction as well as a yardstick for measuring the results of operations and evaluating the extent of improvements resulting from changes in resources, new technology, or management of human capital. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 required executive branch agencies to develop multiyear, strategic plans covering at least a 5-year period; describe the human and other resources needed to achieve goals; update these plans at least every 3 years; prepare annual performance plans with annual performance goals; and measure and report annually on its progress toward meeting those set long-term, output- or results-oriented goals in these strategic plans; goals.", "Under the act, strategic plans are the starting point for agencies to set annual performance goals aimed at achieving their strategic goals over time. As part of the strategic planning process, agencies are required to consult with Congress and to solicit the views of other stakeholders who might be affected by the agencies\u2019 activities.", "Unlike IRS, officials at all seven public and private call center operations we visited as part of our August 2000 report said that they determined staffing requirements based on their customers\u2019 needs and clearly articulated service-level goals\u2014that is, the percentage of calls to be answered within a given time frame. For example, the Social Security Administration (SSA)\u2014an agency that is also subject to federal budget constraints, had a goal of 95 percent of its callers getting through on its toll-free line within 5 minutes of their first attempt. This goal was established with input and support from Congress and top SSA leadership as part of a government wide effort to improve customer service. According to an SSA associate deputy commissioner, the focus on improving telephone customer service followed a period of very poor service in the early and mid-1990s, when as many as 49 percent of callers got busy signals when they called the toll-free number. The associate deputy said that congressional stakeholders continue to monitor SSA\u2019s toll-free telephone operations, resulting in continued support by SSA management to allocate the resources needed to meet established goals.", "Other studies have also documented the importance of setting service- level goals based on customers\u2019 needs. One guide to call center management for practitioners that we reviewed underscored the importance of service-level goals. It described service level as \u201cthe core value\u201d at the heart of effective call center management, without which, answers to many important questions, including \u201cHow many staff do you need?\u201d would be left to chance. It said service-level goals should be realistic, understood by everyone in the organization, taken seriously, and funded adequately. While the guide also recommended benchmarking, formally or informally, with competitors or similar organizations, it stated each organization should determine an appropriate service level for its call centers, considering its unique circumstances. These considerations should include the labor and telephone equipment costs of answering the call, the value of the call to the organization, and how long callers are willing to hold for service.", "IRS recognizes the need to establish long-term goals and is considering adopting some of the measures used by other organizations and establishing goals for those measures. For fiscal year 2001, for example, IRS plans to measure the percentage of callers who reach IRS within 30 seconds. While IRS has not established a long-term goal for this measure, it has set an interim goal of 49 percent for fiscal year 2001.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commissioner stated that IRS had instituted an agencywide strategic planning process in March 2000 that links the budget and available resources to its strategies and improvement projects. According to the Commissioner, IRS\u2019 fiscal year 2002 Strategic Plan and Budget will include a 74 percent level-of-service goal, with a goal of reaching 85 to 90 percent by fiscal year 2003.

Nevertheless, five of the sites were able to fill their vacant positions. One site was unable to fill its needs and had concerns about the suitability of the persons hired. According to officials at this latter site, due to the limited time between the date they were provided the number of positions to fill and the time that the new employees had to report for work, the officials did not have sufficient time to interview all applicants before hiring them.", "Officials at each IRS call site were responsible for hiring representatives for their location, including deciding what recruiting methods and applicant screening tools to use. All six sites used some combination of conventional recruiting methods, such as newspaper advertisements and college campus recruiting. To determine the suitability of applicants, beyond the basic qualifications for the position, officials at four sites interviewed applicants before hiring them, and most used interview techniques to determine how applicants might behave in typical work situations. Two of these four sites also administered a five-question, tax- related math test to assess a candidate\u2019s basic math and analytical skills.", "In an effort to improve its recruiting for customer service representatives, IRS is in the early stages of developing a national recruiting strategy. As part of this plan, IRS is determining where it should target its recruiting efforts. IRS is identifying sites where IRS\u2019 salary and benefits make it a competitive employer in the local job market and sites that have trouble recruiting and retaining suitable applicants. Officials believe this will help IRS determine which sites should be growth sites for hiring telephone customer service representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Sites Experienced Challenges in Training Representatives and Keeping Them Proficient", "paragraphs": ["According to officials at the call sites we visited, the many obstacles that affected their ability to train customer service representatives and keep them proficient included the broad range of complex topics representatives must address, inadequate resources, the cyclical nature of taxpayer demand, reassignment of tax topics among representatives, and the lack of a formal mechanism to identify individual refresher training needs.", "Each year, IRS must train thousands of customer service representatives in a broad range of topics, and according to officials at the six sites we visited, they sometimes had to do so without adequate resources. Topics range from the status of refunds to more complicated issues such as capital gains or losses. In fiscal year 1999, the standard training curriculum provided by all sites generally included periods of classroom instruction, followed by periods of on-the-job training that were roughly half the length of the classroom instruction. This training was delivered incrementally over a 3-year period, between the busy filing seasons, during which IRS receives the bulk of its toll-free calls. The training program also included annual tax law/procedural update training. However, after customer service representatives received their initial training, they generally did not receive subsequent refresher training despite the cyclical nature of the work.", "Officials also cited a shortage of instructors, limited training time, and outdated training materials as other factors that affected their ability to effectively train customer service representatives. For example, officials at the one site that did not hire the number of representatives authorized said they did not have enough instructors to provide the necessary training. Officials at three sites said that they did not have sufficient time to fully train representatives before their peak season because they did not receive timely notice of when, and how many, they could hire. Officials at four sites also said that training materials provided by the National Office were frequently outdated.", "Keeping customer service representatives proficient was also a challenge for the sites due to the cyclical nature of taxpayer demand and changes to the topics representatives were expected to know. The frequency of the calls and the topics covered varied throughout the year. The bulk of the calls are generally received during the busy filing season. For example, more than 57.6 of the 79.6 million toll-free calls made to IRS in fiscal year 2000, or 72 percent were made from January through June. In addition, calls received from January through April predominantly involved tax law topics, while calls received after April mainly involved account- and refund-related topics. Consequently, customer service representatives could go long periods, such as months between filing seasons or even years since topic training was completed, without receiving calls to reinforce their experience on some of the topics for which they were trained. Moreover, this situation was compounded when IRS implemented centralized call routing in 1999. In conjunction with this change, IRS consolidated the number of subject categories, which ranged from 40 to 125 depending on the site, and reassigned representatives to a broader group of 31 categories. This was done without ensuring that they had adequate training or experience. According to a site official, inadequate training is one factor reducing the accuracy of IRS responses to tax law and account calls. From 1998 to 1999, for example, network accuracy for account calls decreased from 87.9 to 81.7 percent, according to IRS\u2019 weekly customer service snapshot report dated September 30, 1999.", "Officials at the sites we visited also said that the lack of a formal mechanism to identify which representatives needed refresher training hindered their ability to keep their representatives proficient. Officials have records of specific training each representative has received, but they do not have a method for assessing individual competency gaps\u2014i.e., between knowledge and skills needed to respond to calls and current proficiency\u2014to quantify each representative\u2019s refresher training needs. Although IRS had developed such a system and began using it in December 1998, a customer service training official said testing was not done consistently among the call sites, and refresher training was not provided to meet identified needs. The official also said a lack of funding and uncertainty of future organizational developments led IRS to discontinue the system in 1999.", "Because IRS does not have a system for assessing competency gaps to identify the specific refresher training needs of individual representatives, call sites waste scarce training resources trying to improve the performance of customer service representatives. For example, officials said they sometimes send groups of representatives to refresher training, knowing that some representatives will probably receive training they do not need. This happens because the course covers several subjects and each representative probably needs some of the training but most representatives probably do not need all of the training. Providing unnecessary training wastes resources that would otherwise be available for representatives who need additional training. \u201cFundamentally, we are attempting the impossible. We are expecting employees and our managers to be trained in areas that are far too broad to ever succeed, and our manuals and training courses are, therefore, unmanageable in scope and complexity\u2026. The next step is to rethink what we should do at each site in order to achieve greater site specialization.\u201d", "Because of the problems involved in attempting to provide the full range of training to all customer service representatives, in fiscal year 2000, IRS began refocusing its program to provide just-in-time training, targeted more to the specific types of questions taxpayers call about at different times throughout the year.  In addition, as part of restructuring, IRS intends to further specialize training to serve specific taxpayer groups\u2013 those who receive income from wages and investments and those who receive income from small businesses or self-employment. IRS\u2019 training related plans do not, however, address the need for identifying competency gaps to determine refresher training needs and target training accordingly. A National Office official informed us that IRS was working with the Office of Personnel Management to \u201cdevelop competency models, document career paths, and develop assessment instruments for use in training, development, selection, etc., for all of the occupations within the IRS.\u201d Due to the broad scope of this endeavor, however, the official could not say when IRS could expect to establish and implement a mechanism for assessing the refresher training needs of customer service representatives and ensuring that the training is provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Did Not Monitor Reasons for Call Center Attrition to Determine How to Address It", "paragraphs": ["Despite its substantial investment in recruiting and training its network of 10,000 customer service representatives, and concern by National Office and some site officials that attrition was higher than it should be, IRS was not actively monitoring attrition and determining what steps, if any, were needed to address it.

They said most of their attrition was to other jobs within their organization and thus benefited the overall organization.", "None of the six sites we visited could provide attrition statistics for customer service representatives for 1998 or 1999. Officials at four sites provided estimates ranging from 13 to 19 percent per year; however, these estimates were just their opinions\u2014they were not based on data collected by the site or the National Office. Although IRS did not monitor attrition, National Office officials and officials at three sites said that attrition was a problem. Only one of the six sites had collected data to determine the reasons why representatives left; officials at the remaining five sites and the National Office had opinions about why representatives left.

During the first 6 months of fiscal year 2000, IRS data indicated that for 60 percent of the time call sites were overstaffed or understaffed compared to tolerances established by IRS. In addition, IRS\u2019 method for measuring call sites\u2019 adherence to their schedules was incomplete. Recognizing its problems with forecasting and scheduling, IRS was adapting an automated system similar to those used by other organizations.", "Inaccurate forecasting of the expected fiscal year 2000 toll-free call volume led to inefficient scheduling and use of staff at some sites. The Operations Center estimated that IRS would receive 100 million calls in fiscal year 2000, but IRS actually received about 80 million\u201420 percent less than forecasted. Because individual site staffing requirements were based on IRS\u2019 forecasts of the expected numbers, types, and timing of calls, network and individual site work plans were also overstated, resulting in the underutilization of staff at some sites. For example, according to TIGTA\u2019s March 2000 report, for the period December 5, 1998, through March 15, 1999, overstated call demand resulted in staff being scheduled and ready to take calls, but getting no calls, an average of 10 percent of their time at six sites for which data were available.", "Operations Center officials stated that IRS\u2019 increased use of new routing technologies, combined with continuous organizational and procedural changes, made accurate forecasting difficult. Moreover, they believed the information that IRS had about historical demand was of limited value in predicting future demand for two reasons. First, the historical information was not based on operating 24 hours a day; and second, it was difficult to take into account the constantly changing environment (i.e., tax law changes and increased use of electronic filing and Web-based services). However, the Directors of Customer Account Services, whose staffs have responsibility for providing telephone customer service to wage and investment and small business and self-employed taxpayers, stated that demand forecasting should improve now that IRS has 2 years of information based on operating 24 hours a day.", "Managers at most of the sites we visited stated that the complicated scheduling process made it difficult to ensure that the appropriate staff were scheduled to work at the right times. They were also concerned about the amount of time they spent scheduling and rescheduling staff in attempting to ensure that they had scheduled the number of staff with the skills the Operations Center prescribed for each half-hour increment of service time. IRS management had not developed a standard system for the sites to use in helping them to develop their site schedules. As a result, each site we visited used its own system to track variables related to each customer service representative, such as the specific work schedule agreement, planned vacation and training, and skill level in answering certain types of calls. Site managers then used these variables to develop site schedules. Managers explained that the large number of variables to consider when doing so (e.g., more than 160 different work schedules at one site) complicated the scheduling process and made it difficult for them to optimize their day-to-day efforts to meet the staffing requirements prescribed by the Operations Center. IRS\u2019 own statistics bear this out. At the times IRS measured, call centers were either understaffed or overstaffed, compared with the Operations Center\u2019s prescribed staffing schedule, 60 percent of the time\u201424 percent and 36 percent, respectively, during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2000. In measuring site adherence to its prescribed staffing requirements, the Operations Center considers variances of more than 10 percent (of the total number required to be ready for each half-hour period) as overstaffing or understaffing.", "The Operations Center only partially measures each site\u2019s ability to meet the prescribed staffing requirements. The current measurement system determines if each site had, on average, the required number of customer service representatives available to answer the telephone for each half- hour period. However, the Operations Center did not measure the extent to which sites provided representatives with the required skills.", "IRS is working with a contractor to refine a commercially available automated system to facilitate forecasting demand, scheduling staff, and tracking adherence to the schedule. The system is expected to use historical data to more accurately forecast call demand (volume, type, and timing of calls) and to centrally compare information on site staff resources (e.g., availability and skills) in relation to forecasted demand to help ensure that network staffing schedules make optimum use of available site staffing.  This system is also expected to identify individual site staffing options for meeting network requirements, thus reducing the amount of time site managers spend on scheduling staff.", "According to Operations Center officials, the contractor was still refining the commercial version of the system because it was not designed to handle the size and complexity of IRS\u2019 toll-free operations (e.g., the number of call sites and customer service representatives and the range of topics). According to the project leader responsible for this system, both system hardware and software were in place at all call centers prior to October 2000, but the software is not yet fully operational. Even though IRS now has 2 years of information based on operating 24 hours a day, it did not gather that data in a consistent format. The system\u2019s forecasting and scheduling capability will not be usable until IRS has collected at least 1 year of call demand data in a consistent format. The project leader was not sure when IRS would have these data because data collection efforts were delayed in order to make changes that would allow IRS to capture more data than originally planned and in a reconfigured format. Also, the planned transfer of certain functions from the Philadelphia Service Center to the Operations Center was more than a year behind schedule in October 2000. Moreover, the project leader said IRS\u2019 restructuring could cause further delays in achieving full system capability.", "Other organizations included in our August report used an automated system similar to the one IRS is implementing. For example, one company used an automated system to identify its short- and long-term staffing requirements. The system assisted call center managers in forecasting call demands and scheduling staff to meet the demands. Officials said the system also enabled the company to significantly reduce the time needed to perform these tasks. It forecasted call demand down to half-hour intervals, based on historical data trends.

As the Government Performance and Results Act and SSA experience suggest, IRS will also need support for its long- and short-term goals from congressional stakeholders.", "IRS\u2019 telephone customer service workforce represents a substantial human capital investment in providing assistance to taxpayers. To get the most from this investment, IRS must be able to (1) target scarce training resources where they are most needed to optimize call center and network performance, (2) minimize turnover of trained and experienced customer service representatives to avoid unnecessary recruiting and training expenditures and enhance productivity, and (3) determine how its individual or collective human capital policies and practices affect its ability to achieve customer service goals and how changes in one or more human capital management practices will affect other practices. However, until IRS establishes a system for assessing competency gaps to identify the refresher training needs of individual customer service representatives, it cannot effectively target scarce training resources to meet individual training needs. Without a system for monitoring attrition, identifying its causes, and taking steps to address them, IRS cannot ensure that its recruiting and training resources are used efficiently. And, unless IRS considers its human capital management practices\u2019 contribution to achieving overall service goals and considers the interrelationships among its toll-free service human capital practices, it lacks a good basis for assessing the soundness of those human capital practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue take several steps to improve IRS\u2019 human capital management practices related to providing telephone customer service. Specifically, the Commissioner should establish a long-term, desired service-level goal based on taxpayers\u2019 needs, together with annual goals designed to make progress toward reaching that long-term goal over time, and work with congressional and other stakeholders to obtain their support and the resources needed to reach those goals; establish a system for assessing customer service representatives\u2019 competency gaps and meeting the refresher training needs identified by the assessments; develop a system for monitoring call center attrition and identifying its causes and use the information gathered from that system to develop, as appropriate, strategies for dealing with the attrition of customer service representatives; and ensure that IRS\u2019 evaluations of human capital management practices consider the effects of those practices on its ability to achieve long- and short-term customer service goals and the interrelationships among human capital practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Commissioner of Internal Revenue provided written comments on a draft of this report in a January 12, 2001, letter, which is reprinted in appendix II. We also met with senior IRS officials on January 4, 2001, to discuss our draft report and to obtain updated information on IRS\u2019 new toll-free measures and goals. The Commissioner agreed with our recommendations, which he said should improve performance in this critical area. In addition, he provided information summarizing IRS\u2019 efforts relating to each recommendation and commented that IRS\u2019 efforts reflected the constructive dialog between IRS and our staff. We incorporated the new information and modified the report, where appropriate, to reflect IRS efforts.", "The Commissioner\u2019s letter stated that IRS had instituted an agencywide strategic planning process in March 2000 that links the budget and available resources to its strategies and improvement projects, but also recognized the need to strengthen that new process. Toward this end, the Commissioner stated that IRS\u2019 fiscal year 2002 Strategic Plan and Budget reflects a 74-percent level-of-service goal, with a goal of reaching 85 to 90 percent by fiscal year 2003. This plan was not yet available as we were preparing this report. He also stated that an initiative was under way to improve workload planning to ensure that customer needs are considered during the planning and budgeting process. The Commissioner\u2019s letter did not say how the cited workload planning initiative would identify and assess customer needs.", "Based on the Commissioner\u2019s comments, significant efforts were under way or planned to help ensure that customer service representatives will have the competencies and training needed to respond to taxpayer calls. In addition to the targeted training and planned specialization discussed in this report, for example, IRS plans to establish competency-based recruiting and retention methods to help ensure that IRS recruits and retains individuals who are well-suited to telephone customer service work. The Commissioner\u2019s comments also stated that IRS\u2019 competency- based management plans include the use of \u201cassessment instruments to identify training needs.\u201d These initiatives seem to be promising and may form a basis for identifying individual refresher training needs and ensuring that these needs are met.", "The Commissioner\u2019s comments also recognized the importance of retaining skilled representatives. His comments identified several efforts that focused on identifying employees that may be more likely to remain with IRS. He did not comment on monitoring why employees leave or on using this information to strengthen IRS\u2019 efforts to retain skilled representatives.", "Regarding IRS\u2019 evaluations of its human capital practices, the Commissioner\u2019s comments did not respond directly to the primary point of our recommendation\u2014that IRS evaluations should consider the effects of its practices on its ability to achieve its long- and short-term customer service goals. However, the Commissioner did say that IRS has embraced our Human Capital Self-Assessment Checklist for Agency Leaders. IRS had used it as a diagnostic tool in its recent review of its mid- and top-level management realignment process and planned to use it again in fiscal year 2001 to \u201cconduct an overview of the status of human capital practices throughout the Service.\u201d Our checklist provides a framework by which agency leaders can develop informed views of their agencies\u2019 human capital policies and practices. The Commissioner also objected to our comparing IRS\u2019 1998 performance with performance in subsequent years, because of the many changes to IRS\u2019 operating environment, such as enterprise call management and 24-hour operations. This report compared IRS\u2019 reported tax law and account accuracy in 1998 and 1999. As stated in our evaluation of the Commissioner\u2019s comments on our 2000 filing season report, we believe it is appropriate to compare IRS\u2019 performance before and after the operational changes mentioned above. In reevaluating the examples we used, however, we decided to eliminate our reference to IRS\u2019 reported tax law accuracy because we learned that the methods used to measure tax law accuracy changed in 1999, and thus, results may not be comparable.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter.
