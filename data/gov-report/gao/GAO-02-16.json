The cooperative exchange of traffic among backbone providers is essential if the Internet is to remain a seamless and widely accessible public medium. Interconnection among Internet backbone providers varies both in terms of the physical structure and financial agreements of data traffic exchange. The physical structure of interconnection takes two forms: (1) the exchange of traffic among many backbone providers at a \"network access point\"--a common facility--and (2) the exchange of traffic between two or more backbone providers at \"private\" interconnection points. No publicly available data exist with which to evaluate competitiveness in the Internet backbone market. Evolution of this market is likely to be largely affected by two types of emerging services.

In addition, we interviewed academic experts,  representatives of relevant trade associations, and officials from the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the  Department of Commerce, and the Antitrust Division of the  Department of  Justice (DOJ)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To access the Internet, most residential users dial in to an ISP over a  telephone line, although other physical means of access to the Internet\u2014 such as through a cable television line\u2014are becoming increasingly  common.  For a residential customer, the ISP sends the user\u2019s Internet  traffic on to the backbone network.  To perform this function, ISPs obtain  direct connections to one or more Internet backbone providers.  Small  business users may also connect to a backbone network through an ISP,  however, large businesses often purchase dedicated lines that connect  directly to Internet backbone networks.  An ISP\u2019s traffic connects to a  backbone provider\u2019s network at a facility known as a \u201cpoint of presence.\u201d   Backbone providers have points of presence in varied locations, although  they concentrate these facilities in more densely-populated areas where  Internet end users\u2019 demands for access are greatest.  If an ISP or end user is  far from a point of presence, it is able to reach distant points of presence  over telecommunications lines.  Figure 1 depicts two hypothetical Internet  backbone networks that link at interconnection points and take traffic to  and from residential users through ISPs and directly from large business  users.", "Once on an Internet backbone network, digital data signals that were split  into separate pieces or \u201cpackets\u201d at the transmission point are separately  routed over the most efficient available pathway and reassembled at their  destination point.  The standards that specify most data transmissions are  known as the Internet Protocol (IP) Suite.  Under part of this protocol,  streams of packets are routed to their destination over the most efficient  pathway.  Other aspects of the protocol facilitate the routing of packets to  their appropriate destination by examining the 32-bit numeric identifier\u2014 or IP address\u2014attached to every packet.  Currently, IP addresses for North  America are allocated by the American Registry for Internet Numbers  (ARIN).", "There are many Internet backbone providers offering service in the United  States.  Boardwatch\u2014an industry trade magazine\u2014reports 41 backbone  providers with a national network and many other regional backbones.   Approximately five to eight of these national providers are considered to be  \u201cTier 1\u201d backbone providers.  A Tier 1 provider is defined by Boardwatch  as having a network of wide geographic scope, having a network with many  IP addresses, having extensive information for traffic routing  determinations, and handling a large percentage of transmissions.", "Unlike telecommunications services, the provision of Internet backbone  service is not regulated by governmental communications agencies.  Dating  back to the 1960s when data signals began to flow over public telephone  networks, FCC determined that \u201cbasic services\u201d\u2014the physical transport  of data over telephone networks\u2014would be regulated, but \u201cenhanced  services\u201d\u2014the data-processing or computer-enhanced functions of data  transmissions\u2014was a vibrant and competitive market that should remain  free of regulation.  Congress maintained this distinction when it enacted  the Telecommunications Act of 1996, terming these services  \u201ctelecommunications\u201d and \u201cinformation,\u201d respectively.  No provisions  were contained in the 1996 act pertaining to Internet backbone services;  rather, the act sought to increase competition in other communications  sectors, primarily the local telephone market.  However, the treatment of  these more established communications services and infrastructures under  the Communications Act of 1934\u2014as amended by the 1996 act\u2014has  indirectly affected the burgeoning Internet medium.  Additionally, the act  provided FCC and states the authority to take actions to encourage the  deployment of advanced telecommunications capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facilities and Financial Arrangements of Interconnection Among Backbone Providers Vary", "paragraphs": ["Two types of facilities are used for the exchange of data traffic by  interconnected Internet backbone providers.  The first type of facility,  known as a \u201cnetwork access point\u201d (NAP), enables numerous backbone  providers to interconnect with each other at a common facility for the  exchange of data traffic.  Internet data traffic is also exchanged by  backbone providers at \u201cprivate\u201d interconnections.  Independent of the type  of facility at which backbone providers exchange traffic, two different  types of financial arrangements exist among backbone providers for traffic  exchanges.  In a \u201cpeering\u201d relationship, backbone providers exchange data  destined only for each other\u2019s network generally without the imposition of  a fee.  Transit payments, which involve the payment by one backbone  provider to another for the mutual exchange of traffic and for the delivery  of traffic to other providers, have become more common with time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Internet Data Are Exchanged Among Backbone Networks at Two Types of Interconnection Facilities: NAPs and Private Interconnection Points", "paragraphs": ["A NAP facilitates the interconnection of multiple backbone providers.  In  the early to mid-1990s, the National Science Foundation designed and  partially funded four NAPs, each of which was managed by a different  company.  Since that time, other interconnection points have been  constructed, and for purposes of this report, the term NAPs refers to  approximately 10 major traffic exchange points that host backbone  providers.  Managed by different companies, NAPs are not uniform  facilities; differences exist in terms of equipment, software, and data  transmission rates.", "Although most backbone providers we interviewed use the NAPs, a few  providers voiced concerns about them.  In the first years of their existence,  NAPs became congested with the rapid rate of growth in Internet traffic.   Two of the providers with whom we spoke said that some NAPs were not  well managed.  Also, originally some NAP technology was not \u201cscalable\u201d\u2014 that is, beyond some level, it was very costly to increase the amount of  traffic that could be exchanged at a NAP.  If traffic exchange at a NAP  became congested, service quality could be compromised.  Two typical  problems that congestion causes include latency (delay in the transmission  of traffic) and packet loss (when transmitted data are actually lost and  never reach their destination).  For example, one backbone provider told  us that the loss of packets at some NAPs had sometimes reached 50  percent.", "The congestion and poor quality of connections at the NAPs led backbone  providers to engage in another type of traffic exchange known as \u201cprivate  interconnection.\u201d  Private interconnection refers to the exchange of traffic  at a place other than a NAP.  Usually, these private interconnections involve  two companies entering into a bilateral agreement to exchange traffic; no  third party manages the traffic exchange.  The parties interconnect their  networks at any feasible location, such as a facility of one of the  providers.  Because of the private nature of these agreements, the number  of private interconnections that currently exist across the United States,  according to one company representative, is not known.", "Despite a variety of technological developments that have improved traffic  flow at NAPs, we found that for the providers we interviewed, the  majority of Internet traffic exchange occurs at private interconnection  points.  Of 17 backbone providers with whom we spoke, 15 used both  NAPs and private interconnections; the remaining 2 used only private  interconnections, avoiding the NAPs entirely.  Slightly more than half of the  15 providers using both NAPs and private interconnection said they  exchanged more than 80 percent of their traffic at private exchange points.   Of the 17 companies that we met with, 10 provided estimates of how their  mix of private interconnection and NAP use would likely change in the  future.  Nine of the 10 stated that they either plan less use of NAPs in the  next few years or do not see their mix of NAPs and private interconnection  changing; only one company said that it was likely to make greater use of  NAPs in the future.", "We found that some Internet backbone providers value several features of  NAPs.  For example, when a company interconnects at a NAP, it saves on  equipment costs and administrative overhead.  Representatives of two  companies with whom we spoke noted that the NAPs play an important  role in helping to keep the market for backbone service open for entry, and  thus more competitive, because NAPs provide new backbone firms an  efficient, low-cost method for exchanging traffic with numerous other  providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interconnection Among Internet Backbone Providers Occurs Under Two Types of Financial Arrangements: Peering and Transit", "paragraphs": ["When the commercial Internet began, only a few major backbone providers  of relatively similar size existed, each of which sent and received roughly  equal amounts of traffic.  The similarities among these backbone firms led  them to view each other as \u201cpeers.\u201d  These providers elected to exchange  traffic for free, rather than trying to measure the actual traffic exchanged  and developing a payment method.  In a peering arrangement, two  backbone providers agree to exchange traffic destined only for each others\u2019  networks.  As depicted in figure 2, the peering agreement between  backbone provider A and backbone provider B only covers traffic going  from A\u2019s network to B\u2019s network and vice versa.  For backbone A to move  traffic to backbone C\u2019s network under peering, it must have a peering  agreement directly with backbone C.", "By the mid to late-1990s, another financial arrangement known as \u201ctransit\u201d  emerged.  Transit and peering are distinctive in two key respects.  First,  while peering generally entails traffic exchange between two providers  without payment, transit entails payment by one provider to another for  carrying traffic.  Transit agreements thus constitute a supplier-customer  relationship between some backbone providers, much like the relationship  between a backbone provider and a nonbackbone customer (such as an  ISP).  Second, when a backbone provider buys transit from another  provider, it obtains not only access to the \u201csupplier\u2019s\u201d backbone network,  but also access to any other backbone network with which its supplier  peers.  Regarding physical locations, however, both transit and peering  take place at NAPs as well as at private interconnection points.  Currently,  there is a segregation of backbone providers into \u201ctiers.\u201d  The top tier or  \u201cTier 1\u201d providers generally peer with each other and sell transit to smaller  backbone providers.  However, we found that smaller providers often  peered with each other and were able, in some cases, to peer with larger  providers.", "The illustration in figure 3 shows backbone provider C as a transit  customer of backbone provider B and backbone providers B and A as  peers.  In this case, traffic originating on backbone C can get to backbone  B\u2019s network as well as to that of backbone A (with which backbone C does  not have an independent relationship) because B will pass C\u2019s traffic off to  A as part of its delivery of transit service to C.  Thus, a smaller backbone  provider generally need only buy transit from one or two large providers to  achieve universal connectivity.", "We found that it is generally not viewed as economical for a backbone  provider to peer with a less geographically dispersed backbone provider.   Thus, even if there were equal traffic flows, the larger provider will tend to  carry traffic a further distance\u2014which, according to a larger backbone  provider we spoke with, ultimately means more costs are imposed on its  infrastructure\u2014when it peers with a provider with a smaller or less widely  dispersed network.", "Figures 4 and 5 illustrate this paradigm.  In figure 4, backbone providers A  and B are of similar size, and traffic between the two could be carried  mostly by one backbone provider in one direction, but mostly by the other  in the opposite direction.", "In figure 5, backbone provider D is smaller than backbone provider C, with  more limited points at which traffic can be brought onto the network.   When backbones C and D exchange traffic, C must carry the traffic much  farther on the return path before it can hand off the data packets to D.   Therefore, C might consider D to be benefiting from C\u2019s network  investment and thus, C would be more likely to view D as a customer  purchasing access to its network than as a peer in traffic exchange.", "The \u201ctiering\u201d of Internet backbone providers and the dual system of peering  and transit agreements have caused controversies.  Several of the non-Tier  1 backbone providers with whom we spoke expressed concerns about their  inability to peer with the largest providers.  In particular, we were told that  the inability of non-Tier 1 providers to peer with Tier 1 providers puts  smaller companies\u2014which must therefore purchase transit service\u2014at a  competitive disadvantage.  We were also told that peering policies should  be made public.", "To some extent, market forces may be relieving some of these problems.   First, despite the view that smaller providers have no choice but to buy  transit, some backbone providers with whom we spoke stated that the  market is competitive, and transit rates have been decreasing.  Second,  eight of the backbone providers with whom we spoke (some of which were  Tier 1 providers and some of which were not) said they already had posted  or soon would be posting their peering policies on their Web sites or  otherwise making them publicly available.", "Perhaps most interesting, we found that some non-Tier 1 backbone  providers do not want to peer with the largest backbone providers.  For  example, one provider spoke critically of the quality of peering connections  and the quality of service provided between peers.  Some stated that it is  difficult to guarantee their own clients a certain level of service if they  receive few guarantees themselves\u2014a common occurrence under peering.

Similarly, most non-Tier 1 backbone providers stated that they can  purchase transit from a number of Tier 1 backbone providers.

Similarly, 11  ISPs and 3 end users we interviewed explicitly stated that it was important  to them to purchase service from a Tier 1 provider.  Finally, many ISPs and  end users stated that it was important to them to purchase backbone  connectivity from a provider possessing certain network characteristics.   Commonly cited characteristics of importance were a network with a  broad geographic scope, many customers, significant capacity, and good  peering arrangements with other providers.  These are all common  characteristics of Tier 1 backbone providers.", "Because Tier 1 providers are viewed as a special class of backbone  providers, the existence of approximately 40 national backbone providers  may not fully reveal the competitiveness of this market.

However, most of the ISPs and end users  with whom we spoke nonetheless stated that the market is competitive and  they have significant choice of provider.  It appears that even if the  \u201crelevant\u201d market for primary backbone connectivity is the Tier 1  providers, that market segment may be viewed as competitive.", "A remaining concern regarding the \u201ctiered\u201d segmentation of the market is  the potential for the number of Tier 1 providers to decline or for one of  these providers to become dominant.  For example, the recent economic  downturn in the communications sector may portend a further shakeout of  backbone providers.  Several of the company officials we interviewed  expressed concern that there would be consolidation among the Tier 1  providers and thus noted the importance of antitrust oversight of this  industry.  Moreover, both an FCC Working Paper and the Antitrust Division  of DOJ have noted that in industries such as the Internet backbone market,  interconnection among carriers is critical to the quality of service  consumers receive.  As such, a much larger provider may have less  incentive to have good interconnection quality with other providers  because without quality interconnection, customers may have an incentive  to buy service from the largest provider with the best-connected network.   This would give the larger provider a competitive advantage, which in turn  could cause the market to \u201ctip\u201d\u2014that is, more and more users would  choose connectivity from the larger network\u2014risking a monopolization of  the industry.

As such, purchasers of backbone connectivity in rural areas may  have fewer choices among providers than their counterparts in more urban  locations.  One point made by two rural providers is that rural areas  sometimes have subsidized networks (e.g., state networks or networks  funded, in part, by governmental subsidy) that may actually discourage  private backbone companies from entering and thriving in such markets.", "Despite the view that rural areas have fewer choices among backbone  providers, most companies we interviewed in rural areas purchased  \u201ctransport\u201d services to connect to an Internet backbone network.

But in  some cases\u2014particularly for ISPs in rural areas\u2014traffic was transported a  few hundred miles to a point of presence of a backbone provider.  The  majority of officials from these companies told us that the quality of  Internet service is not diminished by transporting traffic across such  distances.  Because many ISPs and end users told us that distant transport  was a viable option for obtaining Internet backbone connectivity, even ISPs  and users in more rural areas told us that they generally had choice among  backbone providers that could receive traffic at varied distant locations.   The one disadvantage of distant transport noted by several providers,  however, was cost.  Some company officials noted that it generally costs  more to purchase transport to a distant location than it does to connect to a  backbone at a local point of presence.

One  such carrier with which we spoke noted that any delay in its own  provisioning of these lines is due to the high expense of deploying the  necessary infrastructure and to technical difficulties in rolling out DSL,  especially in more rural areas.  This carrier also noted that FCC found the  percentage of all local lines served by competitors had doubled to  approximately 8 percent in 2000."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Introduction of New Services Over the Internet May Be Constrained by Limits in Capacity", "paragraphs": ["New Internet services, such as video streaming and voice telephone calls  over the Internet, are expected to become increasingly common in the  coming years.

These  developments are particularly noteworthy in light of the dynamic nature of  the Internet backbone marketplace\u2014Internet backbone providers not only  compete with each other for customers but also cooperate for the  exchange of traffic.  The success of the Internet, as evidenced by its  growth, evolution, diversity, and cooperative structure, has occurred with  minimal government involvement or oversight.", "Despite the Internet\u2019s success and the competitiveness of the Internet  backbone market, several issues of concern regarding this market were  raised to us during the course of our study.  Market participants noted the  importance of Tier 1 backbone providers and the potential for reduced  competition if consolidation were to occur at the Tier 1-provider level.  The  inability of backbone customers to ascertain the causes of service  degradation or traffic disruptions was also expressed to us, along with  concerns about the adaptability of the Internet to new services.  These and  other concerns underscore the need for adequate information on such  items as, for example, the geographic scope of backbone networks, the  number of backbone providers\u2019 customers, the number of IP addresses  assigned to providers, traffic flows, and outages.  In the absence of  adequate information, it is difficult to fully ascertain the quality of service,  the reasons for problems when they occur, and the extent of market  concentration and competition in the Internet backbone market.", "The adaptability of backbone networks for new services, such as Internet- based voice and video services, foretell a trend commonly identified as  \u201cconvergence\u201d in the broader communications sector and the increasing  importance of the Internet to the U.S. economy.  This expectation of  greater convergence was widely shared by the market participants we  interviewed for this study and for other studies we have conducted at your  request over the past 3 years.  There is a strong expectation that  traditionally regulated services\u2014such as voice telephone and video  services\u2014are already migrating to the Internet and will soon become  common applications used by residential and business Internet users.   Moreover, advances in technology are changing the very nature of the  Internet.

In its  memory, the router contains a \u201crouting table\u201d which contains information  specifying all of the IP addresses of other networks.  The router compares a  packet\u2019s destination IP address with the information contained in the  routing table to determine the network to which the packet should be sent.   In order to ensure that packets from one network can reach any other  network, the router must include an entry for each possible network.

Finally,  there can be approximately 2 million networks with a Class C address, each  with a maximum of 254 host addresses.  As the Internet grew, engineers  quickly identified the problems associated with exhaustion of class B  addresses and the increasing number of Class C address entries in routing  tables and developed a solution known as Classless Inter-Domain Routing  (CIDR).  CIDR treats multiple contiguous Class C addresses as a single  block that requires only one entry in a routing table.  This method of IP  address allocation was adopted for technical efficiency reasons\u2014the  number of IP addresses that must be maintained in each router for traffic  routing purposes is substantially reduced.  However, this method of IP  address allocation presents unique problems for smaller ISPs and other  entities.  If an entity seeking IP addresses cannot utilize a large block of  address issued by ARIN, the entity must obtain their addresses from among  the allocations made by ARIN to their Internet backbone provider.
