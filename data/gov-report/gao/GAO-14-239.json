However, as agencies work to balance limited resources with mission demands, many have turned to approaches other than full upfront funding to acquire, renovate, or dispose of federal real property, such as buildings, structures, and land. GAO was asked to review alternative models for managing federal real property. This report examines (1) agency experiences funding federal real property projects, (2) some of the alternative funding mechanisms selected agencies use, as well as agency experiences using selected mechanisms, and (3) alternative budgetary structures within the current unified budget that may potentially help Congress and agencies better recognize the cost of real property projects and associated returns, promoting both transparency and fiscal control. GAO reviewed case study projects from 4 agencies among the top 10 in federal real property holdings and chosen based on their use of alternative funding mechanisms, as identified in our past and ongoing work. Finally, GAO identified alternative budgetary structures that may support real property projects and principles for considering them by reviewing published reports and interviewing federal budget staff and experts.", "GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GSA, USDA, VA, and Interior generally agreed with our findings. USDA, Interior and VA provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Officials at four selected agencies\u2014the General Services Administration (GSA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of the Interior (Interior)\u2014experienced challenges receiving full upfront funding for federal real property projects through the annual appropriations process. For example, due to budget constraints, GSA acquired one property between 2008 and 2012. In addition, GSA has been unable to access funding to complete renovations in Interior's headquarters building due to obligation limitations in the GSA-administered Federal Buildings Fund (FBF). The FBF, which is the primary funding source for operating and capital costs associated with federal space, held an unobligated carryover balance of $4.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013 as a result of congressional limits on obligations. Officials noted that authority to retain proceeds provides a key incentive to initiate disposals, as agencies without this authority must request upfront funding for disposal costs while resulting proceeds are paid to the Department of the Treasury. Nonetheless, officials at selected agencies with the authority to retain disposal proceeds cited barriers to disposals, such as poor market demand, historical status or necessary remediation.", "Instead of full upfront funding, selected agencies sometimes used a variety of alternative funding mechanisms to meet their real property needs by leveraging authorized monetary resources, such as retained fees, and non-monetary resources, such as property exchanged in a swap or space offered in an enhanced use lease. Alternative funding mechanisms are not universally available to all agencies; even within an agency, legal authorities may differ across agency components. For alternative funding mechanisms that involve working with a partner, such as in a land swap, the agency's ability to find an appropriate partner, manage that partnering relationship, and share risk\u2014both explicit and implicit\u2014with the partner affected project outcomes. For example, because of legal, cost, and other challenges, officials from USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) said that ARS held onto land for about 10 years while seeking an appropriate partner to successfully complete the land swap.", "Changes to the budgetary structure itself\u2014within the bounds of the unified budget\u2014might provide a more consistent way to meet real property needs while helping Congress and agencies make more prudent long-term fiscal decisions. Alternative budgetary structures should balance tradeoffs across two key GAO-identified budgeting and capital planning principles: (1) promoting transparency and fiscal control with regard to the funding of federal real property; and (2) providing agencies the flexibility to facilitate the acquisition, repair and alteration, and disposal of federal real property in support of federal missions. GAO provides alternative budgetary structure options for Congress to consider. For example, in one option Congress would make the full balance of the FBF available for funding real property projects, which could create room for additional agency flexibility but may reduce fiscal control. Another option would establish a government-wide capital acquisition fund with authority to borrow from the Federal Financing Bank for approved projects, which could improve transparency of both costs and benefits upfront and over time while business case analyses could provide a means of assuring fiscal control."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The budget process is the federal government\u2019s primary resource  allocation, financial planning, and control tool. Accordingly, it helps  establish national spending priorities and the allocation of resources; it  also helps ensure that the government spends taxpayers\u2019 money in  accordance with applicable laws. Given the budget\u2019s dual functions,  federal real property projects such as structures, buildings, and land are  fully funded when Congress provides budget authority for the estimated  full cost of projects up front (at the time they are undertaken). Such  upfront funding recognizes the commitments embodied in budgetary  decisions and maintains government-wide fiscal control. However, it can  be challenging for agencies to make the case for such large commitments  of funding as other critical needs compete for scarce federal dollars.", "Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use  alternative funding mechanisms for the acquisition, renovation, or  disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding. Some of  these alternative mechanisms allow selected agencies to meet their real  property needs by leveraging other authorized resources, such as  retained fees or land swaps with a private sector partner. Depending on  the funding approach, the budgetary treatment of project costs may allow  an agency to spread the asset cost over a number of years or monetary  costs incurred may not be recognized in the budget. Because various  funding approaches are reflected differently in the budget, resource  allocation decisions for real property projects may not consider the full  financial commitment the U.S. government is making. Further, costs for  projects financed through alternative mechanisms may not be fully  reflected in the budget request, whereas the costs for projects that require  full upfront funding are fully reflected in the budget request. From an  agency's perspective, meeting real property needs through alternative  funding mechanisms can be attractive because the agency can undertake  the project without first having to secure full upfront funding to cover the  cost of the project. As a result, projects financed through alternative  mechanisms may be selected over other equally worthy projects for which  full upfront funding would be requested. From a government-wide  perspective, however, the costs associated with some alternative funding  mechanisms may be greater than full, upfront funding.", "In contrast to alternative funding mechanisms that agencies use to meet  their real property needs, alternative structures within the budget, such as  capital acquisition funds, have also been proposed. These proposed  alternative budgetary structures serve as potential options to help  agencies address their real property needs while minimizing costs to  taxpayers.

In June  2010, the President directed agencies to achieve real property cost  savings through a number of measures, including disposal of excess real  property and reducing leasing through consolidations and increased  space utilization. In 2011, the administration proposed legislation, known  as the Civilian Property Realignment Act (commonly referred to as  CPRA), and accompanying bills were introduced in both legislative  chambers, which would identify opportunities to consolidate, reduce, and  realign the federal footprint as well as expedite the disposal of properties  by building off the military base realignment and closure (commonly  referred to as BRAC) processes. In May 2012, OMB issued a  memorandum directing agencies to not increase the size of their civilian  real estate inventory, stating that increases in an agency\u2019s total square  footage of civilization property must be offset through consolidation, co- location, or disposal of space from the inventory of that agency, a policy  that became known as \u201cfreeze the footprint.\u201d As a result, acquisition has  become more about consolidation and identifying opportunities to share  space rather than acquiring new space.", "Pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act,  OMB identified real property as a Federal Government priority goal.

As part of  the capital funding process, shown in Figure 1, an agency prepares a  business case analysis and considers how to fund the project, including  whether to request upfront funding. If an agency chooses to request  upfront funding from Congress, it submits a business case to Congress  through the annual appropriations process. If Congress approves the  project, it may authorize spending for the project by appropriating full  upfront funding to the agency. Once an agency has obtained upfront  funding, it can obligate funds to complete \u201cuseful assets\u201d of the project.

The FBF is  the primary source of funds for operating and capital costs associated  with federal space. The FBF is funded primarily by income from rental  charges assessed to tenant agencies occupying federally owned and  GSA-managed and -leased space that approximate commercial rates for  comparable space and services. Congress exercises control over the  FBF through the appropriations process that sets annual limits on how  much of the fund can be obligated for various activities. In addition, it  periodically provides supplemental appropriations for the Fund. For  example, the Fund received $5.6 billion as part of the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009. GSA may incur obligations and make  expenditures from the FBF in five categories of activities: (1) rental of  space, (2) repairs and alterations, (3) construction and acquisition of  facilities, (4) building operations and maintenance, and (5) installment  acquisition payments (funds debt incurred as the result of building  acquisition and lease purchase arrangements). Revenue from the  federally-owned facility inventory managed by GSA is the main source of  the FBF\u2019s operating income used to fund repair and alteration, new  construction activities, and operations and maintenance.

In September 2013 we reported that the  decision to halt this type of formal analysis for high-value leases has  limited the transparency of the prospectus process. We recommended  that lease prospectuses include a description of the length of time an  agency estimates a need for a space, how long the agency has leased  that particular space, and major investments necessary. For spaces for  which an agency has a long-term projected need, we recommended that  GSA include an appropriate form of cost-to-lease versus cost-to-own  analysis. GSA concurred with this recommendation. Although at times  leasing versus owning analyses found leasing to be a more cost effective  option, it often concluded that ownership would be cheaper than leasing;  however, in many cases where ownership was found to be the better  option, GSA ultimately recommended leasing due to funding constraints."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Case Study Agency Officials Experienced Challenges Receiving Full Upfront Funding for Federal Real Property Projects", "paragraphs": ["Officials at four selected agencies\u2014GSA, USDA, VA, and Interior\u2014 experienced challenges receiving full upfront funding for federal real  property projects through the annual appropriations process. For  example, GSA officials told us that obtaining upfront funding through  appropriations is difficult and thus presents a barrier to ownership,  resulting in a reliance on leased space. USDA officials said that, given  current fiscal pressures, they do not routinely request acquisition funds.  Interior officials told us that the Department has had a moratorium on new  construction since 2010 and that any upfront funding received through the  annual appropriations process goes towards necessary renovations to  existing property. Although VA requests and receives appropriations for  some real property construction projects, it has a significant backlog of  incomplete major construction projects that have not received funding.  The Veteran\u2019s Health Administration (VHA) requested $215 million for  major construction funding in fiscal year 2014 and estimates that it would  require $5.8 billion to address its current backlog.", "Budget constraints have resulted in limited acquisitions at GSA, Interior,  and USDA. For example, GSA\u2019s sole acquisition between 2008 and 2012  resulted from exercising a purchase option on a preexisting lease. GSA  renewed its lease at Columbia Plaza in Washington, D.C. for the  Department of State (State) in 1992. As part of an agreement to invest  $30.6 million in renovations to the building at that time, GSA was directed  by congressional resolution to \u201cattempt to include a purchase option in the  lease contract.\u201d GSA did not have the option to purchase the building in  1992 but it negotiated a purchase option as part of the terms of the 20- year lease. As the expiration of the lease neared, GSA concluded that a  mission need for the building remained and that acquiring the building  would be financially advantageous. Under the original contract, GSA  could purchase the building for $100 million though the 2009 appraised  value was $150 million. A 30-year present value analysis concluded that  acquiring the building would result in an annual cost advantage of $12  million over continuing to lease and, in 2012, GSA exercised its purchase  option. Because State was already occupying Columbia Plaza, GSA  officials said that they mitigated a portion of the acquisition cost by  avoiding certain costs typical to the construction process including  acquiring land, phased funding for construction, paying for interim office  space, and final relocation to the new space. However, purchase options  may cost more over the life of a lease than buying a building upfront.   Figure 3 shows that although the contract purchase price was $100  million, adding in the initial renovation costs and lease payments made  over the 20-year term, in total the acquisition cost to the government was  $258 million.", "Limitations on obligations constrain funding for real property, especially  for repairs, alterations, and new construction. The difference between  receipts collected in the FBF and the amount authorized for annual  obligations affected one of our case study agencies that rents property  through GSA. Interior officials said that GSA has been unable to obtain  FBF funding through the annual appropriations process to complete  renovations in Interior\u2019s federally-owned and GSA-managed headquarters  building. As a result, Interior officials said that they have not been able to  realize the savings they anticipated for a full renovation, such as energy  savings. The FBF\u2019s balance has increased significantly in recent years,  growing from $56 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2007 to $4.7  billion at the end of fiscal year 2013. As we previously reported, the  increased balance has primarily resulted from the growing difference  between the resources deposited into the FBF and the level of funds GSA  is authorized to spend. GSA officials noted that when Congress provides  less obligational authority than requested, repairs, alterations, and new  construction projects for GSA-managed buildings are most affected  because available funds are first used to pay leasing, operations and  maintenance, and debt costs. As a result, GSA\u2019s obligations authority for  repairs and alterations projects decreased from $855 million in 2005 to  $280 million in 2012. GSA officials noted that when prioritizing requests  for repair and alteration projects, they consider asset condition and  performance; life safety and compliance with laws and regulations;  customer considerations, including consolidation and reduction in space;  financial viability, including lease cost avoidance; and improvements to  utilization rates and recapturing vacant space.", "With regard to the disposal of federal property, officials at USDA, which  has authority to retain proceeds from sales and disposals, cited financial  obstacles to these initiatives, such as little market demand. For example,  USDA\u2019s Forest Service was given authority in 2005 to retain proceeds  from disposals; it typically uses these funds for critical maintenance  work on its properties or to prepare other buildings for sale. Forest  Service officials said that except for a few administrative buildings in  affluent areas sold for a high return, the return on investment for  disposals, often for structures on land Forest Service would like to retain,  is minimal. In 2011, the Forest Service reported that it would cost $120  million to dispose of property with a salvage value of $5 million.", "Non-financial barriers to disposal also exist, resulting in underused  agency property. These obstacles include remote locations, necessary  environmental cleanup, or limitations on the use of property. Historically  significant properties are also challenges. For example, VA officials said  that VA\u2019s historical buildings often require significant cleanup and  preparation prior to disposal, and the agency must often address  significant stakeholder interests. In addition, VHA\u2019s buildings are often on  campuses or are medical facilities, limiting potential buyers or lessees to  those with missions similar to VA. VHA currently has about 250 vacant  buildings with no defined need, totaling more than 4 million square feet.  Interior officials stated that the land Interior owns is primarily stewardship  land for preservation, and thus Interior has few buildings or land to sell.  Instead, excess buildings on stewardship lands are typically demolished.  To facilitate the disposal of excess property, Interior includes funding for  disposals as part of its planning process\u2014it requires each bureau to set  aside 3 percent of its property budget for disposals of excess property.", "Officials at GSA and USDA noted that the authority to retain proceeds  provides a key incentive to initiate disposal transactions. For example,  officials at GSA, which provides disposal services across the federal  government, stated that the vast majority of current disposal transactions  are by agencies or components that have the authority to retain the  proceeds from sales or disposals. They also said that agencies without  this authority may have less incentive to dispose of underused property  as they must take money from competing budget priorities to invest in  readying a property for sale. USDA officials said that because resulting  proceeds are remitted to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury as  miscellaneous receipts, components without authority to retain proceeds  have little incentive to request full upfront funding for disposal costs such  as site cleanup, resource surveys, title and legal preparation, and auction  fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Funding Mechanisms Helped Agencies Meet Their Real Property Needs, but Also Posed Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Use a Variety of Funding Mechanisms to Meet Their Real Property Needs", "paragraphs": ["Selected agencies have been authorized to use a variety of funding  mechanisms as an alternative to full upfront funding to meet their real  property needs. Funding mechanisms leverage both monetary resources,  such as retained fees, and non-monetary resources, such as property  exchanged in a land swap or space offered in an enhanced use lease  (EUL). In some cases, the funding mechanism may function as a public- private partnership intended to further an agency\u2019s mission by working  with a partner to leverage resources. Some of these mechanisms allow  the private sector to provide the project\u2019s capital\u2014at their cost of  borrowing. The U.S. federal government\u2019s cost of borrowing is lower than  in the private sector. When the private sector provides the project capital,  the federal government later repays these higher private sector borrowing  costs (e.g., in the form of lease payments). In some cases, factors such  as lower labor costs or fewer requirements could potentially help balance  the higher cost of borrowing, making partner financing less expensive.

NPS\u2019s recreation fees, which  are authorized by the Federal Land Recreation Enhancement Act, require  that not less than 80 percent of retained recreation fees be spent at the  site at which fees are collected while the remaining 20 percent is pooled  to fund projects that are national priorities. This 20 percent of the retained  recreation fees provides NPS additional flexibility. In 2011 Interior  determined that it would request line item construction funds in fiscal year  2014, but later identified fiscal year 2012 funds from an alternative  funding mechanism, retained recreation fees, for the Herring Cove and  Nauset Light Beach facilities renovations in Massachusetts, negating the  need to seek additional funding. Interior has internal processes for  prioritizing projects for line item budget requests and for allocating the  retained recreation fees to high-priority projects, which NPS officials  reported allowed Interior to complete the renovations more quickly than  would have otherwise been possible with full upfront funding.", "In 1991, Congress authorized VA to enter into EULs. VA\u2019s available legal  authorities also framed its 2008 decision to enter into an EUL with a  nonprofit organization in Dayton, Ohio. VHA\u2019s partner in the EUL  leveraged nonfederal funds to renovate a building and provide housing  and services to homeless veterans. The Dayton, Ohio Veterans Affairs  Medical Center had underused historic buildings. Officials reported that  the buildings\u2019 historic status made it difficult to dispose of or demolish the  buildings. The Volunteers of America of Greater Ohio approached VA  about entering into an EUL; they agreed to provide 50 beds of transitional  housing and related services to homeless veterans in the property that  VA wanted to take off its inventory in exchange for financial and  nonfinancial considerations. VA determined that renovating the building  with appropriated funds would result in the highest upfront costs to VA  and would forgo the benefit of any private-sector funding or participation.  VA accepted the Volunteers of America\u2019s proposal and the Volunteers of  America paid VA rent for the space and were responsible for renovating,  operating, and maintaining the building as well as for providing housing  and services to homeless veterans. By partnering with the Volunteers of  America on this EUL, VA estimated that it has cumulatively achieved  almost $2.8 million in cost avoidance and that the project has provided  services valued at more than $2 million while costing the VA less than  $500,000. Without the authority to enter into EULs or other alternative  funding mechanisms, VA officials said that VA would not have been able  to move forward with this project.

We have previously reported that project  decisions should reflect both the likely risk and the organization\u2019s  tolerance for risk. Incorporating risk assessment and risk management  practices into decisions can help ensure that the organization recognizes  and is prepared to manage explicit risks (e.g., financial and physical) and  implicit risks (e.g., reputational). For example, clearly defined lease  terms helped VA manage financial risk associated with the Dayton, Ohio  EUL when its partner sought to share costs for unexpected building  repairs for the building leased. During renovation, asbestos was  discovered in the building and VA\u2019s partner sought a financial contribution  from VA to help offset some of the cost of the cleanup. Because the  contract clearly held the partner financially responsible for unexpected  expenses, VA was not liable for the cleanup costs.", "We have also previously reported that when working with a partner, it is  important to actively manage the relationship. Formalizing collaborations  between the partners, including documenting dispute resolution  processes, can enable productive partner interactions. For example, VA  stepped in to more actively engage its partner, the city of New Orleans, in  a land swap to build a hospital after Hurricane Katrina. To monitor project  timelines and goals, officials representing all partners\u2014including VA\u2019s  Chief of Staff, the logistics manager and city counterparts\u2014participated in  a steering group. When it became apparent that the city of New Orleans  was unable to meet its initial goal of having the property in construction- ready condition within 1 year as outlined in a memorandum of  understanding (MOU), the group began to meet weekly. VA and the city  of New Orleans amended the MOU to permit phased delivery of the  construction ready site. Additionally, New Orleans VA Medical Center  continued to have quarterly meetings with the community. Officials  reported that early coordination contributed to increased efficiency and  improved outcomes and helped the project overcome challenges such as  managing to meet different federal and state fiscal years and funding  cycles, as well as different federal, state, and local policies.", "In addition to an agency\u2019s ability to share risk and manage stakeholder  relationships, the availability of an appropriate partner and the geographic  location of the property may affect the use and success of an alternative  funding mechanism. We have previously reported that partners should  bring complementary resources, skills, and financial capacities to the  relationship. Agency officials reported that the geographic location and  the condition of a property can make it difficult to locate a willing buyer  and expensive to dispose of the property. For example, according to  Forest Service officials, many of the structures that may be disposed of  are of little value and are on land Forest Service will retain, such as a  cabin in the woods. Additionally, these facilities may be located in remote  areas that are difficult and costly to access with the construction  equipment necessary for demolition. As part of the auction process,  Forest Service typically asks for bids at salvage value and requires that  the structure be removed from the property at the buyer\u2019s expense.  However, because of the expense to the buyer of the building removal  and any necessary environmental remediation, properties are usually sold  for low prices. The Forest Service benefits from selling the property\u2014 even for a low value\u2014 because it is no longer financially responsible for  costs such as maintenance, demolition, property removal, and  environmental remediation. For example, ARS needed to acquire land or  build an incinerator to dispose of excess manure. ARS does not have the  legal authority to purchase land valued at more than $100 and the  incinerator would have been significantly more expensive than this limit,  prompting ARS to consider a land swap. Because of these legal, cost,  and anticipated stakeholder challenges, ARS officials said that ARS held  onto the land for about 10 years while seeking an appropriate partner with  whom to exchange land. When ARS identified an appropriate partner, it  completed a land swap with the city of Ames, Iowa. ARS officials reported  that this outcome was more efficient and environmentally friendly than the  alternative of building an expensive incinerator."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternative Budgetary Structures Have Potential to Help Congress and Agencies Recognize the Costs and Returns of Real Property Projects Upfront and Over Time", "paragraphs": ["While different funding mechanisms have been used as an alternative to  obtaining upfront funding for federal real property projects, changes to the  budgetary structure itself\u2014within the bounds of the unified budget that  encompasses the full scope of federal programs and transactions\u2014may  also help agencies meet their real property needs. Alternative budgetary  structures may be established to change budgetary incentives for  agencies and therefore help Congress and agencies make more prudent  long-term fiscal decisions. Such alternatives may include changing  existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property  projects. These alternatives could promote more complete consideration  of the full costs of projects and associated returns over time as well as  provide agencies with greater flexibility to manage their real property  needs. This could be aided by agencies completing comprehensive  business case analyses detailing project costs and returns in a process  similar to GSA\u2019s prospectus process. A business case analysis might  include details about how the project aligns with an agency\u2019s strategic  plan, a needs assessment and gap identification, an alternatives  evaluation, a life-cycle cost analysis, a schedule of project milestones and  deliverables, and a cost-benefit analysis.", "We explored options for changes within the current discretionary budget  structure and options on the mandatory side of the budget by reviewing  our past reports and discussing possible options with federal budget  specialists and industry experts.

As decision  makers consider these budgetary structures, they must balance tradeoffs  between the two principles to understand whether the options would allow  for full upfront cost recognition, establish accountability mechanisms to  track cost recovery and return on investment, and provide timely funding  to promote an appropriately sized federal real property inventory. The  principles may interact and conflict with each other and each alternative  budgetary structure has benefits and challenges.

However, tradeoffs are inherent in budgeting  and these changes may affect spending for other discretionary programs  competing for mission critical resources.", "Modify the FBF: The FBF is a discretionary fund that receives revenue  through rental payments from agencies that lease buildings that GSA  manages. GSA\u2019s authority to access these funds is determined through  the annual appropriations process. As previously described, resources  deposited into the FBF have exceeded the amount that Congress has  appropriated to GSA in recent years, resulting in a $4.7 billion difference  between the full balance of the FBF and amounts made available for  spending in fiscal year 2013. Congress provides authority to GSA to incur  obligations and make expenditures from the FBF in five categories of  activities, such as repairing and altering GSA-managed buildings and  constructing new buildings. However, GSA officials said that because  available funds must first be used to pay costs associated with other  authorized activities, such as leasing privately owned space, operations  and maintenance of GSA-managed buildings, and debt incurred from  building acquisitions and lease purchase arrangements, repairs and  alterations and new construction are the most affected. For example,  GSA\u2019s obligational authority for repairs and alterations projects decreased  from $855 million in 2005 to $280 million in 2012. As a result, customer  agencies are being charged for services that the GSA may be limited in  its ability to provide in a timely manner. To meet agencies\u2019 real property  needs, the FBF could be modified in the following ways:", "Make the full balance of the FBF available: Congress could make  the full balance of the FBF available to GSA. GSA would then have  resources to provide the full array of services for which it charges  agencies, including repairs and alterations. In 2011, we reported that  GSA\u2019s overall obligational authority has trended downward in recent  years, resulting in GSA reducing spending on repairs and alternations  and new construction. GSA officials and OMB staff noted that such  repairs have the potential to be more expensive if delayed. Making  the full balance of the FBF available to GSA would increase funding  for GSA to complete projects for agencies, but it would mean less  congressional fiscal control and less funding for other mission critical  needs. OMB staff noted that with access to all of its receipts, the FBF  would be able to meet necessary recapitalization needs, such as  major repairs and alterations.", "Adjust the FBF pricing structure to exclude certain major  renovations: To ensure that the GSA charges cover all services  provided under agreements with tenant agencies, GSA could choose  to exclude certain major renovations from agreed upon services.  GSA could then reduce rents to cover only operations and ongoing  maintenance costs of federally-owned buildings. Appropriations  decisions to fund capital repairs with rent savings would be made by  the agencies\u2019 appropriations subcommittees. In effect, this would shift  the locus of decision making from GSA\u2019s appropriations subcommittee  to the appropriations subcommittees of affected agencies. With the  change in pricing structure, agencies would have the ability to decide  whether to complete funded repairs and alterations in house or use  contractors or shared service providers. However, because this option  addresses GSA-managed buildings, there may not be an incentive for  agencies to carry out this devolution of responsibility amid other  priorities and it may be difficult for multi-agency tenant buildings to  obtain funding for necessary renovations from their respective  appropriations subcommittees. Nevertheless, an agency that uses a  GSA-managed building as its headquarters, such as Interior, which  has been unable to complete renovations through GSA, would gain  some flexibility in completing repairs and alterations by requesting  funding directly from its subcommittee. GSA officials noted that  separating capital investment funding decisions from operations and  maintenance funding decisions could make it difficult to manage the  portfolio of government-owned and -leased assets in a strategic  manner. They and OMB staff agreed that, without the shared funding  aspect of the FBF, it was unlikely that agencies would have sufficient  funds available to complete repairs and alterations, even if they were  able to maintain the same level of appropriations.", "Delay recognition of receipts until projects are ready for funding:  To better match FBF receipts with expenses, the recording of receipts  from agencies could be held in a temporary account until transferred  to the FBF, temporarily recorded as a mandatory receipt until  transferred to the FBF as a discretionary offsetting collection. The  receipts would be recorded in the FBF account when funds are  appropriated for each \u201cuseful asset\u201d of a project. Receipts from  agencies to the FBF would then be recorded as discretionary offsets  in the fiscal year in which they are appropriated to GSA.", "Carve out spending from the discretionary allocations: One approach  to further invest in federal real property projects and meet  governmentwide priorities could be to allocate resources at the full  appropriations committee level, outside the competing priorities of the  appropriations subcommittees. The appropriations subcommittees have  jurisdiction over different agencies and are responsible for appropriating  resources among their relevant agencies. Congress could agree to carve  out of the full appropriations committee\u2019s 302(a) allocation\u2014the level of  spending that the full appropriations committee is authorized to  distribute\u2014the amount for federal real property, effectively decreasing the  cap for the subcommittees\u2019 302(b) allocations\u2014the level of spending that  the subcommittees are authorized to distribute to their respective  agencies. This would free up funds for acquiring, disposing of, or  repairing and altering space and provide a guaranteed funding level to  real property; it would also protect it from competition with other programs  that are more focused on spending for consumption activities. In the past,  Congress has similarly chosen to allocate resources at the full committee  level for certain programs. For example, in 1999 there were five  discretionary categories with a separate spending limit \u201ccarved out\u201d\u2014 violent crime reduction, defense, non-defense, highway, and mass  transit. As a result of these carve outs, total spending determinations  were made at the full committee level rather than at the subcommittee  level.", "Carving out of the full committee\u2019s allocation spending for federal real  property would also \u201ccrowd out\u201d spending for all other discretionary  programs that might represent a higher priority for the nation. For  example, we have previously reported that if a guaranteed minimum  funding level for a certain program is carved out of the full committee  allocation, and total spending is not increased commensurately, then the  remaining activities must compete for the reduced amount that is left.  Alternatively, the total cap for the subcommittees\u2019 allocation could be  increased to dedicate funding to real property projects. The adjustment of  the cap could be triggered by the approval of project proposals  accompanied by business case analyses.", "Related Questions on the Implementation of Discretionary Options:  1.

Controls on access to funds in both scenarios  could be based on comprehensive project proposals with a business case  analysis completed by agencies and submitted to the fund manager,  OMB and the Congress to ensure their agreement that the project  warrants access to this type of funding. This analysis would describe,  among other aspects, the nature of the project and potential savings or  costs avoided. If the proposal was accepted, funding could be provided  for each useful asset.  For each useful asset, agencies might provide  updated business case analyses, which could include reestimates of both  costs and returns.", "Mandatory budget authority options may also present opportunities to  promote collaboration among agencies with different appropriators and  authorizers as well as allow for better alignment of upfront costs with  longer-term returns. These options could result in a centralized funding  source available to all agencies, which could facilitate consolidation,  sharing space, and partnering among agencies for other real property  needs. Mandatory options could also be established to receive returns,  such as proceeds from disposals, or enforce the recognition of non- monetary returns, such as cost avoidance or cost savings, through  revised business case analyses provided by agencies as they complete  useful assets of projects. Despite these benefits, mandatory budget  authority options could result in a shift of the locus of decision making  from appropriators to authorizers, and would create new management  and oversight responsibilities for federal entities. In addition, under the  pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budgetary enforcement mechanism, mandatory  budget authority options would require costs to be offset by an increase in  mandatory receipts or a decrease in mandatory spending for other  programs. Nonetheless, these options could result in cost savings and  cost avoidance over the long term.", "Create a capital acquisition fund (CAF): Congress could provide  budget authority in the form of borrowing authority to a governmentwide  capital acquisition fund (CAF) managed by a single agency, such as  GSA.", "In contrast to a department-level CAF, which we have previously reported  on, a centralized governmentwide CAF could provide funding for real  property projects for all agencies. The fund could complement the FBF by  providing upfront funding for complex, multi-prospectus level projects or  projects estimated to exceed a certain total cost threshold while the FBF  could be used for relatively straightforward rental and maintenance  expenses. The governmentwide CAF could be subject to a borrowing limit  and provide upfront funding for the full cost of projects (or useful assets of  projects). As depicted in Figure 4, a governmentwide CAF could be  established to:   1.  Use its authority to borrow from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) to  fund real property projects agreed upon by Congress, OMB and the  CAF manager on a project-by-project basis for all agencies.  2.  Use annual payments made by agencies to the CAF to repay the loan  from the FFB. The annual payments\u2014provided by agencies\u2019  subcommittee appropriators\u2014would be principal and interest  amortized over the useful life of the asset, allowing the agency to  spread the project cost over time.  3.  Automatically receive other monetary returns associated with real  property projects to be used for future real property projects or deficit  reduction. During implementation as well as at completion of projects,  agencies would inform the CAF (along with Congress and OMB)  about all returns, including nonmonetary returns, such as cost  avoidance or cost savings, via revised business case analyses.", "Establish a dedicated fund with permanent, indefinite budget  authority: Congress could pass legislation to establish a  governmentwide, dedicated fund with permanent, indefinite budget  authority instead of borrowing authority. Similar to the CAF, this fund  could be managed by a single agency, such as GSA. As depicted in  Figure 5, it could automatically receive sums as needed, eliminating the  need for annual appropriation to acquire, dispose of, or repair and alter  federal real property. The dedicated fund could be at least partially  replenished as agencies return net proceeds, such as proceeds from the  sale of a building.  The fund could complement the FBF by providing  upfront funding for complex, multi-prospectus level projects or projects  estimated to exceed a certain total cost threshold while the FBF could be  used for relatively straightforward rental and maintenance expenses.

Our selected agencies have  experienced challenges receiving full upfront funding for federal real  property projects through the annual appropriations process and instead  have used alternative funding mechanisms, such as public-private  partnerships and operating leases to meet long-term needs.", "In times of fiscal pressure, employing alternative funding mechanisms to  carry out real property projects can appear attractive to agencies because  it does not first require obtaining full upfront funding. However, there are  inherent risks in using an alternative funding mechanism and many  factors affect the outcome. For example, employing alternative funding  mechanisms may result in funding federal real property investments  without recognizing their true, full costs. This could mean that assets  financed through alternative mechanisms may be selected over other  equally worthy projects that are competing for full upfront funding.  Moreover, with the administration\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfreezing the footprint,\u201d  investment decisions that do not recognize costs upfront and returns over  time may not result in an appropriate assessment of the size and cost of  the federal real property inventory.", "We have presented options for alternative budgetary structures that  congressional decision makers may wish to consider.
